        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marcia, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I know it's been a long week for those analysts involved in the financial services industry.</p>
          <p>Without question, the tremendous volatility in the financial markets and weakening global economy have combined to make this a very challenging year for banks around the world. Fiscal 2008 and particularly the last quarter were marked by unprecedented events, including the collapse of some major financial global financial institutions, a rise in funding costs, dramatic declines in equity markets, and government bailouts of historic proportions. While we have had losses related to the market environment, RBC is one of the world's most profitable financial institutions, having generated approximately $4.6 billion of earnings in 2008 with a return on equity of 18%.</p>
          <p>Equally important is that we have generated these results and maintained a consistently strong capital position throughout the year. In aggregate, our earnings were down from last year, mainly due to higher write-downs and higher provisions for credit losses, primarily in the U.S. banking business. Slide five and other items that impacted our full-year and Q4 results, including gains related to fair value adjustments on RBC debt and the reduction of our Enron-related provision. Our reported diluted earnings per share is $0.81 for the fourth quarter and $3.38 for the full year. I would like to highlight that this is after items that had an $0.18 impact on the quarter and $0.77 impact on the year.</p>
          <p>Never has it been more important for us to focus on the fundamentals of our business. And I am firmly convinced that our relative strength in earnings performance is a direct result of us following a disciplined strategy, adhering to sound risk management practices, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and ensuring our business mix is well diversified. By following this course, we have withstood the market shocks over the past year better than most other financial institutions around the world, and we have grown our businesses. Our diversified business portfolio is a key foundation of both our stability and our success, and let me explain by giving you some highlights of our business segment performance.</p>
          <p>Canadian Banking continued to underpin our results with strong earnings over last year, reflecting solid volume growth across all businesses, and effective cost management, offset to some extent by margin compression and increased provisions.</p>
          <p>In Wealth Management, transactional volumes were lower than last year because of these market conditions. However, fee-based revenues were higher from growth in fee-based assets reflecting our PH&amp;N acquisition and strong net mutual fund sales for most of the year.</p>
          <p>Insurance results were also reduced by investment losses because of the decline in equity market values. But we continue to grow our Insurance business, with premiums and deposits up 12% from a year ago.</p>
          <p>In International Banking, our U.S. banking business continued to be impacted by the challenging environment, resulting in higher provisions for credit losses and write-downs on our investment portfolio. However, this was partially offset by earnings from our RBTT and ANB acquisitions and business growth in RBC Dexia.</p>
          <p>While some of our businesses in Capital Markets have been impacted by the write-downs, it is significant that we earned through these losses every quarter by generating strong results in other Capital Markets businesses. In 2008, this segment generated return on equity of in excess of 20%, which is a testament to the strength of our diversified businesses, as well as our risk management practices.</p>
          <p>All in all, I am pleased with our performance this year. Most of our businesses &#x2013; with the exception of U.S. banking, which was certainly impacted by our builders finance businesses &#x2013; continued to perform very well, both on an absolute basis, particularly relative to their primary competitors.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide six our capital position remained strong throughout 2008, and we ended the year with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 9%. As you know, the Canadian and U.S. dollar exchange rate changed significantly over the fourth quarter, which did have an impact on our ratios and businesses. One of the impacts is that it increased our risk-adjusted assets and was the largest factor in decreasing our capital ratios from the third and fourth quarter of last year, which Janice will discuss in her remarks.</p>
          <p>With respect to our dividend, we are maintaining our quarterly dividend at $0.50 in the first quarter of 2009, which we believe is prudent in this environment. Over time our objective is to grow our dividend.</p>
          <p>Slide seven shows our total shareholder return, demonstrating our long-term track record of outperformance as compared to our peers. Relative to our peers over the three-year period, we ranked second with an 8% annual return, and we ranked first in both five- and 10-year periods, generating total shareholder returns of 12% and 14% per annum, respectively.</p>
          <p>Our diversified business portfolio, strong risk management, and solid capital position have enabled us to remain focused on our three long-term strategic goals, which are outlined on slide eight. They are in Canada to be the undisputed leader in financial services; in the United States to be a leading provider of banking, wealth management, and capital market services, building on and leveraging RBC's considerable capabilities; and internationally, to be a premier provider of select banking, wealth management, and capital services in markets of choice.</p>
          <p>In Canada, our retail business made significant strides during the year to enhance our market leadership positions by making it easier for clients to do business with us. We have successfully increased market share across all Canadian banking businesses this year. And we intend to continue to grow our market shares. Our loan book increased by 13% as a result of strong growth in residential mortgage products and the launch of new credit card offerings. Also, we grew our deposit base by 5% through the introduction of new personal and business products. We are open for business, our volumes are growing, and we continue to focus on growing our businesses and market share in our Canadian Banking business.</p>
          <p>In Wealth Management, acquiring PH&amp;N on May 1 together with our existing operations made RBC the largest discretionary manager in Canada and the largest fund company in Canada with a 16% market share. We continue to be a leader in the industry this year, with $8.8 billion in total mutual fund net sales. As Canada's largest investment bank and a leader in virtually every domestic ranking, we are distancing ourselves from our peers with our broad global capabilities and strong balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Turning to the U.S., the significant challenges in the U.S. banking environment impacted our banking operations. We are working hard to strengthen our business by managing our U.S. loan portfolio, improving efficiencies, and reducing expenses to ensure that we are well positioned when the environment improves. We are not happy with the current performance of our U.S. banking business, and we will be extremely focused in 2009 in dealing with this underperformance.</p>
          <p>In U.S. Wealth Management, we continue to build scale and extend our reach. In 2008, we acquired Ferris, Baker Watts, which expanded our presence in key U.S. regions. In addition we attracted a number of experienced financial consultants from the competition over the past year, demonstrating both the quality of our business and RBC's growing reputation in the United States. With over 2,000 financial consultants, we are the seventh-largest national investment advisory firm in the United States.</p>
          <p>While market and economic events are negatively impacted some of our U.S. capital markets businesses, we continue to capitalize on opportunities created by this market disruption. In addition, we are adding talent and resources that are drawn to the strength and stability of the RBC name.</p>
          <p>Turning to our third strategic goal, closing our acquisition of RBTT in the third quarter was the most significant development that we had outside of North America during the year. Combined with our existing Caribbean banking businesses, the acquisition made RBC the second-largest banking group in the English Caribbean, as measured by assets.</p>
          <p>International Wealth Management continued to expand its footprint by opening new offices in Santiago, Chile, and in Mumbai in connection with our Capital Markets business and by recruiting experienced private banking professionals. Also, for the third consecutive year, we were recognized by Euromoney as the number one provider of trust services in the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p>Finally, our Capital Markets operations continue to build international capabilities in areas where we have strength. For example we added a leveraged finance team in London to support our European Investment Banking business, and we expanded the UK-based infrastructure financing business into Continental Europe and Australia and the United States.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 9, we look ahead with caution, recognizing that the financial markets and global economies continue to face headwinds. We believe a weak global economic outlook, continued market volatility, and general uncertainty on the timing of recovery will create a challenging environment in the short term, but I would re-emphasize that we continue to see significant opportunities over the medium term. Because of the high degree of uncertainty in the short term, we have established medium-term performance objectives in place of our annual objectives. These objectives are aligned with our three strategic goals and we believe better reflect the new realities of the business and economic environment.</p>
          <p>Our medium-term objective is to generate earnings per share growth of 7% or greater. Our focus on cost management relative to revenue growth is underlined by an operating leverage objective of over 3%. Our return on equity objective is 18% or higher, reflecting our commitment to delivering strong returns to shareholders within the context of structural changes in the industry. We will keep a keen eye on our capital base, maintaining a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8.5% or higher.</p>
          <p>Finally, our continuing objective is to maintain dividend payout ratio over the medium term of between 40 and 50%. We will continue to assess our progress on a quarterly and annual basis against these medium-term objectives and benchmark our total shareholders returns with our North American peers.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, while cautious about the environment, we are confident in our business and committed to delivering long-term growth to our shareholders. We will remain vigilant in managing our cost structure, efficiently using our balance sheet, and managing risks. As I have said a number of times this year, we are open for business and proactively providing our clients with relevant and timely advice and the support they need during these difficult times.</p>
          <p>I will add, the dislocation in the markets continues to create opportunities for RBC to pull away from the competition or strengthen our leadership position. Across our businesses, we continue to find ways to deploy capital effectively in new products and new markets and our existing businesses.</p>
          <p>In closing, I would like to thank our employees for their hard work, integrity, and dedication. Through these remarkable times what has struck me the most is the outstanding commitment of our employees to helping our clients around the world.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll now turn it over Morten.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Gord. I'll start with a review of the write-downs and then provide an update on our credit portfolio. As shown on slide 11, in the fourth quarter we had write-downs in Capital Markets, Corporate Support, and International Banking. These are covered in detail in our disclosure and totaled approximately $1 billion before tax or $532 million after tax and related compensation adjustments.</p>
          <p>Approximately half of the write-downs related to structured credit transactions in our Capital Markets segment, which I've spoken about in previous quarters. This includes $248 million of write-down related to the structured credit transaction that we hedged with MBIA. This amount represents declines in the fair value of credit default swaps with MBIA, expected recovery rates on the underlying assets, and other parameter inputs.</p>
          <p>A further $204 million related to the fair value declines in subprime CDOs of ABS and other subprime RMBS. The remaining write-downs in Capital Markets totaled $153 million and related largely to our U.S. insurance and pension solutions and U.S. commercial mortgage-backed securities businesses. Also, as Janice will discuss in her comments, we reclassified $6.9 billion of U.S. auction rate securities and U.S. mortgage-backed securities from held for trading to available for sale. In Corporate Support and International Banking, we had write-downs of $154 million and $244 million respectively.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 12, you'll see this quarter trading had unusually high volatility, reflective of the markets. This volatility led to a number of days of both trading losses and gains. Seven of the largest days of net trading losses exceeded global VaR for their respective days, two of which were due to month-end valuation adjustments. The remaining 10 large net trading loss days this quarter did not exceed global VaR. We also had five days of significant trading gains across different businesses. Our global VaR is based on two years of historical data. Assuming market volatility continues, we can expect to see our global VaR trend higher as more months are incorporated into the historical datasets.</p>
          <p>Turning to credit on slides 13 to 16, we had $619 million in provisions for credit losses in the fourth quarter, up from $334 million in the third quarter. This includes a $145 million general provision this quarter reflecting portfolio growth in Canada and weaker credit quality metrics over prior periods. The balance relates to specific provisions for credit losses, which I will discuss in more detail by geography.</p>
          <p>I'll start with Canada. Over 77% of our loans are in Canada, and credit quality remained strong in the fourth quarter in most portfolios, including residential mortgages. The increase in Canadian-specific provisions as compared to the third quarter was primarily due to a few corporate accounts in our wholesale portfolio as well as volume growth and slightly higher loss rates in our retail portfolio.</p>
          <p>Approximately 8% of our loan book is international and consists largely of our Caribbean banking operations. In general, credit quality in the Caribbean remains stable, with some signs of softening. The increase in provisions for credit losses over the third quarter largely reflects the inclusion of a full quarter of results from RBTT.</p>
          <p>Finally, approximately 15% of our loan book is based in the U.S., where as you know, credit quality has continued to deteriorate. Those impaired loans and provisions for credit losses in the U.S. increased from the third quarter. I should note that part of the increase is due to the large change in the Canadian-U.S. dollar exchange rate from the third quarter. However, we did also see credit quality deterioration.</p>
          <p>In our U.S. banking business, the credit issues are primarily in our residential builder finance portfolio. However, our commercial and business banking portfolios there also experienced increased impaired loans, contributing to increased PCL in the wholesale portfolio. In the retail portfolio, home equity lending and lot loans continue to weaken compared to the third quarter, also contributing to higher PCLs. In the U.S. retail portfolio, we have very little unsecured lending or credit cards, and we had no subprime lending origination programs.</p>
          <p>Lastly in Capital Markets we had an additional 25 million provision in our U.S. wholesale portfolio related to impaired loans extended under liquidity facilities drawn on by RBC-administered multi-seller asset-backed commercial paper conduits. These are the same loans that we took a $35 million provision against in the second quarter of this year and relate to a single security. Impaired loans extended under these facilities amounted to $203 million at the end of the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, assuming slower economic growth and higher unemployment in Canada, we would expect credit quality in Canada to weaken moderately in fiscal 2009. Based on this, we would anticipate modestly higher average provisions across consumer business and corporate credit portfolios.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., we expect that our U.S. banking operations will continue to be impacted by a weak U.S. economy and the decline in the U.S. housing market. We anticipate ongoing deterioration in our residential builder portfolio, as well as in our commercial, retail, and business banking portfolios.</p>
          <p>At this point I'll turn the call over to Janice Fukakusa to discuss our fourth quarter results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Morten. Slide 18 provides an overview of our quarterly performance. Net income was down 15% from Q4 2007, largely due to higher write-downs, weaker results in our equity trading businesses, and higher provision for credit losses, including the increase to our general provision that Morten discussed.</p>
          <p>These factors were partly offset by revenue growth in certain fixed income and foreign exchange businesses and reduction of the Enron-related litigation provision and gains related to fair value adjustments on RBC debt designated as held for trading. Non-interest expense declined 3% from a year ago, largely because of the reduction of the Enron-related litigation provision.</p>
          <p>As Gord mentioned earlier, the significant change in the Canadian-U.S. exchange rates had impacts across our businesses. Overall, it negatively impacted our fourth quarter earnings. As a reminder, most of the areas where we took write-downs and a large portion of our provisions are from U.S.-based businesses. In terms of our balance sheet, the weaker Canadian dollar accounted for approximately one-third of total asset growth from the end of the third quarter to the end of the fourth quarter. And the impact of the change in the Canadian-U.S. dollar exchange rate was even larger for those balance sheet items that is have a higher proportion of U.S. dollar denominated assets.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide 19, our capital position remains strong, with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 9%. The Tier 1 capital ratio declined 50 basis points from the third quarter, primarily due to the impact of a sharply weaker Canadian dollar at quarter end on the translation of our foreign currency denominated assets. This change in foreign exchange rates accounts for approximately two-thirds of the increase in risk-adjusted assets from the third to the fourth quarter. As Morten mentioned earlier, effective August 1, we reclassified $6.9 billion from our held for trading to available for sale portfolios. This resulted in $478 million or $270 million after tax being recorded as a decline in other comprehensive income instead of net income.</p>
          <p>We believe these securities are good quality, but given the significant lack of liquidity, their current market prices are well below our view of their long-term recoverable value. We intend to hold these securities until their values recover. Speaking generally about our available for sale portfolio, we conduct other than temporary impairment testing on our AFS portfolio to determine whether impairments in value are expected to recover. Our AFS securities remain quality assets, and unrealized losses are viewed as temporary in nature. We intend to hold these assets and fully expect these assets to recover in value.</p>
          <p>I'll now review the quarterly performance of our five business segments and Corporate Support. Turning to slide 20, Canadian Banking net income was down 15% from Q4 of '07, and 5% over the third quarter. Excluding the Visa gain and the adjustment to our credit card loyalty reward liability in Q4 '07, net income grew 11% from Q4 '07 on strong volume growth and effective cost management. Earnings decreased from last quarter, largely due to spread compression on lower mutual fund distribution fees, offset by solid volume growth.</p>
          <p>On slide 21, you will see our retail net interest margin decreased over the year and the quarter. The decline over the previous year largely reflects the impact of sharply lower interest rates, as well as our clients' continued preference for lower-spread products such as home equity lending and high-interest saving accounts. This change from the previous quarter reflects narrower spreads between prime and funding cost in the fourth quarter. Competitive pressure also continued to impact our margins.</p>
          <p>Looking at Wealth Management on slide 23, net income was down 64 million or 36% from Q4 '07. Results this quarter were reduced by the combined impact of a provision related to the Reserve Primary Fund and a charge related to auction rate security settlements, which are fully described in our 2008 Annual Report. We also had lower transactional revenue in our brokerage businesses due to uncertainty in the global financial markets. These factors were partially offset by the earnings from PH&amp;N's private counsel and asset management businesses, which we acquired on May 1.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expense grew 18% from Q4 '07, primarily reflecting increased costs in support of business growth, including acquisition-related costs, depreciation of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, and the provision for the Reserve Primary Fund and ARS settlement I mentioned before.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Insurance on slide 25, earnings over Q4 of '07 and Q3 of '08 were reduced, mainly due to the $110 million or $80 million after-tax impact of losses related to the sale and impairment of securities, as well as impacts from equity market movements. These factors were partially offset by strong growth in our reinsurance business and higher favorable net actuarial adjustments.</p>
          <p>Let me go into some more detail on the losses. We had losses from the sale of bonds and impairments on preferred shares and bonds of certain financial institutions. Similar to other life insurance companies, our earnings were also impacted by declines in equity values held to support our actuarial liabilities and universal life policy funds. These largely represent non-cash charges on long-dated policyholder obligations. The decline in equity values was caused by significant market volatility, and should markets improve, we would report gains in respect of these obligations. Unlike some life insurance companies, we have minimal exposure to products with embedded investment-related guarantees, such as segregated funds and certain types of annuities.</p>
          <p>Turning to International Banking on 27, earnings were down over Q4 of '07. The decline predominantly in our U.S. banking business was mainly attributable to write-downs and losses on our investment portfolios of $244 million or $168 million after tax and higher provisions for credit losses, which Morten highlighted earlier. These factors were partially offset by earnings from our RBTT and ANB acquisitions. Non-interest expense increased over the fourth quarter of '07, mainly due to costs in support of business growth, including acquisition-related integration costs.</p>
          <p>Turning to Capital Markets on slide 29, earnings were up over the fourth quarter of last year, reflecting stronger performance in certain fixed income and foreign exchange businesses, the reduction of the Enron-related litigation provision, and higher gains on credit derivative contracts used to hedge our corporate loan book. Offsetting these factors were weaker results in origination and equity trading, a higher effective tax rate, and significantly higher write-down. Non-interest expense was down significantly, mainly due to the reduction of the Enron-related litigation provision.</p>
          <p>On slide 31, you'll see a breakdown of RBC's total trading revenue. Certain fixed income and foreign exchange businesses benefited in the quarter from the market volatility and interest rate environment, while equity trading revenue declined.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin questions and answers.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We will now take questions from the telephone lines. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Robert Sedran from National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. I guess the first question is for Morten. Morten, the coverage ratios dropped again this quarter despite the addition to the general. Can you talk a little bit about where you think we are in the credit cycle, how comfortable you are with the reserves, and what might cause you to strengthen them further?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So the coverage ratio, you're right, did fall where it's 79% in terms of total ACL to impaireds and 26%, which is more stable, on specific ACL to reserves. I mean, it is the normal pattern as you go into the cycle that as impaireds grow, the provisions do not follow in tandem. And that is because the route out of impaireds is a combination of recovery back into producing status and provisions and write-offs. So if you look at the historical pattern of coverage ratios, we are at a point in the cycle that's consistent with being early to mid-cycle, and from the combination of additional provisions and recoveries we'd expect coverage ratios to flatten out and move back up as the cycle turns up.</p>
          <p>I guess the other point that I would make is the coverage ratio is an interesting number to look at, but it is a function of portfolio mix, underlying views on recovery rates, and the overall quality of the portfolio. So I mean, it is a bottom-up process where we look at provisions on an account by account basis. And we look at total coverage ratios, as a bit of a sanity check at the end of the process. So where this takes us from here, as I said is, is likely to have a flattening out and improvement in coverage rates over time, depending on the nature of how the cycle evolves, the mix of reduction to increases in provisions, and movements back into productive status will really drive exactly how that works.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if it weakened a little &#x2013; or I guess went down a little further from here &#x2013; it wouldn't necessarily concern you all that much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean, if you look at this in a historical context, we're at a similar level to what we were in the early part of this decade, where there were some credit quality issues but we were actually performing fairly well, both in an absolute and a relative sense. So to the extent that the downturn continues, there may be some ongoing deterioration on the coverage ratio. I mean, I do think you have to look at the components, and the part that's driving this is the size of the builder finance portfolio, where the recovery rate over time on that will be relatively good. We are not a distressed seller of those assets. And while there have been significant reductions in the underlying asset values, recovery rates will over time be in fairly reasonable ranges, and that kind of assessment does help drive the coverage ratio down when you have a large chunk of new impaireds with a projected good recovery rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. Gord, I guess sticking with the balance sheet, I'm just curious to get your thoughts on capital. It seems like the definition of well capitalized has been taken away from the regulator and given to the market. With the asset growth, with the fact that every new preferred share issue seems to be pushing the price higher, would you be prepared to have the Tier 1 ratio slide into the high 8's in the near term, if assets continue to come on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, firstly if you look at our plan as we go forward, we wouldn't expect that to happen. Our capital ratios &#x2013; as you know, they're strong to begin with, although you're absolutely right, the world has changed. I would make a couple of points on that, one of which of course is that we did add $525 million of capital right after our year-end so that our capital ratio actually was higher on November 2 than it was on October 31.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, through a combination of managing our balance sheet, which we've been doing quite aggressively &#x2013; again, I know it was lost in the foreign exchange side, but if you look at the Capital Markets balance sheet, they managed their gross adjusted assets down quite dramatically, if you look at it from peak to trough, and that process is still continuing. And the good news is that the return on GAA is going up at a very, very attractive rate, which is one of the reasons you're seeing good performance in our Capital Markets business notwithstanding that we are managing the balance sheet on the Capital Markets side quite aggressively.</p>
          <p>So we do think we're well capitalized. Our earnings continue to be strong. We are managing the balance sheet. And I would say that there's no question going forward, we will continue to work to maintain a strong capital position. It is a priority for us. We think it provides not only strength in terms of stability and credit rating, et cetera, but we also think it's extremely important in being able to take advantage of some of the opportunities that we do think are in front of us, both in the short term and the medium term, because in this environment, there is an opportunity to deploy capital aggressively.</p>
          <p>So we will manage it very carefully and we'll continue to make sure that we maintain a strong capital position. And I think if you look at the trends going forward, there's been quite a change. But I would also just emphasize that when you look at the marketplace, there's a difference &#x2013; I mean, stated capital and &#x2013; capital going up temporarily to plug a hole is different than capital actually going up to grow a business. And I would like to think that we're in the business of growing our business, not plugging holes.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Got a couple questions with respect to the U.S. operations. I was surprised actually to see that there was not a goodwill or an intangible charge this quarter, given it's the year-end. And I put it in the context of a significant operating loss coming from the U.S. this quarter basically not having &#x2013; very little earnings in 2008. And as by management's comments with respect to escalating provisions in the U.S. for 2009, it's hard to imagine anything but minimal earnings, if not losses, again in 2009. So just wanted to get a sense on, why there wasn't a charge there and kind of a realization that perhaps this asset is somewhat impaired.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jim. It's Janice speaking, and I'll answer the question on goodwill. You're absolutely right. We test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, and we go through an extremely complicated valuation methodology.</p>
          <p>One thing to point out to you is that with respect to the testing, the testing is done in reporting units that are a level below the segments. But for International Banking, for example, the reporting unit includes both our U.S. bank and our Caribbean bank. So the testing of goodwill is against those two banks; that's number one.</p>
          <p>And the second thing is that when we actually re-segmented the bank after 2004, when we did that major reorganization, with respect to goodwill that arose on the acquisition of RBC Centura, two-thirds of that was left with the originating business platform that actually made the acquisition, which was the Canadian bank. So we did do very robust goodwill testing, and we came up with our valuations that supported our carrying value of those assets. But definitely as we go through the next quarter or two, we will continue to monitor that. But I think the nuance is that it's not just about the U.S. bank but our International Banking operation and their performance overall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Janice. No, I understand that. Okay. So perhaps when we think of the U.S. operations, Gord, you just said a few minutes ago, part of your strength with respect to capital is to opportunistically deploy it aggressively. And the U.S. banking system seems to be in some sort of impairment, and perhaps for a considerable time ahead and we're actually seeing significant players come in and aggressively move deposits. And I'm just wondering at what point would the bank consider or yourself consider that perhaps the U.S. retail banking environment is not for us and actually consider being a seller in this market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's certainly not our intention to be a seller in this market for a variety of reasons, the least of which &#x2013; you know, we do think that there will ultimately be a recovery in the U.S. banking business. And given our strength, we would like to take advantage of that as opposed to miss that opportunity. And particularly at this point in the cycle. There is no question, and I have been very clear to the marketplace, that we do not believe this is an environment, nor do we have the competitive advantage given what is happening in the U.S. banking system in terms of capital being provided by the government, in terms of the change of capital rules, goodwill, and accounting rules that you've seen in that marketplace. It is a market that we're going to continue to be extremely cautious in terms of deploying capital aggressively in.</p>
          <p>But at the same time, it's not a market that we believe we should be exiting. And it will turn. There's a lot of good things going on in our U.S. banking platform, and what we're very focused on in 2009 is, one, ensuring that we do everything we can to get the bank performing at a much better level. And secondly, to make sure that we do explore our options in terms of making sure that we're well positioned as the marketplace turns around.</p>
          <p>I would just emphasize &#x2013; and it's not an excuse by any means. I mean, we've been very candid. We're disappointed with our performance of our U.S. banking business. Fortunately on a relative size basis it's not a large business. But the vast majority of that is as a result of their builders finance business. If you look at the core operations of RBC Centura, there are some good things going on in RBC &#x2013; the old RBC Centura. There are some good things going on in RBC Bank. Unfortunately, it gets overwhelmed by what is happening on the PCL side, primarily as a result of the builders finance business. And if you remember &#x2013; as I'm sure you do, Jim &#x2013; the builders finance business originally was a business that was actually acquired before RBC Centura. It wasn't part of it, but it's obviously a part of the U.S. banking reporting structure. But if you back out builders, their core operations, there are some good strides being made. They've had good deposit growth in the last couple of quarters, and there's a lot of initiatives under way.</p>
          <p>Jim Westlake might want to add to that, because I would say for 2009, it's priority number one for Jim.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Gord. You know, when we get into the actual bank, Jim, we're doing what you'd expect. We are very aggressively managing expenses. We're focused on getting the kind of operating leverage we've been accustomed to here in Canada. We're focused on taking advantage of the marketplace in the south, where some big players such as Wachovia have gone through changes, and we think it represents some good client opportunities. So trying to build the business while we deal with the current economics of the situation that we find ourselves in.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Ian de Verteuil from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Two sets of questions. The first one really relates to Page 36 of the Annual Report, which I think gives us a concept of Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. As I look at it, there's a significant increase in the assets that are being valued off of internal models. Janice, can you talk to what assets are in there? It looks as if the majority of them are in the trading book outside of derivatives.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. The majority of the increase are in securities like auction-rate securities and municipals where the market was totally illiquid and some of the bank paper. So that's why you see the increase in the other than derivatives in the top category and also classified in our available for sale, because as you know we reclassified the auction rate securities portfolio largely to available for sale this quarter. So basically, it is kind of comparable to Level 3, but not exactly, because as you know, Level 3 is the U.S. GAAP concept. But what that does is tell you that we used a lot more models valuations in some of these shorter-term money market products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So of the &#x2013; as I work back through it, it's about 23 billion. How much of it is auction rate securities that are valued at, and how much are other things?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the auction rate securities that we reclassed were about 6 &#x2013; just over 6 billion, I think. Oh, just over 3, right. The total was 3, so just over 3 billion. And working back from that, the rest would be &#x2013; there's a small portfolio that's left in held for trading, and the rest would be other bank paper.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So this would be &#x2013; when you say other bank, what other bank paper would there not be &#x2013; would you have to use models on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bank paper that was relatively illiquid, where the spreads widened out so much that we couldn't really get quotes on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the second questions relate to the ABCP conduit, Page 78 of the Annual Report. As you can tell, I've been busy since this morning. So the &#x2013; and Morten, this relates to loans. You've got loans of over 1.9 billion, which were the conduits drawing on liquidity backstop. Is this assets that you've taken back, and that's where the loan comes in, or is the 1.9 billion something else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Ian. So if you're looking at top of Page 78, I think that helps you navigate through. If you see the &#x2013; the line that we're looking at here is the 2.36 billion of asset-backed securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is commitment. About 75% of that is outstanding. So what has been funded is the asset-backed securities, or some of the asset-backed securities as a subset of that, the 1.9 billion. And the loan with the provision that we referred is a further subset of the only asset-backed related security where we have had any evidence of real quality deterioration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what happened on that is you took the asset-backed securities from the conduit and &#x2013; through a loan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; and others may want to help me out, but I believe what we actually did, we are just funding it by way of a loan to the conduit. We have not taken the asset-back as such. It might be a fine nuance, but it's rather than being funded in the CP market, given that the commercial paper holders have a clear preference for simple assets. However high the quality might be, funding more exotic assets through the CP market we just decided was less efficient, and it was more cost-effective to bring the funding back through a loan from the bank. But the assets remain in the conduit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And it also looked as if you sold some auction rate securities to a conduit as well? Is that right, the 465 of auction rate that was sold to the conduit during the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ian, it's Janice. And yes, during the year we restructured some of the auction rate securities and put them into conduits so that we could get more liquidity on that particular product. So we had talked about that, I think, in Q2 and Q3. As the auction rate security market was seizing up, we were restructuring them. So we have done that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you put them into the conduit.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Andr&#xE9; Hardy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is either for Janice or Morten. It relates to Page 19 of the supp pack. So Morten, in your prepared remarks you alluded to why the VaR will increase. By how much should it increase? And ballpark is fine. And by how much would that affect that 17 billion of market risk-weighted assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is &#x2013; first of all, how much it will continue to increase is a function of how much the ongoing volatility continues. If you look at the value at risk methodology, we have a 500-day data center, two years of trading P&amp;L, that determines this and we update this roughly on a monthly basis. So every time you &#x2013; at the moment every time you drop off a month, it's a month of quite benign stable data, and then as you add a new volatile month, that changes the mix. So the longer the degree of high volatility continues, the more you will see value at risk increasing, assuming that we keep a similar mix of business in the trading businesses.</p>
          <p>So how much it will go up will be a function of, number one, what kind of mix of business that we are doing, and then number two, of what the future looks like. But I mean you can see &#x2013; I think you can see with us and a number of other institutions that the VaR has been trending upwards. And there will be single-digit millions of VaR, added assuming we keep the same kind of portfolio on each additional month of new volatile data. But it's hard to be more precise than that.</p>
          <p>And obviously, we are adjusting our trading businesses to take a view on where are the opportunities for return relative to what appears to be increased risk. I think the good part of the story at the moment is that there are a large number of areas where, while the risk is moving up, the return in a majority of those businesses is actually very good. So the return on risk that we're seeing is actually excellent.</p>
          <p>Then it's just calibrating the amount of risk that we're taking against the return that we have. So I think it's more a Stan and Doug question probably in terms of how we value those pieces. But it's clear that in the near term you're likely to see a gradual increase in VaR. I would add that by our risk appetite measures, from the overall risk we're taking in the trading businesses, whether you measure it in a value at risk or sort of expected loss-like fashion or you look more at tail events, we are at levels that we continue to be quite comfortable with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess perhaps a more fair question would have been let's say VaR increases 25%. By how much would your market risk &#x2013; risk-weighted assets increase?</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, along the same lines as Ian's questions regarding the U.S. multi-sellers. You make reference to weighted average first-loss protection of 35.7%. If you could talk about what form that takes, is that a first-loss protection note or some other form? And that's an awfully high number, but only if the weighted average really is arrived at from a rather diverse pool where there aren't any major extremes. Could you provide some commentary on the U.S. multi-sellers, that pool, in the context of the effectiveness of the first-loss protection?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, Mario, this is Mark Standish. Yeah, as you point out, we actually have a weighted average first-loss buffer of 35.7%, and that essentially is additional credit enhancement. So over and above that, we have a small additional first-loss provider, but that nearly 36% credit enhancement is made up of a mixture of additional collateral, some in the form of cash, some in the form of additional receivables. We run an extremely diversified pool. 95% of our conduits are made up of cards, order receivables, trade receivables, students loans, equipment leases, et cetera. And, probably just add to that that 90% of these assets are run on a cost of funds plus basis. So that relates to how we fund them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So when you say that there's &#x2013; the credit enhancement is a weighted average 35.7, there must be a number of tranches or whatever the terminology is within there? And can you give us a sense, are there any &#x2013; I guess what I &#x2013; really what I'm getting at is cards are a big part of this, 12.3 billion. And I think everybody can appreciate that cards are softening in the U.S. pretty abruptly. I want to be comfortable that there isn't a tranche out there that's all cards with a low first-loss protection on it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mario, it's Morton. Really, this is the &#x2013; averages do not tell a complete story obviously, but the point here is that the degree of subordination or over-collateralization in the various transactions is driven in large part by what tranche we are looking at. The vast majority of our business is very high in the capital structure and still carries a large amount of subordination. To the extent that we have pieces that are not at the top, the degree of over-collateralization increases. And using your example of credit card receivables, you're right that the performance is &#x2013; we've seen some softening in the U.S. market, and given the current environment we're likely to see some more.</p>
          <p>But we are, as we've indicated here, able to take a multiple deterioration of what we're currently seeing given the amount of over-collateralization and credit support we got in these structures. And for the various issuers, whether it's credit cards or the other asset classes, we have tracked performance going back years, and in some cases decades. We have clear evidence of underwriting practices, collection practices, and the ability to track this very accurately. So the history we have to base it on goes back through several cycles, and the structuring reflects that. So this is a good business for us, it's got very nice returns, but the risk protection actually is very good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was very helpful. Maybe then in the context of that $1.9 billion loan that you made to the conduit &#x2013; and I understand it's more semantics as to whether you pulled the assets out or made the loan &#x2013; why would there be a $65 million provision on that particular loan, just given the level of credit enhancement on the pool?</p>

          <p>Well &#x2013; okay, so it's &#x2013; the provision we have is against a single security, which has some mortgage product in it. So going back to the 1.9 billion, that is a mix of asset-backed securities that have been funded through loans from the bank. The one loan in there that we have seen a quality deterioration of in any measurable sense is the one loan we have the provision against. It's a, as I said, a mortgage-related product where there is real deterioration. The rest of the asset-backeds are a more complicated story to tell than the card cards or trade receivables or auto receivables. But they remain at a level from a quality standpoint where we have no concern in the near term over impairment or provisions on any of those assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But why wouldn't that asset-backed securities also have a level of credit enhancement that would limit Royal's exposure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, they do a level of credit enhancement. I mean, I would say the difference between the more structured assets and credit cards or auto receivables is that they are structures that are slightly more complex. The degree of subordination actually is very large, but as we have seen over the last year and a half, the subordination in some of the more complex structures gets eaten up more quickly than in a plain vanilla credit card or other type of transactions. So if we were to quote you numbers, they would actually sound similar or more comforting than the credit card receivable type transaction. But I think the reality is that those structures as then have more complex story and we feel comfortable with the quality, but the reason we fund them by a loan is exactly the reason why we're having this conversation here, where it's a little bit complex and confusing, but the quality actually is strong on those assets as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think &#x2013; just to &#x2013; and we'll get off this soon. It sounds like the ABS were leverage structures; that's what sort of drove the loss even though you had protection. And would I be right in saying that outside of that ABS that you had to make the loan for, there are no other structure that have that sort of level of leverage that would cause you problems?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>These are &#x2013; as a broad statement, we do not have &#x2013; outside of that loan &#x2013; we do not have &#x2013; or outside the asset-backed securities category, any assets with leverage incorporated into the conduit business.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's all I wanted to go through, thank you. One other just quick thing then. Growth in U.S. earning assets &#x2013; and I understand clearly that currency had a big effect here -but earning assets in the U.S. business or international, up 25% sequentially, loans and acceptances up 21% sequentially. I think currency would account for half of that, but it's still a big number. Anything you can point us to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we'll have to get back to you on it. Because I don't have a quick comeback. I mean it is largely driven by currency-related things and opportunities or movement in assets driven by currency, but we'll get back to you on the details.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Morten, just one more time on the conduits. Did you say of that 60 million provision that had been taken against that book of loans, it was 200 million or so on the gross impaired? So that's the total size of the loan that relates to this problem asset that you're talking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's $203 million Canadian at the end of the quarter. It's a U.S. $170 million asset.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that 200 million is the part of the 1.9 billion that the 60 million in provisions relate to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You got it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the remainder of the assets, as you just went through, you're comfortable with what we're seeing there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So if I bring that back to RBC Capital Markets, the loan portfolio in that segment, so 25 million this quarter relates to the conduit. The number's still, and obviously it's been very low for a few years, still a little bit higher in provisions for what we're seeing there. Can you talk about specifically in the corporate book what you're seeing, maybe in terms of watch lists or sector concentration, as the economy here shows some signs of weakening? What are the areas of concern at this point for Royal in the corporate book?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So in the corporate book, the PCL in the quarter is &#x2013; we've got the 25 million that we just talked about, and a small number of other loans that have taken provisions. We got gross impaired at 199. And as you were saying, foreign exchange is driving some of the increase in both impaireds and provisions here in that it's sort of half and half in terms of where we got the issues, our Canadian and U.S. borrowers.</p>
          <p>In terms of impaireds, we don't actually have any particular sector focus in the wholesale portfolio. The run-up in real estate is dominated by the wholesale portfolio coming out of RBC Bank. So the corporate banking portfolio we have, as I said, no particular sector focus in terms of where the problems are. We're focusing obviously on any of the sectors that are being impacted in the current environment.</p>
          <p>But the watch list in the corporate bank is &#x2013; we're seeing some increase in the number of accounts coming into the watch list. I would add that a fair number of them move off the watch list without going into impaired. There is not a dominant theme on any of that activity. In the Canadian environment it tends to be midsize, more commercial-like accounts that end up on the watch list, the majority of which we so far have not seen the need to take any provisions on. And in the U.S. it's really one account at the moment, without any clear sectoral trends.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I just bring this back, it's been a few years now since Royal would talk about a loan loss range of 40 to 50 basis points, and depending on how you view the general this quarter, we're somewhere in the 65 to 85 range. As you look out to 2009 right now, and obviously we've seen an acceleration in nonperforming loans, do you view the level of provisioning this quarter with or without the general as something &#x2013; or maybe that's the question. Is 600 maybe a number that we should get used to from Royal in terms of getting that coverage ratio a little bit higher and having the reserves built up for any kind of surprises that could occur as the economy weakens?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The big unknown here is the speed and location of the deterioration. I mean, if you look at the current quarter, the specific PCL ratio is 65, and that's &#x2013; I mean the one that &#x2013; to the extent that we've talked about a 40 to 50 basis point target for where we should at worst be in a normal credit environment, that's the reference point. If you take out builder finance &#x2013; and I appreciate we can't take out any of the portfolios without starting to dilute this conversation &#x2013; but if you take out builder finance, we're well within the 50 basis point area.</p>
          <p>As we go forward with the kind of change in unemployment and economic growth that's being forecast, we would expect some deterioration in the Canadian book, but not massive. Whether or not further addition to the general is required is obviously something that we will look at as the quarters move forward. But I would suggest that in the current environment, seeing us in the 50-plus basis point range for specific provision is entirely possible. We are shooting to be better than that.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The final question is from Darko Mihelic from CIBC World Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you. Just a quick question actually. I'm not sure if this is for Gord or Barbara or Janice. So if anyone could give me a hand with this. You achieved operating leverage this year by having expenses fall faster than revenues. Gord, what happens if you have another year of declining revenue? Can you bring expenses down again? You have a large expense base. I'm just curious as to how much expense save you can find in there. And if you can, I'm just curious which business unit do you think could punch above its weight in reining in expenses in a period of falling revenues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Darko, it's Janice. Why don't I answer that for you? Definitely operating leverage is a function of both revenues and expenses, and we're totally engaged on the cost management side. And so it's not about targeting certain businesses that will come down. For example, Capital Markets is constantly retooling their businesses, and for some of their businesses that are not performing, they're taking out expenses there. We're doing some business process outsourcing, we're accelerating on that front, managing our discretionary expenses across the board, and really trying to maintain our expense run rate at a very low core, and not putting on any additional projects and things like that until we see revenue coming on stream. So it is a balancing act between looking forward and seeing when we're going to get more revenue strength, and layering on some of the projects that are more focused towards cost containment versus revenue growth. So it's across the board in all of our businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just emphasize, Darko, that as we build our plans &#x2013; or, we have our plan for 2009 &#x2013; as we stress test our plan there's a number of initiatives across all of our businesses, including the back end of our businesses, that will be put into place to react to any revenue impact as a result of what is going on across the economy. So as Janice says, it's not so much a specific business as it is a number of initiatives across all of our businesses, both in the front and back end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And we had once heard that discretionary spend was about $1 billion. Is that still a round-about number of that? And how fast can you pull that in, Janice?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is still around about $1 billion, and so the speed &#x2013; what we were focused on initially was not growing it. And so the speed at pulling it in is more related to looking at travel, entertainment, all that sort of stuff. And we're actively managing that spend down at this point.</p>
