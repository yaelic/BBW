      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Oracle's third quarter fiscal year 2009 earnings conference call.</p>
          <p>With me on the call are Oracle's Chief Executive Officer, Larry Ellison; Oracle's President, Safra Catz; Oracle's President, Charles Phillips; and Oracle's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Epstein. We will begin with a few prepared remarks and then take questions from the audience.</p>
          <p>Let me begin by reminding everyone that today's discussion may include predictions, expectations, intentions, estimates, or other information that might be considered forward-looking. While these forward-looking statements represent our current judgment on what the future holds, they are subject to risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Roy. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will review our non-GAAP financial results focusing on constant currency growth rates unless otherwise stated.</p>
          <p>First, a note about foreign exchange rate movements. In December we told you that using then current exchange rates would reduce our Q3 growth rate by 8 percentage points compared to constant currency. During the third quarter the U.S. dollar strengthened again further reducing our international revenues, expenses and profits, when measured in U.S. dollars. As a result, currency movements reduced new license revenues by 9%, total revenues by 10%, net income by 12%, and earnings per share by 13%, or $0.05 per share, compared to Q3 of last year.</p>
          <p>Now, let's review the income statement. In the third quarter our new software license revenues were $1.5 billion, up 3% in constant currency, and down 6% in U.S. dollars. EMEA grew 12%, Asia grew 1%, and the Americas were down 4%. Technology new license revenues were $1.1 billion, up 6% in constant currency and down 4% in U.S. dollars. EMEA grew 15%, Asia grew 1% and the Americas were down 1%.</p>
          <p>Our BEA products, which have now been technically integrated with Oracle's Fusion Middleware, packaged into unified suites and are sold off the same price list, accounted for $140 million of our Q3 new license revenues based on our internal allocations, which are consistent with previous quarters.</p>
          <p>Applications new license revenues were $396 million, down 4% in constant currency and down 12% in U.S. dollars. EMEA grew 2%, Asia fell 2% and the Americas were down 8%. Our software license updates and product support revenues were $3 billion, up 21%, in constant currency and up 12% in U.S. dollars. These revenues are annual fees the customers pay to receive updated versions of and enhancements to their existing products without having to buy the software again.</p>
          <p>On a trailing four quarter basis, our software license updates and product support revenues totaled $11.8 billion, up 18% over the prior comparable period. Our services revenues were $1 billion, up 2% in constant currency and down 8% in U.S. dollars. Our total revenues were $5.5 billion, up 12% in constant currency, which is above the high end of our constant currency guidance range of 8 to 11% and up 2% in U.S. dollars.</p>
          <p>Operating income was $2.6 billion, up 26% in constant currency, and up 15% in U.S. dollars. Our non-GAAP operating margin grew by 510 basis points to 46.4% in U.S. dollars. This is the highest Q3 operating margin in Oracle's history as a public company, and further demonstrates the success of our operating model.</p>
          <p>Our tax rate was 26.6%, which is lower than our guidance of 28.5%, due largely to a one-time benefit from a recent state tax law change.</p>
          <p>In Q3, we repurchased 86 million shares at an average price of $16.82 per share, for a total of $1.4 billion. As we have previously stated, the rate of our stock buyback will fluctuate each quarter, taking into account alternative uses for our cash and our stock price.</p>
          <p>Our non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.35, above the high end of our EPS guidance range of $0.31 to $0.33. This was up 29% in constant currency and up 16% in U.S. dollars. Our non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.05 higher had foreign exchange rates remained the same as they were in Q3 of last year.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet, we have $11.3 billion in cash and investments. Our days sales outstanding improved again this quarter, from 54 days last year to 49 days this year, a testament to the quality of our receivables, the quality of our customers and the effectiveness of our collection efforts, as well as from foreign exchange and product mix benefits. We generated a record $8.0 billion in free cash flow, over the last four quarters, growing 14% over the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll turn the call over to Safra.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeff. Well, clearly we're extremely pleased with our spectacular Q3 results. We hit the midpoint of our new license guidance. We beat the high end of our total revenue guidance. We beat the high end of our EPS guidance by a full $0.02, and we delivered the highest Q3 operating margins in our history, substantially higher operating margins than our peers, and we grew faster than SAP in every region around the world, clearly taking market share.</p>
          <p>Our software license updates and product support revenues, which hit $3 billion this quarter, are growing nicely off a very large base. And our customer renewal rates and satisfaction levels continue at record highs. This quarter clearly demonstrates the strength of our diversified portfolio of products, the breadth of our enormous customer base, and the strength of our operating model.</p>
          <p>Once again, the only negative story for the quarter was currency, as it was in Q2 and as it will be again in Q4. To give you a flavor for the region, since Q4 of last year, currencies in the major European countries have depreciated about 20%. Currencies in Latin America have depreciated 30%. And currencies in Asia, except for Japan, have depreciated about 30%.</p>
          <p>For the coming quarter, assuming that exchange rates remain at current rates, there will be a 12% negative currency effect on license growth rates, a 12% negative effect on total revenue growth rates, a negative 15% effect on net income growth rates, and a negative $0.07 per share effect on earnings per share.</p>
          <p>So, now, let me turn to guidance. And we believe that the guidance we're giving today is realistic, given the continuing strengthening of the US dollar and a very tough Q4 comparison from last year, but I do want to emphasize that our pipelines continue to be strong and the close rates that I'm assuming are more conservative than typical Q4 close rates. So we think they may end up being appropriate.</p>
          <p>With that, our guidance for Q4 is as follows. New software license revenues are expected to range from negative 5 to negative 15% in constant currency; so adding the negative 12 from currency, that's a negative 17 to negative 27 at current exchange rates. Total revenue on GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from plus 2 to minus 3 year-over-year in constant currency, and minus 10 to minus 14 at current exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.49 to $0.53 in constant currency, up from $0.47 last year, and from $0.42 to $0.46, assuming the current exchange rate. GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter is expected to be $0.41 to $0.45 at current exchange rates, and 34 to 38 assuming &#x2013; excuse me &#x2013; at constant currency, and 34 to 38 assuming current exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Now, our guidance assumes a tax rate of 28% for Q4 versus 30.8 in Q4 of last year. Now, I want to be clear. The midpoint of our Q4 EPS guidance puts us at $0.44 or $0.42 for the year. But you need to remember the impact of currency not only for the quarter, but for the whole year. Currency impacted earnings negatively by $0.01 in Q1, $0.04 in Q2, $0.05 in Q3, and as I said, my guidance assumes $0.07 in Q4, if the dollar stays at these rates. So, forgetting the economy, if you merely adjust for the strengthening of the dollar, and use the midpoint of my Q4 guidance, we would be over $0.57 for the year.</p>
          <p>As we have always said, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovations, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and now a dividend. And though, we cannot control the stock market, one benefit we can give our stockholders is a cash dividend; so today we are announcing Oracle's first ever quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share. We generated $8 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months and we are running the business at record margins. We are extremely confident in our financial strength, our operating model, our competitive position, and our execution capabilities and as a result, when many others are reducing or eliminating dividends, we are putting one in place.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Safra. I'm just going to re-emphasize a few things that have already been said. First of all, but for currency, we actually sold more new licenses in Q3 of this year than in Q3 of last year. Now, and that is in the face of a worldwide global recession, great reductions in capital spending, what's been described as tough times for the tech industry.</p>
          <p>In terms of new license sales, our new license sales actually grew year-over-year when measured in constant dollars. That is a remarkable achievement, we're very proud of our &#x2013; the quality of our products and the quality of our field to deliver such result.</p>
          <p>But for currency, our earnings per share would have been 29% growth, year-over-year. That is in the face of a worldwide recession, global &#x2013; weak global economy. We are still able to grow our earnings ahead of our plan, which did not anticipate a global recession or a weak economy. Our target growth rates are 20% per year and we delivered 29% in constant dollars. By the way, even when you do count currency, the twin headwinds of a weak global economy and a strengthening dollar, we still managed to grow earnings per share 16%. That is a remarkable achievement, and we're very, very proud of that.</p>
          <p>So, looking out &#x2013; that's looking back. Now, looking forward, I think the most exciting new product we've had in many, many years, is our Exadata database server. We've planned to grow using a combination of innovation and acquisitions. Now, our fastest growing business right now, fastest growing large business right now is our Fusion Middleware business and that really is a combination of innovation and acquisitions, the BEA acquisition being the largest and the most visible in terms of growing our Middleware &#x2013; our Fusion Middleware business.</p>
          <p>Exadata is 100% innovation on top of our very large and very strong database business. And the early results have been remarkable. Charles Phillips will go into a lot of detail but I'll just throw a couple of numbers out there. One of our customers and Charles will describe this customer again; you're going to hear all this twice. One of our customers saw a 28 times performance improvement over an existing Oracle database. Another customer saw a monthly aggregation drop from 4.5 hours just to three minutes.</p>
          <p>When compared to Teradata, when compared to Teradata, a competitive database machine that's been in the market for a very, very long time, another customer saw that we were six times faster than their existing Teradata application, when using Exadata versus Teradata. Another customer saw a batch process fall from eight hours to 30 minutes. And Charles will go into more detail on all this. He'll repeat those numbers because I think they're worth mentioning twice. Charles?</p>
          <p>[Laughter].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Larry. I want to start off with a few comments about how the field performed. I think the field was very proactive and did a good job adjusting to the current environment, so just some of the things that we've been doing. I think we anticipated extra layers of approvals, given the tight controls on spending and we negotiated that quite well. We've refreshed the selling messages around cost reduction and consolidation and the elimination of costly customization.</p>
          <p>We are more focused on edge applications and add-options to add value to existing deployments. This includes things like Agile, Demantra, G-Log, sourcing applications, EPM [Enterprise Performance Management], which is Hyperion and BI [Business Intelligence] on the tools side of it. And the good news about all of that is that we can sell that into the SAP install base as well. So we can add value to an existing deployment.</p>
          <p>We're getting people to upgrade to the latest releases of our applications. That sets the stage for us to up-sell through region add-on modules and we've been selling into existing demand not ahead of it, so customers don't have excessive license headroom at the moment.</p>
          <p>On the consulting side, we've adjusted consulting hiring on projects to keep utilization and margins high, by load balancing with contractors and the integrators instead of hiring for future products ahead of the deal.</p>
          <p>So now, just a few comments by area. On database, as Larry mentioned, we are very excited about how the HP Oracle database machine is performing, the increases have just been stunning and so we're getting great feedback from our customers and the pipeline is the largest build I've ever seen in terms of a new product. And as he mentioned the numbers are just stunning.</p>
          <p>The major European retailer who reduced the batch processing time from eight minutes to 30 &#x2013; from eight hours to 30 minutes did not believe the process had completed. We had to convince him that actually it was done. And so as Larry mentioned, this is a reminder that is internally developed technology. In the midst of all the discussion of acquisitions, people forget that we're actually spending 3 billion a year on research and development and this is why we do it.</p>
          <p>So a few enterprise wide database deals to highlight: Bank of America, even despite what's going on in the financial services, did a very large deal with us to purchase many components across the tech stack and because they wanted to lower their costs and consolidate around our database and our middleware stack and so it was a good deal for us.</p>
          <p>Campus-wide license for RAC and Database at New York University, two notable ones. More important, upcoming new release of the Database 11g release 2 should happen in Q1. The key feature enhancement there is enhancement to Real Application Clusters, or RAC. So just to remind you, RAC is our most popular Database Option that we sell around Database and it is the underlying technology for grid computing.</p>
          <p>We have been focused on advanced users because of the complexity of clustering technology at least historically. What's changed in this release is it has significant ease of use enhancements and this will make the grid computing accessible to a much broader market. So basically this is grid computing for the masses.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Middleware, Middleware continues to do extremely well. We still have all the momentum you have become accustomed to. I think one of changes recently is just how much the system integrators are now helping us. We now have trained over 33,000 consultants in 50 countries. It is a great way to expand our selling capacity without increasing our cost. So some recent partner deployments of our middleware: Accenture at JP Morgan Chase, CSC at Wells Fargo, Deloitte at the University of North Carolina, IBM Global Services at Navistar.</p>
          <p>We're also having amazing new releases of our entire Middleware suite this quarter, Fusion Middleware 11g. And this is the major integration we've been talking about. Integration all of the BEA products, common metadata, upgraded components, we expect that to make us a lot more competitive. Some recent wins on the platform: Smucker's, Weight Watchers; at the application server levels: San Diego County, Verizon; Enterprise Performance Management, the Hyperion product: the Gap, Home Depot, Adobe Laboratories, Federal Reserve Board, CVS Pharmacies; and our BI products, Lexmark, Pella, Florida A&amp;M and Federal Customs Service. Good wins in content management at the University of Arkansas and Identity and Access Management at Standard Life and Liberty University. Lots more we could mention, just wanted to give you a sample.</p>
          <p>Lastly on applications, we had new a release of Application Integration Architecture [AIA], version 2.3 in January. Just to remind you these are package integrations between Oracle applications that are built completely on standard middleware. So standard off the shelf integration has turned into a good differentiator for us, since customers want to avoid costly hardwired and custom integrations that always break on upgrades.</p>
          <p>So we use this integration platform for our own products, but we also extend them to third party products where it makes sense. A couple of examples, LexisNexis purchased AIA for communications and medium, and they used that to surround their high volume online billing engine and integrate in legacy applications as well. Foster's Group purchased Oracle Fusion Middleware, and AIA Foundation pack to integrate JD Edwards and Siebel along with some third party applications, on and on. People like the fact that we're taking responsibility for the integrations.</p>
          <p>So a couple of notable wins across the applications portfolio, ERP: Hitachi Global, Federal Express; CRM: PNC; Affiliated Computer Services: Telecom Italia; Demantra: Sara Lee and Leggett &amp; Platt; Oracle Transportation Management: Ingersoll-Rand and Sears; in retail: Belk; financial services: GBU, Federal Home Loan, Bank of Pittsburgh, HDFC Bank of India; and in communications: GBU, add-on deal to KPN, which is one of our largest wall-to-wall deployments; insurance: GBU, Great American Insurance Company; utilities: Seattle City Light and Northeast Utilities.</p>
          <p>So finally, on CRM On Demand, our ongoing battle with Salesforce.com continues. We beat them at MiniSAP, leading contractors, Scottish Widows, which is part of Lloyd's TSB group, Cummins Engine and we replaced them 1,000 seats they had in place at Carlson Wagonlit.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll turn it back over to whomever.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll go first to Heather Bellini, UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, everybody. I guess, two questions for you Safra. The first one would be, I was wondering if you could give us an idea of how you saw the quarter progress, if you saw more hesitancy to sign deals in the month of February, versus January, or do you think we've seen some signs of stabilization in term of deal signings? And I guess what I'm trying to take from that is, Adobe made some comments last night on their call that the last five weeks &#x2013; the last five or six weeks they've seen more stability in their channel business. So I was wondering if you could give us some color there.</p>
          <p>And then the second thing is, it looks like you're getting awfully close to that 50% operating margin goal that you set probably five or six years ago. And I'm just wondering if you can give us a sense of what's the limit there? I mean, is this something that we can continue to see and that once you get to 50 there is going to be another goal on the horizon that you're just going to see this continue to progress as you layer on the maintenance revenue? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Heather, so as far as how the quarter played out for us, we were actually on track the whole quarter. You know, every month looks sort of on track, and there was &#x2013; there was no more of an issue earlier on. So, as you know, we do a lot of our business at the end, and nothing about that was different. But we did end up with a good close, but we were actually on track every single quarter. Our business might be a little bit lumpier, more hockey stick than the Adobe's, so it might be something they might see and we wouldn't.</p>
          <p>As far as the 50% rate, that that is very much dominated by the mix of business dependent on our large install base of customers who already have bought our product and are interested in buying the upgrade rights every year, and as that base continues to grow as a percentage of our total revenues, you will see the margins continue to improve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is 50 &#x2013; better than 50% in the cards then, at some point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you just need a spreadsheet, enough years in it, I think we're definitely -- we're up &#x2013; well, obviously 500 basis points this quarter, 300, et cetera, in the previous quarter. So, we are on track to do over 50 ultimately, sure.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>We'll take our next question from Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, and congratulations. First question is on maintenance revenue, it looks like you had a nice sequential increase in maintenance revenue. There has obviously been a lot of focus on this line. Our work suggests that your pricing has been holding in pretty well in what is obviously a difficult environment. Can you talk a little bit about what you saw on the pricing front, renewal front and some of the mechanics around maintenance revenue?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I also had a question on the OpEx side. You're obviously doing a terrific job on margins. Your head count is slowing on a sequential basis, still growing year-on-year. What are your plans for head count growth going forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was nothing special about the upgrade and product support business. It continues to grow because our, every one of these new license customers, a very overwhelmingly high percentage will renew next year and so this year, the maintenance &#x2013; the product updates and support number is simply from previous years, so same customers continuing to renew. There was nothing unusual in the pricing one way or the other. And so there's really no news whatsoever on that line.</p>
          <p>As far as head count, the head count numbers are often very dependent on what we do with acquisitions. We are always very careful with how many folks we hire. The big ramp-ups in head count have generally come in with acquisitions. So we really can't comment as far as what will happen in the future. It's very dependent on what will &#x2013; as far as a big move on acquisitions, we haven't had a very large acquisition in the past couple of quarters, so there's not the big bump.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Terrific. Thanks a lot. And good quarter, guys. Just a question on the growth in EMEA and even in Asia-Pac, which is just very noticeable given the backdrop that we're in. As you think about the different geos and how they performed through the quarter and as you look forward, is the U.S. just a precursor of what's going to come in those geos or is there something specific for Oracle in those geos, either that you have more share gains to take or there's more low-hanging fruit in maybe some of the BRIC economies that would continue to make them look a little bit better than what you're seeing in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the economic impact was clearly more severe in the U.S., but having said that, there are some things going on in some of the other countries that maybe made a difference. We had a management change in Asia-Pac and that's working out quite well. Japan is another story. But ex-Japan is actually working out very well in all the things that we're asking him to do and the new energy he has brought, that's actually happening.</p>
          <p>In EMEA we have the same thing. We have a management change that was planned and natural, but I do think some of the changes he made there are having some immediate impact as well. So, I think we've adjusted for all that in our forecast, the economies as we see them unfolding. And hopefully as things grow out through the quarter, some of the deals that we've been counting on, closed early in the quarter. There are other large ones out there. We have to see what happens.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And then if I may, just a quick follow-up, kind of a similar, what the leading indicator is saying? I look at your Database and Middleware growth in the U.S. at constant currency, it actually dipped down negative one and it's trailing off from how strong it's been. Is there &#x2013; I would think that Database and Middleware is still an area that could continue to see growth. Apps I'd expect weakness in but Database and Middleware feels like an inevitability in life. How do you think about the ability to keep growing that business even given everything that we're seeing out there in the economy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the Middleware business, I think we're gaining significant share. We just have such a lead on the competition and we have a new release coming out. So I do think that's a growth area and that's been helping us get through a tough time period. And all the new BEA customers we can up-sell. So, that's working quite well and I expect that to continue. Database is a more mature market. There's no getting around that. Nonetheless, our differentiation relative to the competition is so great, if there is demand, we tend to get it. So I would say infrastructure is easier in a tough environment and new project driven areas like Applications are somewhat tougher and that's reflected in the results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Brent Thill with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good afternoon. Safra, you mentioned you're assuming slightly more conservative close rates for Q4. Can you just give us a sense of that conservativeness in your guidance? Any key metrics would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in general, we try to use &#x2013; Q4 &#x2013; first of all, Q4 has a dynamic all its own, frankly and closure rates are always very high in Q4. So what I tried to use is a closure rate more similar to Q3 or Q2, just because we want to &#x2013; we can't see into the future. We had a spectacular &#x2013; another spectacular quarter. So we have no idea what's going to be happening in the future. So in trying to use our best judgment, both using a bottoms-up and a top-down analysis, to just kind of see if the numbers make sense, we came out this time with a more conservative closure rate. Really just probably in an abundance of caution as to what's going to happen next in the economy. But there is nothing special. I often end up using a lower closure rate because I just don't know and the actuals usually come out higher than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, Charles, just on the Database, the Options seem to be a popular choice. Can you give us a sense of what you've been seeing in this environment with the add-on of some of these Database Options, how important that's been to continue to fuel that line item?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's certainly a significant part of the growth around Database. The Options are leading it, and I think our challenge is to make sure that we focus on better, have more specialization around some of the options, have a higher attach rate when we do a database deal, make sure we offer the Options at the same time. So internally the opportunity around the Options given where we are has gotten a lot more focus. So that's what's happening and we're actually starting to forecast at that level, not just overall Database but internally forecasting the individual, at least the major Options in the major regions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take our next question from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you very much. Larry, it looks like you've declared this earnings growth goal. You had one five years back and you've actually outperformed it pretty significantly. I'm wondering as a management team how do you think about the next 12 months ahead? Are you still targeting earnings growth rate? I know it's a challenging currency environment, if you strip out the currency, those results look really impressive. But the currency also continues to be a headwind as you quantified Safra over the last few quarters. So how do you think about on a reported basis what the earnings growth profile of the company could &#x2013; how are you managing that for the downturn? That's my question. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, it's very difficult for us to predict currency rates. I mean, no one would have predicted a euro at $1.68 and/or the sudden decline of the euro. So we're not really in the business of predicting exchange rates. We'll leave that to George Soros and other people who do that for a living.</p>
          <p>We try to manage our business using constant dollars, and try to sell more software this year than the previous year, on a constant-dollar basis. And on that constant dollar basis, I think we can continue growing our earnings at our targeted 20% share. Again, as you know we almost hit it in the face of huge headwinds, currency headwinds. We did 16% in reported but 29% EPS growth in constant. And I think that's a terrific achievement in the face of this recession. I think we're managing our way through this recession very, very well but currency is just too unpredictable. It fluctuates suddenly, and it is not something we really try to manage for.</p>
          <p>We don't do a lot of hedge &#x2013; currency &#x2013; which, to do with currency hedging and things like that. We're not going to do that. We're going to try to run our business within the recession, deliver good growth within the recession, make appropriate acquisitions, invest in appropriate innovation, and target a constant dollar EPS growth rate of 20% and currencies are going to do what currencies are going to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And Safra and Charles, any commentary at all on ELA [Enterprise Licensing Agreement] trends, renewals, anything that you've been noticing? I know you don't quantify it but any trend-wise qualitatively, can you talk to that? That's it. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's still a lot of ELAs being done, that's still healthy for our business. I would say, on average globally maybe the deal sizes are a little bit less than they were in past years, but that's probably a good thing in this environment for predictability. There is still some large deals out there. We're not counting on those. Those aren't in the forecast, so the average deal size that we see has probably come down a little bit. But there is plenty of individual opportunities out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, operator?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take our next question from John DiFucci with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I guess, for Safra, or Charles, I mean, a lot of people look at Oracle as a gauge for the software industry, and whether you are or not is debatable. I have my own opinions there, but just wondering what you're seeing versus your competitors? We all know the macro environment is tough out there, it is for you too, but for instance, I think your Apps results were better than anyone would have guessed here and your largest competitor was probably down &#x2013; I don't know, 15% in their most recent quarter on an organic constant currency basis where you put up numbers on an organic constant currency basis, it looks like it's down about four. Can you comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think SAP is a lot more reliant on big mega deals than we are, out of their install base, and the thing that we used to get criticized for, having lots of applications is actually a pretty good thing right now. We have lots of ways to sell into not only our own install base but into the SAP install base around their customers as well and so we have just more ways to get to the number. All the edge applications, all the On Demand applications and we know their customers since they're running on our infrastructure; they don't know ours.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So even when you look at your Apps business, as far as its growth rate has improved in each of the last three quarters, Charles, you even said even in this environment, well, I guess your database is doing better than Apps, as far as a growth rate but it's just sort of surprising to see that continued growth, or improvement quarter-over-quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also keep in mind: they don't have any industry applications. We have vertical applications that are much less penetrated than ERP and with less competition. So that's part of the growth and they don't have anything there that I know of.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They don't have a significant CRM business. They don't have a CRM On Demand business. We have a much broader portfolio -- as Charles pointed out, we have a much broader portfolio of applications. We think our applications are much more modern. And let me add, around the end of this year, we're going to be starting delivering the next generation of Fusion applications, which we've been investing very heavily in over the years and SAP is not doing that either.</p>
          <p>So I think we're going to be able to continue to take market share from them for years to come, because of the breadth of our portfolio, the investment in new applications, again currently things like CRM On Demand, in the future our Fusion applications which are all On Demand ready or cloud computing ready, if you prefer. And SAP is not making those investments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Charles. If I might just one quick &#x2013; Charles and Larry, just one quick follow-up. Charles, you mentioned Q1 RAC, you're going to come out with a new version that's going to address sort of ease of use. And you did talk a little bit about options. But specifically on RAC, because that one is one that, as you know has been a great one for you over the last several years. Can you talk a little bit about the penetration today, about the opportunity there, what's left, even subjectively without even specific numbers, if you can?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a small percentage of our install base. It's high value product and it's significant revenue but it's a small percentage of the individual customers that are out there. And it makes a ton of sense for medium and small customers as well if it can be made easy to use, and that's exactly what we've done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. Operator, we have time for one last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And that question comes from Peter Goldmacher with Cowen and Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. Safra, I wanted to ask you a quick question about head count. I noticed that your head count is relatively flat for the quarter, yet all of your operating expense line items were down absolutely. How does that happen? What's going on there? Where are you getting the costs from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter, it's currency. You know that. It's got to be. We pay those folks. They're all over the planet and we end up paying them less &#x2013; I mean, we pay them the same. They still get their same paycheck, but they get it in reals or in rupees or in whatever and so that's all that's going on, it's nothing special.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just following up on DiFucci's question on competition, are you seeing anyone that's remarkably &#x2013; competing remarkably differently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll tell you, any one of us can tell you, we feel like we are winning an awful lot. We are winning in other people's installed bases. We are winning what maybe in many cases we shouldn't be winning. We're competing very effectively against our competitors. I don't know. Larry, do we see anything different from anyone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think, again, Charles pointed out the magic number, we invest $3 billion a year in R&amp;D. So, we think we have a better database machine than Teradata. We're competing very successfully against Salesforce.com. We're taking &#x2013; we're doing better in Applications in every region and taking share against SAP. Our &#x2013; in Database, we're doing extremely well against both Microsoft &#x2013; taking share from Microsoft and IBM. So, I think we're competing more effectively across the board in all of our product areas and that's the explanation for Q3, and the reason for optimism going forward.</p>
