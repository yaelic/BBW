        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David. And welcome everyone to the National Oilwell Varco first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. With me today are Pete Miller, Chairman, President and CEO and Clay Williams, Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>Before we begin this discussion of National Oilwell Varco's financial results &#x2013; David, operator, are you on there, hello &#x2013; before we begin this discussion of National Oilwell Varco's financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2009, please note that some of the statements we make during this call may contain forecast, projections, estimates, including but not limited to comments about our outlook for the company's business.</p>
          <p>These are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws based upon limited information as of today which is subject to change. They are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. No one should assume that these forward-looking statements remain valid later in the quarter or later in the year.</p>
          <p>I refer you to the latest Form 10-K, National Oilwell Varco has on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a more detailed discussion of the major risk factors affecting our business. Further information regarding these as well as supplemental, financial and operating information may be found within our press release on our website at www.nov.com or in our filings with the SEC.</p>
          <p>Later on this call, Pete, Clay and I will answer your questions. We ask that you limit your questions to two, in order to permit more participation.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll turn it over to Pete for his comments.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Loren, and I hope you are all on here. We just got some strange feedback on the call. So, I hope you're able to listen to me. And again, we appreciate your calling in here today.</p>
          <p>Earlier today, we reported net income of $470 million, or $1.13 a share on revenue of $3.48 billion. This compares to a net income of $1.40 a share on revenues of 3.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008, and net income of $1.11 a share on revenues of 2.7 billion in the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we've reported a quarter-ending backlog of $9.6 billion, after taking in a net $240 million of new orders, during probably what is historically one of the most difficult world top &#x2013; economic times in the world's economy.</p>
          <p>I'll provide more color in a moment regarding our operations and backlog in this call. These are very challenging times economically, throughout the world generally, and in the oil and gas business specifically. However, with challenges cum opportunities, and at National Oilwell Varco, we are positioned to take actions through these difficult times to become an even stronger company as we look to better times in the future. We will avail ourselves of opportunities and have a wonderful balance sheet that puts us in a position to be able to do things that are going to strengthen the company throughout this downturn.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to ask Clay to provide more color on our results.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, thanks, Pete. National Oilwell Varco reported earnings of $1.13 per diluted share on $3.5 billion in revenue for the first quarter of 2009. Q1 earnings and revenues declined sequentially, as rig counts and oilfield activity fell in every major market around the globe, and as our customers retreated in the phase of increasingly bleak economic news.</p>
          <p>The company's financial results for its first quarter of 2009 tell the tale of two businesses. Our backlog driven Rig Technology segment, continued to grow nicely up 5% sequentially with again exceptional execution at strong flow-throughs. But our rig count driven Petroleum Services &amp; Supplies and Distribution Services segments declined sharply. As the industry shared an average of 700 operating rigs from the fourth quarter levels down about 21% worldwide. Overall, revenues declined 9% at 48% decrementals from Q4 to Q1.</p>
          <p>Year-over-year pro forma comparisons were better. Consolidated revenues increased 10% at 17% operating leverage, driving an 8% improvement in operating profit. On a GAAP basis, NOV's quarterly earnings increased $0.02 per diluted share from the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Lately, we've heard others talk of a Q2 bottoming in North American rig counts, referencing incrementally less terrible news as marking a second derivative inflection point, signaling that we are near the bottom, but in our candor we do not know, what we do know is that a recovery, a return to prosperity is never a question of if, but when. We do know that our recoveries on the horizon, perhaps as early as late this year, but we don't know when it will happen.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, our customers were suffering and industry is undergoing an extraordinarily breathtaking unwind of a steady five-year build up in activity. It's a cyclical business that can bite, and right now it's biting hard. But it never bites forever.</p>
          <p>Volume declines and ferocious price pressure are evident in our results in the first quarter. And unfortunately, we see more of the same continuing into Q2, even if activity rebounds in the third quarter, we will likely continue to see a lot of pressure on our margins, as contracts roll-off and as we re-price to lower spot pricing typically 10 to 30% lower than last year.</p>
          <p>2009 will continue to be very challenging. We're just glad that it's almost one-third over already. Operating profit of $720 million declined 18% sequentially during the first quarter, excluding Q4 transaction charges, but improved 8% year-over-year as compared to the pro forma first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Operating margin was 20.7% compared to 23% in the fourth quarter and 21% in the pro forma first quarter of 2008. Operating flow-through or leverage was 48% sequentially and 17% year-over-year. The sharp decrementals on the revenue declines from Q4 result from a combination of volume declines which typically run about 30% for Petroleum Services &amp; Supplies and 10% for Distribution, coupled with pricing pressure.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, cost reductions in such a downward vortex simply can't keep-up fast enough to sustain margins. But nevertheless, future periods will benefit from cost reduction measures we're taking. Our operations are responding appropriately and resolutely, tackling the difficult task of reducing cost and infrastructure with prudence and urgency.</p>
          <p>Overall, we recorded expenses for salaries, wages, overtime, contract labor, travel and entertainment and outside services that were down by $66 million from the fourth quarter to the first quarter due to initiatives executed by our operations since late last year.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we are currently offering enhanced retirement benefits under a voluntary program to our long tenured employees. Expect to record a charge in the second quarter related to this program. The size of the charge in the impact on our P&amp;L will not be known until we determine how many employees accept our offer, and we will report the results to you in our next earnings release. Importantly, we are reducing cost prudently and thoughtfully with a view towards maintaining flexibility to ensure we can continue to service our customers well.</p>
          <p>In the cyclical world of oilfield services, you seem to always be driving your business one direction or the other, you're either trying to grow like crazy to meet sharply rising demands at your customers during periods of growth or you're too big and urgently trying to cut costs as rigs are being laid down.</p>
          <p>Driving infrastructure and associated cost up urgently and down urgently as the market dictates are necessary survival skills in this industry. Our team has shown amazing resourcefulness through the expansion cycle of 2004 to 2008, growing production five, six and seven full through many of our products. But in late 2008, we shifted gears and moved crisply to the far less fun task of adjusting cost down to a far more subdued marketplace.</p>
          <p>Pete, Loren and I have an abundance of confidence and the capabilities of the professional men and women of NOV, who manage our businesses in both arenas. They know what to do in both arenas.</p>
          <p>As a result, National Oilwell Varco will continue to skillfully navigate wherever obstacles the market deals with us, and emerge stronger and better position strategically when the inevitable upturn arise; and it will arrive.</p>
          <p>The world's industrial base is critically dependent on the precious commodities of oil and gas. Because of this, we take the long view. This downturn is all about opportunity. It liberates us to unleash initiatives and big-bold news that simply are not possible when our factories and operations are running 24/7.</p>
          <p>The prosperity of the last few years narrowed our focus on getting more products out the door, which necessarily directs management attention to the short-term task of pushing out the last marginal product. A slowdown with the slack resources and lower utilization it brings actually liberates us to think about to plan; to execute broader initiatives like shifting again production footprint to improve our overall cost structure.</p>
          <p>In concrete terms, this means we expect to use this newly found flexibility to reset our manufacturing footprint to drive production to lower cost areas and to redirect outsourced production with marginal vendors back into our own facilities and we can do this at a time when it's not disrupted to our customers.</p>
          <p>NOV will invest for the future. We continue to train our people to prepare for the upturn. We will step up efforts to push out QRM, cellular and lean manufacturing techniques through our operation. We will find and execute attractive acquisitions, all to better position us to take care of our customers.</p>
          <p>NOV is built for all kinds of weather. We carry into this downturn a rock solid balance sheet, by design, which boasts $2.2 billion in cash and less than $900 million in debt, all with very long tenure. Our $2 billion revolving line of credit is un-drawn and carries a very attractive interest rate. Our diverse mix of early cycle and late cycle oilfield businesses smooths earnings and cash flows through the natural cyclicality of the oilfield.</p>
          <p>Q1 saw the company grow cash by nearly $700 million. Since, March 31, we have put over $300 million of this to work in exciting new acquisitions, and we hope to invest nearly $100 million more in another acquisition in the next few weeks. The financial design of NOV enables us to act on the extraordinary opportunities, both internal and external, which this downturn will bring.</p>
          <p>Demand for new drilling equipment slowed sharply in Q1, as we recorded net new orders of only $240 million, down two-thirds from 724 million booked in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Gross orders were $272 million, and cancellations, about which I'll provide additional color in just a moment, were $32 million. Production out of backlog was excellent at 1.7 billion, up 15% sequentially as our Rig Technology group continued to deliver excellent equipment on time and on budget. We delivered ten offshore rigs this quarter, bringing our total to 54 so far this cycle.</p>
          <p>Below 14% book-to-bill ratio in Q1 caused backlog to fall 13% sequentially to $9.6 billion. We expect revenue out of backlog to start trending down in Q2 and to be about $3.8 billion through the remainder of 2009, bringing the year's total to about 5.5 billion. In 2010, we expect $4.7 billion, and in 2011 we see about $1.1 billion, all based on projects on the books at March 31, 2009.</p>
          <p>We also entered this downturn with unprecedented visibility and an awful lot of work to do. The quality, if not the size of our backlog, continues to hold up reasonably well, despite duress in the financial markets. The $32 million we removed from our backlog was predominantly cold tubing and pressure pumping equipment ordered by North American customers. Last quarter we noted that we considered about $364 million of our backlog to be at risk. We now see this to be about $380 million, up slightly from last quarter. We continue to negotiate with these more troubled customers to arrange for the sale of these projects to others, or otherwise find a solution that will permit them to move forward. We've been paid $93 million in cash on these, but have recognized only about $41 million in revenue against these orders.</p>
          <p>Despite price concessions, not many drillers were buying new equipment in the first quarter. Choosing instead the defer purchases of bread and butter capital units and spares, and cannibalizing equipment from idle rigs wherever possible. So suffice to say the headwinds we face are a little more stout than they appeared last quarter. This is evident in our non-backlog revenue for Rig Technology, down 18% sequentially, and in the expendables we make and sell in Petroleum Services &amp; Supplies, and Distribution Services.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, we expect orders for Rig Technology to improve as the year unfolds. As we stated last quarter, much of this depends on Petrobras executing its reported plans. We continue to work with drilling contractors, who are targeting the deepwater Brazil market to secure financing for new floaters through government trade agencies, and progress has been slow but steady. We also continue to bid a variety of land rig projects into Latin America and the Middle East, and for some of the IPM projects that are being tendered. Last call, we talked about the possibility of achieving 3 to $4 billion in orders in 2009, and we still believe this is achievable with a little luck.</p>
          <p>While we know orders will be challenging in the short run, we also know that rust never sleeps and that the task of retooling the world's fleet of rigs is slowly, quietly rising in urgency. There are billions of barrels to be found and produced in deepwater basins, which will drive the fortunes of the world's major oil companies in the coming decades. When the economic tsunami subsides, NOV will stand ready to resume our critical mission, with a core team of talented, dedicated professionals up to the challenge.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to our segment operating results. Rig Technology posted an exceptionally strong first quarter generating $2.2 billion in revenue and $606 million in operating profit in the first quarter, yielding an operating margin of 27.6%.</p>
          <p>Sequentially 5% higher revenue was due to higher shipments out of backlog up 15%, offset by lower non-backlog revenue, down 18% mostly due to North America land drillers and pressure pumping &#x2013; pressure pumpers shutting off purchases of both capital items and spares. Compared to the first quarter of 2008, revenues improved 37% and margins increased 230 basis points.</p>
          <p>Operating profit flow-through was 44% sequentially and 34% year-over-year. Most regions are seeing lower interest in new rigs but many previously active projects in Russia, the North Sea and the Far East being tabled pending economic clarity. However, we continue to work projects throughout Latin America and the Middle East, albeit at a major pace than before.</p>
          <p>Demand for equipment across North America, both drilling and completion units has dropped about zero, despite price concessions. But we continue to see relatively stable demand for wireline units and certain other well servicing equipment destined for international locations.</p>
          <p>Commissioning activity remains very robust with several hundred employees engaged in installation and completion operations on 30 rigs and 13 shipyards around the world. This activity is expected to continue to grow through the year as we ready the rigs we are building for spud.</p>
          <p>Operationally, we are taking this opportunity to reset our manufacturing footprint to move outsource production back into our plans and to move products to lower cost operations. The downturn will let us catch our breath and tackle initiatives that simply weren't possible over the past few years.</p>
          <p>For instance, we are now moving much of our spending for gears from outside suppliers into a business we acquired a couple of years ago, which until now was too busy to handle all our needs. The 529 plant has been reorganized to enhance flows and efficiency and we are driving still more standardization into mud pumps and SCR houses through our IQ2 process to reduce manufacturing cost.</p>
          <p>We've consolidated certain well stimulation equipment manufacturing operations in the mid-continent. And we also continued to develop new product offerings for our market. Like, our new Drake Rig design, which specifically target shale plays like the Marcellus. We're maneuvering rigs around tight turns, under low bridges and on to very small drill pads is challenging. First version of this rig is expected to spud its first well in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>We're seeing rising increase from a broad spectrum of customers for a new drilling, instrumentation and data capture products, which optimize drilling operations. As market leader, NOV understands well its responsibility to remain at the forefront of drilling technologies and techniques. And we have for years honored our commitment to the industry to steadily invest in new and better technology for our customers, despite business cyclicality that is sometimes gut-wrenching.</p>
          <p>Looking into the second quarter, we expect to see Rig Technology revenues dropped in a high single-digit range and high decrementals as pricing and volume pressures begin to mount. We nevertheless expect margins though to remain in the mid 20s through the year, owing to the strength of our backlog for this group.</p>
          <p>Our Petroleum Services &amp; Supplies segment, posted revenues of one billion in the first quarter, down 27% from record Q4 sales of 1.4 billion. Operating profit was $164 million and operating margins dropped to 16.2%.</p>
          <p>Sequential leverage or flow-through was 47% owing to a one-two gut punch of price and volume declines. Compared to the first quarter of 2008, revenues felt 23% as 50% decrementals.</p>
          <p>Substantially, all of our product lines posted double-digit sequential declines with the North American rig count and free fall, and pressure in a number of international locations as well. Notably the North Sea, Venezuela, Russia and China.</p>
          <p>Drill pipe was our hardest hit product, as drillers pull strings off of idle rigs to meet their dwindling operating needs. Drill pipe volumes dropped sharply after a record fourth quarter and pricing has suffered to particularly in lower end commodity pipe.</p>
          <p>Premium pipe demand for deepwater, especially strings is holding out comparatively better, but it is also under some pressure. Due to a schedule mill shutdown in our Voest-Alpine plant, we purchased higher price green tubes from third-party suppliers late last year, which continue to run through production, expect some relief on the cost side of this business in the second half, as lower cost green tubes begin to run through our P&amp;L, as we temporarily idle some well lines.</p>
          <p>Our inspection business saw a sharp decline in pipe-processing operations, as mills shutdown to wrestle with growing OCTG inventory gluts. Our coating plant efficiencies are beginning to suffer from lower volumes, shorter runs and more plan changeovers.</p>
          <p>Sales of downhole tools and bits also fell sharply as rigs win idle in the first quarter, which is opening up the possibility closure integration between these products to improve efficiencies and sales coverage. And we continue to move forward steadily with efforts to upgrade our motor and jar rental fleets with newer high performance designs.</p>
          <p>Also, within Petroleum Services &amp; Supplies, we're optimistic that we will be able to close our previously announced IntelliServ joint venture with Schlumberger this quarter, pending regulatory clearance.</p>
          <p>Last quarter, we were hopeful we find a level of stability following the Q1 drop in Petroleum Services &amp; Supplies overall. But it appears to us now that revenues and margins will continue to decline through the second quarter and a certain international projects were getting off to a slow start and as pricing pressure has been much greater than expected.</p>
          <p>Overall, for Petroleum Services &amp; Supplies, we expect low double-digit sequential declines in revenue at decrementals in the 40 to 50% range in Q2.</p>
          <p>Distribution Services was also hit hard by the downturn in rig count, mostly in North America. Both the U.S. and Canada posted large revenue declines, but these were partly offset by significant growth in international sales, where we have methodically invested over the past few years, which came in a good incrementals.</p>
          <p>Our rig store concept, which we've discussed on prior calls, appears to be gaining momentum. Another bright spot is, in this business is our mono business which despite lower sequential revenues posted record margins in Q1, owing the manufacturing efficiency initiatives and high demand for artificial lift products into Latin America. Marriage of this group with our extensive distribution store network, expanding over 200 stores is working very well and is expected to provide additional growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>Revenues for the Distribution Services group were $408 million, down 16% from the fourth quarter, but up 11% from the prior year. Operating profit was $25 million and operating margin was 6.1% down 280 basis points from Q4's record. Operating profit flow-through was 24% much higher than normal for this business due to severe price pressure across the board.</p>
          <p>Looking forward into the second quarter, we expect Distributions Services revenues to decline somewhere in the mid-teens range and decrementals in the 15% range. Higher than a long run 10% flow-through level due to continued price pressure.</p>
          <p>Turning back to National Oilwell's consolidated first quarter income statement, SG&amp;A declined $13 million sequentially as decreases in salaries and wages; D&amp;A and other cost were partly offset by higher bad debt accruals and legal expenses in the quarter. SG&amp;A was 9.2% of revenue in Q1 compared to 8.7% last quarter.</p>
          <p>Equity income from our unconsolidated joint venture with Voest-Alpine grew $12 million sequentially due to higher OCTG sales and a stronger dollar. We expect this to fall in Q2 due to the softening pipe market.</p>
          <p>Other expense on our income statements swung from a $9 million credit in Q4 to $36 million debit in Q1, due to a $26 million FX charge in the first quarter. First quarter FX charge was mostly due to adjustments made to our hedging positions in Norway. While our largest ledger is U.S. dollar functional, but where we incur substantial periodic cost in a region krona and euros, which we hedge back to our functional currency on a forecasted basis.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, we revised our forecast non-functional currency expenses downward and debit our resulting over hedge position. This was an exceptionally large FX impact in the quarter that we don't expect to repeat, but given our extensive international operations, we will always have some level of foreign currency exchange volatility impacting our income statement.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter income statement have benefited from the net FX gains, giving rise to the sequential swing. Additionally, we incurred higher bank fees associated mostly with letters of credit, we issue against large down payments and progress billings from our customers which also adversely affected the other expense line in our income statement.</p>
          <p>Unallocated expenses and eliminations on our supplemental segment schedule, which is pro forma for the Grant Prideco acquisition for all periods were $75 million in the first quarter, up $11 million due to higher legal expenses and higher payroll taxes on Q1 incentive compensation, partly offset by savings in other areas.</p>
          <p>In particular, legal expenses were up as we charged-off cost associated with M&amp;A activity, following our adoption of FAS 141R, that would previously being capitalized. Tax rate was 32.5% for the quarter and we continue to expect 2009 to remain in that range.</p>
          <p>Depreciation and amortization was $116 million in the first quarter. CapEx was $79 million. We expect 2009 CapEx to be in the $350 million range. EBITDA was $827 million in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>On March 31, 2009 balance sheet employed working capital, excluding cash and debt of $2.2 billion down about $300 million from Q4 and equaling 16% of annualized revenue consistent with recent prior quarters.</p>
          <p>We saw some deterioration in collections in certain areas in the quarter. So we're aggressively pursuing collection efforts in vigilant for any potential customer payment problems. But overall DSOs remain stable.</p>
          <p>Customer financing on projects in the form of prepayments and billings in excess of cost, less cost and excess of billings was $2.1 billion at March 31, down slightly from the prior quarter due to the high level of revenue out of backlog.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $785 million unless Q4 CapEx of 79 million yielded free cash flow for the quarter of $706 million.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn it back to Pete.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Clay. What I'd like to do at this point is just talk a little bit about our operations and also give you kind of a quick overview of what we're seeing around the world. There's some basic themes, I'm going to reiterate a few of the things that Clay has already mentioned basically when you talk about our Distribution and our Petroleum Services &amp; Supplies business. A big part of what we're doing today is we're going to be improving the efficiencies throughout the organization. We're going to be doing a lot of in-sourcing. We are starting to see raw material reductions. We're starting to see some things come across the board.</p>
          <p>On steel I think will be positive. We're trying to parlay those to our advantage as we move forward. And you'll also see continued international expansion bias in these areas.</p>
          <p>While the international market is a little softer, it's still not anywhere near soft as what you see in North America. We're also going to continue to rifle shot the shale plays. And I think as you look around the United States, the Haynesville and the Marcellus, we'll still be able to continue to pickup some steam. We also think you're going to see some international shale plays. And as all shale plays manifest themselves, we want to be able to take advantage and move some of our operations into those arenas.</p>
          <p>Currently in the Distribution business, when you take a look at the margins, we're still able to achieve in a down market. We're very pleased with that and I think our rig store concept is continuing to gain a lot of momentum, especially when you see many of the new rigs that are coming out.</p>
          <p>And our Petroleum Services &amp; Supplies business, we continue to integrate very effectively the things that we've done with the Grant Prideco acquisition, and our downhole tools today. We're able to offer the complete array of bottom-hole assembly from the bit, from the Andergauge items that were brought in through Grant Prideco, to the downhole tools that we already had in the legacy National Oilwell Varco.</p>
          <p>We think being able to cut &#x2013; put these products together really has a very compelling value, a story to our customers and we're excited about the opportunities that are rising. Also because of all the new rigs that we built, as you take a look at the deepwater, you're starting to see many of these rigs coming in the Gulf of Mexico, I think we're going to be able to parlay as these rigs run much more of our PS&amp;S business into expanded business out there.</p>
          <p>Our Tuboscope operation continues to work very well and being able to integrate the lifecycle management of drill pipe, we've got a lot of interesting things on the table like RFID chips. They're going to be able to monitor a lot of what we do. So we feel very, very good about the positioning that we've been able to do with these and distinguishing ourselves in the future.</p>
          <p>Also, for any employees that might be listening in, I'd like to welcome all the am-sock folks who are now part of the PS&amp;S group, predominantly out of Newcastle in England, but also all over the world. We're glad to have you as part of National Oilwell Varco, and we think you'll be excited about the things that we're doing.</p>
          <p>Now, on our drilling side of the business, and I'd like to talk a little bit again about the same sort of themes. And today, what we're really talking about &#x2013; continually there'll be new rigs built. One of the things, it looks like we just about signed up the drill ship, we've kind of hope to have it in the first quarter but these things move a little bit slower today because of financing, but we'll probably have it all done by the end of the month. That would have substantially increased the 250 we talked about earlier.</p>
          <p>But again, it's all a question of timing, and we feel very positive that things going to happen and I'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment when I go around the world.</p>
          <p>But, what we're going to be seeing on that much more in the Rig Technology group, a lot more components, sales, a lot more refurbishment as opposed to new rig type sales, a lot of repair and maintenance, and again we're going to be doing a lot of the same things I talked about earlier on in-sourcing, efficiency initiatives, cost reduction and we're also looking at the lot of the products that we haven't looked at quite as closely in the past which would be FPSOs and well an intervention type vessels.</p>
          <p>And also in the Rig Technology group, we have another new addition and that's the ASEP acquisition that we made in Holland, and for those ASEP folks that are listening in, we'd like to welcome you to the National Oilwell Varco family.</p>
          <p>Now, let me real quickly just kind of give you a kind of tour of the world, and interestingly enough I'll start in Brazil.</p>
          <p>That clearly is going to be the area where we're most excited about. The Brazilians continue to push forward on the deepwater play, we're positioned very well to take advantage of that. We have great relationships with all of the predominant contractors down there. They also are working very closely with many of the top shipyards in the world, Samsung, Hyundai, Daewoo folks that we have great relationships with and we've built a lot of rigs wells.</p>
          <p>So, we're excited, we believe that you're going to continue to see the Brazilians push forward on many of the initiatives that they have. I think that their stimulus packages down there are going to work very effectively, and I think they're going to work to the advantage of us as we push through the year.</p>
          <p>So, as you look at if what's going on, this particular quarter, the order intake wasn't quite what we had anticipated. However, we also have come through probably historically one of the toughest periods. And quite frankly, the market was almost paralyzed in December and January.</p>
          <p>We're starting to see that free up sum and we're got to be optimistic about what we're seeing as we push forward, but Brazil is going to be a large part of that. Also throughout Latin America, I think in other spot, they were very encouraged by as Mexico.</p>
          <p>We're encouraged there also because of the IPMs where some of our good customers like Schlumberger and Weatherford that are getting them. But also because we believe that the Pemex will actually buy new rigs to participate in that themselves. So we think Mexico is going to be very positive for everyone of the business lines that we have in the &#x2013; throughout National Oilwell Varco.</p>
          <p>Other parts, I think Argentina will show a little bit more vibrancy as the year moves on. And I think Latin America in general will be a good spot.</p>
          <p>Now, throughout the rest of the world, it's kind of interesting right now. It's clearly slowed up a lot, but in the parlays of Washington, and many parts of the rest of the world, there are lot of shovel-ready projects.</p>
          <p>Places like Russia right now, they're having issues but I think that you'll see a pretty big &#x2013; pretty quick bust out of that. And given the way I think, the price Wal-Mart go, I think the Russians have many, many shovel-ready projects to go.</p>
          <p>Many of the things that we've talked about are on hold, it takes a very quickly &#x2013; can they bring them off a hold. So, in the long-term, we're still very excited about Russia, and the Middle East, I think there are some nice places still going on Kuwait, continues to very aggressively go after some rigs. I think you'll see some things in Iraq, which should be very positive. And then in Northern Africa, Egypt really has to slowdown much at all; Algeria has put a few projects on hold, but again I think they have a lot of shovel-ready projects that are going to be ready to go, and we're positioned to be able to take advantage of those. So, we're got to be optimistic again that the Middle-East will be a nice area.</p>
          <p>In China, we're starting to see a few of the fruits of the stimulus package there. I think that what you're going to see is the Chinese will do some things with our infrastructure that are going to increase their demand for oil, which overall, I think for the economy in general, for the oil business in general is going to be a positive development. We continue to have a lot of different operations in China. We're very excited about some of the projects as we push into late '09 and earlier '10 as we get towards the end of the year.</p>
          <p>So I think throughout the world, the real issue is going to be shovel-ready. It's going to be projects, that when they're ready to go, we have to be on the doorstep to be able to take advantage of them and we feel very good about that.</p>
          <p>The key, again, when we take a look at backlog, is really going to be Brazil, but we feel very positive that the things that the Brazilians are talking about, in fact, are going to come to pass.</p>
          <p>So that's kind of a quick overview; it gives you a kind of an idea of what it is that we're doing, and we feel very comfortable with our backlog at this point, as Clay has mentioned. Predominantly it's an international and an offshore backlog and we think as we go through the year, you'll continue to see additions to the backlog, not quite to the $2 billion levels that we've seen in the past for quarter, but still it's going be positive and it's going to get good transparency and visibility as we look out at into the future.</p>
          <p>So with that, David, I'd like to turn it over to you and ask if any of our listeners have any questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Mr. Geoff Kieburtz, please respond with your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Geoff Kieburtz of Weeden. Pete, can you elaborate a little bit on what kind of luck's required to get you to, say 3.5 billion of orders this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think when we talk about luck, Geoff. What we're really talking about is the viability of the financial community. I think some of the things &#x2013; and also it's one of timing. What you have today in this environment is probably a more protracted negotiation timeframe. I mentioned earlier the drill ship that we'll sign up here imminently that we thought we'd get in the first quarter. A year ago, we would have hit through that pretty quickly, but because of the protracted timeframe, making sure that everybody has got financing, making sure that we in turn get our down payment in-house before we put anything into the backlog.</p>
          <p>Those timing issues require a little bit of luck just on the cut off dates, if you will. We cut off everything on the 31st March, and if something moves into the 2nd or 3rd of April then it says, well, gosh, we didn't get it in the first quarter it moves into the second quarter. And I think also it means that there has to be a little bit of financial viability out there and I think some of the governments are going to have to step up to the play with some of the assurances that they'll &#x2013; like GIEC in Norway and some of the other places that they will ensure and guarantee some of the financing that's there.</p>
          <p>So that's really the type of luck. We don't think it's luck that is unprecedented; it's just going to be moving a little bit more quickly than it appears it is right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And there is less urgency wrapped around the process, right now too, Geoff. Part of that is, as Pete just mentioned, a lot of our customers are pursuing government back financing on these projects, and the agencies that he just referenced require a lot of documentation and things just tend to move a little more slowly. So that &#x2013; it's just grinding at a more methodical pace than it was last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You &#x2013; I think, you've mentioned that you've been working particularly with the backlog, the customers that represent the backlog at risk; you've been working with them to help arrange financing and help them work through their problems. In that experience, have you seen things getting better or is the system still kind of gummed up here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Geoff, I would say we're seeing it getting a little better. I think that &#x2013; I think there is a little bit more money that's available to folks today. I mean, I think you know it just from what you look at in the financial community. If you tried to finance anything in December or January you were probably out of luck, but today you're starting to see a few things free up. And so I think that I would say clearly from late December, January to today things have improved. And I think the psychology's improved and I also think the financial markets have improved a little.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the backlog that's at risk now, I guess you said $380 million. Can you characterize the composition of that in terms of the way you've talked about backlogs in the international, domestic, land, offshore or possibly not even in drilling equipment itself?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, predominantly offshore rigs, there's a handful of jack-ups in there, one floater...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...and then kind of a variety of various ordinance for people that were buying components to go into mostly into land rigs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And last question, are you expecting working capital to be a positive or negative contributor to cash flow this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it'll continue to be a positive &#x2013; it was in the first quarter. And I think as &#x2013; I just guided down on revenue across all three segments, I think it's going to continue to move down through the &#x2013; as the year develops. One of the challenges, we have in the short run is, we had such long lead times in lot of the components that we buy, a number of our businesses had to place orders kind of out in the future. So, we still had some raw materials and things coming in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>So, the inventory ended up being roughly &#x2013; I think it was up just slightly but call it flat, and the businesses were trended up with generally because purchase orders place sometime ago, that were still coming in. So, I think those kind of get out of the woods, I think we certainly slowdown buying a lot on the inventory front. And I think it'll go down a little bit more in Q2.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. And Mr. Jeff Spittel. Please state your company name and followed by your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Jeff Spittel of Natexis Bleichroeder. Good morning, guys. First question just &#x2013; appreciate the comments about Brazil. If you could talk, I guess a little bit more we started to hear at Petrobras and in the press a little bit about additional orders for floaters. I appreciate that things are a little bit bogged down in terms of financing for that initial wave of 12, but could you give us a general sense, I guess in terms of timing and what the outlook is, for the plants behind that initial package of 12 floaters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. I think the initial package of 12, Jeff continues to move forward. There's some issues there, I think debt financing and things like that. But, I would &#x2013; as I look at that today I would say probably the vast majority of those will come to fruition here at some point in time in the near future. The second part of that of course is what Petrobras themselves to put out which is a May tender, that's going to be for another grouping of rigs and we think that a lot of those rigs will have some Brazilian content and other things, but they're also working very closely with a lot of the worldwide shipyards which I mentioned earlier in the comments to kind of help them work through some of those issues.</p>
          <p>So we believe those things are in fact going to come to pass too. I mean, what it really looks like is that the Brazilian government understands the importance of Petrobras to their basic financial security within the country, and I think you'll see them step-up to the play, and I do believe most of the things that Petrobras wants to do, will in fact come to pass.</p>
          <p>Now having said that, there is also a question of timing. And when you're dealing with the lot of &#x2013; especially a lot of the NOCs, you're dealing with little bit more bureaucracy, things take a little bit longer. And so we're very comfortable and confident that things are going to occur, I'm not as confident on the exact timing. But I think things are pretty positive in that arena.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As a reminder too, Jeff we announced we won three of the 12 backlog in Q3 of last year and have a couple others that we're still working hard with those customers to try to get financing on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then if we could switch gears over to land market, principally in North America. Could you talk about, people are obviously going to be cannibalizing drill piping consumables, as the rig count has continued to fall through Q2 here.</p>
          <p>Could you talk about comparing that process versus some of the prior downturns, and what effect the proliferation of the shale plays has had on that process this time, if it's different or if it's not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's a tried and true practice. When the business cycle is down, our customers are pretty energetic about pulling consumables and expendables off of rigs that go idle. It's just not drill pipes, it's mud pump liners and centrifugal pumps, and it's a whole myriad of things. So we've kind of seen it across our business, I guess as you pointed out the difference this time, is there is a lot more horizontal drilling going on, and so we think that makes the average rig running a little more drill pipe consumptive because it now will tend to be drilling a horizontal well which burns through drill pipe faster.</p>
          <p>Interestingly, here in the last quarter or two, we've seen non-vertical drilling, directional plus horizontal, rise above the 50% mark in the U.S. markets now about 60%. The horizontal wells &#x2013; horizontal rigs are down only about 37%, whereas vertical rigs are down more like 60%. And so it's evident that the economics of these plays, the economics of drilling horizontal &#x2013; horizontally appear to be surviving the economic stress a lot better and so &#x2013; in spite of all that, when the rig count plummets 51% from peak to where we are now, demand from drill pipe has gone down, and we certainly felt that in our business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. Mr. Bill Herbert, please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, guys.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Pete, getting back to the Q1 orders and attempting to bridge that with a guidance, and let's just stick with the $3 billion kind of lower end of the range. So, if the math is right here, you're going to have to average about $900 million a quarter going forward in order to meet the lower end of that range.</p>
          <p>Walk me through, if you will, how much of that is contingent on Petrobras, and what is non-Petrobras related opportunities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, Bill, I won't get too specific in the sense of giving you numbers...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...but clearly, we would expect a portion of that, and a good portion of that, to be the deepwater rigs that would come out of Petrobras. And as you take a look &#x2013; first off, 900 million a quarter is absolutely right mathematically. That's just not the way it always happens.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you could have 500 million a quarter to 1.4 billion a quarter, something like that. But if you take a look at some of these Petrobras rigs, you're talking, let's say, roughly speaking, 2 to $250 million per, and so, as we look at a few of those, you can kind of do the math and think, well, if you picked up four or five of those, what that would mean for you. There is still a lot of land business that I mentioned earlier in the Middle-East.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Some of those land rigs there are much greater than you'd have. For instance, you might sell a rig in the United States for 13 million, but by the time you do the things that you need to do for desert worthy rigs or even north-sloped type rigs. You're up to 30 to $35 million.</p>
          <p>And also it's not just Petrobras that's looking at rigs. We mentioned Petrobras simply because that's the one that's out there, and most of our shareholders are pretty cognizant of what's going on there, but there will be others that will in fact order some new rigs, be they floaters, submersibles drill ships, and/or I think some jack-ups, believe it or not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the fact of a matter is there's still a lot of stuff that's out there that we're working on. When you look at the tender offers that we have today, it's still pretty substantial, it's not &#x2013; our folks are working very, very hard and diligently, getting a lot of quotations and bids out there. I think the reality of it just becomes one of timing. So, we're not despondent at all about where this is going, and I think the nice thing is that with a $9 billion &#x2013; $9.6 billion backlog that we have today, we can withstand a quarter like we just had and not really miss a beat in what we're doing in our Rig Technology group. And when orders start coming in, I think you'll see the &#x2013; as the rig count goes down, then at some point you'll start to see the build of a one-to-one book-to-bill ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I'm not mistaken, when you provided that guidance, you always had envisioned a relatively backend weighted affair in order to hit that number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, if that drillship had in fact landed in Q1, you probably would have been tracking relatively closely to your original expectations, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, much more close to that. That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and is the drillship, is that a Petrobras-related opportunity or is it something else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a Petrobras related opportunity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just generally speaking, you've recently consummated a couple of acquisitions. I think you've been amongst the most sort of demonstrative about putting your balance sheet to work and investing in this part of the cycle, which is absolutely the right thing to do. I'm just curious, you mentioned a subsequent $100 million opportunity that you're about to close on. But paint for me, if you will, the landscape of opportunity, that you're looking at above and beyond what you've already done and what you're about to do?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>You bet. First, I'm not going to say anything about the &#x2013; other than I've already said about the upcoming transaction because it hasn't happened yet. But secondly, beyond that, we have another half dozen or so fairly well-developed opportunities that we're considering, mostly international, mostly private, that aggregate to be another couple hundred million dollars, and then beyond that we've got some larger opportunities that typically kind of move through our process a little more slowly, a little more closely negotiated, and economically, the larger the deal, generally, the less compelling the economics.</p>

          <p>Right.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not surprisingly. But &#x2013; and I would stress that this isn't atypical. We've ramped up our efforts to make acquisitions as the business started cycling down. We took steps in October, November last year to add some staff in this area and some resources in this area, and really send our folks on the road to find more things. And so we always, as you know, always have a pretty good backlog of acquisition opportunities that we're looking at but we very consciously tried to step that up. So, where we are now in the process is starting to see they're kind of &#x2013; maybe hopefully the front-end of this will come through. I'll stress, as I always do, none of these transactions are ever closed until they're closed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have things fall apart in the 11th hour sometimes. But we really try to approach this statistically, get a lot of conversations going, and make informed decisions about that range &#x2013; that opportunity set, based upon a statistically meaningful sample size. So, that's kind of what we're seeing out there, and finally, Bill, let me &#x2013; I'll wrap up my answer by telling you that we're really not seeing very many distressed opportunities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There maybe a perception out there that a lot of people are suffering. Generally, a lot of folks in oilfield services learned a long time ago not to push their balance sheets too far. So I think a lot of, particularly private companies, entered this downturn with pretty strong balance sheets. They're not being pushed on by their banks. And generally, the folks we're talking to view the sale of their business really as sort of the handoff of that business to NOV, so that we can take it to the next level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so let me &#x2013; just to wrap up, I mean the punchline for me, Pete, what I sort of derived from our dialogue here, is that you had a meaningful opportunity that you felt was going to close in the first quarter, in terms of an order slipped into the second quarter. But be that as it may, your order evolution is pretty much tracking as you thought when you formulated a guidance in the first place, I mean, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We wouldn't &#x2013; we're still pretty consistent with that right now, Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. It's Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Hey, Brad.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. I guess I'll stick with the order discussion as well, please. Although I think Bill has just tried to sort of put it into some perspective, but &#x2013; so is the message &#x2013; and then we'll move on &#x2013; is the message that it's not really a little bit of luck, but it's the same guidance as what you have been trying to illustrate all year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Let me be clear, we need our luck to improve over what we've had in the last couple of quarters. [laughter] With a rig count pulling at 51%, we don't really view ourselves as being particularly &#x2013; as having good luck here lately so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, right. That makes sense. I've gotten a sense that up until fairly recently there was a little bit more conviction than what we heard in your prepared remarks and so I'm just trying to feel that out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't parse the words too much. I mean, again, we like what we see into the future. I think the &#x2013; when we talk about luck, luck is probably much more of a timing issue as opposed to we know there is a lot of things that are going to be done, but it really is a question of just timing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well that's helpful. I'm glad &#x2013; wait -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. Go ahead Brad.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe we're clear again. Okay, a couple of elements within that, though, please, just to help us understand it. If I understood it right maybe half of that outlook came from the upgrading refurbishment process perhaps by existing contract drillers taking advantage of a little bit of down time. There was obviously some element of that not happening in the first quarter, maybe that's not so surprising. But what's the visibility on that part of your order book?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; actually, Brad, it would be less than half. I mean we need to have some big offshore rigs come our way to hit the guidance. But in answer to your question, yeah, we saw kind of a first quarter paralysis that we think is &#x2013; and a cannibalization process going on, but that only lasts for so long, and Pete's comments earlier were referencing the fact that these guys are going to have to get back to buying. You're going to have rigs come into the shipyard and take advantage of that downturn, and get &#x2013; they're going to refurbish equipment and buy spares and upgrade components during that window.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very good. Just a couple more for me, if I can squeeze it in, and I apologize, I know it's a lot. The &#x2013; what implication does it have for you if Petrobras, in fact, with the 28 upcoming rigs, kind of mandates, in some sense, I'm curious for your thoughts on this, but mandates that it is sort of local production driven, if you will, local manufacturing? Does it take away from some of the opportunities for you, or is it not affect your outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It really doesn't affect us too much at all. I think when you talk about the local content of that, Brad, what you're really talking about are the shipyards and hulls, and it's not dissimilar to what you see, if when we go to Korea today, you have the Koreans build the hulls, be it a drill ship or a semi-submersible, and we put on the drilling package. And you'll see the same sort of thing that would happen in Brazil. I think it's more driven around being able to build the hulls, put those down there, and then have folks like us come in and be able to bring the drilling packages in.</p>
          <p>And we'll do some local content. We've got very extensive operations throughout Brazil in Mackay. As a matter of fact, we just opened a training facility in Rio de Janeiro to be able to train a lot of the people that are on the rigs that we're putting in there. So we'll work very closely with them, but that will not &#x2013; that should not have any negative implication at all for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. And then just lastly, can you &#x2013; and what is still out there as you're trying to push it to the finish line? Are you getting pressure put back as you do lower pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yeah, I mean, heck we get that in the best of times. I mean these are all &#x2013; these are tough negotiations all the time, and I've been in the business for 30 years and never have I had anybody just take the price I gave them without negotiating. So I would expect that we'll continue to see fierce negotiations all the time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Presumably those negotiations become a little bit more relevant in the current environment. Are you seeing &#x2013; and is it fair to assume that we start to &#x2013; you mentioned 2 to 250, it was 250 to 3; is that some indication of perhaps where pricing kind of needs to go to help push some of these projects along?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's probably more of a function of FX changes and raw material changes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>Morning, Pete and Clay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Pete, Weatherford and Schlumberger are good customers of yours. If they were to do a lot of the IPM work in Iraq, in your opinion, would they need a lot of newer rigs, or are older rigs sufficient to do a lot of the field development that will be required there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it'll be a combination, Jim, and it would totally be dependent upon what the particular field was. But I think what we've seen in Iraq today is there are some fields that you can probably use &#x2013; some existing rigs, which I think each one of those companies would be able to come up with. But there's other fields that are going to have a little bit more &#x2013; I think that the requirements are such that you'd probably want to put a new rig that was more fit for purpose in there. So I think it'll be a combination of factors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second question, Pete. Can you give me an update on, let's say, potential project &#x2013; or projects that you're working on now that are not progressing because the customer isn't paying you. Have there been any additional ones since the last quarter, or is it pretty much the same situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jim, the 32 million we relieved out of our backlog were projects we sort of gave up on, and then we had another group of drilling equipment &#x2013; it was loose odds and ends that came into that bucket. So, it went from 364 million at the end of Q4 that we identified at risk, to about 380 million this quarter that we have identified at risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You think those projects, Clay, project or projects that involve new rigs, that certain of those or most of them would be continued by a major oil company, and that they would not be canceled, they would just transfer ownership at a present time to a new more financially strong company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the offshore rigs is &#x2013; has a customer out there, and we're working just try to get that &#x2013; find somebody to go ahead and complete that rig. The others are a little more speculative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Activity in Russia, Pete and Clay, certainly has fallen precipitously here the last six months but one or two companies are now saying that its bottomed and should start trending up, do you see that reflected in your interest in new rigs in your business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably, you know, I've heard and I wouldn't disagree with some of the folks that have said that they think it has bottomed and it's moving up. There is one or two of the more, I think well financed companies there that we continue to have some very fruitful conversations with and I think we'll probably sell some things under this year. I think it's probably going to be more toward the latter part of the year before we see some meaningful improvement there. But as I kind of mentioned earlier, the nice thing about it is we've already had pretty in-depth discussions with a lot of our customers there and much of what's going on there is shovel-ready. It's just a question of, I think, financing, and the price of oil and whether or not the folks want to push forward, but I think when they do decide they want to do it, it will be some something that will happen fairly rapidly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and last question, obviously very close to what's going on in Brazil. Do you think it's possible if the deepwater rig market loosens up that a meaningful portion of Brazil's 42 rigs will be gotten from existing rigs that are already out there but that are idle, I mean a number of new rigs could come down maybe even measurably come down from those 42?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm not too sure on that Jim. I mean I think what you've got right there is there are so many specific items about these rigs that are so much what's the water depth? And I think we have a tendency to look at deep water rigs in kind of a just all in one class, when in fact a lot of them can do things quite differently and I think that the Brazilians are probably pretty intent on pushing ahead with a lot of the stuff that they've got in their plans right now to build. So, while some could be displaced I'm not sure I'd say it'd be meaningful.</p>
