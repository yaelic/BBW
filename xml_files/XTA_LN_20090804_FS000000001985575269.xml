          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Xstrata's Half Year Results for the Six Month Ended 30 June, 2009. I'd also like to welcome those who are attending the presentation via the webcast and there are some who are also attending by telephone.</p>
          <p>Now with me this morning are the other members of Executive Committee who are familiar I think to most, if not all of you. In the front of the room in order is: the CFO, Trevor Reid; Santiago Zaldumbide, Executive Director of Xstrata and Chief Executive of Xstrata Zinc. We then have Peet Nienaber, Chief Executive our Alloys business; Peter Freyberg, Chief Executive of Xstrata Coal; Charlie Sartain, the Chief Executive of Copper; and Ian Pearce, the Chief Executive of our Nickel business. There are two other members of the Executive Committee, Benny Levene, Chief Legal Counsel, and Thras Moraitis, who is the Executive General Manager Strategy and Corporate Affairs, and they're sitting in the audience amongst you.</p>
          <p>2009, as you know, commenced amidst uncharted territory for the global economy, financial markets and the mining industry following the rapid deterioration of the operating environment in the later part of 2008, to say the least. And as last year drew to a close, it was apparent that demand had collapsed and commodity prices were near all-time lows in real terms, so unsurprisingly Xstrata's first half earnings reflect these adverse market conditions.</p>
          <p>Average LME base metal prices fell by up to 57%. And EBITDA was 51% lower at $2.8 billion, despite a strong operating performance across the Group. Higher received thermal and semi-soft coal prices from the contract prices agreed in 2008 offset the full impact of the lower metal prices, I think demonstrating the benefit of a diversified portfolio.</p>
          <p>Pro forma operating profit of $1.7 billion included the negative impact of lower commodity prices, which reduced earnings by over $3.6 billion alone compared to the first half of 2008. Earnings per share reduced to $0.38 compared to $1.66 in the prior period, that number obviously adjusted for the rights issue which we did earlier this year.</p>
          <p>Our business achieved a solid production performance in thermal coal, nickel, zinc, copper, which largely mitigated the effects of lower volumes from the suspension or early closure of unprofitable high-cost operations, as well as reduced ferrochrome, ferronickel and coke and coal production in view of lower demand for these products.</p>
          <p>And by the end of the first quarter, Xstrata had successfully completed a two-for-one rights issue, allowing us to repay some $3.7 billion of debt and providing a robust capital structure to significantly reduce our gearing. Our rights issue was taken up by well over 99% of our shareholders. We have seen the value of the investment increase by 145% in six months from the announcement of the rights issue.</p>
          <p>At my last presentation to the market in January, I set out Xstrata's strategy to secure a robust financial position, accelerate the transformation of the portfolio and maximize cash while retaining the full optionality of our organic growth pipeline. So I'm very pleased to report that barely six months later delivery on these objectives has been quite decisive. The entrepreneurial culture and devolved lean management structure have played, I think, an important role in the speed of our response.</p>
          <p>Operational management are able to take &#x2013; to move nimbly to take and implement tough but timely and necessary decisions for their operations without the burden of head office overhead, centralized processes or head office second-guessing. Driven by an owner-operator culture, managers are incentivized to seek every opportunity, no matter how small, to create value, drive down costs on a continuous basis.</p>
          <p>The rights issue in the first quarter and the refinancing of near-term debt in October 2008 have enabled Xstrata to emerge from the aftermath of one of the world's greatest financial crises with a robust capital structure and a solid platform from which to create further shareholder value. At the end of June gearing had fallen to 28%, retaining Xstrata's investment grade rating. We have no significant refinancing requirements until 2011 and we have ample headroom in existing facilities.</p>
          <p>While continuously reducing operating cost is part of business as usual at Xstrata, the economic downturn enabled us to accelerate the restructuring activities to achieve a step change in operating efficiency, particularly in Nickel and Zinc. Together with a range of efficiency initiatives across the Group, the net impact is a substantial improvement in the overall quality and resilience of Xstrata's portfolio and earnings profile.</p>
          <p>Our business closed or suspended cash-negative operations, replacing lost production with lower-cost supply. In ferrochrome and to a less extent coke and coal, we temporarily suspended production to curtail supply in the face of a collapse in demand from the steel industry. We conserved cash, including substantial reduction to previously budgeted expansion in capital expenditure, to prioritize near-term brownfield growth projects including Nickel Rim South and Goedgevonden that are already delivering cash flow, while also preserving the full benefit of our organic growth options.</p>
          <p>And I think it's worthwhile outlining in more detail therefore the individual initiatives taken by our businesses to respond to the environment that each faced. Xstrata Alloys, responded promptly to deterioration of the stainless steel market in late 2008 and suspended up to 80% of the Xstrata-Merafe Chrome Venture's total production capacity. Production was prioritized from the Lion and Lydenburg smelters, which use Xstrata's proprietary Premus technology to significantly enhance energy and oil consumption efficiencies compared to conventional technologies.</p>
          <p>And despite the temporary suspension of all but three of its furnaces, cost efficiencies enabled Xstrata to avoid any retrenchment of permanent employees and retain its skilled work force in South Africa. And so consequently the production restarted very quickly and efficiently at several furnaces in the second half, representing 60% of annual capacity, to capture the benefits of now increasing demand for chrome. And indeed third quarter prices have increased by 29% to $0.89 a pound to reflect this.</p>
          <p>Xstrata's Mototolo joint venture with Anglo Platinum at which Xstrata is responsible for mining activity is now at full steady-state operating rates with consequent improvements in cash costs. In addition, reduced stripping ratios and contractor costs at both open pits at the Eland operations will deliver further productivity improvements and real unit cost savings at this growing part of the business, the platinum business.</p>
          <p>Xstrata Coal successfully delivered initial production from the greenfield Goedgevonden coal in South Africa during the first half, continuing Xstrata Coal's track record of successful growth delivery. Since 2005, Xstrata Coal has delivered compound annual growth of something like 11% per annum across its key operating regions and benefits from a long-life reserve and resource base, robust cost position and industry-leading margins.</p>
          <p>A strong production performance at the thermal coal operations delivered 18% volume growth in the first half, including productivity improvements at a number of operations including the Newlands North underground mine, the ramp-up in production at the Glendell open cut and the contribution of the acquired Prodeco operations.</p>
          <p>Record prices settled in 2008 continued to benefit received thermal and semi-soft prices in the first half of the year. Xstrata's coal production costs and sales are on track to improve also in the second half, with additional cost benefits from the transition from high-cost mines to lower-cost operations in South Africa. As you know, the longwall at Oaky No 1 was temporarily suspended in the light of the weak market conditions for coking coal but has also recently resumed operations.</p>
          <p>Xstrata Copper focused on capital and operating cost reductions across its portfolio, while preserving its quite unrivalled brownfield and longer-term greenfield growth options, which this business enjoys. A solid volume performance across the portfolio in the first half offset the impact of significantly reduced production at Ernest Henry, in line with its life of mine plan and the impact of flooding due to adverse weather conditions in January, and at Antamina, where the mine plan led to lower copper grades.</p>
          <p>Cash costs were reduced by 5% to $0.85 per pound as a result of a range of initiatives and together with a solid volume performance have enabled the business to withstand recent challenging market conditions and to be really well-positioned to capitalize on the current market strength.</p>
          <p>The dramatic fall in demand for nickel in 2008 led Xstrata Nickel's management team to radically review its asset optimization plans and timetable, resulting in an ambitious transformation of the entire portfolio. Working closely with stakeholders, the successful delivery of this plan has resulted in the fundamental restructuring of Xstrata's Nickel business in terms of average cash costs and therefore competitive positioning.</p>
          <p>High-cost, end-of-life mines at Sudbury were closed earlier this year. And the oil-fuelled Falcondo ferronickel operation was placed on care and maintenance at the end of 2008. Production on the other hand was successfully ramped up at the Australian nickel operations and, together with initial production at Nickel Rim South and improved volumes and grades at Raglan, this more than replaced lower tonnage from the closed Sudbury operations to fill downstream processing facilities and increase mined nickel production.</p>
          <p>Together with efficiency improvements at the Nikkelverk refinery in Norway, this integrated set of restructuring activities has already reduced unit cash costs by 27% from an average of $5.63 per pound in 2008 to an average of just over $4 per pound in the first half, and a current run rate of just below $3 per pound. The transformation of this Nickel business will continue in the second half and we'll see average C1 cash costs continue to reduce, to position our Nickel portfolio comfortably in the lower half of the industry cost curve.</p>
          <p>Cost cutting and efficiency improvements enabled Xstrata Zinc to achieve an operating profit of $84 million in the first half, more than offsetting the impact of lower commodity prices, the absolute collapse in sulphuric acid demand, which constrained production, and adverse weather conditions in Australia.</p>
          <p>The successful delivery of growth at Mount Isa and at McArthur River Australian operations and the new Perseverance mine in Canada contributed to a 30% increase in mined zinc production. As part of the ongoing transformation of our entire zinc business, Santiago and his team successfully restructured the Mount Isa operations, replacing higher-cost production from Handlebar Hill with increased volumes from Black Star open cut and George Fisher underground operations to realize cost efficiencies and improved recoveries.</p>
          <p>So volumes raised by 20% at Mount Isa with record throughput at the expanded Mount Isa zinc-lead concentrator of 3.4 million tons in the first half, up 22% on the comparable period. And the concentrator is now operating at its expanded nameplate capacity of a run rate of eight million tons per annum, with production of 7.3 million tons expected in the total year of 2009.</p>
          <p>The transformation of McArthur River mine into a low-cost, open-pit operation is nearing completion and you will be pleased to know the operation now has final regulatory approvals. The new Perseverance mine in Canada is operating at full capacity and at 20% lower operating costs than originally budgeted, while the Brunswick operation's improved efficiency and recoveries compared to the prior first half.</p>
          <p>So in total, Xstrata Zinc reduced average C1 costs by 22% to $0.45 per pound compared to an average of $0.58 per pound for 2008. Now that's about the operations.</p>
          <p>Safety and safety performance is a very important indicator, I think, also of operational excellence and I'm pleased that safety performance continued to improve in the first half. The total recordable injury frequency rate for the Group, including contractors, declined by 17% compared to 2008. And lost time injuries were reduced by 20% to 2.1 per million hours at the end of June.</p>
          <p>We have significantly improved safe performance at existing and acquired operations every year by increasing resources at a site level, focusing on the identification and control of major hazards and addressing the underlying causes of critical and near-miss incidents. In total the lost time injury frequency rate has improved by 83% since 2002.</p>
          <p>But it really saddening to report that in the first half of 2009 three contractors and one employee lost their lives at Xstrata operations. And we continue to commit significant management focus and resources to safety performance with the ultimate objective of eliminating injuries from our business.</p>
          <p>In summary, the actions of our commodity business teams over the past several months have markedly improved the competitiveness of this portfolio. We've conserved cash by closing the Australian operations promptly and by restructuring our operations to achieve sustainable reductions in cash costs.</p>
          <p>We have committed to invest in our key growth projects, looking for every opportunity to optimize capital and operating costs for each of these. At the same time we've reduced overall CapEx to preserve capital but we have ensured that we retain the full optionality of our sustainable organic growth pipeline.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well thank you, Mick, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. As usual we have provided comprehensive detail on our financial and operating performance in the half yearly report. So today I will focus rather on the key performance indicators of our business, which reflect a period in which Xstrata's operational and financial performance withstood and responded to the unique economic storm that savaged global economies during the second half of 2008.</p>
          <p>The stark impact of the economic downturn is particularly apparent in a comparison of the prices we received for our products in the first half of 2009, and as a consequence our financial results, against the buoyant conditions experienced in the same period last year.</p>
          <p>As Mick has outlined, Xstrata's businesses took prompt and decisive action to adjust our capital structure, production and operations to an uncertain and challenging environment. And as a result, we end the first half with a very robust business, having bolstered our balance sheet, preserved capita, and sustainably improved the cost-competitive position of all our businesses.</p>
          <p>The revenue, EBITDA and operating profit numbers have been presented on a pro forma basis to include the full period results of the Prodeco operations acquired from Glencore. As Glencore has an option to acquire these assets, the results will be reflected in financial income in the statutory accounts.</p>
          <p>Revenue for the period of $10 billion was some 39% or $6 billion lower period-on period, as average metal prices declined significantly in the first half as a result of depressed economic and industrial activity.</p>
          <p>When compared to the second half of 2008, revenue fell by almost 17% or $2 billion. Average copper, nickel, ferrochrome, and vanadium prices for the first half of 2009 fell by over 50%, while platinum, lead and zinc prices were over 40% lower.</p>
          <p>Despite this gloomy overall picture for the first half, we are starting to see a significant improvement in metals prices quarter-on-quarter from very depressed levels at the start of the year, as increased demand, particularly from China, and the impact of stimulus packages has boosted demand for infrastructure-related commodities.</p>
          <p>Realized Australian hard coking coal prices have declined as a result of the deferral of the record coking coal contracts agreed last July, which has forced us to sell our product into the Chinese spot market.</p>
          <p>Xstrata Coal is holding its contract customers to the agreed terms, but we have allowed some flexibility in timing, given the rapid collapse in demand from steelmakers. And we expect three million tons of metallurgical coal sales under these contracts to be delivered over the next 18 to 24 months.</p>
          <p>Australian thermal coal prices benefited from record contract prices for the 2008 to 2009 Japanese financial year contracts and a recovery in spot prices in the second quarter of 2009. The Pacific market is now broadly imbalanced as a surge in Chinese imports and lower-than-expected growth out of Indonesia have mitigated reduced demand from some customers in the region.</p>
          <p>The Atlantic market has been weaker and South African realized prices were lower period-on-period due to subdued European demand and resultant lower spot prices. As a consequence of these significantly reduced commodity prices, operating EBITDA halved to $2.8 billion and operating profit fell 63% to $1.7 billion.</p>
          <p>The benefit of the Group's policy of maintaining its borrowings in U.S. dollars subject to a floating rate of interest is clearly seen in the lower cost of debt during the period. The average interest rate paid on Group borrowings during the period reduced by 43% to 2.6% as LIBOR rates declined to 1%, compared to some 3% during the previous corresponding period.</p>
          <p>Reported interest expense was further reduced by $83 million as the Prodeco call option premium was amortized in finance income. In total, net finance costs decreased by 41% to $232 million.</p>
          <p>A higher percentage of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions and the benefit of Xstrata's Swiss tax domicile and tax-efficient structure reduced the pre-exceptional effective tax rate for the period to 25% from 27%. And the full year tax rate is expected to remain at a similar level.</p>
          <p>Minority interest reduced due to low earnings at the Alumbrera operation as a result of lower coal &#x2013; copper prices, which were only partially offset by very strong operational performance at that mine. And attributable profit before exceptionals decreased by 68% to just over $900 million, resulting in earnings per share of $0.38.</p>
          <p>Now we continue to believe strongly in the merits of diversification. And despite the dramatic decline in period-on-period profits, the fall in base metals prices was mitigated to some extent by the performance of our large export-focused Coal business.</p>
          <p>Our earnings continued to be weighted to the attractive copper and export coal market. In the first half of 2009, thermal and metallurgical coal and copper together accounted for 90% of the Group's operating EBITDA.</p>
          <p>While the contributions from Xstrata Alloys and Xstrata Nickel declined, Xstrata Zinc contributed around 9% of total earnings, in line with the prior year, again demonstrating the successful cost-cutting and productivity initiatives at those zinc operations that offset some of the impact of the significantly lower prices.</p>
          <p>Commodity prices reduced operating profit by $3.6 billion. The impact of lower copper prices was particularly influential and reduced earnings by more than $2 billion alone. And while we have seen most commodity-based currencies steadily strengthen against the dollar in the second quarter and into the early part of the third quarter as commodity prices have regained some ground, average exchange rates in the first half were generally favorable, with the impact of the stronger dollar against most operating currencies adding just under $900 million and partially offsetting lower prices.</p>
          <p>A strong production performance and increased volumes from Xstrata's thermal coal, copper, nickel and zinc operations were offset by the impact of suspensions to ferrochrome, ferronickel and coking coal capacity to respond to lower demand in these markets. Overall, volumes reduced operating profit by a net $95 million.</p>
          <p>Xstrata achieved real unit cost savings of $119 million in the first half, marking an unbroken record of reductions to the Group's operating cost base at each reporting period since our inception. While we have come to expect cost savings in every reporting period, this is certainly never an area of complacency and the performance reflects the unremitting focus of our operating teams in continually improving the competitiveness of their operations.</p>
          <p>At Xstrata Copper, real unit cost savings of $81 million were achieved as a result of productivity improvements in South America, including procurement savings through a revision of all major contracts, reductions in contractor numbers and improved consumption rates of key consumables.</p>
          <p>Xstrata Zinc continued its track record of consistently improving productivity and stripping out cost to realize $58 million of net real unit cost savings during the period. The restructuring of the Australian zinc-lead operations at Mount Isa and improvements at McArthur River contributed some $43 million of savings. Efficiency programs at the European smelters and the successful ramp-up of the new Perseverance line in Canada and increased efficiency at Brunswick further lowered overall unit cost.</p>
          <p>The substantial restructuring of Xstrata Nickel's portfolio over the past few months has transformed our Nickel business into a low cash-cost producer. Increased mined nickel production from Raglan and Xstrata Nickel Australasia and the successful commencement of initial high-grade production at the low-cost Nickel Rim South mine, more than offset the impact of closing high-cost end-of-life operations at Sudbury, and together with high-value third-party custom feed enabled the Sudbury smelter and Nikkelverk refinery to continue to operate at capacity.</p>
          <p>The Falcondo ferronickel operation remained on care and maintenance throughout the first half, having been initially suspended in August last year. In total, these initiatives realized $42 million of real unit cost savings with the full benefit of this transformation expected to take effect in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Peet and his team at Xstrata Alloys moved quickly to suspend up to 80% of ferrochrome production from late 2008, in response to growing stocks and poor demand. Despite higher standing charges and reduced volumes due to idle capacity, Xstrata Alloys achieved real cost savings of some $9 million by prioritizing production from the energy-efficient Premus technology furnaces.</p>
          <p>Cost-saving initiatives across the Coal business include: the optimization of asset utilization, portfolio management and the alignment of production to market requirements; head count reductions of approximately 5% of the total workforce to date; and a wide range of procurement adjustments, including a review of all major contracts.</p>
          <p>In response to weaker market conditions the Oaky Creek No. 1 longwall operation was temporarily suspended in December 2008, while the Beltana thermal coal underground operation implemented the strategic decision to mine through a faulted area to avoid sterilizing future profitable reserves in that coal resource.</p>
          <p>Now both these decisions maximized the long-term value of the operations but led to a short-term negative impact on real unit costs within Xstrata Coal. In addition, the higher proportion of high-margin export sales, compared to sales to domestic customers, increased unit costs but had a positive impact on received margins.</p>
          <p>Strengthening demand from Asia has subsequently allowed Oaky No. 1 to restart production. And the longwall at Beltana is in the process of being relocated to a new longwall block. And this augurs well for costs in the second half.</p>
          <p>The inflationary pressures specific to the mining industry continue, reducing profits by $183 million in the first half. We calculate inflation specific to the mining industry according to independent third-party indices where possible. And while we have seen a marked fall in cost inflation for a number of key inputs, including explosives, contract labor, fuel and tires, our South African Coal business, for example, experienced significant inflation in port and rail tariffs, which were up by more than 75% period-on-period.</p>
          <p>The cost of materials also continued to increase for the industry as a whole in Australia and South Africa, rising by 12 to 13% compared to the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>Despite the significantly lower commodity prices, Xstrata's operations generated $1.6 billion of cash during the first half 2009 after taking account of an increase in working capital over the period of some $1 billion.</p>
          <p>The results of the bottom-up detailed review of all expansionary and discretionary sustaining capital plans, which we conducted last year, is reflected in the reduced capital expenditure during the first half of 2009. While CapEx has been reduced across each of our commodity businesses, we've continued to fund the near-term growth projects, including the Nickel Rim South mine and the Goedgevonden open cut thermal coal mine in South Africa.</p>
          <p>And both these operations are really contributing lower cost production and they remain on track to ramp up to full production over the next year to 18 months. Guidance for total capital expenditure of approximately $3.6 billion for 2009 is some $200 million higher than the guidance I gave previously as we've accelerated expenditure at a number of projects.</p>
          <p>At the end of January, Xstrata was one of the first companies in the U.K. to approach the equity markets with a substantial rights issue, as part of a series of proactive measures to strengthen the Group's balance sheet in the face of the prevailing uncertain economic climate. The fully underwritten two-for-one equity issue was successfully completed in March to raise net proceeds of $3.7 billion and net of raising costs and the acquisition of the Prodeco operations for $2 billion.</p>
          <p>As a result, a substantial proportion of outstanding debt was repaid to bring net debt to $13.1 billion, down from 16 billion at the end of last year. As a consequence, the Group's gearing has fallen to 28%, which is in line with our long-term targets.</p>
          <p>Our liquidity position remains very robust, and we have over $6 billion of headroom in our committed facilities. And we have no significant bond or bank maturities until the second half of 2011. We are comfortably within our banking covenants for the period and current estimates indicate solid headroom on those covenants going forward. In summary, we have weathered the storm.</p>
          <p>Despite slightly higher capital spending in the second half, we do not expect our debt level to increase materially as the business continues to generate solid cash flows. And initiatives to reduce costs and conserve cash are continuing throughout the Group.</p>
          <p>I will now hand you back to Mick.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Trevor. I want to talk now about the drivers of future value for Xstrata before getting onto an opportunity to create even more value.</p>
          <p>One of the key aspects of Xstrata's value proposition is the pipeline of over $40 billion of organic growth options across each of its key commodities, representing approximately 80% of our current enterprise value. By 2013, Xstrata's growth pipeline is expected to deliver an uplift of approximately 50% to our current production profile, driven by a combination of near-term brownfield and greenfield growth projects.</p>
          <p>Six growth projects are currently being constructed with a total capital cost of $7 billion. While not comprehensive, the slide behind me highlights a number of our most significant greenfield and brownfield projects, both in design or feasibility stage, and for a numbers of others in the pre-feasibility or scoping stage.</p>
          <p>The cost efficient Lion operations commissioned in 2006 have benefited, as I said before, from the potential to expand capacity from 360,000 tons to one million tons per annum through two further brownfield expansions at the existing complex, which will be activated in line with market conditions.</p>
          <p>In platinum, brownfield expansions of the Eland operation are expected to progress &#x2013; progressively double current production to some 300,000 ounces of platinum over the next six years for an indicated capital cost of around $400 million. The sinking of the Western Decline at the Eland operation will commence in the second half to replace the open-pit mine, with the Eastern Decline to follow in 2011.</p>
          <p>Xstrata's Coal portfolio continues to be characterized by a broad range of brownfield and greenfield growth projects that can be initiated as market conditions allow and which provide the potential to increase coal production by over 70% over existing levels. Four projects are currently under construction to grow annual production by 20 &#x2013; by over 20 million tons, with an additional three million tons of replacement tonnage.</p>
          <p>Initial production commenced from the greenfield Goedgevonden coal mine in South Africa during the first half. The operation is well on schedule to commission fully in the third quarter of 2009, ramping up to full production of six million tons of coal in 2010. And as a first quartile cost producer, Goedgevonden will have a significantly positive impact on average operating cost at the South African Coal division.</p>
          <p>The Mangoola thermal coal project in Australia gained approval to commence construction in July, just a couple of days ago. The mine will produce seven million tons of export coal and an additional one million tons of domestic product. And over the last six months the project has undergone reengineering and optimization to reduce fixed plant capital costs by approximately 16%. And earthworks are commencing for first production, which will start round about 2012.</p>
          <p>The Prodeco Colombian thermal operation &#x2013; coal operations are expanding production from nine million tons per annum to 17 million tons by 2013. First half production is on track for an upgraded run rate of 11 million tons per annum in 2009. Total capital expenditure of approximately $1 billion over four years includes Prodeco's share of the new direct-loading port and associated infrastructure.</p>
          <p>The longwall production at the new Blakefield South thermal coal operation is on schedule to commence in mid-2010 and a range of other projects remain able to be initiated in line with market demand at Wandoan, Ulan West and Ravensworth North.</p>
          <p>Xstrata Copper has progressively increased near-mine mineral resource estimates over the last five years to support a very strong brownfields growth. And five copper expansion projects will be presented on final approval during the next 12 months, providing an NPV enhancement in excess of $1.5 billion over the next three years.</p>
          <p>The world-class Collahuasi and Antamina operations in Chile and Peru respectively are planning expansions to concentrator capacity. At Collahuasi, a 20% increase in capacity will sustain copper in concentrate production of over 600,000 tons per annum. And a further project to increase production to one million tons is at the conceptual study stage.</p>
          <p>At Antamina, a 70% increase in proven or probable ore reserves to 745 million tons at a grade of 1% copper has supported the final feasibility study into a 40% expansion to the milling capacity of the concentrator to 130,000 tons per day.</p>
          <p>Southern Peru is rapidly emerging also as an important new copper-producing district and Xstrata's plans will see copper production from the region quadruple within the next five years. Following the acquisition of Tintaya from &#x2013; in 2006 from BHP Billiton, Xstrata Copper has developed the Antapaccay deposit, some 10 kilometers away, into a brownfield 160,000 tons per annum expansion project to extend Tintaya's remaining life to over 20 years at a significantly increased level of annual output. I think this is particularly exciting.</p>
          <p>This brownfield project is being developed in parallel with the Las Bambas project, which you will remember is an early-stage exploration option acquired in 2004 for $90 million. Las Bambas has progressively being developed now into a major copper project to construct a 300,000 ton per annum open-pit operation.</p>
          <p>Capital and operating costs for both projects is going to be reduced by leveraging on existing regional infrastructure and by extracting operational synergies as part of an integrated regional strategy.</p>
          <p>Now Xstrata Copper has recently announced &#x2013; or has announced an upgraded total mineral resource in Southern Peru of over two billion tons, representing a 23% increase in tonnage to the previous estimate, comprising resource of some 720 million tons at a copper grade 0.54% at Antapaccay, and a 1.1 billion ton resource at Las Bambas at 0.77% with a 0.3% copper cut-off grade.</p>
          <p>A successful project to extend the life of Lomas Bayas and increase capacity by 15% was completed in the first half. And further brownfield expansion is being assessed to maintain the expanded production rate for a further eight or more years. Further out, a sulphide inferred resource has been identified beneath the existing mine, which could supplement future cathode production from the operation.</p>
          <p>At Ernest Henry in North Queensland a feasibility study is nearing completion to examine the potential to convert the open cut operation into a sub-level caving operation to extend the life of mine. And we'll report on that &#x2013; more about that later.</p>
          <p>Xstrata Copper's greenfield projects provide the potential to double current copper production and our Copper business benefits from one of the leading growth pipelines in a highly attractive commodity. Xstrata Copper has continued to proceed with the feasibility and pre-feasibility study for its major greenfield projects.</p>
          <p>And full feasibility studies are underway at the Tampakan copper-gold project in the Philippines, the El Pachon project in Argentina, where mineral resources were increased by 41% over the previous estimate to a total of 1.4 billion tons at a copper grade of 0.58%, again using a 0. 0.3% cut-off grade.</p>
          <p>What about Nickel? Well Xstrata Nickel's new mine at Nickel Rim South in Sudbury benefits from high-grade polymetallic reserves with significant PGM and copper by-product credits to reduce the overall average operating cost profile of Xstrata's Nickel business. The operation will reach for the full production of 18,000 tons per annum in 2010 and is ramping up to 60% of full production by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>Significant progress has also been made at the large-scale Koniambo project to develop a tier one, low cash-cost nickel complex in New Caledonia, and is expected to be approximately 50% complete by year end. The project was approved in October 2007 after a one-year review of the project plan and costs and is employing an innovative modular design to achieve capital cost efficiencies.</p>
          <p>By opting for a tried and tested pyro-metallurgical technology, Koniambo has been designed to avoid the technological and environmental risks posed by the use of hydro-metallurgy. The projects remains on schedule and within budget. Following further optimization of capital spending in 2009, commissioning is now expected in early 2012.</p>
          <p>Moving on, the feasibility studies continue into the Kabanga sulphide project in Tanzania with further growth options available in Raglan in Western Australia, Fraser Morgan and Araguaia in Brazil. Xstrata Zinc has the potential to expand its Mount Isa operations at a low capital cost including further extensions to the George Fisher underground and the Black Star open cut operations.</p>
          <p>A study is underway to assess a pilot Albion plant at San Juan de Nieva to treat bulk concentrates such as the product which emanates from McArthur River. And the Pallas Green project in Ireland published a promising mineral resource estimate incorporating a third high-grade zone to increase inferred mineral resource to 11 million tons at 10% nickel and 2% lead, as drilling continues to assess its potential.</p>
          <p>So the stock markets rebound and achieve substantial gains. The refrain from Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1932 campaign song easily comes to mind. Happy days are here again, the skies above are clear again, let us sing a song of cheer again, happy days are here again.</p>
          <p>But until the American consumers emerge from their shell-shocked state and begin to spend again or domestic consumption in China of a similar power emerges, I feel that these words are somewhat premature. We have not yet entered the sunlit uplands of prosperity and I guess we would all do well to remember that as we execute our plans for the future.</p>
          <p>So with that as a caveat let me say nonetheless, and this is important. Well I guess all of it's important but this is particularly important. The outlook for demand for most commodities is positive.</p>
          <p>The inexorable drive towards urbanization and industrialization in China and India and other Asian economies continues, while the supply side of our industry remains particularly constrained. Now the impact of the financial crisis has served only to exacerbate these supply constraints in a number of key commodities.</p>
          <p>Industrial production growth in China is now widely to believe to be underpinned by stimulus investment and infrastructure development, sowing the seeds for another period of strong demand growth from the region once the western economies and exports markets recover. Economic and financial indicators for India, for Japan and recently the U.S. are beginning to point to a return to growth over the next 12 months, which of course bodes well for stronger and a more sustained demand for Xstrata's key commodities.</p>
          <p>While some uncertainty remains over the short-term outlook, the medium- to longer-term fundamentals of commodities I believe remains very attractive. And I think Xstrata is particularly well-positioned in this environment.</p>
          <p>Our portfolio is exposed to early-stage recovery commodities, a view supported by this analysis that illustrates that demand for copper, lead and iron ore have historically shown the strongest correlation to growing industrial production. Demand for thermal coal, nickel and zinc closely follow and, together with copper and lead, account for over 95% of Xstrata's EBITDA in the first half.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the majority and a growing proportion of our sales are into rapidly growing market including China, India, Russia, Japan and South America, which are showing increasing strength in industrial production growth and an increasing share of global industrial production. Xstrata's sales are also predominantly to the construction, infrastructure and electricity-generation sector, all of which are set to continue to expand, boosted by stimulus packages weighted heavily towards these sectors.</p>
          <p>And more importantly of all, the entrepreneurial value-seeking culture which permeates through Xstrata and which we have instilled into our many different businesses that we have acquired and integrated over the years, continues to liberate operational managers to deliver value and to seek out new and innovative ways to improve the operational performance and demonstrate year-on-year benefits.</p>
          <p>It's very pleasing, very pleasing that recent initiatives have further optimized Xstrata's competitive position, enabling our businesses to reap the maximum benefit from improved market conditions for metal and coal and to capture the growth in demand that we foresee in the medium term through an organic portfolio of growth projects. It seems to me that we have in this Company a recipe for superior value creation and performance.</p>
          <p>Let us turn and reflect on the industry and the industry consolidation. Now shortly before we began our odyssey in 2001, Anglo American and Rio Tinto were the largest diversified companies, with BHP seeking to establish itself as a major diversified player through this merger with Billiton.</p>
          <p>The rest of the industry was made up of a fragmented set of smaller companies, providing us with an opportunity to execute against our belief that the pursuit of scale and diversity would lead to increased consolidation and that in time a few major diversifieds would contain the sources of advantage essential to delivering superior shareholder returns.</p>
          <p>A mere eight years later, the evolution of the mining industry illustrates the pre-eminence of the major diversified mining company. The most significant combination in our history in the past ten years, namely BHP Billiton &#x2013; BHP and Billiton in 2001, a transaction with which I was intimately involved, both in conception and execution, clearly demonstrates the ability of larger, more diverse mining groups to deliver superior and more consistent returns for shareholders through the cycle, encouraging others to follow it.</p>
          <p>Scale is not a pursuit in, of and for itself. The scale in the capital-intensive industry, which is increasingly finding new deposits in riskier and more challenging regions of the world, provides the ability to own and develop several large projects without risking a substantial portion of the company's capital in any one region or any one project.</p>
          <p>Scale also brings an improved ability to access capital, talent and new resources and to capture external opportunities. As a further driver of consolidation, the quest for diversification aims to deliver more stable returns over the cycle and an improved ability to manage risks across commodities, geographies, currencies and end-user customer segments. These attributes and the delivery of large-scale organic growth are key in the mining sector and having advised diversifiers to deliver constantly high returns at demonstrably reduced risk.</p>
          <p>A defining feature of Xstrata's development into a major mining group has been our ability to identify and successfully execute opportunities to create value and pay an active role in the continuing consolidation of the industry. And that is why I recently wrote to the Board of Anglo American, proposed that the two companies should engage in discussions regarding this dreaded merger of equals.</p>
          <p>We've set out our arguments for combining Xstrata and Anglo American before but the key point is that the enlarged company could create more value then the sum of the parts. That is the key point. Both Xstrata and Anglo American are capable of prospering independently. That is not in question. But a combined company would unlock value for its shareholders that is simply not available to either company while we remain apart.</p>
          <p>Anglo and Xstrata have complementary asset, commodity and project portfolios. The merged company will benefit from increased export coal and copper exposure from Xstrata, together with exposure to platinum and iron ore from Anglo American. It's a highly compelling portfolio.</p>
          <p>The merged company would benefit from an unrivaled combined portfolio of growth projects, enabling the best projects to be prioritized, resulting in a significant uplift in returns for both sets of shareholders. Enhanced access to finance to fund growth and increase scale could allow several large-scale projects in increasingly challenged regions or with substantial capital budgets to be developed without needing to share future earnings with third parties.</p>
          <p>Our operations are located in close proximity in key regions and we've quantified over $1 billion of unique synergies, adding to the earnings of an enlarged entity every year post-completion with a full run rate of over $1 billion achieved in the third year of a combination.</p>
          <p>The merger would create a new major diversified mining powerhouse, able to compete more effectively with our larger peers including BHP Billiton, Rio and Vale. It would benefit from the enhanced geographic and commodity diversification, optionality and resilience. Such an opportunity to create significant shareholder value in my view should not be ignored.</p>
          <p>Now some brief remarks about the synergies we've quantified. The synergies have been reported in accordance with the City Code of Takeovers and Mergers and arise uniquely from the merger of the two companies. The bulk of these synergies relate to tangible operational opportunities brought about by the proximity of our assets, enabling increased scale, the optimal use of equipment and plant and the savings related to logistics and product flow procurement and operational efficiencies.</p>
          <p>In South Africa, our coal operations are closely in &#x2013; in close proximity in the Witbank and Belfast regions. In Queensland, our Oaky Creek and Anglo American's German Creek coking coal mine leases are contiguous to one another. Other operations, explorations, leases in Queensland provide additional regional scale.</p>
          <p>In bulk commodities, logistics can prove decisive in establishing a superior competitive position. Regional scale permits optimization of logistic chains, product lending at ports and the simulation of scale through multi-operation complexes.</p>
          <p>In South America, the combined Xstrata and Anglo American would become the majority owner of two of the world's tier one operations, Collahuasi and Cerrej&#xF3;n, with the more efficient government structure leading to opportunities for further value creation within each operation and in the broader regions in which these mines operate. Additional operations and leases in the region present further potential synergies, result from improving product flow between mining and downstream operations.</p>
          <p>Our proposed merger of equals is predicated in equality of Xstrata and Anglo American on a wide range of different measures including market values, enterprise values, financial positions, reserve and resource life, asset qualities and aggregate earnings estimates. Anglo and Xstrata shareholders will jointly own the combined company, sharing the substantial benefits that can be realized through this combination and retaining access to the potential future upside.</p>
          <p>Now while our businesses may have different cultures and operating approaches, in my now many years of combining companies and acquisitions, or indeed mergers, such as the highly successful BHP Billiton combination, I have yet to come across two organizations with the same culture. Yet we have always delivered the promised synergies, usually exceeding our initial estimates.</p>
          <p>The value proposition of putting these two companies together is highly compelling. And I believe that it's in the best interests of Xstrata and Anglo management to examine the potential to create the value we have identified for the benefit of both sets of shareholders. I mean this is without doubt an opportunity which merits serious consideration, without the usual distractions and defensiveness that often stand in the way of the pursuit of shareholder value.</p>
          <p>So we're now going to take questions. Please wait for microphone to reach you because of the web broadcast and if you wouldn't mind stating your name and your organization for the record.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Jason Fairclough, Banc of America Securities Merrill Lynch. Mick, you've previously stated that big deals need to be friendly. How hostile can you be here with Anglo and still be friendly? And if nothing happens what's the next step?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well some big deals aren't friendly. I mean, I've always said that I always start off friendly and for some reason they seem to end up hostile. But I'm being very friendly here at the moment and I've no intention of being &#x2013; have no feelings of hostility at all towards Anglo American. I think the combination is too important for emotion to get in the way. We presented a proposition. It's really &#x2013; if &#x2013; to my mind, I don't understand what Anglo loses in engaging with us to investigate that proposition. There's nothing for them to lose. And they might well find that the synergies that we've promoted they agree with. And in fact because I think they're conservative, they could well find that there's more synergies on the table. And it would seem to me that that's a sensible proposition. That's something that I think that if in Xstrata we were facing similar circumstances that's what we would do. But at the end of the day, I mean, I can't force the transaction upon people. And one of the important things which I've tried to outline in today's presentation, that Xstrata as it exists today is a fine standalone company with enormous amount of potential and opportunities going forward. And we will continue to create and add value to our shareholders. And Anglo, if the opportunity doesn't happen, well that's just one of the opportunities that didn't happen.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Fiona Perrott-Humphrey from Rothschild. Can I just ask about the statistical underlay of two aspects of the presentation? The first one is the cost curves, the comparative cost curves that you presented with Xstrata and Anglo. I mean clearly those are weighted average of a wide range of different operations. What is that based on? Is that average production? Could you just clarify because they're tremendously...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're the Brook Hunt cost curves that are produced. So they're produced in the normal way that Brook Hunt produces their cost curves. I don't know if anybody wants to comment on it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>And the second statistical underlay, your claim on Page Eight of the half-yearly report, combining Xstrata with Anglo American is widely accepted to represent the most compelling major combination in the industry. I wondered what statistical analysis or underlays that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm happy if you'd like to accompany me to the various number of institutions that we've been speaking to over the last five or six years about what are the growth options in the mining world. And I can tell you, though, that if you came out of any of those meetings you'll find that all of them believe that a combination of Xstrata and Anglo makes sense. And people might have different views about what the exchange ratio should be but the combination there is no doubt about.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sam Catalano from Macquarie. Two questions, firstly in your ranking of commodities with respect to the correlation with BRIC, IP growth, platinum sits quite low in that. I wonder, in the context of the write-down in today's results as well if you could comment on how the stake in Lonmin sits in the portfolio going forward in isolation of whatever happens with Anglo? And secondly, given all the compelling arguments that you make and the comment about it being widely accepted amongst investors, what do you think the major barriers are in the Anglo American mindset, if you were to comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, when we made our proposal to buy Lonmin, it wasn't frivolous. It was based on our view that platinum was a commodity which had long-term, very positive fundamentals. It supplies into industrial use. We see that industrial use growing especially with the continued urbanization and development of the economies of China and India. But as it sits at the moment it is a late-stage commodity, given the fact that it is influenced very heavily still by the OECD countries.</p>
          <p>And I guess from that point of view we pulled back from Lonmin when the world crashed about us and we couldn't see line of sight into the refinancing risk in 2009. I think that was the right decision. The result is that we sit with a very interesting option. I mean we can either pursue Lonmin further or we can do &#x2013; we can divest. And those are decisions that we will make when it's clear to us what option will give us the best value. But our view of wanting to be in &#x2013; more heavily invested in platinum remains intact. And Lonmin continues to be one of those vehicles where we could pursue that objective. But now is not the time for us to be making those decisions.</p>
          <p>I really don't think it's appropriate for me to try and opine what it is in the mind of the Anglo management and Board in relation to what the obstacles are. I mean, they are doing a lot of engaging and talking with a number of people. The only thing I'm sad about is they're not talking to us. So I'm quite sure their views will &#x2013; should be apparent to the market.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Des Kilalea from RBC. Would it be possible to give more detail on where you see the synergies coming from in that one billion? Say South Africa versus Australasia versus South America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We set out in our announcement as much detail as we really could on the synergies and I don't think that I want to progress on that. It's a range of synergies which arise from operations in terms of shared services, shared resources, the optimization of resources. And I think that I can't really expand any further on what we said at the time of the announcement and I'm very happy that we'll provide you with that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Tobias Woerner from MF Global. Just one question, if I may? You have a decentralized entrepreneurial model, which works very well for you, and Anglo American has a more centralized model with purchasing going really centralized now. One or the other would have to give when the two companies get together. I don't suspect you want to give up your decentralized entrepreneurial model?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yeah, you're quite right. No company easily wants to sacrifice the way that it operates. But at the end of the day, you take the best out of both companies and that's what a merger is all about. I'm sorry to hark back to BHP Billiton, I wasn't engaged with them at the time but they set about setting how the companies were going to function and they combined what they thought were the best aspects of BHP and the best of Billiton to come up with the new design on how they're run. And that would come about in discussion.</p>
          <p>But the one thing that wouldn't change, which is I think is the objective of both companies, is to maximize the value of your buying power. The question is how you just get that. Do you need a centralized organization to achieve that? Or do you need your various operating businesses to recognize that as a requirement and when the time is right for them to actually combine their buying power to achieve results? So nobody wants to lose the benefits of buying power. It's just a question of what is the best technique of doing that. And again, clearly as I said, everybody thinks that the way they do it is the best. But when you have a constructive discussion, I think one gets into a situation of ultimately what is going to be the solution for the combined entity? We're not there yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter Davey from Ambrian. Just following on from perhaps Des's question there. In your letter to Anglo management, a lot of that billion dollars was split out, a lot of it referred to the overlap in the Coal and the PGMs and in the regionalized offices. Yet at the beginning of the letter you say you don't envisage any job losses in South Africa. Could you perhaps share with us where all those synergies are going to come out if it's not going to be job losses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We said that our synergies have not taken into account any job losses at operations in South Africa. And that's a statement of fact that none of the synergies incorporate that. So yes, there are going to be job losses around the world and some of those will filter through. But the key aspect of the synergies is derived from the value of operating contiguous reserves more effectively, from utilizing shared services, plant and equipment more efficiently, from the maximization that one gets from the flows of logistics and the flow of product. And that's where most value comes from. And again, while I don't want to hide behind any particular aspect of our presentation, we've made a proposition, we're happy to have those discussions with Anglo. And when they're ready to have those discussions we can test each of those individual synergies with them and determine whether it makes sense or not. But I'm pretty comfortable that what we've put down is a conservative estimate and they've been independently audited and I'm pretty happy with the fact that they are in the right ballpark. So when we say that there won't be job losses operations in South Africa, that's what we mean.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ephrem Ravi from Morgan Stanley. Three questions. Firstly on the CapEx, you're kind of upping your CapEx guidance for the rest of the year and you made a statement, if I understood correctly, that you are pushing all five of your greenfield copper projects to a feasibility study or approval. If that's the case, is this a deliberate step to highlight the growth potential of Xstrata before the &#x2013; probably a skeptical South African Anglo shareholder base? Second question on more deal-related, number one, there is no formal bid on the table as far as I understand and there is no put-up-or-shut-up deadline. If the current situation continues, for how long do you think your shareholders will countenance a half-pregnant bid, for want of a better expression? And thirdly, other than job security are there any other conditions or preliminary conditions that's been laid out by the South African authorities on &#x2013; as a precondition for your approval from a Board perspective or a headquarter or a listing perspective, for them to countenance a potential merger of equals with Anglos?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First of all, I don't think we've given you any change in guidance on capital expenditure for this year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's up by $200 million from 3.4 to 3.6. That reflects the acceleration of the Mangoola project which, at the last results presentation, I indicated was on hold until we had more visibility into Coal markets. It reflects a modest increase at Prodeco, now that we're in there and we've decided to accelerate some of the capital in that operation. And it reflects some currency movement. So really it's &#x2013; if you look at &#x2013; we're not making a dramatic statement there. I just wanted to give some helpful guidance to analysts as to what it would be.</p>

          <p>But on the issue of laying out the brownfield project, if you go through all of our previous presentations that we've done in the last, I don't know, five or six years, you'll find that we spend a lot of time explaining to you what's in our organic pipeline. And this is just a continuation of that. We're now reaching a position where the work done by Copper in particular is reaching decision points and that's something which I think is important to highlight in terms of the understanding of the Company.</p>
          <p>Your question around the issue of how long does this continue? Well I guess this transaction will have a natural rhythm to it. It will either create some sort of engagement at a point in time or it will end. I can't say when that will be. And time will tell and we'll play it out. There are still some processes that need to go through. There's anti-trust issues that need to be addressed and we are busy preparing ourselves to address those. And clearly, if I link now into the last part of your question, there are responses to issues within South Africa that one needs to address as well.</p>
          <p>There's no formal process in South Africa in relation to government support for a transaction. In fact, there's no formal piece of legislation which says that the government has to sign off on the transaction. There are different regulatory elements that take place within &#x2013; in the country. But I would expect for South Africa to ask the same questions that we've been asked in Australia and in Canada when we've done our big mergers there. And that is, what is the net benefit to the country? Now in Australia and in Canada it's formalized in the Financial Investment Review Board in Australia and Investment Canada.</p>
          <p>In Canada that &#x2013; any foreign company wanting to achieve a formal approval of the government needs to demonstrate net benefit. And net benefit is a very wide-ranging thing, some of which you can quantify, some of which you can't. And we've engaged in that sort of discussion with the South African authorities. We've been told that they are very interested in the impact on jobs. We've been told that they're very interested in the impact on empowerment and we've been told that they're interested to see how a combined company would benefit the development of the mineral sector in South Africa. And those are all legitimate questions which we will address. So at this stage I think it's fairly early days and I'm pretty comfortable with the interactions that we've had with the South African authorities. And if the transaction progresses, no doubt those will become more firm and more specific.</p>

          <p>George Silva from BBVA. One question, do you see the lack of iron in your portfolio as a weakness? And will you consider to go into that industry?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, none of us like to talk about weaknesses. We like to talk about opportunities. So yes, if we could find an effective way of entering into iron ore we'd take it. I suspect that it's very difficult to go out and buy an iron ore producer. It has been for some years. There are iron ore projects out there and one could take an early-stage development entry point into those projects. And provided you don't have to pay too much to make that entry point then that might be a useful thing to do, bearing in mind that the capital costs associated with the development of iron ore deposits are very, very significant, because you're not only dealing in terms of the actual mine itself, but you're taking on board almost the total logistical system as well, being a sort of a low-value, high-bulk commodity. And so, yeah, we have teams engaged looking at those options and if we find the right option at the right price, we'll do it.</p>

          <p>Yeah. Hi, Rob Clifford, Deutsche Bank. Couple of quick questions on Prodeco. Could you just provide us with the updated capital expectations for this year on Prodeco? It's the first question. The second one is, you provided an average realized Americas received thermal coal price of around $77 a ton. Does that include Prodeco or is that just Cerrej&#xF3;n? And the third one is, have you had any recent discussions with Glencore over that particular asset?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll answer the third question, the answer's no. But for the first two questions, Peter, could you pick that up?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The CapEx year-to-date is around 147. We're well on track with our programs to develop the mine, and starting to spend on land and the new port. The guidance for the year is somewhere around 200 million for the full year. In terms of coal prices, as we announced in January, we have an offtake arrangement with Glencore, which is at $75, basis 11,300. The qualities have been running slightly above that.</p>

          <p>Charles Kernot from Evolution. Three questions, please. First, could you give an indication of how much you've spent on the pursuit of Anglo to date? And secondly, just questions with regard to your unit cost savings. You talk about these $119 million worth of savings, if I added up the savings that you talked about on copper, zinc, nickel and alloys, am I right in thinking that costs in coal increased by about $71 million in the period? And finally, on cost savings, you talk about how incentivized your employees are. I presume clearly a lot of that comes through your share-based compensation plans. If I look at the number, that's actually $122 million. Have you spent $122 million to save 119?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are absolutely correct, your math is spot on. And on Page 29 we actually disclose the unit cost performance of the Coal business and it is indeed minus 71% &#x2013; minus $71 million. On the issue of share-based payments, I'm not sure where you get that number from, but it would reflect the accrual of the expectation of those share-based payments as they unwind. We accrue it every period according to what our share price is.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Nick Hatch, ING. Mick, in the release you talk about the successive real cost savings over the seven years since the creation of the company. And I think somewhere else it mentions that there'll be further savings in the second half of this year. Can you outline maybe how much further scope there is for additional savings over the next few years? And which parts of the business you see that coming through primarily?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well yeah, it's interesting. The savings come out of different companies, different things. I think about Zinc, every year I am assured by Santiago that they run the most efficient operation that they possibly can, but every year you actually manage to produce additional cost savings. And they basically adopt the attitude of sitting down with their management team and looking at every single aspect of the operations and finding ways in which they can do &#x2013; if they can do it smarter. And they accrue these savings every single year on very different asset space. None of them are big elements but they're small elements and that's the route that Zinc have actually adopted. And they've also benefited clearly from the massive turnaround of Mount Isa and increase in throughputs through the concentrator.</p>
          <p>If we look at Coal, for instance, the propensity for coal savings I think are very significant. As we move into much lower-cost production in South Africa with the development of Goedgevonden, with the new projects that will come through in Australia, the development of Prodeco, I mean those will lower the cost base. So those are production-orientated savings.</p>
          <p>In Nickel, the work that has been done in Nickel is to really close down the high-cost operations. And with the development of Nickel Rim South into full production where it's got a &#x2013; still, I think, is a negative cash cost because of the spot product traders and the development of Koniambo, that will see the whole profile of the Nickel business continue to decline.</p>
          <p>I can speak about Alloys, where they &#x2013; very significant cost savings came through the application of the Lion project, with the Premus technology and the reduction in energy costs, the result of the lowest use of electricity. As we expand the Lion project into those two new phases, those will bring those costs down.</p>
          <p>And so I think every business has a story to tell in terms of how it's actually going to approach costs. But the one thing which I think underpins this whole perspective of cost reduction is the concept of trying to work out on your existing footprint how you expand NPV on something which is a complete &#x2013; generally a depleting asset base. And what we look at is a sort of NPV reconciliation. So taking out movements in prices, we ask the businesses every year to tell us how they reconcile NPV movement from the beginning of the year, end of the year, and what they have done to add to NPV. Now in those circumstances, what they have to do is how they can actually operate the existing footprint of either producing more material, more product out of it on the same footprint. Or alternatively with a smaller amount of CapEx introduce additional output or how they can actually, through some utilization of technology, lower costs</p>
          <p>And that technique has actually been the thing which has served us well consistently over the last few years and that's why we've consistently been able to come up with these cost savings. It's not by accident that the Zinc operations in Mount Isa have doubled capacities through the concentrator with a very, very low cost capital injection with the utilization of equipment sourced &#x2013; secondhand equipment sometimes, sourced around the world. That didn't come by accident. That came about because &#x2013; Charles, go back to Charles's question and his very perspicacious comment, because people are incentivized to actually get value out of the operations. Because they don't just actually get shares from the &#x2013; in terms of the whole performance of Xstrata. They get bonuses based on the return on the investment. If the return on the investment is crappy, they get crappy pay. If the return on investment is good, they get good pay. That's seems to me a very sensible way of incentivizing people and aligns them certainly to &#x2013; with the returns that shareholders get.</p>
          <p>So none of these things happen by accident, they happen because people are incentivized to get higher returns. And on your existing footprint, if you can't rely on the business of varying commodity prices on your NPV reconciliation, you have to do it in running your operations smarter. So a long answer to your question but there are many reins of opportunities and I have no doubt we will continue to extract value out of the business going forward.</p>
          <p>Have we now reached a deathly silence? Well do we want to sing our little song or should we...</p>
          <p>All together now.</p>
