          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Canadian Natural Resources Fourth Quarter Conference Call. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. John Langille, Vice-Chairman of Canadian Natural Resources. Please go ahead, Mr. Langille.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for attending this conference call, giving us the opportunity to review our 2007 fourth quarter as well as the full year results for 2007.</p>
          <p>Participating with me today will be Allan Markin, our Chairman; Steve Laut, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Lyle Stevens, our Senior Vice President of Exploitation; Doug Proll, our Senior --Financial Officer and Senior Vice President of Finance, and R&#xE9;al Doucet, our Senior Vice President of Oil Sands.</p>
          <p>Before we start, I would like to just refer you to the comment on forward-looking statements contained in our press release, and also note that unless otherwise stated all dollar amounts are in Canadian Dollars and references to production and reserves are before royalties.</p>
          <p>I will make a couple of quick comments before I turn the call over to Allan, Steve, Lyle, Doug and &#x2013; Lyle, R&#xE9;al and Doug. In 2007, we again achieved excellent results, both operationally and financially. And for the eighth consecutive year, we have increased the dividends we pay to our shareholders, this year an 18% increase to $0.40 a share. Our cash flows totaling 6.2 billion were strong with our conventional businesses in all areas, providing the free cash flow necessary to undertake the building of our oil mining project, which will provide years and years of additional free cash flow.</p>
          <p>And as we look forward early in this year, the current commodity strip prices for the balance of 2008 and our very strong production base will again result in excellent free cash flows. As we meet these financial results, our balance sheet continues to strengthen from late in 2006, when we did complete a major acquisition.</p>
          <p>Our finding and development costs for proven reserves decreased in 2007 compared to 2006, and we achieved an excellent recycle ratio of 2.3 times. That is a top notch result, which is one metric to point to high value creation. As we go through the review of our assets and businesses, I believe you will see that our strategies are well entrenched to ensure future value creation for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Allan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural has enjoyed another solid year, a year defined by value creation. We reached several milestones at Horizon and had more than significant success in our conventional business. Major progress has been made at the Horizon Project as we exited 2007 at 90% complete, with first oil expected during the third quarter of 2008. That represents tremendous progress on a project of this magnitude. As always, we remain committed to doing it right. As a result, we have made getting production on line at Horizon our top, top priority.</p>
          <p>This, along with other challenges and inflationary pressures, has had an effect on our costs. On February 12th of this year, we announced a cost increase to Phase 1 of the project of 25 to 28% over our initial budget of 6.8 billion. With this increase, we project our on-stream cost to be less than $80,000 a flowing barrel, and this includes the benefits of the pre-build capital we have invested for future phases.</p>
          <p>Our conventional assets have continued to deliver solid returns, which have some of the highest net-backs in the company history, a true reflection of the strength of our asset base. Our first-class heavy crude oil projects, alongside our high-graded natural gas program, have produced results that have exceeded our expectations.</p>
          <p>In a business environment characterized by high crude oil prices, lower natural gas prices, a strong Canadian dollar and uncertainty surrounding Alberta's royalty review, Canadian Natural has been able to respond to the ever-changing economics of exploration and production.</p>
          <p>We balance our production mix just as we balance near-, mid- and long-term projects within our portfolio of assets. And as a result, we are able to allocate capital within our production mix from one commodity to another. This underlies our fundamental approach to creating and maintaining value.</p>
          <p>As a team, we believe we have the people, assets and plan to continue to deliver shareholder value for years to come. The challenges we met and successes we achieved during 2007 are a reflection of that.</p>
          <p>I want to thank the employees of Canadian Natural for all their hard, dedicated work, and I look forward to working together with everyone, ensuring 2008 is another successful year. And in spite of the Alberta royalty review and the unintended consequences in 2009, we are surviving and will deliver.</p>
          <p>Over to Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Al, and good morning, everyone. As both John and Al have pointed out, the fourth quarter and 2007 were strong. Operationally, we were well within our guidance, driving strong cash flow and earnings.</p>
          <p>As Al just mentioned, 2007 was particularly successful in light of the many challenges the industry faced in 2007: new environmental charges, tax changes for oil sands, Alberta royalty changes, rampant inflation in the oil sands business, a strong Canadian dollar and weak gas prices.</p>
          <p>In the face of these challenges, Canadian Natural has effectively executed our capital allocation strategy, maximizing value by allocating capital to oil projects and away from gas projects, and delivering a strong year.</p>
          <p>Cost control is a cornerstone of the company, and on the gas side of the business we have made tremendous progress with capital costs down roughly 20 to 30% from Q1 2008 versus Q1 2006 for the similar type work. This has come about from rate reductions, enhanced productivity of crudes, and better use of technology, with each contributing about a third of the overall savings.</p>
          <p>On the oil side of the business, we have not seen the same effect as the activity in heavy oil and thermal heavy oil is very high. We have a large &#x2013; to a large degree we have been able to hold costs in line with Q1 2006 due to the better use of technology. And of course, at Horizon, our ability to control costs while maintaining the schedule has been severely tested in a highly inflationary environment. And as you know, we have made the choice to increase costs to meet schedule.</p>
          <p>That being said, our cost control culture and focus on execution is as strong as has ever been in the company. Horizon first oil is still on target for Q3 2008 as originally planned in late 2004. Our costs are up. However, I will point out that our costs are less than 80,000 barrels a day, which is unmatched in this environment.</p>
          <p>Now, let me comment on each of the products, starting with gas. Canadian Natural gas assets are very strong. We have the second largest undeveloped land base and a dominating infrastructure and we are poised to add significant value once the relative economic returns of gas and oil projects return to more historical levels. Production levels declined in 2007 and will decline in 2008. So, I'm sure some of you are wondering why would we say our gas assets are strong, and why they are very strong. While the decline is strictly a result of Canadian Natural's ability to allocate capital to maximize value, we are focused on maximizing value and adding value, not growing volumes for growth sake.</p>
          <p>To illustrate this point, in 2005, we grew gas volumes organically 5% by drilling 890 gas wells. In 2007, volumes actually declined 11% entry to exit, where we only drilled 383 wells, only 43% of what we drilled in 2005 to achieve a 5% organic growth. In 2008, we will drill 314 wells, half of which are core or shallow or CBM wells which are low rate, wells that are unaffected by the new royalty program, or roughly 35% of what we drilled in 2005. And in 2008, we expect our declines to only be about 10%. That reflects the strength of our gas assets. If we don't drill gas wells, gas production will not grow.</p>
          <p>Today, we have over 8,000 gas locations in inventory. So when the relative economics normalize, Canadian Natural will be able to quickly and effectively utilize our deep gas inventory, our dominant infrastructure and our very strong technical and operational teams to add significant value from our gas assets.</p>
          <p>Turning to oil in Canada, and particularly heavy oil and thermal heavy oil, which we believe is the most undervalued and under-appreciated asset in our portfolio. However, the world is changing. With higher overall levels of oil pricing and access to secure supplies becoming increasingly difficult to achieve, these assets are very, very valuable.</p>
          <p>As you know, Canadian Natural has over 300,000 barrels a day of incremental oil to develop from our heavy oil asset base, we have the oil. The value of these assets has not only increased dramatically with higher pricing, it is set to take another significant step in value with access to the Gulf of Mexico refining markets. At roughly 7.5 million barrels a day of capacity, it is the largest refining market in the world. Canadian Natural expects at least one of the four pipeline proposals to be completed and on stream likely in late 2011 or early 2012.</p>
          <p>At Primrose East development, the second phase bringing on 40,000 barrels a day of the incremental 300,000 barrels a day is on track with first steam in late 2008 and first oil in 2009. At Kirby, our 45,000 barrel a day or third phase is in the regulatory process and we expect regulatory approval for Kirby in 2009.</p>
          <p>At Pelican Lake, our polymer flood expansion continues on track and is delivering as expected. Pelican is a world-class pool with 2.8 billion barrels in place, and with polymer flooding we can take recovery from 5% up to 25%, or an additional 550 million barrels of low-cost incremental oil. The polymer flood at Pelican will and is adding significant value for Canadian Natural shareholders.</p>
          <p>On the heavy oil differential side, two differentials widened as we expected. However in Q1 of this year, differentials have narrowed markedly as Midwest heavy oil refinery capacity has been brought back on line. We currently see March differentials at about $17 or 17% of WTI, very low and very positive for Canadian Natural's March cash flows.</p>
          <p>Our heavy oil assets are vast, pricing is strong, and with additional pipeline access to new markets and our defined plan, the future looks bright, very bright for this undervalued and under-appreciated jewel in our portfolio.</p>
          <p>Turning to our international operations, which provides light oil balance and some of the highest return on capital projects in our portfolio, North Sea production was steady in Q4 and is expected to remain relatively flat for 2008 as we continue to execute our mature basin strategy. <mark type="inaudible" /> waterfloods, infill drilling, workovers and recompletions to maintain production, adding reserves and extending field life.</p>
          <p>In Cote D'Ivoire, Espoir continues to outperform as we have successfully completed the West Espoir development and are in the process of expanding the FPSO to increase our capacity for late 2009. At Baobab, we now expect to rig sometime in mid-2008 and it's possible or maybe even likely that we'll describe earlier and we expect to bring on a minimum of three wells of the five wells shut in due to standing issues in our one-year contract window. Currently, we are about 8 to 10,000 barrels a day of capacity shut in. Our Olowi development in Gabon is on track. The FPSO is under instruction to buy. Wellhead towers in Sardinia are ahead of schedule and the drilling rig is expected late in Q2 with first oil scheduled for late 2008, early 2009, ramping up to a 20,000 barrel a day plateau.</p>
          <p>Now, before R&#xE9;al and I make a few comments on Horizon, I will turn it over to Lyle to comment on our very good reserve results in 2007. Lyle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Steve. Good morning.</p>
          <p>Before I review the results, I'd like to mention that 100% of our reserves are externally evaluated, not just audited or reviewed. All of the metrics that I'll be mentioning are based only on our conventional crude oil and natural gas reserves, and I will mention Horizon Oil Sands mining reserves at the end.</p>
          <p>2007 was another very good year for Canadian Natural, with our net proved, finding and on stream costs coming in at $14.28 a BOE, while replacing 110% of our net production. This is a 12% reduction from our 2006 proved finding costs, and also helps drive our three-year average down to $15.07 a BOE. The significant improvement in 2007 is the result of our excellent drilling and development program, good results from our EOR projects at Pelican Lake and Primrose, and our focused effort to reduce capital cost.</p>
          <p>On a net proved and probable basis, our finding an on stream costs were $18.02 a BOE. As expected, this is slightly higher than our historical numbers, primarily as the result of our significantly reduced drilling program in 2007. In North America, high natural gas production levels and a small natural gas capital program resulted in being unable to replace the natural gas produced. Another contributing factor was the focus on low risk development drilling in the North Sea that to a large extent had been previously booked.</p>
          <p>In offshore West Africa, net proved and probable reserves in the Cote D'Ivoire were reduced due to high year-end oil prices, which accelerates project payout and under the terms of the PSA would increase the government share.</p>
          <p>Our net proved reserves increased to 1.97 billion barrels of oil equivalent, made up of 1.4 billion barrels of crude oil and NGL and 3.7 TCF of natural gas. With our Horizon oil sands mining project, reserves are also externally evaluated. The gross leased proved bitumen reserves increased 110 million barrels to 2.39 billion barrels. This equates to proved synthetic crude oil reserves of 1.96 billion barrels. The increase in proved reserves relates primarily to tranche 2 capital spending and a small improvement in the project life. Proved and probable reserves remained essentially unchanged from our 2006 evaluation at 3.53 billion barrels of bitumen and 2.96 billion barrels of synthetic crude.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll pass it back to Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Lyle. As you can see, we dropped our proved F&amp;D costs by about 14% in 2007, reflecting not only the strength of our asset base, but our ability to control costs. Now before I ask R&#xE9;al to give you an update on Horizon, our world-class oil sands project, I'll make a few general comments.</p>
          <p>As you know, we have over six billion barrels of oil to develop at Horizon. Phase 1 is currently under construction and will take us to 110,000 barrels a day and is on track for Q3 '08 start-up. We have broken Phases 2/3 into four tranches. The first tranche is complete and the second tranche is underway. Long lead items for Phase 2, 3 are ordered and the coke drums and hydrotreating vessels are actually on site.</p>
          <p>Phase 2/3 will take us to between 230 and 250,000 barrels a day of light sweet 34 degree API crude with no declines for four years. In addition, we have plans for phases 4 and 5 to take production to just under 500,000 barrels a day or 0.5 million barrels a day of light sweet oil.</p>
          <p>As you know from our earlier press release, we have made the choice to meet schedule on Phase 1, and of course we announced this has come at an additional cost. Although we are very disappointed in the cost increase, it is clearly the right decision to make as it adds the most value for Canadian Natural shareholders. And as I pointed out earlier, our costs are less than 80,000 barrels a day, unmatched in this environment.</p>
          <p>And with that, I will turn it over R&#xE9;al to bring you up to date on what we are doing right now and some of the plans going forward. R&#xE9;al?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve.</p>
          <p>So we have, as Steve mentioned, made the strategic decision here to invest and to protecting our schedule. So we have increased our manpower, which originally were supposed to be around 7,000 people; we are up to 10,000 people now on pipe, and obviously we had some cold weather here in January and February, and now the weather is getting much better. We have seen now an improvement in productivity here over the past week or so, and I think we are going back into our former schedule here doing hydrotesting and so on.</p>
          <p>We are quite confident right now that 95% is achievable at the end of the first quarter or so, and then we'll be quite in good shape for the start-up here in August. As a matter of fact, right now on the mining, we are ready. The trucks are on site. They have been assembled. We have the hydraulic shovel also that has been put in the bank already, and then some tests and then it's fully commissioned. We have the two electric shovels that are being built right now and it's about two-third complete and this would be complete here within a month. So we will be about three months ahead of schedule here in the mine ready to start rolling the equipment and testing it out.</p>
          <p>On the bitumen production, right now we are demobilizing the extraction plants since the plant is mechanically &#x2013; just about mechanically complete. We have also imported diluents for the start-up of the froth treatment plant. We have 50,000 barrels right now being imported into two tanks here on site which also have been ready for some time. The extraction plant and the froth treatment plant here actually is just about ready to commission. We've completed most of the hydrotesting on the site, and within a couple of months they will be into the commissioning mode, which is about also three months ahead of what's needed.</p>
          <p>In the upgrading, the sulphur plant and the hydrogen plant have also one to two months of float right now, and they plan to be completed sometimes in April, May, beginning of June. The primary and secondary upgrader, which have always been since day one the critical <mark type="inaudible" /> project was based on, are on target right now for the third quarter start-up as were planned originally. All the support plants, like water circulation, firewater, potables and sewers and so on, are already operational. They have been tested and they have been running all along. So in terms of the schedule right now, it's looking quite favorable. We are quite comfortable also that the third quarter is achievable.</p>
          <p>In terms of being ready for operation, we have already on site right now 250 operators in place, and we are hiring right now to the rate of about 20 operators a week. We need about 400 operators by December '08, so we are quite comfortable that we will be there. All our start-up commissioning operating procedures have been written. They have been hazzed up, they have been approved and so on, so we are ready also to roll in that area. We have also 800 systems to operate this plant as a whole. We have already 125 of them that have been walked down, over 75 of them have been already commissioned and they are in operation as I speak right now. So we are quite comfortable right now also in terms of being ready for operation of this plant at the end of the day.</p>
          <p>So on this, Steve, back to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, R&#xE9;al.</p>
          <p>As you can see, we are on top of the action at Horizon and on target for Q3 start-up, and as R&#xE9;al said we are comfortable with that. We are aggressively working to control costs and ensure that we meet that schedule. Overall, the company is in a very enviable position, with a strong, well balanced asset base. Our gas assets are strong and poised to deliver significant value growth once the relative economics of oil and gas return. Our oil assets are even stronger in Canada at over 300,000 barrels a day of incremental volumes to add.</p>
          <p>Internationally, we continue to leverage our mature basin expertise, our offshore expertise and our government relations niche into some of the highest return projects in the company's portfolio. And of course Horizon is a world-class project, which will add tremendous value to shareholders. We have the assets, a well-defined plan, the discipline and most importantly, the people to execute the plan and generate significant value for shareholders. We are in great shape.</p>
          <p>I will now turn it over to Doug to update you on our financials. Doug?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve, and good morning.</p>
          <p>The accomplishments of Canadian Natural in 2007 were many and are outlined in our press release and summarized by Steve and John. Financially, we generated $6.2 billion of cash flow from operations or $11.49 per share and 2.6 billion of net earnings or $4.84 per share. We incurred $6.4 billion of capital expenditures, roughly in balance with cash flow and exited 2007 with long-term debt at 10.9 billion, in-line with our 2006 year-end debt of 11 billion.</p>
          <p>Our financial metrics improved considerably as debt to book capitalization was 45% compared with 51% at the end of 2006 and debt to EBITDA was 1.6 times compared with 2.1 times last year. Both of these metrics are within our targeted ranges and signify our commitment to balance sheet strength.</p>
          <p>Our liquid resources are also strong. At year-end, we had undrawn bank lines of credit of $1.4 billion. Pro forma, our issue of US 1.2 billion of notes on January the 10th, our undrawn lines of credit exceeded 2.5 billion. This liquidity combined with our plan to once again balance cash flow and capital expenditures will allow us to carry out our plans and not have to reenter the debt capital markets in 2008.</p>
          <p>Our commodity hedge book is posted on our website and laid out in the press release. It is our intention to continue to monitor commodity hedge opportunities and underpin our cash flow from operations.</p>
          <p>As we look forward to 2008, we have today reconfirmed our annual guidance for production and operating cost. Based on current strip pricing, largely improvements in heavy oil differentials and the current outlook for natural gas pricing, we now estimate that 2008 cash flow may approach $6 billion. This would allow us to further improve our balance sheet metrics.</p>
          <p>Finally, we announced our eight straight year of dividend increases. The 2008 quarterly dividend will increase 18% to $0.10 per common share effective with the April 1, 2008 payment. This confirms our belief in the stability of cash flow and our production base. It also confirms our strategic principles of a strong balance sheet and diligent review of allocation of capital.</p>
          <p>Thank you, and I will return it to John for some closing comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Doug and Steve and R&#xE9;al. And while I think everybody can appreciate that our balance of assets and businesses is very strong, we have excellent focus on what we are doing and we continue to carry on that focus as we continue to develop our assets and continue to drive to create value for our shareholders. And remember that value is not necessarily growth in production, that is not our target all the time. We are targeting towards always creating long-term value for the shareholders that will pull through many peaks and valleys of commodity price changes.</p>
          <p>With that, operator, I would like to open up the call to questions that people may have.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, gentlemen. The obvious questions -- we've now got the strip through $100 for all of Q2 and very close to $100 for the balance of the year, cash flows are going to be substantially higher than budget, as Doug suggested. With the marginal dollars, what do you do over and above the current budget?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Martin, Steve Laut here. I think what we are doing now, the strip is up there and we have additional cash flow. Obviously, we are going to strengthen our balance sheet and be ready for any other opportunities. Obviously, we have some great opportunities. We would like to allocate more capital to in the oil side of the business; that's a possibility. There may be other opportunities internationally, but I think the first allocation of that capital for cash flow would go to the debt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in terms of you guys and the board sitting down to have a kind of top-to-bottom review of budget, when is that going to happen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We normally -- every year we do it in April and May and we allocate capital based on results from the first quarter. Again, we will do that this period of time. I think by then we will have a little bit more confidence that the strip is going to stay up there, obviously, little higher prices for both oil and gas.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Stephen Calderwood of Raymond James. Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Yes, good morning. You mentioned that your peaking labor now at the project at Horizon is 10,000 workers. Is that expected to come down in the next few months? What does the profile look like and what should we &#x2013; when should we be looking for there?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Steve, I think what's going to be happen here is that the 10,000 people will probably be there from March and April, and maybe part of May, but will probably be coming down in May and will fully drop off fairly quickly. Would you like to add anything to that, R&#xE9;al?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think you got it right, Steve. I think we want to keep the manpower on site here to make sure that we are well ahead of our expectations here <mark type="inaudible" /> to plan, and I will tell you that by sometimes in March, April, we are going to start to wind down.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you mentioned a couple of times in the presentation that August is the target month. What happens if it's a couple of months later? Does that really matter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Steve, what you got to look at is that we take Q3, I know everybody has got August on their mind, but I guess that is in Q3, it's the middle of Q3. So we think Q3 is realistic and we are pretty confident with that. If it slips into October, probably not an issue. November, depending on the weather, it might be okay, but it can get cold in November in Fort McMurray so we will have to make a call. But again, we don't see that as something we are going to have to worry about. We are -- as we said, and both R&#xE9;al and I said, we are confident we are going to make Q3.</p>
