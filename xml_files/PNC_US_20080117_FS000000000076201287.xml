          <p>Good morning, my name is Regina and I'll be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The PNC Financial Services Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2007 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bill Callihan. Sir, please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to today's conference call for The PNC Financial Services Group. Participating in this call will be PNC's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Rohr; and Rick Johnson, the company's Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>In the following comments, we refer to adjusted results for the current period as well as various prior periods. We believe having these adjusted results in addition to our reported results helps provide a clear picture of PNC's results and trends.</p>
          <p>In order to put all of the periods we discuss on a comparable basis, these adjustments report our investment in BlackRock, as this, we had also recorded it on the equity method of accounting, prior to closing the BlackRock/MLIM transaction on September 29, 2006.</p>
          <p>We also adjust, as applicable for the following types of items in order to illustrate their impact on integration costs; net effects of our BlackRock LTIP share obligation; the Visa indemnification charge; our 2006 gain on BlackRock/MLIM transaction; and the cost of our 2006 securities and mortgage loan portfolio repositionings in each case, as appropriate, adjusted for the impact of tax.</p>
          <p>We provide details of the adjustments and reconciliations to GAAP of these and other non-GAAP financial measures we may discuss in today's conference call in our earnings release and financial supplement, and our presentation slides and the appendix for this &#x2013; in the appendix of this call, and in various SEC reports and other documents. These are all available on our corporate website at pnc.com in the Investor Relations section.</p>
          <p>The following statements also contain forward-looking information. Actual results and future events could differ, possibly materially, from those that we anticipated in our statements and from our historical performance due to a variety of factors, including those described in today's conference call, in our earnings release and related materials, in our 10-K and 10-Q and other SEC reports available to our &#x2013; that are available on our corporate website. These statements speak only as of January 17th, 2008, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.</p>
          <p>And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim Rohr.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Bill and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. The last six months, I don't have to tell this group, has been an extraordinary time in our industry, been marked by unprecedented volatility and many in the financial services industries are reporting substantial losses, write-downs, and workforce reductions. Interesting that after several mostly predictable years, we are seeing market conditions that no one could have predicted.</p>
          <p>Credit losses which were at historical lows are now increasing. Liquidity at many companies is constrained and the need for capital is driving consolidations and infusions from offshore investors. Truly an unusual marketplace we're living in.</p>
          <p>So, given all of those challenges, we are pleased with where we are today, and we are satisfied with how our businesses are running. Good news is, we are growing our diverse revenue streams faster than our expenses and we continue to deepen our customer relationships and we are deploying capital to grow our businesses. And we like our strategic decision making, because we've avoided material exposures to subprime mortgages and other issues that are currently plaguing the industry.</p>
          <p>We had a good year in 2007 given the operating environment. We delivered solid financial results. We completed several significant acquisitions that will further the growth of our franchise and at $139 billion, our assets are at record levels.</p>
          <p>For the quarter and for the year, we saw significant increases in net interest income. We saw strong fee growth, excluding the CMBS and trading, which we'll talk about in a moment. And we continue to manage our expenses effectively and we expect these trends to continue in 2008.</p>
          <p>However, we are not without disappointments. PNC is not immune to the current market volatility and our fourth quarter results did not meet our expectations. As I shared with you in December, we experienced earnings pressure in two primary areas. One, credit deterioration primarily related to our residential real estate development portfolio, and the other performance in our CMBS origination business and trading activities.</p>
          <p>Today, we also reported charges for our share of the estimated Visa's litigation exposure. For several quarters &#x2013; let's talk about the real estate piece first, we've been experiencing a downturn in the credit cycle. We've been saying for years that we were at unsustainable low levels of nonperforming assets. Our nonperforming assets did increase to 0.34% of total assets from 0.22 in the fourth quarter, still remarkably at low levels. And we bought a bank this year that had zero NPAs, obviously, unsustainable as well, and we converted them on to our platform late in September. And these combined with the deteriorating residential real estate market, contributed to this increase in NPAs, but still again at a low level.</p>
          <p>Our relationship managers are increasing their focus on at-risk credits to help us through this cycle. And we have a proven ability, we believe, to manage through these kinds of credits. We've done them before. Most of the credit quality issues we are hearing about today relate to residential real estate development. This represents less than 2% of our assets, a very small percentage relative to many of our peers. The other troubled area, with regards to CMBS and trading, we are comfortable that that will &#x2013; and we expect that to return to profitability this year.</p>
          <p>And given our strong business model, and our ability to create positive operating leverage, we believe we can continue to deliver solid results in this challenging environment. Looking at our adjusted full-year results, we achieved year-over-year adjusted net income growth of 12% while our EPS on an adjusted basis was essentially flat due to the fourth quarter. We will discuss our financial performance in more detail in a few moments, but let me offer some highlights from our business segments.</p>
          <p>In Joe Guyaux's Retail Banking business, we continue to grow customers. We added more than 300,000 net new checking account relationships in 2007, and that includes the acquisition of Mercantile. We also saw more customers using Online Bill Payment, a key to increasing customer retention and profitability. The percentage of consumer DDA households using the system in the fourth quarter increased year-over-year from 23% to 33%, boding well for retention.</p>
          <p>Regarding our acquisitions, we successfully integrated Mercantile in September, adding them to our industry-leading technology platform and we captured the expected cost savings in the fourth quarter. We're already seeing growth in our converted Mercantile branches, with a 60% increase in the production of consumer checking accounts in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year. This increase reflects the opportunity we see for growth in the former Mercantile branches and we are pleased that some 20,000 Mercantile customers now bank online with PNC.</p>
          <p>Another item; our initial credit card mailing to Mercantile customers took place in the fourth quarter and we achieved 140% of our goal. Also, with regard to a strategic decision in the fourth quarter for Retail, we decided to focus our brokerage business on our &#x2013; in footprint activities where we have a competitive advantage. As a result, we announced the plans to sell Hilliard Lyons and we expect the sale to close in the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Bill Demchak's Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking business, they've made great progress this year. This segment delivered good results on a relative basis, despite a challenging environment. Our relationship approach, which is supported by a broad array of products and services, generated almost 50% of total revenue from noninterest income in 2007. This segment with its national capabilities continues to deepen relationships with its middle market customers providing them with a broad array of credit liquidity and capital markets products and services.</p>
          <p>In fact, for 2007, we remained number one in arranging middle market loan syndications in the Northeast and, in the U.S., we are number two in both transaction and dollar volume. Harris Williams was selected as the middle market investment bank of the year by a leading trade publication and they had a record year. And we had a record year in our national asset-based lending group, ending the year with loan outstandings of approximately $5 billion. Not to be last, treasury management revenue is up 14% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>As we turn to PFPC, Tim Shack and his team has done a wonderful job. Our global fund services provider reported revenue growth of 8% in 2007, driven by a robust sales pipeline. Core earnings continue to show significant improvement as we transform the segment from an information processor to an information provider.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, we completed two acquisitions to further that strategy. By adding the capabilities of Albridge Solutions and Coates Analytics, PFPC can now facilitate the flow of information both to and from financial advisors, broker dealers, and fund companies.</p>
          <p>PFPC continued its international expansion in '07 also by opening a new sales office in London and obtaining a license that allows it to provide depository services to the $1 trillion Luxembourg market. And as we know, our international services there are growing at approximately 40% per year.</p>
          <p>Just earlier today, Larry Fink and BlackRock reported another very strong quarter of core earnings, with assets under management now at $1.4 trillion. The strategic decisions being made to grow the distribution network, expand the product range and our overall focus on investment performance and client service should continue to benefit PNC.</p>
          <p>As we look forward to 2008, we believe our industry will continue to face challenges from in-market liquidity and credit deterioration. We believe this is good and bad news for PNC, because of our relative strength position. As a matter of fact, we look at it as a year of opportunity when we look at competition with our competitors.</p>
          <p>As for the economy, we currently see growth in '08 albeit at a slower pace than '07. Assuming a reasonable economy, we're focused on maximizing the strength of our franchise in 2008 at a time when others have lost significant revenue streams or are laying off employees. We look to execute our business plan this year by really taking advantage of PNC's products and services to new markets as well as our existing markets, and as a result, we believe we're well positioned for an even better year in '08 than '07.</p>
          <p>Now Rick will provide even more detail of our financial strategies and outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. Overall, this was a very good year for PNC despite our fourth-quarter challenges. First, our business model with its diverse revenue streams continued to deliver solid results. Second, on an adjusted basis our revenues continued to outpace our expenses creating positive operating leverage, and third, our moderate risk profile and flexible balance sheet position us well for the current environment.</p>
          <p>Our reported earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter were $0.52. These results included a $0.24 charge related to our BlackRock long-term incentive plan obligation, a $0.16 charge related to Visa, and a $0.15 charge for integration costs primarily due to the additional provision of 45 million related to our Yardville acquisition.</p>
          <p>The Visa charge represents PNC's share of our estimate of Visa's litigation exposure. We expect this loss to reverse on completion of Visa's pending IPO, and given the temporary nature of this charge, we excluded it from our adjusted results.</p>
          <p>Our adjusted earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter were $1.07. This included 26 million of valuation losses for commercial mortgage loans held for sale and trading losses of 10 million. In the aggregate, these items were marginally better than what we disclosed in December, but significantly below our original expectations. Adjusted earnings also included a 78 million increase to the provision for credit losses versus the third quarter, primarily related to residential real estate development. This is a bit more than we disclosed in December, and I'll have more to say about that later.</p>
          <p>For the full year, our reported earnings per diluted share were $4.35 or $5.05 on an adjusted basis when you exclude the BlackRock LTIP activities, integration costs and the Visa litigation charge.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to focus the remainder of my comments on our key business strategies, delivering diverse revenue streams with a high concentration of fee income, creating positive operating leverage and maintaining a moderate risk profile. Now, as it relates to our moderate risk profile, we'll also comment specifically on today's priorities: managing asset quality, maintaining our strong liquidity profile and building our capital strength.</p>
          <p>As slide 5 shows, we continue to grow high-quality, diverse revenue streams. Overall, adjusted revenue for 2007 grew 18%. That's a significant achievement in this environment. We are differentiated by our high-quality, diverse revenue streams, which require relatively less credit capital than our peers.</p>
          <p>Our fee-based businesses account for 50% of total revenue. On an adjusted basis, they grew 10% on a year-over-year basis, despite the challenges in our CMBS and trading activities.</p>
          <p>Asset management revenue increased 10% on a linked quarter basis due to BlackRock and our wealth management businesses, which continue to deliver record results through strong revenue growth and disciplined expense management.</p>
          <p>Fund servicing revenue grew 3% on a linked quarter basis driven by our emerging products, primarily offshore activities and our Albridge acquisition.</p>
          <p>On the consumer side, our consumer service fees and deposit service charge revenues increased 3% on a linked quarter basis and were up 12% for the full year due to organic growth and the addition of Mercantile and Yardville.</p>
          <p>In addition, brokerage revenue remains strong with full year growth of 13% driven by the strong performance of our in-footprint brokerage business and Hilliard Lyons.</p>
          <p>On the corporate and institutional side, corporate service revenue in the fourth quarter returned to more normal levels following an outstanding third quarter. For the full year they grew 14% due to strong results by treasury management services, Midland commercial mortgage servicing and Harris Williams M&amp;A advisory services.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a minute to talk about our commercial mortgage origination business. We had about 2 billion in held-for-sale loans at year end. While we clearly understand the risks involved with this business, our decision early in the quarter not to fully hedge our inventory in an environment where credit spreads were widening, cost us 26 million. Since then we have hedged all new originations and currently have several securitizations in the pipeline. Our intent is to significantly reduce our inventory in the first half of 2008. This is a good business for PNC and we will continue to be active in originating, securitizing and servicing commercial mortgage loans, and this in our trading business is very similar. We simply took positions that were adversely affected by unprecedented widening of credit spreads. I should point out that our customer related trading business met expectations for the quarter. Despite these challenges, the diversity of fee income sources enabled us to grow these revenues by 10% over the prior year on an adjusted basis.</p>
          <p>Our next largest contributor to revenue is our deposit franchise, which accounts for 27% of adjusted revenue, growing 5% on a linked quarter basis and 34% for the full year. We are differentiated by our ability to gather low cost deposits through multiple channels including consumer, small business banking, corporate banking, treasury management, and Midland loan servicing. We were successful in growing our average noninterest-bearing deposit base by more than 250 million on a linked quarter basis.</p>
          <p>On the interest bearing side, revenue growth was enhanced by our strategy of focusing on relationship customers rather than pursuing higher-rate single service products. Our strategy is to remain disciplined on pricing while targeting specific markets for growth as opportunities arise. Consequently, our results this quarter benefited from lower deposit costs associated with lower rates. We're seeing some price easing in certain geographies, however, overall, this remains a competitive market.</p>
          <p>Our smallest contributor to revenue is credit, which represents 6% of adjusted revenues and grew 25% for the full year, primarily due to Mercantile and growth in our commercial client base. We continue to deploy credit capital to service our customers and where it meets our risk return criteria. As a result, we saw average total loan growth of about 2.3 billion over last quarter, primarily driven by loan demand in our Corporate &amp; Institutional segment, and our Yardville acquisition. We're very comfortable with the diversification of revenue resulting from our business mix, overall, this approach delivered 18% growth in adjusted revenue for the full year.</p>
          <p>Now, as you can see on the slide 6, we created a positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis in 2007. This was accomplished with 18% growth in adjusted revenues and a 15% growth in adjusted expenses. Overall, adjusted net interest income growth was 12%. In the fourth quarter, we saw incremental savings and operating expenses related to the Mercantile integration. We said we expected a reduction in operating expenses of 108 million annually, and we have met that goal. You might notice that our effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 21%, but this simply reflects the impact of lower reported earnings, while a permanent tax credits remain consistent with expectations.</p>
          <p>Now, PNC is well positioned from a risk perspective because of the strategic choices we made and our operating discipline. Let's start with asset quality. Strategically, we have substantially avoided many exposures; subprime mortgages, high yield bridge and leverage finance loans that are creating challenges for some of our peers and our commercial real estate portfolio is relatively small compared to the peer group. On a daily basis, we make credit decisions based on our assessment of risk-adjusted returns. And as a result, our asset quality continues to be strong when nonperforming assets representing only 34 &#x2013; 0.34% of total assets at quarter end. However, we did see a sizable quarter-over-quarter increase in nonperforming assets, but it was in line with our expectations for this stage of the cycle.</p>
          <p>Our exposures continue to be very granular. Our largest nonperforming asset is $20 million, and our average nonperforming commercial loan is less than 500,000. That being said, we do expect nonperforming assets to increase in the first quarter, but at the slower pace than what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>We recorded a provision of 188 million, which includes a provision of approximately 45 million related to the Yardville acquisition. The remaining increase in the provision over the third quarter was primarily related to deterioration in our residential real estate development portfolio.</p>
          <p>Our commercial real estate portfolio is well diversified. The outstandings as a percentage of Tier 1 capital remains relatively low compared to our peers. Our outstandings in the residential real estate development sector is only $2.1 billion, which represents only about 4% of total loans. The majority of this exposure is in our footprint.</p>
          <p>Overall, our portfolio continues to be very granular and manageable, and the average size of these exposures is about $2 million. We recognize this is an area of heightened concern, and we remain diligent in our underwriting practices and in our ongoing credit assessments.</p>
          <p>Next, let's talk about interest rate risk management.</p>
          <p>Our duration of equity at the end of the year was 2.1 years positive, providing us with continued flexibility to invest opportunistically and benefit from lower rates. Our net interest margin was essentially flat as a decline in deposit rates kept pace with asset repricing. The reduction in the Fed rates were marginally beneficial to net interest income, but the more significant benefit will take effect when; first, the spread between Fed funds rate and LIBOR eases as it's beginning to do, and you are seeing that in the market today; and second when our deposit base reprices and this will take some more time to work its way through.</p>
          <p>From a liquidity perspective, PNC's loan-to-deposit ratio of 83% is among the lowest of our peers, and from a contingency perspective we have unused borrowing capacity of more than $30 billion. So we are very comfortable with our overall liquidity position.</p>
          <p>Next, let's talk about capital.</p>
          <p>We are adopting the Tier 1 capital ratio as our primary metric for capital management. This metric provides better alignment of capital management with our balance sheet risk. We're doing this for a number of reasons. First, we believe Tier 1 provides a better management of risk, and is more consistent with our economic capital methodologies. Second, Tier 1 is a regulatory capital concept, and is better aligned with capital approaches used by the rating agencies; and third, it allows us to access the hybrid capital markets as a recognized part of our capital structure.</p>
          <p>Our Tier 1 capital at year-end was 6.8%, that's above the well-capitalized level from a regulatory perspective. However, this level of capital is a little thinner than I would like in this environment. This happened because we grew our balance sheet more than expected and we closed an acquisition earlier than expected. That being said, our focus in 2008 will be on building our capital ratios and I am confident in our ability to do so. This is why; first, we have the ability to grow earnings. Second, we can access the hybrid capital market without diluting earnings per share; and third, we do not plan to use our capital to repurchase shares for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>As a result, our Tier 1 capital ratio target for year-end 2008 and potentially sooner, is between 7.5 and 8%.</p>
          <p>On a final note, I'd like to report that we have resolved our cross-border leasing issue with the IRS. With an additional charge of a nominal amount of 7 million after taxes, this significant uncertainty is now eliminated from our balance sheet, a major accomplishment.</p>
          <p>If you look to full year 2008 compared to 2007, on an adjusted basis and based on our economic forecast of 2% GDP growth in 2007, we expect to see loan and deposit growth percentages somewhere in the mid single digits.</p>
          <p>Total revenue growth will exceed 10%, driven by strong net interest income growth as well as solid growth in noninterest income. We continue to expect to create positive operating leverage with expected noninterest expense growth in the high single digits. Given our mid single digit loan growth expectation, we expect the provision in 2008 to be between 400 and 500 million, depending upon the pace of change in the credit cycle. We also expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 32%.</p>
          <p>In summary, we believe our industry, including PNC, will continue to face challenges from market volatility and credit deterioration. Even so, as we seek to maximize the value of our franchise in 2008, this business model and our business strategies should serve us well.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it back to Jim.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rick. In closing, it was another solid year for PNC. I believe our performance validates our approach and reinforces our commitment to the key strategies to deliver these results. Most important, we believe we are well positioned for the current environment.</p>
          <p>As we continue our efforts to build a great company, we'll focus on revenue side of growing high quality revenue streams through a diversified business mix. On the expense side, we believe that we will achieve positive adjusted operating leverage through growing the businesses with disciplined expense management and maintaining a moderate risk profile.</p>
          <p>Given what we see now, and assuming a somewhat stable economy, we expect '08 to be better than '07. And we're comfortable with the range that First Call has for our '08 expectations.</p>
          <p>And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning guys. Question for Rick and maybe Jim on Capital. Rick, would you say buybacks look like they are on hold for 2008 and would that also mean acquisitions probably also on hold for 2008? And then secondarily, might you consider some kind of debt issuance or other kind of capital enhancement activity this year to get your capital levels up to where you want them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think in terms of buyback, I think at least for the first half of the year, no doubt, I think we'll be on the sidelines as it relates to that and we'll have to reassess our capital position at mid-year. I think as it relates to issuing, and access in the capital markets, we certainly feel that we have access to that, and as I mentioned, I think we will be strongly considering some kind of Tier 1 capital issuance which is not diluted to earnings per share, and we've done that throughout 2007 and we'll be looking at that in 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then maybe Jim's comments on acquisitions, given the capital levels now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The acquisitions, I think it's important to note, John, I think we have tremendous opportunity just by operating our business as we see it. I think in the last presentation we made we talked about how much opportunity &#x2013; upside opportunity there is in the new markets that we have entered and we like the success that we're having in Mercantile and Yardville already. And so I think where our focus really this year is going be to continue getting some of those cost savings out of there and drive revenues through our existing and our new franchises. Acquisitions I think at this point in the credit cycle are kind of interesting to do; as we know, real estate in the past takes probably three years to work its way through the cycle. That's why we're glad we have a lower relative percentage than our peers. So I think we would rather just run our business.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just a follow-up Rick, on the margin and NII, did you give an outlook for the early '08 or '08 at all on margin or NII growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think as it looks, NII, clearly we see growth in NII, and I mentioned that we will see strong growth through the entire year. On the margin, I would say it will be stabled up throughout the year, given what we're seeing right now in terms of Fed easing throughout the year, as well as our expectation of a little bit steeper curve than what we're seeing today.</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian with Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Ed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Ed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the 400 to $500 million provision, if we look at that level, does that include some additional reserve building? And not just reserve building on a dollar basis, but reserve building on a reserve to loans outstanding basis as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think so Ed, because I don't expect chargeoffs to reach that level through the course of the year. So I think absolutely it would result in some reserve building over the course of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're talking about loan growth in the mid-single digits. It will be tied to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, I guess the question I'm asking is, would you expect your dollar reserve to increase faster than the mid-single digit pace?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yes, it would.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as the combination of loan growth as well as to the extent that there's further deterioration, there will be probably some excess reserving over chargeoffs in the near term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then secondarily, I know this is kind of hard thing to look out on; you mentioned you expect NPAs to increase in 1Q, but increase at a slower pace than they increased in 4Q. Any outlook for credit quality beyond 1Q? Or any kind of tentative outlook? Do you think that pace of NPA growth will continue to decelerate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The challenge there Ed is, everything is based upon our view of the economy of what we think is going to happen over that period, and based upon the economic forecasts of our economists and where that's at, I think you see it building Q1, make a little bit in Q2, leveling off maybe through the second half of the year. But boy, that's based upon a forecast, and those forecasts are changing pretty rapidly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So suffice to say, if that's sort of the tentative outlook, that would not really be a &#x2013; or excuse me, a recession scenario or outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's a 2% GDP growth outlook.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Good morning, Mike.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have five little questions. One is, where is consensus that you're saying is okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First call consensus for us in '08 is $5.94 to $5.35.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, 5.94 to...?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lower end is 5.35, and the upper end is 5.95.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's a wide range, I guess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Agreed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then second, Mercantile cost savings, you got what you wanted. Is there more to go or is that pretty much it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's more to go.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>About how much more you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't given an estimate on that but I think there we're continuing to see opportunities for cost savings on Mercantile, but we're also investing in Mercantile in terms of hiring people that produce fee income. So &#x2013; but there will be more cost savings coming out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then third, Yardville. How much did that add in different categories like NPAs, revenues, expenses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was &#x2013; in terms of NPAs, it was pretty marginal &#x2013; 17 million; I think in terms of overall loans was about 1.3 billion. What other categories are we looking at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Revenues and expenses. If we were to back out Yardville to look at link quarter revenue expense growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you're talking &#x2013; Yardville's revenue number is about $10 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the expenses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>$10 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And that's the impact in the fourth quarter, or would that be a whole quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the impact in the fourth quarter, and we closed, it's two months worth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then fourth, the new capital issuance, is that factored into your expectations for 10% revenue growth? Because if you issue say some preferred with the dividend rate, that would be a drag on revenues. So is that in your numbers already?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then lastly, I guess your home loan bank borrowings went up 4 billion this quarter and 6 billion the last two quarters. At the same time, I guess securities are up also?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Uh-huh.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, to get back to your capital targets, do you think about maybe downsizing the balance sheet in that area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not downsizing. I think what you saw there was, we just saw a great opportunity in the market to be able to borrow cheap and invest, right, and enhance earnings. I think over the long haul though, we don't want to be as dependent on those kinds of borrowings, and I think we'll probably be taking a look at that over time and converting that back into some longer term funding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Actually I have just one last one, I keep reading the name of PNC in the paper as a takeover target. And I haven't heard you guys say that. But just &#x2013; Jim, how do you respond?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple questions here; one, you guys adopted FAS 159, but you did not do so for your BlackRock investment. Could you comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we will adopt January 1, 159 and we've got two very small strategy structured repos in CMBS where we're going to go to fair value. It's not going to have that big of an impact on our results overall. If we were going to adopt 159 in our BlackRock Investment, we'd have a wonderful capital ratio immediately. And then we'd have a tremendous amount of volatility in our overall earnings stream over time, but we just didn't think that was reflective of our view of our investment in BlackRock, which is a long-term investment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Another question about credit moving forward. In the light of the multifamily default that you had on CMBS, and the litigation in the matter, what do you see for commercial real estate credit quality in general for the industry moving forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well generally speaking, our commercial credit quality is doing extraordinarily well, and with regards to that one customer, although we don't make customer contacts, we have no economic risk there and we don't have any comments on the litigation there either. But we're comfortable with the credit quality in the commercial space at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what is your view moving forward for the industry as a whole? Do you think it's going to hold up, or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it will hold up fairly well. I think it depends on the economy. If the economy grows at 2%, I think the commercial real estate market will hold up much better than the residential piece, which &#x2013; we clearly have overbuilt and enjoyed the subprime problems and the rest. Commercial really doesn't have those kinds of issues.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Nancy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple questions here. Jim, I was intrigued by your comments about taking products to new markets and by your other comment about no acquisitions. So can you just kind of flesh that out a little bit, what new products to what new markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In our most recent presentation, we showed, for example Yardville, I think is probably the easiest example. Our bank, ex-BlackRock, if you just take the bank itself, is 50% fees with all the various products and services that we deliver to customers through the bank. Yardville, which is the #1 market share player in three of the 10 richest counties in America, has 29% fees. They don't have any private banking activity. They have no credit card capability. They have no brokers in their branches. They don't do merchant servicing for their small-business customers in the region. They didn't have remote deposit.</p>
          <p>And so, we look at opportunities like that to put those products in the hands of those salespeople in that region. And we reported &#x2013; we expected a 15% IRR by taking the costs out, to the extent that &#x2013; and you don't give us any credit for the revenue stream &#x2013; any growth in revenue. But if we can drive that revenue from 29% to 40 or 50, like we can the rest of the company &#x2013; the rest of the bank, we can truly enhance that acquisition. We look at &#x2013; and the same issue is at Mercantile, although they have a little bit higher component of fees. And then, when we look at Greater Washington, with the Riggs acquisition, we've been able to increase their percentage of fees and their fee growth by over 10 full percentage points in a year and a half &#x2013; or two years, I guess now.</p>
          <p>So those are the kinds of things we think we can do in those new markets, and it's a tremendous opportunity for us without having to do an acquisition.</p>
          <p>The acquisition environment, your second question. It's going to be interesting to watch, I mean credit quality is clearly going to be an issue for the next year or two, and I'm sure there will be opportunities. Our first and foremost issue is just to run our business. I think we have a great opportunity. And the markets we're in are doing very well, I mean the Maryland market, the New Jersey market, eastern Pennsylvania, and even the stability that we have in the Midwest, we don't have, as you know, northern Ohio and Michigan where the default rates are so high. So, I mean we've got stable markets and growing markets, and I think that gives us a real opportunity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're talking about enhanced delivery within the footprint, not outside the footprint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, some of our businesses are outside the footprint, our treasury business, our real estate business, our midland &#x2013; our secured lending business with business credit. So some of our businesses are outside the footprint. But the branch business, I think, we'll just mind the existing footprint for a while.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the residential real estate front, I'm assuming that most of the issues that you're seeing right now are related to Mercantile. Are they mostly Northern Virginia/metro D.C issues, or are there some outside that area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's across the board, but our residential real estate is concentrated in that region. So when we announced the Mercantile deal, they had no nonperformers at all. That was an unsustainable comparison. The nonperformers today would be less than 50% Mercantile, but they were a larger real estate lender than PNC was. So they have contributed significantly to the increase in the NPAs.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sorry, I flailed reaching for the mute button. Was there any impact on the quarter income statement or your book basis for BlackRock associated with the Quellos acquisition in fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, actually there wasn't because what BlackRock ended up doing was the shares they were planning to issue actually went into trust, so there was no underlying write-up with respect to our investment in BlackRock.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That won't incur until those shares actually come out of trust and actually get delivered to the third party.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I was hoping you might be able to provide a little bit more color on your actions against the construction book. Obviously don't really see the delinquencies but I think you said a lot of the 190 million increase in NPLs was related to construction credits. Can you give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing? Are those loans actually gone delinquent, have you run through interest reserves or is this reflective of a reassessment of collateral values?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really reassessment of the collateral value. It's a very interesting portfolio Bob. Frankly, it's lots and lots of small loans. I think we just said the average NPA is 500,000 bucks. The largest deal is $20 million in the whole NPA portfolio. So what you need to do in those cases is you really need to work with those borrowers, and in some cases they're people we've done business with for years and years, you know, and you want them to stay friends for life just because there's a residential real estate downturn doesn't mean you throw everybody out. So it's a real opportunity to make a customer for life.</p>
          <p>But you have to be careful, you work with those people, that you're talking about small loans, 500,000, a million, million and a half apiece. So there's terrific, there's more opportunity to resolve those issues than there would be for real large loans, which is good. But on the other hand, it takes a lot of shoe leather to work with $500,000 loans. So we're just going to be very aggressive in pursuing those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And could you give us an indication of what your total reserves are now set aside against the residential development portfolio?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we do the reserving, we do it by customer, but we just don't have it broken down.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Jim when you talk about comfort with &#x2013; range of consensus and expecting a better year in '08, that's off of the 505 basis, adjusted basis for '07?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then if we think about this quarter's results say ex the cross-border lease charge, $1.09, and you normalize some of the trading results and commercial mortgage-backed activity &#x2013; activities, maybe you get to a run rate that's closer to $1.30. At the same time, I think a lot of investors might view the 2% GDP growth assumption as somewhat optimistic next year. What else is going to help you get to better results in '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we see net interest income growing nicely next year. I think with a reasonable economy, the fee income pieces, especially some of the things I was talking to Nancy about, I think we'll do well. BlackRock ought to have another good year I would think. So when you look at the revenue side, whether it's net interest income or fees, I think with just a reasonable economy, I think we're going to see nice growth there.</p>
          <p>We've been pretty disciplined on the expense side, so I think the expense piece is okay, and I think Rick talked about a 4 to $500 million provision, and I think that leads us to another solid year if we're able to do some other things and be a little more aggressive and have a little luck here and there, I think we can have a real good year, but I think at this point we're comfortable with the range.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Connor with UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Matt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Matt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> a lot of sensitivities in the credit cost and macro assumptions, and can you just give us a sense of if GDP is kind of flat for the year or maybe 1%, how much increase would there be in the credit cost versus the 4 to 500 million that you're assuming?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not certain. I think one of the things that is an advantage to us is that 1 and $2 million loans aren't so sensitive to GDP growth. You're talking about local loans that get handled differently than 40 and $50 million developments. So I don't think we are as sensitive as other people, it obviously wouldn't be positive, but I don't think we're as sensitive as other people. The other thing is that most of our real estate issues are all concentrated &#x2013; most of our real estate in general is concentrated in the mid-Atlantic states, where the real estate market has held up better than the rest of the country. So using a GDP number across the nation probably isn't fair, I don't think, to compare that to what might happen in the mid-Atlantic states. So we're &#x2013; I'm not as concerned as I might be if I had a national franchise or if that was a very large portfolio. It's only 2% of our total loans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean, if we have a mild recession for this year, and it impacts many markets, I think there's some concern that a lot of the markets that we're in, it's just taking a little bit longer for the slowdown to occur us here. Is there &#x2013; have you run some sensitivities to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've run sensitivities, but again, I think it would be worse, but not significantly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just separately, of the $2 billion of residential construction that you disclosed, you said that most of those were small. Should we assume that a vast majority of that are smaller builders versus the bigger ones?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's correct, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just lastly, I think almost every conference call you're asked about PFPC, but as I look back over the last several quarters, the earnings have been roughly flat in that business and I'm just wondering, one, what the prospects are going forward there. And then two, the question you always get, do you reevaluate keeping this business as part of PNC overall?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know, we've &#x2013; we like it as part of PNC significantly. I think we're doing a very good job. Tim and his group have done a very good job in terms of diversifying the revenue stream of that company. Over the last five years they've grown the net income substantially, and now with these two new acquisitions it really differentiates them in a way that they never were before, in terms of in the past they were an information processor, and now they're becoming an analytical provider for their customers. And it opens up a whole new customer base, especially in the separate account and the managed account area, so I think there's a &#x2013; we're optimistic that once those two organizations really get integrated into the systems, there's a tremendous growth opportunity for PFPC. So I didn't imagine that Albridge Solutions could do for us what I think it will do. And it's brought a lot of customers to us too. So I think there's a really, really good future for PFPC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Matt, actually if you look to what happened in 2006, we had about a $14 million tax credit in that business. But the actual &#x2013; if you adjust for that, the actual growth in PFPC year-over-year in net income is about 17%. So while &#x2013; and it's kind of a stepped business; big clients come on, some clients go off. So it just keeps reaching new levels of overall earnings growth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Next question, please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of David Hilder with Bear Stearns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. And I think Matt actually touched on the first part of my question. I guess the second part would be, just wondering how you arrived at the 2% GDP number as the one to base your forecasts around because that would seem to be perhaps more optimistic than others, especially given the outlook for the first half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have a fellow here named Stuart Hoffman who has been named the Economist of the Year by the Wall Street Journal a number of times as the most accurate forecaster and that's his number. So that's how we came to that number. He can talk about that at the &#x2013; at great length.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think the other thing, too, is the GDP forecast isn't as critical. If our GDP growth was actually lower than that, my guess is our net interest income growth is going to be even stronger than what we expect it to be. There probably would be a little bit of an impact on fee income growth and then separately you probably have a higher provision. But I still think in most environments we're still going to be able to deliver good earnings growth in the new year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Your next question comes from the line of Matt Botein, with Highfields Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Matt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's actually Jon Jacobson, with Highfields Capital. Let me first walk you guys through a couple of numbers which may not be 100% accurate but they are sort of directionally correct and then I want to ask a question. So, with PNC stock right now last sale sort of $58, over the last year, stock is down roughly 20% from &#x2013; market capital roughly 25 billion to a little under $20 billion today &#x2013; $20 billion today. At the same time your 43 million shares of BlackRock have appreciated from $150 a share to 210, or roughly 40% over that time period. So that $6.5 billion investment at market a year ago is now worth over 9. So, sort of putting those two numbers together, the non-PNC part &#x2013; sorry the non-BlackRock part of PNC has declined in market value from roughly $18 billion a year ago to just under 11 today, or something like 40%.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; here are the questions. The first question is, do you think that's appropriate, particularly given that you guys have done a much better job sort of managing your business then virtually all of your competitors, number one? And the second question is, does it bother &#x2013; does this bother you as much as it bothers us? And then, I guess, the punchline question is that do you think it's incumbent upon the management to sort of take actions to sort of rectify sort of this disconnect and create value for shareholders?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, one, is that we certainly are disappointed in the valuation of PNC. We think we have done a much better job than our peers in this environment and I think that's &#x2013; I agree with you on that. And that's true whether it's corporately or personally. So &#x2013; because we all are big investors in PNC, and we spend a lot of time managing the risk here, and we do agree that we've done a better job. I think the issues that face the industry are &#x2013; also face PNC as a financial services company. And, you know, although we've not &#x2013; we're not &#x2013; we've not been impacted by subprime and others, we're not immune to the fact that the entire industry's share price performance is down substantially, across the industry. As a matter of fact, I think we ended, our peer group was down 27% last year and I think we were down 11 last year.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. So, we're disappointed. The share price has done better than our peers, but we're still disappointed in that as well. So I think to answer your question, yes, we &#x2013; we are disappointed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Third question in terms of trying to do what we can do to get the share price back, I think we are communicating with our &#x2013; communicating with our shareholders as best we can in order to let them know how the franchise is operating, we've taken some actions on the risk side where the fourth quarter was disappointing, but frankly the year wasn't. And I think &#x2013; I think when we look ahead to 2008 we can make statements about 2008 that I believe other people can't. So I think that's important for us to keep working and keep delivering.</p>
