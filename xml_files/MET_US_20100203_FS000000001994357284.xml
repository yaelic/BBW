          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the MetLife Fourth Quarter Earnings Release. For the conference today, all the participant lines are in a listen-only mode. However, there will be an opportunity for your questions, and instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's Incorporated's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. MetLife Incorporated specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to turn the call now over to Conor Murphy, head of Investor Relations.</p>

          <p>Thank you, John , and good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's Fourth Quarter 2009 Earnings Call. We are delighted to be here with you this morning to talk about our results. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or so-called non-GAAP measures. We have reconciled these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly financial supplement, both of which are available at MetLife.com on our Investor Relations page. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of the net investment related gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period, and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.</p>
          <p>Joining me this morning on the call are Rob Henrikson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Kandarian, our Chief Investment Officer; and Bill Wheeler, our Chief Financial Officer. After our brief prepared comments, we will take your questions. Here with us today to participate in the discussion are other members of management including Bill Mullaney, President of U.S. Business; and Bill Toppeta, President of International.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Conor, and good morning, everyone. Before we get into earnings results, I'd like to take a moment to comment on recent developments that we noted in our press release. As we stated, we are in discussions with AIG over the potential acquisition of ALICO. But we have not reached an agreement, and there is certain -- no certainly &#x2013; no certainty that we will. Beyond that, I have nothing further to say about those discussions. But as I have repeatedly said, MetLife does not need to enter into any M&amp;A transaction to meet our business objectives. And any transaction we undertake would be accretive and financially attractive to our shareholders, would accelerate our strategy and importantly, we would be confident in our ability to execute and realize those transactions' economic value. In other words, our acquisition criteria have not changed.</p>
          <p>Now let's get started on our year-end results. During the fourth quarter, MetLife delivered very strong results, growing premiums, fees and other revenues to 9.3 billion, up 14% over the prior year and 10% sequentially. We converted growth into earnings with operating earnings of 793 million, significantly higher than they were a year ago, and 10% higher than the third quarter of 2009. We have again demonstrated our strength as we grew our businesses and extended our lead in the marketplace. And we did this while maintaining our discipline in underwriting, pricing and risk management.</p>
          <p>Now let me share a few highlights from our businesses. In U.S. Business, results for the quarter were very good. Premiums, fees and other revenues was 7.8 billion. Grew 11% over the prior period driven by 32% growth in Retirement Products, 26% in Corporate Benefit Funding, and 8% in Insurance Products. Within our Insurance Product segment, we enjoyed growth across all product groups. Individual life delivered solid results with increased whole, term and universal life sales. Group life grew by nearly 10%, and non-medical health grew by almost 5% due largely to continued organic growth in our dental business.</p>
          <p>In Retirement Products, the significant top-line growth is due to higher income annuity premiums and fee income on our variable annuities. Total annuity sales were strong again at 4.2 billion, up from the third quarter, and driven mostly by 3.7 billion of variable annuity sales. This performance reflects continued strong sales in our traditional markets, including individual distribution, banks, and wire houses, as well as our expanded partnership with Fidelity. We also continue to experience positive net flows and declining lapse rates, which I believe is a strong demonstration of a continuing flight to MetLife.</p>
          <p>In Corporate Benefit Funding, premiums, fees and other revenues were a billion for the quarter, up from the prior period due to higher structured settlement premiums, another area where we have gained market share, and increased pension closeout premiums, which were strong in both the U.S. and the U.K.</p>
          <p>And rounding out the U.S. Business segments, Auto &amp; Home also had another very solid quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to International, we achieved double-digit growth across all of our regions. Premiums, fees and other revenues grew 22% over the prior period. Driven by strong growth in Mexico, Chile and Brazil, our Latin America region grew its top-line 18%. Asia Pacific grew 25% due to higher sales in Korea and China. In Japan, annuity sales continue to be impacted by current market conditions, with an 18% increase in fixed annuity sales and a 35% decline in variable annuity sales. And in our European region &#x2013; which includes Europe, the Middle East and India &#x2013; premiums, fees and other revenues increased by 32%, driven by growth in India. With momentum in our International businesses, we will continue to invest where we see growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>At our Investor Day in December, we talked about MetLife Bank and how closely the bank ties to our retirement strategy. As you can see, with another solid quarter, the Bank achieved almost 300 million in operating earnings for 2009. Clearly a great result, which we have built from two relatively small, but important, acquisitions.</p>
          <p>In a few moments you'll hear from Steve about our Investment portfolio, but first I'd like to say that the results are good. And as we projected at Investor Day, our credit losses are much lower this quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking back at the full-year 2009, I'm pleased with our strong and consistent performance, particularly during the period marked by unprecedented economic events. We grew our premiums, fees and other revenues to 34 billion, up 4% over 2008. Our U.S. annuity sales totaled 21 billion, an increase of 10% over 2008. And our book value is recovering, up 37% from year-end 2008. During this time, MetLife has truly distinguished itself by increasing market share and growing our business when others could not, while at the same time practicing sound risk management and expense control. As we shared with you at Investor Day, we are proud of the success of our Operational Excellence initiative, surpassing our initial goal one year ahead of schedule, and raising the bar relative to both expense management and operational efficiencies going forward. As we move forward to 2010, let me assure you that we will exercise the same discipline that led us through the crisis and allowed us to extend our lead in the marketplace. I believe we are well positioned for future growth. Backed by a strong brand, solid financial position and a talented and dedicated management team, we have the foundation to create an even stronger, more valued and more profitable MetLife.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob. I would like to spend a few minutes reviewing the key components of our investment results for the quarter. First let me start with a comment on variable investment income. Pre-tax variable investment income for the fourth quarter was $212 million, which is above plan by $62 million, primarily from strong corporate joint venture and hedge fund returns, partially offset by continued negative real estate fund returns.</p>
          <p>Let me touch on our investment activity during the quarter. As discussed at Investor Day, we are reducing our cash position and purchasing spread assets as markets have stabilized. During the fourth quarter, we reinvested approximately $1.6 billion of cash in spread assets. Our overall investment yield for spread assets during the quarter, excluding short-term portfolios such as securities lending, was approximately 5.2%.</p>
          <p>Now let me cover investment losses for the quarter. Gross investment losses continued to decline, and were $272 million. Write-downs also continued to decline, and were $297 million. These write-downs included $164 million in structured finance securities, $52 million from the strengthening of the mortgage valuation allowance, and $16 million of corporate securities. Write-downs also included $49 million of hybrid securities and $16 million of partnerships in equity securities, which were impaired because of the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below amortized cost. Overall gross investment losses and impairments for Q4, excluding derivatives, were at the lower end of the post-tax range discussed at Investor Day. Losses from derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting were $810 million. This was primarily attributable to pre-tax losses of $383 million caused by higher interest rates and $327 million due to an improvement in MetLife's own credit spread and its impact on the valuation of certain insurance liabilities.</p>
          <p>Gross unrealized losses continued to decline, and were $10.8 billion at December 31, down from $11.8 billion at September 30, as spreads declined across all sectors. For example, spreads for BBB-rated corporate bonds in CMBS declined about 60 basis points during the quarter. However, the gross unrealized gain decreased to $8.6 billion due to higher interest rates. As a result, the net unrealized loss increased slightly to $2.2 billion from $1.6 billion at September 30.</p>
          <p>Finally, I'd like to touch briefly upon our commercial mortgage holdings. During the fourth quarter, we had no delinquencies in our U.S. portfolio, and total delinquencies were only $8 million, or two basis points on the overall portfolio. While we expect that delinquencies may increase in 2010, we view the level of delinquencies as manageable, particularly given our commercial mortgage valuation allowance of approximately $590 million. This allowance represents 1.7% of our portfolio, which we believe would cover a 5.7% default rate. The loan-to-value ratio of our portfolio increased slightly to 68% from 67%, based on a rolling four quarter valuation process, as the pace of value declines slowed. We estimate that market values will decline an additional 5% during 2010.</p>
          <p>Our average debt service coverage ratio remains strong at 2.2 times and loans above 80% loan-to-value, had an average coverage ratio of 1.5 times. Near-term maturities remain manageable with only $2.1 billion maturing in 2010.</p>
          <p>While we expect that the real estate sector will remain challenged, we are confident that our commercial mortgage portfolio will outperform the overall market.</p>
          <p>With that, I will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. MetLife reported $0.96 of operating earnings per share for the fourth quarter, and $2.87 for the full year 2009, which are above our Investor Day estimates. As I think you will see, our business has performed well in the quarter. This morning I will walk through our financial results and point out some highlights, as well as some unusual items which occurred during the fourth quarter. Before I get started, I just want to remind you that I will now be speaking to our new U.S. Business, which consists of Insurance Products, Retirement Products, Corporate Benefit Funding, and Auto &amp; Home. Also, as we had mentioned on last quarter's call, and again at Investor Day, MetLife Bank has become more impactful to our financial results. And so with the fourth quarter of 2009, we have started separating the Bank within Banking, Corporate &amp; Other in our QFS. And so I will speak to the Bank's results as well.</p>
          <p>With that, let's get started. Let's begin with premiums, fees and other revenues. Premiums, fees and other revenues, which totaled 9.3 billion in the fourth quarter, are up 14% from the fourth quarter of last year, which is an excellent result. For the full year, our top-line revenues totaled 34 billion, a 4% increase over 2008.</p>
          <p>Total premiums, fees and other revenues for U.S. Business of 7.8 billion reflect an 11% increase over the fourth quarter of 2008. The growth in Insurance Products revenues of 8% in the fourth quarter reflects across the board strength in group life, individual life and non-medical health. Retirement Products revenue increase of 32% was driven by fee growth due to positive net flows and higher separate account investment returns in annuities, as well as an increase in income annuity premiums. Revenue growth in Corporate Benefit Funding of 26% was driven by strong structured settlement premiums in the current quarter.</p>
          <p>International's premiums, fees and other revenue are up 22% over the fourth quarter of 2008 on a reported basis, and 13% on a constant currency basis driven by growth across all three International regions.</p>
          <p>MetLife Bank's fees and other revenues from both forward and reverse mortgage activity increased to 258 million from 94 million in the prior-year period, an increase of 175%.</p>
          <p>Turning to our operating margins, let's start with our underwriting results. In U.S. Business, our mortality results were very strong in both group life and individual life, with the full-year mortality ratios coming in below Investor Day ranges. The group life mortality ratio for the quarter was 89.7%, bringing the full-year ratio to 90.3%, versus our estimated range of 91 to 93%. Our individual mortality ratio for the quarter was 81.1%, bringing the full-year ratio to 82.5, versus our estimated range of 84 to 86.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned on Investor Day, historically we spoke about group disability morbidity ratios. Now that our dental business has become just as important as our disability business in terms of the bottom line of &#x2013; at MetLife, for non-medical health we will discuss a total benefits ratio that includes dental, disability and other non-medical health coverages such as long-term care; which we think is a better indicator of morbidity trends across the products in this segment. At 90.2% for the fourth quarter, this total benefits ratio is up from 86.3% in the prior-year quarter, and that was driven by higher dental claims activity and weaker disability margins during the recession.</p>
          <p>Turning to our Auto &amp; Home business, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, while up, remained strong at 92.3% for the fourth quarter. This compares to last year's result of 84.9%. Also, included in this combined ratio result is a non-cat prior accident year reserve release of 9% -- of 9 million after tax, compared to a 27 million after tax release in the prior-year period.</p>
          <p>Moving to investment spreads. As Steve mentioned, investment spreads improved this quarter as we continue to shift funds from cash and government securities to higher yielding investments. In addition, variable investment income continues to improve. With regard to variable investment income, as Steve explained, we again saw mixed performance of certain variable alternative asset classes this quarter. Strong returns on corporate joint ventures and hedge funds were partially offset by negative returns in real estate. For the quarter, variable investment income after tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs was 40 million bucks, or $0.05 per share, above the 2009 quarterly plan.</p>
          <p>Moving to expenses, our Operational Excellence initiative continues to prove successful, but we had some unusual items flowing through expenses this quarter which drove our reported expenses up. Expenses at MetLife Bank were higher this quarter as compared to the prior-year due to the significant growth in that business. And as I have mentioned in previous quarters, pension and post-retirement benefit costs were also up from the prior-year. This quarter we incurred $18 million after tax in Operational Excellence charges, which consisted mainly of real estate write-downs. We also had certain one-time expenses this quarter that amounted to $44 million after tax. Together, these items amounted to $0.08 per share. All of these expenses appear in Corporate &amp; Other.</p>
          <p>Turning to our bottom-line results, we earned 793 million in operating income, or $0.96 per share. If you recall on -- at Investor Day, we noted that we anticipated a positive impact from annual DAC unlockings and other adjustments which we did not yet include in our projected operating earnings range because the amount was not yet final. This ultimately added $0.12 to our operating earnings. Offsetting this is an adjustment made in our International Business relating to a change in assumptions for measuring the effects of inflation on inflation-indexed securities in Chile, Argentina and Mexico. This reduced earnings by $0.13 per share. When we normalize for these two items as well as the other factors described earlier, we are still above our Investor Day estimates.</p>
          <p>With regard to investment gains and losses, in the fourth quarter we had after tax net realized investment losses of 557 million, which included derivative losses of 527 million after tax. As Steve mentioned, the derivative losses were primarily attributable to a tightening of MetLife's own credit spread, which amounted to 213 million after tax, and a rise in interest rates impacting our interest rate swaps and floors. MetLife uses derivatives to hedge a number of its risks. Changes in the values of these derivatives are, in general, offset on an economic basis across various assets and liabilities. Impairments were 193 million after tax in the fourth quarter, and have been declining each quarter in 2009.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to take a moment to talk about cash and capital. For the fourth quarter, statutory -- preliminary statutory operating earnings are an estimated $730 million. For the full year 2009, we had preliminary statutory operating earnings of approximately 3.3 billion after tax, and preliminary net income of approximately 1.8 billion after tax. Total adjusted statutory capital and surplus at year-end is approximately 21 billion.</p>
          <p>Cash and liquid assets at the holding company at year-end totaled 3.8 billion. During the fourth quarter, the holding company paid our annual common stock dividend, amounting to just over 600 million. We also invested 375 million into Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, or MLIC, in the form of surplus notes during the quarter.</p>
          <p>We have not finished our RBC calculations for year-end 2009, but based on our work to-date, we are estimating that consolidated RBC will end the year at approximately 400, significantly above the 355 to 375 range provided at Investor Day. The increase was largely driven by better than expected results in the NAIC re-rating of RMBS securities, as well as generally stronger fundamentals.</p>
          <p>I'd like to point out one thing about our book value. Book value per share including AOCI was $37.96 at year-end, and that's a little lower than our Investor Day projection. This was an -- almost entirely driven by an overall increase in interest rates during December. The general account, which was essentially at break-even just before Investor Day, moved to a small unrealized loss at quarter-end. By the way, since quarter-end, the general account has swung back to an unrealized gain.</p>
          <p>In summary, our revenue growth remains strong, our investment performance has improved and our earnings have grown considerably over the course of 2009.</p>
          <p>And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. Over the past month or so we've seen a broad range of different regulatory and tax proposals: financial services responsibility fees, the Volcker rule, reduction in dividends received deductions. Is it possible to discuss the potential impact of those proposals on your fundamental outlook? I know it's still very early stages, but any perspective to help dimension that would be very helpful. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Nigel, I'm sorry, the -- a little bit of an echo here. I think what you asked was -- just in case not everybody heard, I think what you asked is about the financial responsibility fee, and the &#x2013; and then also the recent Administration proposal regarding taxes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The financial responsibility fee, I'll -- I'm sure Rob will maybe have a comment about this. I &#x2013; if &#x2013; I would like to think that that number would be zero, given the, given what it's labeled. But the &#x2013; but I think based on everybody's assumptions regarding how that will be interpreted and implemented, it will have a relatively modest effect on our results. In all &#x2013; but it frankly all depends on what the details are, in terms of do they exclude insurance liabilities. I read something the other day which said they might exclude repos, which if -- consistent with that would mean you would also exclude securities lending footings. So I think &#x2013; so if you're really just talking about our debt balances that would be affected by the fee, which I think that's where that -- the argument ultimately goes, it's a really modest number. We're talking a few pennies. If &#x2013; but again, I'm not sure why we would pay anything.</p>
          <p>With regard to the Administration's tax proposals, again, the details are really preliminary. I would say with regard to the COLI proposal or anything to do with the IOLI, those are immaterial to us and I think in some ways, would obviously help us.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; with regard to the DRD benefit, our total benefit that we received from the dividends received deduction today is approximately $0.20 annually. And so I don't -- so that's what's potentially at risk. It's not clear to me if the proposal would assume the assumption of the loss of all that or a piece of it. That's hard to say. And I think, though, the silver lining here maybe is that as marginal tax rates go up on individuals, that probably on the margin increases the demand for a lot of our insurance products. And so there may be -- though there're obviously some ways we get penalized in this tax bill, there may be some benefits as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Nigel, only because Bill said I'd have something to say about this, I would say he's -- I can't improve on his answer in any way other than just to point out that as he stated -- but there are many discussions going on about this in terms of definitions, unintended consequences and so forth. And those discussions are occurring with Treasury, with various people on the Hill who have responsibilities relative to the committees that are overseeing this, and so forth. So I would say stay tuned. But Bill's answers are right on.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning. A few questions. Maybe the most important is as the M&amp;A environment is changing, you mentioned on the call and in your press release that any transaction needs to meet your criteria. And so when I evaluate a transaction, I like to know what is the return on invested capital. So if you were to do a deal, any deal, what type of return would you want on your capital and over what timeframe? And I have some follow-up questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is Bill. Andrew, I just apologize. And I don't mean to be -- to duck you. Obviously at the right time I'd be happy to answer that question. I just don't want to give any more back-door color on the discussions we're currently having with AIG. So -- regarding ALICO. So if you don't mind, I'd just as soon skip that one to another day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mind, but I guess we'll have to skip it anyway. All right. With regard to the investment portfolio, and Steve gave some excellent color around the commercial mortgage loan portfolio, but just looking at the losses, you had about 1.3 billion in 4Q '08. It went down to 1.2 billion in 3Q '09. And then this quarter, you're looking at less than 600 million. The guidance was for about 1 billion in after tax investment losses, in economic investment losses in '10. So are -- does that indicate that you're right on track for that? Maybe just a little color of how you feel about that guidance now?</p>

          <p>Andrew, it's Steve. The investment losses are trending down nicely. We're seeing our impairment number coming down, our loss number coming down, and actually some of our gains going up. So it's reflecting the marketplace overall, especially the tighter spread, tighter spreads we're seeing in the marketplace. And in terms of what we're projecting and thinking about for the coming year, or the current year I should say, we think the trend will continue to improve. That's based upon our view of the overall economy, which is that there'll be a slow recovery, but a slow and steady recovery. And obviously if there's a faster recovery, the numbers could get even better. If there is a double dip, which we're not projecting, they could turn around and get worse. But we've seen some real improvement over the course of the year. And even some of the securities that we impair still, or most of them, are still paying us in full. And we're very hopeful in terms of how this will play out over time.</p>

          <p>Okay. And just lastly with regard to RBC, Bill mentioned about a 400% ratio at the end of the year, cash and liquidity at the hold co of about 3.8 billion. So just in terms of an update, what is your redeployable capital at the end of the year? And do you anticipate, given the higher RBC ratio, any need to downstream money to the Life Cos during the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, redeployable capital, I -- do you mean excess capital?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excess capital would be fine.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I would &#x2013; just -- new definitions worry me. They &#x2013; well I think we've said a lot. A couple things. A couple lines in the sand here. We need to hold 750 million minimum of cash at the holding company. So 3.8 billion times -- minus 750 is just a little over three bil [billion], obviously. We've also said many times we view the line in the sand regarding RBC is 350 consolidated -- on a consolidated basis. Obviously, that turns out to be about 50 RBC points higher where we are today, and you can think 60 bucks an RBC point. So that's three bil. It's -- in terms of do I think we'll need to make investments down in the insurance subs, I do not. I expect those businesses to be -- have a respectable level of profitability in 2010. But obviously, this is the highest RBC -- consolidated RBC ratio we've ever posted. So that we have more cushion down in those businesses than we've really ever had. And the -- so I don't think we'll have to put money down. In fact, I fully expect to pay meaningful dividends up to the holding company in 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. First just a quick follow-up to Nigel's question about the regulatory reforms. I'm not sure you commented on the one that he had mentioned, the Volcker changes around hedge funds and corporate JVs. Is there going to be any impact as far as you can tell on your investment strategies as it relates to your alternative portfolio? And then I'll have a follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Suneet, it -- obviously the details are to come. We don't know how this will impact us, if at all. As you know, we do invest in hedge funds. We have about 1.3 billion currently outstanding in hedge funds. The proprietary trading aspect wouldn't really apply to us. So we're sort of staying tuned. But we are regulated, of course, by the states, and we have RBC charges against any and all assets that we purchase. So I would think the logic would suggest this would not touch us. But again, we'll have to see how the bill is written.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing that, Suneet, I'd add to that is I think the thesis was investing that you do on behalf of your clients or customers versus your own account. Well, all our invest &#x2013; all of our investing is on behalf of our customers and clients. We don't have some prop desk. So there -- so I think that's a pretty key distinction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just on the investment portfolio, Steve, I think you mentioned 1.6 billion of cash invested in the fourth quarter. Just wondering what the new money investment rate on that was, and where you put it to work in terms of asset class? And then as it relates to the consolidated yield, ex the short-term portfolio of 5.2%, how does that compare to your pricing assumptions as you think about managing the business? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Suneet, we -- we're investing across a broad array of assets, right, the entire sort of array that we normally invest in. And our yield is about 5.2% when you exclude things like securities lending. And as of now, it's hard to know exactly where that's going to go in the current year, but we're certainly seeing a little tick-up here in interest rates. But we are also seeing spreads tightening. And I'm not quite sure I understood the last part of your question regarding what this means for -- were you referring to the liability side, how we're doing crediting rates? I wasn't quite sure what you were saying there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, actually, the other question was where &#x2013; at what rate did you put the 1.6 billion? I think the 5.2% relates to that total portfolio. As it relates to the other question, yeah, I just assume that you have in your pricing models some sort of a yield assumption -- we assume that we're going to get this level of yield. And I'm just wondering what that number is, if you can give a range, as it compares to the 5.2%? That's all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's -- well, there's no simple number there. Obviously, every product we sell has different duration characteristics and the portfolio make-up is quite different in terms of how much would be in Treasuries, or private equities, or corporates or what have you. So every product has a different sort of target new money yield. I would say this, though. Keep in mind, any product we have that has, sort of I would say a fixed component to it, that's like a fixed annuity or a structured settlement, those get repriced pretty continuously. It's not literally every day, but certainly close to every day. And they -- and so &#x2013; and we &#x2013; and whatever the new money yields are at that time get factored into our pricing. And so that we earn our requisite spread. So it's really quite dynamic in terms of how we manage pricing there. And as you -- I think we've said on a number of occasions this whole year, we've been raising prices, or in some ways lowering crediting rates, on our products all year pretty much across the board. And so it &#x2013; so that's something just to factor. When you think about our revenue growth here, especially with the backdrop of the kind of pricing changes we've made, it's really pretty impressive.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I was hoping if you could comment on the financial leverage of MetLife. What is the number that you're looking at? I know that there's some adjustments that you would make to that. And then also just wondering how much debt and hybrid capacity you'd have from those numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so, I &#x2013; not to give anybody a little free advertising, but we generally look at the Moody's leverage ratio, and they -- as sort of our expected -- as sort of how to discuss it. As you're right, Darin, there's a lot of different ways to calculate leverage, and everybody does it a little differently. On a Moody's leverage ratio basis, we are just under 30%. At a debt leverage ratio, we're under -- a little under 30%. And so I would say as of now, based on that ratio, our current capacity for more debt or hybrid financing is nearly zero.</p>
          <p>Keep in mind one thing, though, and this is sort of a conscious decision we made. We -- at the beginning of 2009 in the throes of the financial crisis, we said, 'you know, if we have an ability to go issue debt or raise money, raise cash to deal with whatever problems occur, we're going to do that'. Because our debt leverage ratio at the end of 2008 was below 25%, I think, or around 25. So we consciously issued securities, moved up the leverage ratio, and then warehoused that cash on our balance sheet. So that's why we have such a big cash balance at the holding company now. So we let the leverage ratio go up. Well the good news is happily we needed almost none of that money. Okay, we did put a little down on the insurance subs at year-end as I discussed, but the rest of it's still sitting there. So if you think about it, I -- that's where my debt capacity went. Okay. It's now sitting in cash. I've already used it, and it's sitting in cash at my holding company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. And just a quick question turning to the Auto &amp; Home segment. Overall results looked good, but as I look at the Auto segment, the combined ratio ticked up above 100%. Anything happening there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Bill Moore, Darin. Let me start by saying the fourth quarter is really seasonally the worst quarter for us, for Auto, and the best quarter for Homeowners. Our combined ratio target for the fourth quarter of '09 was actually about 98. Now that being said, there was about an 8.5 point change from Q4 '08 to Q4 '09, and the drivers of that change look like this: it's about three points less for prior-year development, which was still favorable as you're aware; we had about two points from one-time items; and then the remaining 3.5 points was from an increase in non-cat accident year loss ratio, of about which one point was adverse weather and then the other two points came from an increase in auto injury cost, which we're also seeing in the industry and we're addressing through pricing. Now looking at the year, which removes the seasonality, the Auto combined ratio came in at 94.7, which is an excellent result and still below our long-term target of 96.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I want to actually go back to -- along Andrew's lines and maybe just help with the framework here. On capital, if you add up what's excess, or I should say capital margin, at the insurance company plus the holding company cash, less the 750 million that you typically think about as one year's fixed charges, you get down to about a $6 billion number, and obviously you need to keep a margin. But is there any framework that you can give us in terms of how you think about what would be a deployable number on an acquisition, or what have you, out of that $6 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yeah, obviously, the excess at the holding company is available for -- to do other things with. So that's -- and should you draw it all down? Should you draw some of it down? Well that's obviously situational. The stuff that's at the insurance company, we'll be able to access that, obviously, through dividends in 2010. But as long as it's in the insurance sub, we'll -- we're &#x2013; I -- not much I can do with it. So obviously &#x2013; but some of it will come out in 2010. I'll have to do &#x2013; use some of that money to pay interest and preferred and common dividends at the holding company. So -- but obviously, some of that's available during 2010 to use for other purposes. So -- but again, I would say that's situational.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just to elaborate, would you be comfortable using that $3 billion at the holding company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ultimately, sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Question for Steve. Based on your forecast of real estate, I think you mentioned you see another 5% down, commercial real estate. Based on that assumption, would it be your assumption that we would continue to see further write-downs in the real estate funds, or do we think that with the write-downs that we showed in the fourth quarter that we're kind of factoring that in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As to the real estate funds, I'd say we've taken a large amount of write-downs to date. And there could be some more coming in the current year, but I would not anticipate it being the same level certainly as 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just on the delinquency build on commercial mortgage loans, it looks like you added about 50 million to that allowance. What is the commentary on that? Given where you are in terms of the actual delinquencies in the portfolio, do we expect to see continued build in that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We look forward 12 months, we put that number together. And the delinquencies, as I mentioned, are very small, only $8 million. All offshore at this point in time. But real estate tends to have a lag effect, and as the economy dips, eventually commercial real estate mortgages will default in some cases. But it tends to happen over a period of time, over a couple-year period of time. So we think this reserve is a adequate reserve, a conservative reserve, but a good reserve. And we'll re-evaluate it every quarter. And based upon market conditions, we'll make changes up or down as time goes on.</p>

          <p>Hey, good morning, everybody &#x2013; excuse me. I've got a couple of questions. I think they're really quick. How much was the negative component in variable investment income from the real estate funds in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was a couple hundred million dollars.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. How much was the benefit from the Pimco RMBS re-rating on the risk-based capital ratio? And related to that, do you think the rating agencies give you credit for that, or give the industry credit for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you thought this -- I thought you said this was going to be quick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, well, I guess the first part of that's quick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well as I start my soliloquy, the -- I think on Investor Day we said that the benefit from the NAIC re-rating would be between 15 and 20 RBC points. It's better than that. The number isn't final yet, obviously, but it's clearly better. I would tell you, since you've given me this opportunity, I would say I want people to understand something about this, because I think it sometimes get lost here. Somebody -- somehow this is perceived as a freebie. We had substantial ratings migration in the RMBS sector during 2009. We did get an adjustment from the NAIC re-rating process. But even net of all that, the increase in capital, or the capital charge if you will, from that ratings migration on a net basis was still over $1 billion. So ratings migration still hurt us significantly in terms of our capital levels in 2009. So it's -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>so it's not that big of a deal. I would say in terms of do the rating agencies give you credit for it, you know, I don't really get a straight -- I don't think you ever -- you're ever going to get quite a straight answer from them. I don't think they're just going to ever say yes, unequivocally. I do think they understand the point of why this was done. And I think depending on who you talk to inside the rating agencies, they accept the methodology. And the fact that given what uniquely, what's happened to RMBS that the ratings and the way they &#x2013; the rating agency ratings versus the way they used to match up with the NAIC ratings doesn't really work anymore. That methodology's sort of broken. I think you'll get consensus on that. I do, effectively, think they will give us credit for it, but they'll look at it closely. And obviously, I -- time will tell in terms of how these securities continue to perform. If they are consistent with the NAIC's re-rating process, and we think they will be, I &#x2013; ultimately, of course, they'll give credit for it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Okay. And then two more, just quick ones. And I don't want to get into ALICO, but just thinking about potential financing for any sort of deal, the -- two questions. One, would you entertain the idea of selling any of your current businesses to help generate cash to finance something else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I have a list here. I can name them now. They -- see if I can scare everybody. No, look, the answer &#x2013; I really -- we really don't want to talk about this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But the answer's no.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And then it just -- I'll try one more. You've got a lot of extra capital that doesn't get credit for, in risk-based capital or other places, in your off-shore reinsurance entity. I think at year-end you put around a $2 billion number on that. Wondering if any of that capital is available to the holding company or otherwise if needed for some other reason?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess it's theoretically available, but that's just not something we would ever do. I think that's a really, really bad risk management practice. So  --</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I feel a little foolish too. They -- when we -- obviously to get credit for it, we need to put the capital down before year-end, okay. So on December 28, I'm look at our -- my Treasurer, slightly -- just before year-end we'd said, well, we think the RBC ratio looks good, but obviously the numbers aren't final and things can jump around. So let's be safe rather than sorry, and let's put some money down. We -- and in hindsight, we didn't need to do that. And so I think the good news is we can probably get it back out relatively quickly, but we clearly didn't need to do it. And by the way, that 375, just to put it in context, that's roughly six-plus points of RBC. So we clearly didn't need to do it.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Just, I want to clarify a couple points. Bill, in terms of a target capital structure with this deal out there, what Moodys will hold you to, obviously the 30% debt, if you can do the 10% hybrids on top of that is question number one? Question two is maybe for Rob, is to talk a little bit more about the dental business. This is really the first time you held it out there as how much money you make. If you can just expand a little bit? I'm not going to use the word color. I don't think any of us want to hear that one again. But perhaps expand a little bit on what's driving the dental business? And you've also talked about potentially doing some M&amp;A there. So not, maybe, on the ALICO situation, but perhaps some of the other opportunities you're looking at to accelerate the growth of MetLife right now? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I really don't want to talk about ALICO, but I don't want to leave &#x2013; or &#x2013; and &#x2013; or theoretical financing situations. But I just would remind everybody, if you issue common, you create debt capacity, and you create hybrid capacity. So -- by putting that additional common footings out there. So it &#x2013; that's obviously how the math works. In terms of -- I talked about -- so on our current balance sheet today, I don't think we have any incremental debt or hybrid capacity. That doesn't mean we wouldn't have some created by issuing common. So, just so -- hopefully that's clear to people.</p>

          <p>Colin, let me pass the dental question to Bill Mullaney.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Colin, just to give you some perspective, at Investor Day we talked about changing the benefit ratio that we report out, moving away from the disability ratio to a non-medical health ratio. And the reason we did that is in non-medical health, dental is about 50% of the total premium today. Disability premium is less than 25% of non-medical health, and less than 5% of U.S. Business overall. And so the dental business over the last several years because of the growth that we've gotten &#x2013; primarily organic growth but also from a small acquisition that we did in 2008 &#x2013; has become an in very &#x2013; a very important part of the U.S. Business growth story.</p>
          <p>In terms of our outlook for dental going forward, as you know, dental faced some pressure from an earnings perspective in 2009. We saw utilization spike up. We think directly related to the increase in unemployment. However, that has started to stabilize as we look at the fourth quarter. And we've taken some significant pricing actions, both from a renewal perspective, as well as a new business perspective, going into 2010. So we expect earnings on that business to begin to rebound.</p>
          <p>In terms of acquisitions for that business, it's a great business for us as we've talked about before. It's been a strong grower. It's got a very high ROE because the capital requirements for dental are low. The acquisition that we did in 2008 which was a small DHMO acquisition in some key states in the West and the Southwest, not only helped us to grow the acquired business faster, but it gave us entree into customers that we were not able to quote on before for our traditional PPO business because we didn't have the DHMO capabilities. So if we could do other acquisitions like that, that would help to expand out our DHMO capability as well as our traditional dental capability in other markets, we would certainly do that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Bill, can you just perhaps -- what is a high ROE for you? Is that a 15 to 20% ROE, if I think of Met's long-term target now at 12 to 13?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">

          <p>Thank you. And then one -- just one quick follow-up for Steve Kandarian. With the defaults on Peter Cooper, can you just reiterate perhaps one more time so I'll sleep better that Met has no residual exposure to that?</p>

          <p>Colin, that's correct. We sold that property. It was a cash sale. We did not buy, for example, any of the CMBS that was issued on that sale. And all of our purchase price consideration was received at closing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. We talked a little bit about some of the tax and regulatory proposals, but given that there are a lot of things potentially floating out there in terms of regulatory reform and that some of the changes may carry various costs or burdens or limitations for banks or bank holding companies, I'm wondering how wedded you are necessarily to keeping the Bank and being a bank holding company under all scenarios? I know you're pretty pleased with the way that's running now, but is there a limit to the inconvenience, I guess, you would accept under new regulatory scenarios?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well let me take a crack at that. In the first place, with the discussions occurring in Washington now, and I would broaden that -- just emphasize that you've got a lot of people involved in discussions on this whole topic. And therefore it's moving and quite fluid. And I would say it's -- it probably moves in terms of rhetoric a little bit differently since recent elections have changed a little bit the landscape in terms of people being willing to change rhetoric and compromise and so forth and so on. So we like the Bank very much. The fact that we're federally regulated as a bank holding company in and of itself has caused really no problems for us in terms of moving forward, and we don't see that it would cause problems anyway.</p>
          <p>Much of the discussion going back -- if you put it all together over the last several months, one would wonder whether it made any difference whether you were a bank holding company or not. And so certainly it wouldn't make any sense to divest something under the theory that that would somehow insulate from all regulatory reform, and then turn around in the end to see that you've sold something that had a great deal of value, was strategically of value and helped us to cross-sell products and services. So we're always looking at the landscape, always looking at the value. If, in fact, this somehow created some sort of value deterioration for our shareholders, obviously we would take whatever action is necessary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. Just one other question. You did see an improvement in individual life sales this quarter, at least year-over-year. Does that reflect the market coming back a little bit, or did you have some company-specific things at work here? Or how should we read that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Bill Mullaney. Yeah, individual sales did improve. We saw individual sales up about 13% over the last quarter, and 17% up year-over-year. A lot of that came from whole life. Whole life sales were up a lot in both our career agency as well as our third-party channel. We also saw an increase in term sales which came primarily from third-party, and an increase in universal life sales. And then a decrease in variable sales because of the changes in the equity market. So we're pretty happy with what we're seeing in the individual life market. We've made some changes to our products, and some changes to our pricing; increasing prices on certain products in certain segments to improve the returns. So to play off something that Bill Wheeler said earlier, we have a pretty dynamic approach to pricing all of our products. And from a life insurance perspective, we've been taking a look at some of the returns that we've been making and changing our prices to improve some of the returns. And despite that, we are seeing increased sales, which we think is a function of our brand and a flight to quality.</p>

          <p>Our final question will come from Tom Gallagher, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Bill, I wanted to come back to a comment you made on your hold co cash position. I think your response was that the full, I believe it's three to four billion of excess cash at the holding company would ultimately be available for redeployment. What do you mean by ultimately? Is the thought that the three to four bil is a real nice cushion to have just given the economic uncertainty, so you'd rather sit on that for the time being? Or can you just elaborate it in terms of how you're thinking about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, I shouldn't laugh when the mic's on. They &#x2013; just so it's clear, it's -- because you used the same term, three to four, we have 3.8 of cash at the holding company. We need 750. So the excess in my mind is three. And it is excess. And so it is available. The timing of that, again, I again -- obviously for me to try to say what's near-term versus long-term just invites speculation about ALICO, which I'm really not going to do. But in my mind, that is all excess -- that really is excess capital, and it's ultimately available. Whether I spend it sooner rather than later, that's a judgment call we'll make.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Bill, so bottom line is given the strong RBC, other potential levers, you'd be comfortable -- forget about ALICO, you'd be comfortable using the excess cash over the 750 million to do something with that immediately? So you don't feel the need to sit on dry powder, per se?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I didn't say immediately. But I did say ultimately, and I think we know the difference there. So it -- but it is excess cash.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just one question for Steve on the mortgage reserve and your comment on the default rate. I just want to make sure I understand the math. So you were saying your mortgage -- current mortgage reserve you think would cover a 5.7% default rate. And I get the fact that that's because you expect to have recoveries because you have pretty good LTVs. But can you tell me what your recovery assumption would be embedded in the &#x2013; in that comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. It's -- we're assuming a 30% loss/70% recovery based upon the nature of these mortgages that we're looking at and historical norms, and past cycles and so on. And let me actually take the opportunity just to go back to Colin's question for one second on Peter Cooper/Stuy Town. I think most of you know there is a lawsuit outstanding in which we are a named party. It relates to some rather complicated tax issues. I won't go into the details of that, but our exposure based upon our analysis is a relatively small number should the plaintiffs be successful in that lawsuit. It'd be less than 1% of the sale price of that property. So we view it as being relatively immaterial.</p>
