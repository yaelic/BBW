          <p>A warm welcome to our investors and analysts. You are listening to SingTel's earnings conference call for the quarter ended 30 June 2008.</p>
          <p>My name Yan Fong. Let me introduce the panel members on the call. Ms. Chua Sock Koong, Group CEO; Ms. Jeann Low, the Group CFO <mark type="inaudible" /> and Optus's CFO; Mr. Allen Lew, CEO Singapore; Mr. Yang Pon Moon, VP Regional Op; Ms. Kow Kaw Kik, CFO Singapore; and joining us from Sydney, Mr. Paul O'Sullivan, CEO Optus; and Mr. Warren Hardy, MD, Consumer. Also assisting them are representatives from the senior management team.</p>
          <p>Before we start rolling in the questions, I would like to invite Sock Koong to share some highlights from this set of results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. We reported our results for the quarter ended June '08 this morning and let me just talk to some of the key highlights. The group's earnings for this quarter were flat and that's largely been impacted by regional currencies and we've also seen competition in Indonesia, affecting telecom sales earnings.</p>
          <p>Group revenues increased by 6%, reflecting steady growth in Singapore and Australia. Underlying net profits would have grown by 6%, if not for the depreciation in the regional currency. Financial impact of the Australia dollar movement for this quarter was quite minimal.</p>
          <p>Let me just talk briefly about Singapore. Revenues were up 8%; that's driven by growth in both telco and IT businesses. Operational EBITDA here up 1% and that's despite costs incurred in preparation for mobile number portability and higher content acquisition costs. In Australia, we have revenue growth of 3% and with strong mobile service revenue growth on very strong customer acquisitions, and that helped offset the impact of mobile termination rates decline. And also Optus's exit from consumer fixed line retail business. EBITDA rose 3% and margins have been maintained at 25.3%.</p>
          <p>So the group and its associates as we announced yesterday have 198 million mobile customers; that's up 45% from last year. The earnings from the regional mobile associates declined by 12%. And as I mentioned earlier, that's due to weaker regional currency, lower contribution from Telkomsel and Globe, and also losses from Warid, which was acquired in September last year.</p>
          <p>Just want to highlight that overseas operations now contribute 74% of our proportionate EBITDA.</p>
          <p>So with that again, I'll hand over to Yang Fong, <mark type="inaudible" /> who is my colleague. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you ma'am. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> First question we have from Christian Guerra. Over to you, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have three questions for you this morning. Firstly on IT services in Singapore, great result with revenue in the quarter up 20%. Just wondering if you could please comment on the outlook for forward orders given the slowing economy in Singapore, particularly given the low GDP growth we saw in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Secondly, on capital management at the group level, clearly balance sheet settings are looking very comfortable. Just wondering whether there is any chance of further capital management from the group before the next full-year result.</p>
          <p>And thirdly on Optus, a question for Paul O'Sullivan. Paul we've had a couple of fairly well publicized network outages in recent months. Obviously the one in Queensland back in July and more recently with the 3G network down the East Coast. Now I know you obviously can't control sort of people cutting your cables in the case of Queensland, but the fact that the redundancy failed is a bit of a concern. Just wondering if you could maybe shed some light on what's going on there and whether you expect to lose any business as a result of that Queensland outage in particular. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Christian, this is Allen here; I'll answer the IT questions and I'll pass on to my colleagues. In terms of our IT services in Singapore, I can't give you a forecast going ahead in terms of the growth potential of this business, but I think it's important for everybody on the call to recognize that our IT services business is not just Singapore focused. It has a number of countries -- in China, in Hong Kong, in Middle East, in Australia -- where it does have customers as well. So in that sense it is not dependent solely on GDP growth in Singapore. So I think you need to factor that in when you &#x2013; depending where the growth trajectory is for this company.</p>
          <p>I'll hand over to Jeann to answer the second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the &#x2013; on capital management, I think we've done the review of our dividend payout last year, and we have actually raised it to 45 to 60% of underlying earnings, and that's an increase from previous range. I think on the debt management we continue to track at about in-line with &#x2013; what we have done previously is at about 6.7 billion, 20-plus% in terms of gearing, and the ratios that we have continue to be very healthy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Just a question on -- just back on IT services. Allen, are you able to tell us what proportion of sales come out of Singapore versus rest of world?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't disclose that, but if we do &#x2013; can you just give me a couple of minutes? I'll check and get back to the call. I don't remember <mark type="inaudible" />, but we have done in the past, I'll give you an update, so just give me a couple of minutes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, would you like to take the question first?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Yang Fong. So I'll just talk about the outages, and what Christian is referring to two unrelated incidents. But one is an outage we had in Queensland which got a lot of publicity, and the second one is some operational problems we've had with the Nokia 3G network through last week.</p>
          <p>First of all, talking about the Queensland outage which related to a cut in our fiber link between the Queensland network and the rest of our national network, look, that is a challenging event, Christian. Actually the statistical odds of the events that happened are very, very low; in fact they were described by one analyst as being a once in 40-year event.</p>
          <p>If you look at what actually happened, we do have an investment in redundancy. The &#x2013; one of the links went down overnight, and we where in the process of repairing it with a new piece of hardware when a third-party contractor who has no relationship to us cut through the other link. We did take it very seriously. We restored the service within about four hours, but nonetheless it got a lot of negative publicity and certainly did create a lot of disruption, for which we've been very apologetic.</p>
          <p>We are spending a lot of time right now reassuring customers on the diversity we have invested in and on the fact that our diversity is at a level that would be considered to be industry class. And if you look at the financials around the level of investment we've made, they are probably appropriate for a carrier of our size.</p>
          <p>Nonetheless, because we do take our reputation seriously, we are now looking to invest in what we call a third layer of redundancy. This is actually an additional guarantee layer, which you probably wouldn't justify normally on financial grounds, but given the reputational issues and the publicity, we're looking at it very seriously. This third layer would allow us to have further redundancy with an independent link yet again for signaling which would mean that in the extremely unlikely event &#x2013; a repeat of that once in forty-year event that had both of our major cable links down, then we'd still would be able to route calls within the state, the impact would merely be on traffic that needed to go from Queensland to another state. We are also looking at providing a similar level of redundancy to that in the other states and at having that completed over the next few months.</p>
          <p>Will customers walk much because of it? Look, it certainly has had a customer impact and we are working very actively to reassure, but I think customers also realize that every carrier has these. In fact, yesterday you'd have probably seen in the media that Telstra had a major outage in New South Wales affecting many of its customers and in fact it's talked about it taking a week to get many of those customers back on the air.</p>
          <p>In terms of the mobile outage, it's an unrelated and quite separate event. That relates to a Nokia network and to an upgrade in software which we had put in place over the last two weeks, and which proved to be quite problematic once it was in place. One of the challenges is that Optus is now working in a market which is one of the highest markets globally in terms of wireless broadband activity and penetration in a per-capita sense. And for that reason we do find ourselves very much stress testing a lot of the capabilities of our partner.</p>
          <p>Nonetheless, they've been very, very responsive and we are now at a stage where we are quite confident that we have got stability back into the network and we are not expecting to see a repeat of that event.</p>
          <p>But two quite unrelated events, but we take each of them quite seriously. Hopefully, Christian, I have given you some reassurance by those comments, but I'm happy to follow up if you got a further question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Paul, it sounds like you have pretty much taken all the necessary steps to make sure it doesn't happen again or if it does happen the impact will be quite minimal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly; that is our focus. So in terms of the intercity fiber, making sure that there is going to be minimal impact if there was a very unlikely reoccurrence. And in terms of the mobile network, we've been moving very vigilantly to make sure we've put all the necessary fallbacks and rollbacks in place so that the software issue doesn't reappear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Christian, this is Allen. Regarding your earlier question, in Q4 last year we did disclose that for our IT services company 70% of its revenues were in Singapore and 30% international. That has not changed significantly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Allen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. Next we have Mr. Anand Ramachandran, Citigroup, Hong Kong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes; hi; morning. Thank you so much for the call. A couple of simple questions from me. Firstly, if I look at the revised associates' guidance, I just want some color on whether this is just to do with what we've already seen in the first quarter and then an assumption of what was, in your original guidance for the rest of the year. Or have any other parts changed with regards to how you see the associates progressing for the rest of the year? Just leave the currency out and I just want some rough color on what you are looking at rather than any specific issues. That's question one.</p>
          <p>Question two is specifically on Singapore. Allen, great job; complements on cellular where you've increased mobile market share by 10 percentage points in the last twelve months, with 45% market share now. I am just wondering: is this something you are comfortable with or do you think there is still room out there for SingTel to go and increase market share in the market? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am going to ask Jeann to take the associates' question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the guidance for the associates taking into account the first quarter performance that's been reported and then for the next nine months together with the first-quarter results we have guided to say that it is expected to grow at double, low double digits. Now that is assuming constant currencies for the next nine months, and it is very much in line with -- if you look at what our associates are also guiding themselves. And the key contributors to our associates' numbers are really Telkomsel, Bharti and AIS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Globe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Anand, this is Allen here. With regard to your question, I think as far as we are concerned in Singapore we are all about creating growth for the company and to create growth that is profitable and value accretive. So I think where there are opportunities we will continue to do that and be mindful that at the end of the day it needs to be value &#x2013; creating value for our shareholders. Particularly in mobile I think we feel that we've got still lots of opportunities available for us to grow the relationship, both in terms of getting our customers to use their mobile for more and more things, particularly entertainment and information. And also to use mobile as a way to deepen the relationship in terms of bundling other products, particularly fixed-line pay television and the like. So I think the short answer to your question is that we will continue to push for more market share refocusing strategically and financially it will add value to the Singapore business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. Next we have Mr. Sachin Mittal, DBS Singapore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually my question has been asked. I pressed 02, so thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. Next is Mr. Sachin Gupta, Lehman Brothers Singapore .</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah; thanks very much. I have three questions. Firstly just on the guidance once again, if you look at the earnings contribution from PBTL and Warid Telecom, I mean that's still negative. Just wondering when do you expect a turnaround in that or what's assumed in the guidance for the full year for PBTL and Warid's contribution?</p>
          <p>Secondly, a question for Allen. Allen, if you look at subscriber costs in the mobile, they are down about 20% sequentially and given the market is still relatively competitive and I think your competitors -- they did report an increase in SACs. So just wondering what's driving that &#x2013; this lower SACs. Is it just a function of lower postpaid adds or is there something more to it?</p>
          <p>And lastly just a question for Paul. Paul, I mean it's good to see the Optus consumer margins finally going up. They're about 17% at the moment. But given the majority of the customer base is on net now, do you think margins will stabilize to these levels or do you see further upside to these? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let &#x2013; can I ask Jeann to talk about the guidance for PBTL and Warid?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've not issued any guidance for PBTL and Warid, but just as a snapshot PBTL has about 1.7 million of subscribers. The loss has basically declined year-on-year this quarter because of, I suppose, lower acquisitions in the quarter. On Warid, Warid actually at the EBITDA line is positive but it is still about 60% network rollout, 56% network rollout, so it is in the course of complete rolling out additional base station sites. And clearly at the bottom line there would be share of depreciation, etcetera, that would contribute to these results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to your question on SACs &#x2013; SAC in Singapore, basically the SACs are down from the previous quarter, but up from one year ago and the primary reason for that is related to a mobile number possibility and we can see from the results that were reported by our competitors, it's actually-that has gone up even Q on Q. We expect mobile to be-continued to be a very competitive environment going ahead and we will manage our SACs in line with our ambitions for market share in this market and in line with the guidance that we've given overall for the Singapore business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Paul here. Would you like me to follow-up on the third question, Yang Fong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes please, Paul.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So look, an important point to make on the Consumer and SMB fixed margins is that we are indeed very pleased to have been able to show the uplift that we promised as we progressed on that. And it's important also this quarter to take out the impact of the $14 million APT back payment which relates to a judgment they made or a determination they'd made on ULL. If you take that out, the underlying margin is around 12.6%, which is probably more indicative of the trading performance of the division.</p>
          <p>We don't give guidance moving forward but I would probably just point to two important trends to factor in. One is, if you look at the ARPUs we're driving in on-net broadband we have been able to demonstrate a slight improvement and that's relating to a greater mix of our $79 fusion products coming into the base. But offsetting that in the next few quarters is the fact that we are expecting to see a slight increase in ULL pricing which has been indicated by the commission. And if that's the case, that will certainly have a dilution effect on some of our margins as well. So I will probably point you to both of those trends, but the underlying trend of looking for a better performance out of on-net versus off-net is clearly demonstrated in the numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Allen, just another quick follow-up question. I was just looking at Warid broadband subscribers, you got 66,000 in Singapore at the moment. Just wondering how do you classify those? Is that in your postpaid adds, so is that in your broadband adds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is in our postpaid adds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Mr. Gupta. Next we have Ken Thumb, UBS Securities Australia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, team. Just got three quick questions for Paul with the Optus Mobile business. First question is, what are the key drivers if you could provide some clarity on the high churn rate of 1.9%? Second question is, what is the total expected mobile CapEx for FY'09? In the notes it says 315 million for the network build, is that the total lot? And where do you see mobile margins for the full year, if you can provide any clarity on that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thank you. I will talk about the churn rate and I will get Jeann to talk a little bit about the mobile CapEx. On mobile margins, we're sort of constrained from giving guidance outside of what we have already given. And I apologize; I just don't like to get into qualifying that in these calls because people do get a bit upset about us giving selective disclosures. But maybe I am happy to take-to talk in terms of our general guidance although there again I've really got to stick to what we have said.</p>
          <p>But if I look first of all at the question you asked on the churn rate, the &#x2013; there is an impact on our churn of approximately 0.1% out of that increase from 1.7 to 1.9, which relates to the CDMA shutdown. And that had an effect in our business division of not only pulling through the customers who had mixed fleets without -- who had the CDMA handsets they wanted to move, but many of those customers who were on a mixed fleet actually chose to move the whole fleet rather than having to deal with two providers.</p>
          <p>So that definitely had an impact on us that came out of the end of the quarter. There is an additional 0.1 which is ambient within the business. On given quarters the seasonality does affect us and part of the work we do is to tailor our retention programs and proactive re-contracting to smooth that out. That's something we will be very focused on over the next couple of quarters.</p>
          <p>I will pass over to Jeann. Maybe she would like to talk about the profile of mobile CapEx within the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think we have guided that the CapEx to revenue ratio for Optus as a whole will be at the mid-teens level. If you look at the quarter's CapEx expenditure for Mobile, we are just up at around 10% of the Mobile revenue. We have made two system announcements in Mobile network rollout. One of course is to rollout to 96% on 3G and then we had a follow up with a subsequent announcement on the additional 2% rollout.</p>
          <p>So I think there would be some phasing between the two to three years that we are rolling out, but we expect to continue to maintain the guidance on overall capital to revenue ratio at around mid-teens.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks for the conference call. I had actually four questions. Just noticed that your net adds for the mio TV business were quite low for the quarter. I know that some of the promotional packages had expired. But I just wanted to get a little bit of a sense on the trend line there. Should we expect a bit of a reacceleration going forward? Maybe there was a one-off churn if you could throw some light on that? Second on prepaid in Singapore, which obviously has been a very important growth driver in the last several quarters. I did notice that your ARPUs there were down after three or four quarters of continuous uptick. So just wondering how the competitive trend line is looking there?</p>
          <p>We recently saw StarHub making a point in their conference call that they're prepared to be a little bit aggressive. So if you could add some color there. And then lastly, the small stake that you have in Far EasTone in Taiwan, just wanted to understand what is your long-term strategy with respect to that little take stake out there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think Allen would be the best person to answer your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me pick the mio and ARPU question on postpaid. In terms &#x2013; on prepaid, sorry. In terms of mio TV, basically we have increased by 2k and that's because of a one off. Basically what we did was when the six months promotion period that we've given to some of our customers ended, they weren't picking up any premium channels and just watching free-to-air, we actually disconnected them so that we get better utilization of the set top box.</p>
          <p>Going ahead, while I can't give you a forecast in terms of subscriber uptick, we are certainly seeing a lot of interest that has now been generated in our market as a result of the new initiative that SingTel has gone into with three of the studios in the U.S. where we will bring their latest series to Singapore within 24 hours of it airing in the U.S. So that give us some optimism with regard to the pickup rate for mio TV going ahead.</p>
          <p>Navin, could you please repeat your second question so that I can answer it for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. That was actually on prepaid mobile and degree of competition in that market. I guess the point I noticed was your ARPUs declined after two, three quarters of consistent increase. And a point that was made by StarHub in their results that they are prepared to be a little more aggressive in that space. I was just wondering if the two are related and does that mean this segment becomes more competitive going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and Navin, actually our prepaid has increased year-on-year from 13 to $14, the decline is mainly Q on Q and that's mainly for seasonal reasons. I think the prepaid market has always been a competitive one.</p>
          <p>In the context of Singapore, the prepaid market is all about reaching out to foreign workers, and it is something that we have got leadership on and we will continue to hold that leadership position. In fact this quarter, we overtook StarHub in terms of even revenue for prepaid revenue leadership, I think we are now at 40%, they are down to 36, 37%. So I think we will continue to compete with them.</p>
          <p>I think the key thing there is less in terms of the price trend, it's more in terms of how you get in front of our customers, the prospective foreign customers. And that's where SingTel, because of its relationship with affiliates that we have in the region in Indonesia, particularly in the Philippines as well as in India, gives us an advantage over that. So I think we will maintain our leadership position but I think that the effect of this will be a competitive market, but we will use the influence that we have with our associates to bring further competitive advantages to offer.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On the question on the FET stake well &#x2013; let me just take a step back. We acquired the FET stake in exchange for investment in NCIC, and we felt that some kind of industry rationalization in the Taiwan fixed line stage was necessary. We've ended up with a 4% stake in FET, which does give us a board seat. The view there is-on FET has been pretty attractive. Obviously it doesn't quite meet our criteria of being a strategic investment. So we are currently reviewing our options for FET, whether we want to increase our involvement or whether we would treat it as a portfolio investment. So in short, we have not <mark type="inaudible" /> our plans yet.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thanks for the call. I just had two quick questions. Just on the associates for telecom sales, if you could just clarify the general strategy of management down there whether they are defending revenue share or subscriber market share in contrast, let's say to AIS previous strategy. And second is just on Warid, just following up, do you think next year there will be enough scale in terms of subscribers and a network for it to approach break even?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, once more Luis, could you clarify your second question with regards to which company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, just on Warid, whether by next year we should think they have enough network and subscriber scale to at least break even?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me just take a question on the telecom sales. Clearly they are the market leaders, they have lost some market share, there have been some network issues which we believe are largely behind us. They had a very successful July promotion. I think the company has announced that they have actually added over three million subs in the month of July alone. Whether the focus of this is on both revenue share and market share, telecom sales actually had probably higher quality subs than the other operators, so they do have a revenue market share that is quite a few percentage points higher than the subscriber market share.</p>
          <p>On Warid, as Jeann mentioned earlier on the call, they have reached about 66% population coverage, the network rollout continues, we have looked at the experience in other markets, emerging markets, and we appreciate the importance of having good network coverage particularly even in the rural areas. So for this we have not &#x2013; to be clear, have not provided guidance on Warid. Suffice it to say that the network coverage rollout will continue for this year and we expect the positive EBITDA to continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just a follow up, in terms of let's say 85% population coverage, will that be achieved by year end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're at about 66% now. There is a very aggressive rollout planned and we are actually with SingTel's technical team on ground, we have achieved stepping up on network coverage. But I think we have not separately guided on what the number would be. Let me check with my colleagues what we have publicly announced to make sure that we have fair and even disclosure.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, thank you for the conference call. I've just got four questions, two regarding SingTel. On the cost front, in SingTel's Singaporean business, you guys had selling and admin costs up 40%. Just wondering what's the outlook on that? And secondly in relation to staff numbers in Singapore, it's consistently been increasing for the past few quarters and just wondering what is the expectation for the coming year?</p>
          <p>In relation to Optus, just got one question there in relation to ULL numbers, you've already got 365,000 declared customers, and Paul mentioned earlier that HFC has approved price increases in relation to ULL. Just wondering what your strategy will be in terms of containing cost increases around that front. And also the assessment in relation to certain assets regarding FTTN. My fourth question is in relation to Pakistan. Once again it's relating to Warid. Just wondering, at what point would SingTel consider divesting or some corporate options around Warid? So that's all my questions, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me just do the Warid question first and also pick up on the earlier coverage question. We currently have 3,400 base stations and in our public announcements we've talked about building an additional 1,500 base stations by the end of the year. So that's a &#x2013; about 30% expansion of the current number of base stations that we have.</p>
          <p>On our plans for Warid, we are very excited about the market potential in Pakistan, notwithstanding the political upheavals that we are seeing, customer additions continue to be very healthy. And as you will be aware, this is an investment that we made in September of last year; we are still in the network rollout phase, so it's the early days for us as far as our investment in Pakistan is concerned. So far, we are tracking to plan &#x2013; to our investment plan. So I'll pass over to Allen to talk about the economies in Singapore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think there were two questions on Singapore, one was generally the cost trajectory going ahead and the second one was on the head count. Let me talk about the cost trajectory. I think we are very focused here on managing our costs for our basic carriage business. But we need to understand also that we need to make sure we maintain our market position and certainly Q1 was a period where all operators were preparing for MNP, particularly in mobile.</p>
          <p>The third important thing is as far as cost is concerned for the Singapore business, we are in the process of changing the shape of the Singapore business to be less reliant on carriage, so there are some investments that we've made, for example in content costs, that will continue to pull through in subsequent quarters. We are also investing in other non-carriage businesses, expanding our presence overseas, for example for our business services.</p>
          <p>So we will &#x2013; I can't give you a projection going ahead, but and I think as the business in Singapore gets more traction in carriage you will see that some costs related to that will increase, as we bring on new services like IPTV, as we roll out more aggressively with our regional data services, some costs there will increase as well.</p>
          <p>As far as staff costs are concerned in Singapore, I think the increases are broadly at least into two categories. One is in our IP business, which is very much related to projects that we secure. So the 150 staff account increases that you see in Q1 was primarily related to new businesses that we secured either in Singapore or overseas. And going ahead, we will continue to manage our staff head count numbers in that part of our business according to the growth that we see in terms of our revenue.</p>
          <p>Secondly, in terms of the telco services, again that has grown by about 149 to 150. Again, this is something that is primarily because of our market share gains and also the new services that we've launched like pay TV. So they are all related to customer uptick, they are all related to revenue that we are getting.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask Paul to talk about the ULL strategy please, Paul?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well thanks Sock Koong. So there were two questions on the ULL. The first one is that we do expect to see a price increase coming through from the regulator in terms of ULL. We actually have advocated very strongly against it, because if you look across the industry, what you can see is that the players you've got involved in ULL and sought to build businesses on them have found the going very tough, not least because of their lack of regulation and lack of detail on regulation, to ensure that we can get competitive access to Telstra exchanges, and to customer premises. Indeed, I note that the next largest player behind us in this market, Telecom New Zealand APT have effectively thrown in the towel in their last set of results, in terms of their performance on broadband.</p>
          <p>In that sense, I'm very pleased to be able to contrast Optus's results, we've continued to make good traction on ULL and just show gains in both market share and financial performance. We do focus very much on how we can take costs out of that business over the next 12 months. In fact, one of the four extremes we've kicked off our internal transformation around is around ULL. And we will be looking for ways in which we can streamline our processes and reduce our cost base.</p>
          <p>At this stage, though, it would be premature for me to say that we can be confident in offsetting any price increase. More likely, what we will do is find a way over the next 12 to 18 months, we should try and reduce our cost base in ULL.</p>
          <p>In terms of your question on stranded assets, it is a major issue around the NBN and in fact we are of the view that Telstra's strategy in announcing the NBN was very much about discouraging investment. Going further in fact towards the view that Telstra has a strong incentive to delay the NBN, because the longer they can delay it, the more they can hang on to their legacy profits and market share on the local loop and milk those. And in fact, I think if you look at their actions on NBN over the last 12 months, far from their rhetoric you can see is a continuous dragging of feet and indeed despite claims to the contrary, they have not yet provided information that's required to allow the NBN to progress.</p>
          <p>Have being said all that, when the NBN is deployed, we've been advocating first of all that it should be deployed in an outside-in way &#x2013; that means those customers and neighborhoods that don't get any broadband today because they're too far from an exchange should be the priority for rollout of NBN &#x2013; and we are fairly optimistic and confident that that will get traction with the regulator.</p>
          <p>Second of all, we have confidence as well that we can recover our investments before an NBN will be rolled out. Our investment's of the order of $150 million and we are of a view that the volumes we're building and the market share we're getting will allow us a payback in that period.</p>
          <p>Thirdly and most importantly, we've been advocating as part of the Terrier consortium that whoever builds the NBN has to provide a through pass to people who already have services on each of those nodes on ULL. What that means in reality is that you get to keep the service you provide to the customer and the economics that have been associated with ULL, albeit it is going to be provided off the new infrastructure. And in that sense, it would allow you to keep your customer base on the economics that you have today. And again, we're confident that that will get traction with the regulator.</p>
          <p>So hopefully, that assists in terms of providing a view of ULL. I would probably close by saying to all those listening to the call, if you watch with interest, you will see that despite the rhetoric, actually the incumbent has a strong disincentive to encourage any speed on NBN, and that's very much reflected in the way in which they are providing information to the department.</p>

          <p>Thank you, ma'am. Next we have Mr. Ian Martin, ABN AMRO Australia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for that. Well, I have a couple of questions on ULL and NBN as well. Good growth in the on-net customers in that quarter, 50-odd thousand I think moving on-net and two more <mark type="inaudible" /> in the provisions &#x2013; sorry, provided the service. And I just wonder, with the reduction in off-net broadband of about 40,000; is the bulk of those migrating on-net versus what you lose through churn? And of the remaining 164,000, what kind of proportion might move on-net and what might happen to the balance?</p>
          <p>And secondly Telstra's been lobbying the ACCC to remove the ULL declaration from Optus in areas where you've got HFC cable, I just wonder what the prospect of that might be in your view. And is there an option, depending on what the NBN price and rankings might be, where you might upgrade the HFC and migrate customers on the HFC and in those areas we've got the footprint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thanks, Ian. I'll take those three questions and what I'll do is, in a moment I'll pass over to Warren, who might give you a bit of a profile of the migrations. And to-date, about 50-50 of our, 50% of our additions on ULL have been made up of migrations and the other 50% new customers. But I'll let Warren talk in a moment about how we see things progressing in the future.</p>
          <p>I might come to your question around declaration and about the fact that where we have HFC cable, Telstra has been seeking to be getting relief from having to provide access to their network. I think there's a couple of important points that need to be added in that space. The first one is, contrary to what has been stated by our competitor, where we have a choice of using our HFC or the copper network to serve a customer, we use the HFC every time. It actually gives us a much better outcome in servicing the customer, because we don't have to work through Telstra's network folks or wholesale folks in order to get an outcome. So it's definitely preferable for us everywhere.</p>
          <p>The second point is that it's not true that everywhere the HFC is present we can serve every customer, there are issues to do with distance from the node on the HFC which mean that we rely on ULL to fill in for customers in those territories and so it's actually quite a challenge to simply say blanket wise that you can look at a piece of geography and rule it one way or the other.</p>
          <p>I think in terms of the overall debate about it, we've seen some coverage in Australia this morning for the benefits of those offshore, which is sort of extrapolating on this debate and asking the question as to whether or not there should be more encouragement to invest in HFC. Look we invested in HFC back in the 90s, and what happened in that environment I could be very illustrative for what we are looking at in terms of NBN. We rolled out to round about 1.2 million homes that we could service and Telstra rolled down the same street as we did. And in fact you've a ludicrous position where in those early days a small number of customers in Australia had a choice of two carriers and the rest of the market was screaming and complaining it did not have access to anybody for cable TV or broadband.</p>
          <p>And I would remind everybody that the economics of an incumbent in choosing to build a network in order to delay a competitor making inroads on their market share are quite different than they are for a greenfield operator launching a new network. The net result of all of that was that both companies wrote off $2.4 billion in their investments. And it proved the point really that in fixed networks in Australia, probably because of our low population density and our geography, there isn't really an opportunity for someone to roll-out a network against the incumbent without either protection from overbuild or a much more tightly regulated environment.</p>
          <p>So we think the debate moving forward should really be about how do you promote efficient investment and we think whoever builds the NBN is going to meet some form of aggregation of traffic and some sort of protection from overbuild. In that sense, Ian, coming back to your third question, which was around us investing in HFC cable, certainly, we are upgrading our existing HFC; we've already deployed DOCSIS 2, and we are looking at DOCSIS 3. And we will continue to progress investment into the HFC. But in terms of extending the HFC, it would face exactly the same economic issues and the same divergence in economics between Telstra and the rest of the industry that our HFC rollout faced in the late 90s, and given that outcome I think to look out for our shareholders and also to insist on getting some form of decent regulation of the market. We would instead insist that there is a regulated outcome for any new builder of network which provides either protection from overbuild or a sensible access regime, where they know they can aggregate the traffic.</p>
          <p>I'll now pass over to Warren to talk briefly about how we see the outlook on migrations and happy, Ian, to take any follow up on that, because there is a lot of information there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks &#x2013; thanks Paul. And just on migration &#x2013; we have been actively migrating those customers that were previously on a retail arrangement and that were within our ULL footprint, we have been actively migrating them across for the last few quarters and that work is sustainably done now although we will still continue to migrate customers for probably another quarter or two; but it's sustainably done, and interestingly some of the dynamics which is going on in there is with the advent of wireless broadband in the market now, some customers are choosing, that previously would have perhaps been fixed broadband customers, are now choosing to opt for a wireless broadband alternative. So there is &#x2013; that's a new dynamic which has entered into the marketplace, perhaps it was not there at the beginning of the &#x2013; of the migration progress as strongly.</p>
          <p>And the good news on this front is that since we announced that we would cease to sell the retail product in those areas outside of our ULL and HFC footprint last year we have not been actively selling into those areas up until now. But you would have seen that we've just recently started offering our fusion bundle of voice and broadband product in a broader area now in conjunction with our 3G network build out. So the good news on that front is we are now back into those previously off-net areas, selling our product with a bundled voice and broadband capability but over a 3G access platform so that means that we are now actually able to offer the customers in those areas a new access alternative whereas for the last few quarters we have not been actively selling into those areas and so there's been churn away from our off-net base because we could not migrate them to our ULL footprint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any indication, Warren, of what the &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; what the migration from off-net to the Fusion product is; what's prospect is there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Ian, if you're saying out of the 164,000 customers that remain on off-net what would we expect to see and I think it would be fair to say based on Warren's comments that clearly we would expect that the number of customers we can migrate on that will decrease as we go forward. You would expect that. But Warren did you want to talk about the overall outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly &#x2013; clearly those customers &#x2013; the customers that already have a previous position to the Optus brand historically that's why we originally inquired them. So, we would expect to, through our already established relationship with them to market very heavily into that base to make sure that we can offer them the Fusion product or indeed our OWT which is just a simple telephony replacement product over the mobile footprint. And so we always aim to, Ian, to achieve at least our market share if not higher than that. So we would be aiming to get more than our fair share of those customers onto our on-net offerings given that those customers already have displayed a previous decision to the Optus brand historically.</p>

          <p>Hello, good morning. I have four questions, but I will ask quite quickly. Firstly, on prepaid in Singapore you have been giving away lots of free minutes, how do you &#x2013; hence your market share success, how do you account for those prepaid free minutes in revenue terms? Secondly, in postpaid mobile a good performance in terms of net additions but you've said that you have been paying for that; is it possible to say whether the mobile business I know you don't give precise results but is it possible to say whether standalone mobile EBITDA would have been down year-on-year? Thirdly, the decision on the NetCo tender is due from the Singapore Government later this quarter; will it be a significant disappointment for you if your consortium, does not win? And fourthly and finally, Globe &#x2013; looking at your affiliates &#x2013; Globe had some &#x2013; had a weaker set of results. Was that a significant disappointment for you? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the Globe question first then I can ask &#x2013; pass over to Allen to talk about the prepaid and the NetCo tender in Singapore. <mark type="inaudible" /> performance I think the company has actually signaled that the impact of the inflation has certainly affected the affordability of the phone service for their customers. You would be aware that there is a large amount of remittance from overseas; they had been providing a lot of the growth stimulation, consumption stimulation in Globe.</p>
          <p>So, clearly a very strong factor in the earlier periods have actually reduced the spending power of the &#x2013; the families who have got overseas workers and now what we've seen is actually the impact of inflation affecting the affordability of mobile phone services. So, that has actually been signaled both by Globe not just in this quarter but in the pervious earlier quarter and also by PLDT in their recent results announcement. So I can not &#x2013; would not say that it come as a surprise to us. We do &#x2013; we are involved quite intimately in the operations &#x2013; the business operations. I think what is happening is that customer adds continue to be very healthy in the Philippines and you would see that we recently increased our shareholding in Globe to 47%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to the Singapore business the two questions that you had in terms of prepaid, before answering your question about the revenue and how we account for the free minutes, I want to clear up misconception in the market that SingTel has been driving the price down. I think we went to the market with a hot 100 trend but, our major competitor actually increased it to a hot 128 trend. So, I think if anything they are the one that is destroying that market unlike what they have represented in their own conference call.</p>
          <p>I think as far as how we account for the three minutes, number one, I think because we are giving out real free there is no revenue associated with it, and basically our philosophy on the free minutes is basically with investors to build a network. The network as far as we managed the capacity and network within the CapEx that we have built, we would be astute in terms of how we package the product at the end of the day. So, I think I hope that answers your question on prepaid and the free minutes.</p>
          <p>The second question on NetCo, the results will be made known when the government has completed its evaluation of the two proposals they have in front of it. The indications I think the government has said publicly they will make a decision by the end of this current quarter, we believe that the OpenNet consortium has a lower risk in terms of implementing because of SingTel's presence is hoped that a faster speed to market. Would we be disappointed if we don't win? Obviously we will be somewhat, but our fixed-line business is very important. So at the end of the day if Infinity wins then we will do what we will need to make sure that we can maintain our leadership position in the fixed market. At this time I don't want to say too much about that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I did actually ask one other question, which was that &#x2013; also which was &#x2013; because of raising acquisition costs particularly in postpaid, there has been some cost pressure in mobile; obviously that's a consequence of growth. Is it possible to say where a standalone mobile EBITDA would have been down?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Tim Smeallie. Just a couple of questions for Paul, just on Optus. First of all, just wondering if you could clarify, just from a strategy perspective -- we talked about this six months ago in terms of actively migrating wholesale subs or encouraging, this time we are looking at 300,000 wholesale customers to leave Optus, and you are now suggesting that you are now targeting those customers again with the 3G Fusion product. I'm just trying to understand the timing on that, or whether I've got it wrong in terms of the strategy.</p>
          <p>Secondly, just looking at the wireless broadband sub adds in the June quarter, just wondering if you could tell how many were the actual net adds because we don't have a March quarter number, and just if we can get some color in terms of what percentage of those wireless broadband subs are Virgin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tim. Just picking up on your questions, the first one -- and I'll invite Warren if he wants to add to it -- but in terms of &#x2013; I think if I sort of put your question in a different way, it will be looking at the 350,000 off-net customers we had a year ago, why didn't we wait to bring our wireless broadband offering to market and then look to migrate, because we could have picked up a higher percentage of them, I think that's what you are asking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and I think the issue there really relates to the churn characteristics of that base, which is also what drove our whole off-net/on-net strategy and our decision to exit resale. Because we didn't control the customer experience, we were unable to therefore give those customers a good service and we had to work through Telstra for any faults. We had all sorts of issues as well in terms of any billing questions or errors. So as a result, the churn rate in that base was phenomenally high. And one of the issues you had was that if you waited, then a significant amount of them would have departed by the time you got to the year-end anyway. So for that reason we made the decision particularly with the high value customers to work on looking to migrate them earlier. It's also the case that the profitability of them was pretty poor, because of the way in which wholesale pricing has eventuated over the last couple of years.</p>
          <p>On the wireless broadband net adds, we haven't disclosed a number specifically but the figure I've given to the market, which is designed to help people be able to calibrate the relative carriers, is that we are doing of the order 20,000 adds per month. That's a run rate we established as we came into this year and we have been able to sustain that; it goes up and down around that number depending on the month, and that's a very good order of magnitude for you to use in terms of trying to calibrate our performance overall.</p>
          <p>Is that &#x2013; does that maybe answer the question for you, Tim?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's great. And if you can just get some color in terms of what percentage of those wireless broadband subs are Virgin and given how aggressive Optus is being in terms of the Timeless Plans and bundling it in the wireless broadband offering, if you are seeing any increase in the take-up rates over the last three, four weeks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on Virgin, I don't think we break them out separately. And on the current quarter, Tim, I think I will be sent to the Investor Relations sin-bin if I start giving you guidance on how things are traveling right now. So apologies; I can't really give you much color on either of those.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I've just got two questions about Singapore. The first one is, do you have any guidance or average acquisition cost per user and retention cost per user going forward and what was it in 1Q? The second question is regarding to the next gen network. In the case if you actually win the bid, do you expect to inject your current backbone into the JV and do you expect to have a probably a noncash income from debt? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, this is Allen here. Your first question in regard to our cost of acquisition, our acquisition cost per subscriber is captured on page 20 of our MD&amp;A. And basically you can see that quarter-on-quarter it's gone down; year-on-year it's gone up a little bit, by about 5%. We don't give separate guidance on &#x2013; we don't give separate disclosure on our retention costs.</p>
          <p>The second question regarding the next gen network and whether we'd be injecting assets and what we'll get for that, I think right now the conditions of the bid and the details of the bid are confidential. When the results are announced and if we do win, I think we would, depending on the agreement from the authorities, we may be able to disclose a bit more information on that. So if you'd bear with us for a few hours time until more certainty is known about the results of this RFP for the net core part of the next generation network.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Are you able to give us some color on what's the book value of your backbone in Singapore now?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't disclose that. So I am sorry. I can't give you more information on that at this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Al. Next, Mr. Lauren Horrit, JPMorgan Australia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you. Actually I have two questions, one for Paul. And, Paul can you clarify what's &#x2013; when the $0.09 mobile termination rate kicked in? Because on page 40 it says it's been down 25% since a year ago, from a year ago and it's now $0.09 from 1st of July 2007. So I was just wondering if you could clarify that. And on that question, what sort of TCP decline are you taking into FY '09, and if the effect of that reduction washes through at some point? That was my first question.</p>
          <p>Second question was on the associates. So obviously the guidance has been lowered to low double digits. Obviously Telkomsel has reduced their guidance, lowered their guidance recently. I was just wondering if you could give a bit more color as to whether your expectations for the other countries have also been lowered, the other associates, and what's actually driven by currency movement as opposed to performance of the businesses. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Lauren. The reduction to $0.09 was in the 1st of July last year. So obviously the quarter we are just reporting, and there was a reduction effectively on what have been previously in place in the previous quarter, which is $0.12. I apologize; I might have missed the end of your question. Would there -- have I answered what you're asking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so Paul, going looking forward so you shouldn't have &#x2013; I mean, that sort of reduction you have been hit with in the last several quarters should wash through the next quarter. Would that be fine?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well in fact going right back to quarter two of '05-'06, we have to report numbers every quarter, which have suffered from that reduction and that's a &#x2013; we shouldn't underestimate it. It's a very large part of a mobile operator, to have incoming calls and for a challenger who doesn't very large fixed base you are a very large net recipient of those. So we have been watching what is 30, 40% of our revenue base suffering reductions of the order of 20 and 30% year-on-year over those years. And you are quite correct, Lauren from this quarter forward to the next two quarters, we are okay. We are going to have two quarters now where for the first time we get a bit of respite.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because the ACCC has confirmed the rate to the end of December. What they are going to do after the end of December is still open and up for grab. But we have been doing a lot of work in advocacy around the model the ACCC uses and around the overall approach that's been applied. And we have been lobbying very hard that we think a very mechanistic approach to this is incorrect. The model is, we believe, flawed. And even independent of whether the model is flawed or not we think the Commission should be looking at a more general competitive position of the industry and asking whether it's appropriate to be giving a huge windfall to the incumbent as a result of these decisions. Some of you will have noticed that the windfall is so significant to the incumbent that they actually put it on a slide in their last set of results. So hopefully our advocacy will have some bearing but at this stage we are all waiting to see what the ACCC does from the 1st of January, 09.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lauren, just a bit of granularity into the low-double digit guidance for the associates' contribution, there has been a couple of announcements by our associates. I think Globe last week talked about revenue guidance being revised downwards from what was previously mid-to-high single digits to now what's low single-digit revenue growth, Telkomsel as well which was revised downwards from more than 15% to what's now 11 to 14%. Bharti does not give any guidance. AIS will announce that in two days' time. So do watch out for that.</p>

          <p>Yes. Hi, thank for the opportunity. A few quick questions, one is on the M&amp;A environment. Can you please comment if there are any particular markets or regions, which are looking attractive. And as of a matter of policy, would you pursue opportunities that any of your associates may have worked upon but not succeeded with.</p>
          <p>My second question is on Optus. Can you please talk specifically about the costs side given that your churn has gone up? Is there anything that you could do on the costs side in spite of rising churn to kind of lower costs?</p>
          <p>And lastly on the Singapore market just a few quick thoughts, if we could get from you on content sharing. Also if you can just please remind us what your ambition there is? I mean have you more or less achieved your market share ambition or you intent to keep going higher? I mean could it attract regulatory scrutiny?</p>
          <p>And on the NBN bid whether it is possible to have an existing network being offered as part of the NBN proposal or would that not qualify? Does the government want a new network altogether? Thank you, I will stop there.</p>

          <p>This is Jeann here. I will take the questions on M&amp;A. The group's geographic focus remains predominantly in Asia because this is where we have a strong track record and we have also previously guided that we are looking at opportunities in adjacent market, which can include the Middle East. In terms of M&amp;A opportunities or dues, the timing of M&amp;A as have always said it's not really within our control. We have made some investments previously during quite difficult market conditions and we continue to be quite disciplined when it comes to M&amp;A. So that our position on M&amp;A opportunities.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We have always worked very closely with our associates and our partners. I think you have seen that in Sri Lanka, for instance. Bharti had taken a license in Sri Lanka. So we have always worked very closely with our associates and in terms of &#x2013; I suppose &#x2013; you have also seen that recently we stepped up on our investment Globe as well.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to the questions on Singapore, firstly on the content business, we have significant ambitions for the content business. We see this as a business for us that can be prospective growth engine as well. We have acquired some very good content. I talked earlier about the content that we acquired from the U.S. Also we acquired Champions League and UEFA Cup. So we believe we have the right product now to allow us to achieve the ambitions and we will continue to push on this service to make sure that it can be a growth engine for the Singapore business.</p>
          <p>With regard to whether it would attract further regulatory scrutiny, the content business is managed by the Media Development Authority of Singapore. And for them the content business is by and large a liberalized business. And it will not attract further scrutiny because there we are basically not a dominant player. We are in fact a new entrant in this business. So I think there would be minimal impact of regulatory &#x2013; further regulatory scrutiny, if any.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, if I may just stop you there, my regulatory question was with regard to your mobile market share and on content I wanted to know if you are opened to sharing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. With regard to our mobile market share, we are still &#x2013; we have 44%. We have not reached a level, which would attract further scrutiny. So I don't think we are in that sort of position right now.</p>
          <p>With regard to content sharing, this depends very much &#x2013; varies from business-to-business, product-to-product in the Singapore context. So we are open to &#x2013; that's something that we are able to discuss, but that's something that I think at this time is a little bit premature to talking too much detail about.</p>
          <p>With regard to NBN as I mentioned, the RFP bids are in and they are under evaluation by the authorities. We are not allowed to discuss the details of our bid. So unfortunately I'm unable to answer your question as to whether any existing network has been injected. I think the government clearly wants and in its aims for NBN to make sure that there is a ultra high-speed network available. That not &#x2013; in their RFP that's not necessarily has to be new. I think we will disclose more details once the results are known.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Optus cost, I should just to highlight that, Optus have been maintaining a fairly disciplined cost structure. The cost growth in fact on an overall basis is about 3%, which is roughly within the revenue growth. Having said that if you look at the cost increase, it is really in customers acquisitions related to the mobile business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Also staff costs and the increase in customer acquisition cost, does it really tie in with the increase in churn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, if you look at the customer acquisition costs, it is on the per subscriber basis. It is quite stable on a year-on-year basis. But across the number of customers if you look at postpaid net adds, we have higher number of postpaid net adds this quarter, versus a similar quarter last year, so accounting rules do require you to expand the acquisition costs.</p>
          <p>I think in terms of churn, we have talked about the churn rate earlier, which is really &#x2013; currently driven by generally higher churn in the wireless broadband area given the unfamiliarity of customers with some of the services, but we are not. But I think, when you look at the cost structure, if you look at advertising costs and promotion costs and you tie that back to the event and now customer acquisition program, that will be very much inline with the acquisitions that we have made.</p>
          <p>On the staff costs, a large part of the staff costs increases really in our ICT business, as well as in Alphawest, which services our corporate business, which is really managed services work. And then the other part of our increase is really in wireless broadband network. So we have stepped up on customer service for wireless broadband services.</p>

          <p>Hi, thank you for the opportunity. I have just one question on Telkomsel, I guess, what I want to ask is are you worried about the conflict between your interest and that of the majority shareholder of Telkomsel, since mobile price have come down quite sharply in fixed and fixed wireless business is probably going to go in to decline. So I guess, what I want to say is that the fixed wireless and fixed line business, the losses on that side would entirely be those of PT Telkom, while the games on the mobile side are going to be shared with SingTel. So do you see this as a conflict of interest and perhaps see mobile growth going down in the future, possibly to make the fixed wireless business run longer? Is this a concern for you?</p>

          <p>Yong Moon from regional operations. I think our objectives are pretty aligned with Telkom and if you look at Telkom's revenue, more than 60% of its revenues is derived from Telkomsel. So actually we discussed in detail with them how to position the mobile business vis-&#xE0;-vis the fixed business. And to make sure migration of fixed business into mobile is a trend that you cannot stop worldwide. And I think that is exactly what we are doing. And within Telkom itself they also do have a fixed wireless business where they position at a different segment of the market. And we work closely to price it in a way so that we can segment the market to cover the entire spectrum of the customers.</p>
