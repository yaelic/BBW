          <p>All participants please stand by; your conference is ready to begin. Good day, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the TransCanada Corporation 2011 Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. David Moneta, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Moneta.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks very much, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to TransCanada's 2011 fourth quarter conference call. With me today are Russ Girling, President and Chief Executive Officer; Don Marchand, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Alex Pourbaix, President of our Energy and Oil Pipelines, Greg Lohnes, President, Natural Gas Pipelines; and Glenn Menuz, Vice President and Controller.</p>
          <p>Russ and Don will begin today with some opening comments on our financial results and certain other company developments. Please note that a slide presentation will accompany their remarks. A copy of the presentation is available on our website at transcanada.com and it can be found in the Investors section under the heading Events and Presentations.</p>
          <p>Following their prepared remarks, we will turn the call over to the conference coordinator for your questions. During the question-and-answer period, we'll take questions from the investment community first, followed by the media. And in order to provide everyone with an equal opportunity to participate, we ask that you limit yourself to two questions. If you have additional questions, please re-enter the queue.</p>
          <p>Also, we ask that you focus your questions on our industry, our corporate strategy, recent developments and key elements of our financial performance. If you have detailed questions relating to some of our smaller operations or your detailed financial models, Terry, Lee and I would be pleased to discuss them with you following the call.</p>
          <p>Before Russ begins, I'd like to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements that are subject to important risks and uncertainties. For more information on these risks and uncertainties, please see the reports filed by TransCanada with Canadian Securities Regulators and with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission.</p>
          <p>Finally, I'd also like to point out that during this presentation, we'll refer to measures such as comparable earnings, comparable earnings per share, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, comparable EBITDA, and funds generated from operations. These and certain other comparable measures do not have any standardized meaning under GAAP and are therefore considered to be non-GAAP measures. As a result, they may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities. These measures are used to provide you with additional information on TransCanada's operating performance, liquidity and its ability to generate funds to finance its operations.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll now turn the call over to Russ.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone, and thank you very much for joining us. I'd like to start today with a couple of financial highlights before I get into a strategic update and Don will, of course, provide you a more detailed financial overview after my comments.</p>
          <p>So to start, 2011 was a very strong year for TransCanada. Comparable earnings were $1.6 billion, or $2.23 a share, a 13% increase from 2010. 2011 was the year where we commissioned a large number of critical infrastructure projects. $10 billion of assets have gone into service in our company since the spring of 2010 largely on time and on budget. These assets are now delivering solid earnings and cash flow for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>In 2011, the assets that became operationally included, the Cushing extension of the Keystone pipeline, the Bison and Guadalajara natural gas pipelines, extensions and expansions of the Alberta System, the Coolidge Generating Station in Arizona and two additional phases of our Cartier Wind project.</p>
          <p>TransCanada is now positioned to complete another $12 billion of projects that are expected to come into service between now and 2015, including the Bruce Power restart program in Ontario, additional extensions and expansions of the Alberta System, the final phase of the Cartier Wind power project in Qu&#xE9;bec, the nine solar projects and the Keystone XL expansion along with the Cushing and Bakken Marketlink projects and the Houston Lateral.</p>
          <p>Again, all of these projects are either regulated or underpinned by long-term contracts, which gives us the confidence that they will also generate stable and sustained earnings and cash flow growth for our shareholders for decades to come.</p>
          <p>Turning to our fourth quarter results, comparable earnings were $366 million or $0.52 a share. Comparable EBITDA was $1.2 billion and funds generated from operations were $881 million, an increase of 8% over 2010.</p>
          <p>Today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per common share, for the quarter ending March 31, 2012. On an annual basis, this translates into a $0.08 increase from a $0.68 to $0.76 per share and represents a 5% increase over the previous amount. This is the 12th consecutive year that TransCanada's Board has raised its dividend.</p>
          <p>Now, moving to some of my strategic comments, I'll update you on the projects we've progressed since I spoke to you last quarter. I'll start with Keystone XL. The U.S. State Department, as you know, suspended the finalization of the review of Keystone XL in November 2011 stating that alternate routes needed to be defined that avoided the Nebraska Sand Hills. The department of State had said this work could be completed by the first quarter of 2013.</p>
          <p>TransCanada will continue to work collaboratively with the State of Nebraska and we are looking at options right now to define any route through that state. As you're also aware, the State Department denied the Presidential Permit for Keystone XL on January 18th. Facing a 60-day legislative imposed decision deadline the Department said, it did not have sufficient time to obtain the information necessary to assess whether the project in its current state was in the national interest of the United States.</p>
          <p>The decision was not made on the merits of our application and the State Department has indicated it is open for us to reapply. We're obviously disappointed with that decision as TransCanada's commitment to the project remains very strong and the company will reapply for the Presidential Permit. We expect the final environmental impact statement, which was issued in August 26, 2011, which was based on 10,000 pages of data and analysis compiled since 2008, would be used in any future regulatory review.</p>
          <p>Keystone XL was by far the most exhaustive and detailed analysis ever conducted of a cross-border crude oil pipeline in the United States, a process that the Inspector General confirmed recently was conducted in accordance with the laws and longstanding regulatory practices in the United States. We remain focused on the necessary work for this pipeline to begin shipping oil in late 2014 or early 2015. Keystone XL is in the national interest of the United States as it will allow Americans to move closure to achieving North American energy security and it will create thousands of much needed jobs.</p>
          <p>Early in January, we released a detailed breakdown of the 20,000 jobs Keystone XL would create during construction, every welder, every electrician, every pipe fitter, et cetera. However, the primary benefit of this project is the role that Keystone will play in increasing energy security in United States. The U.S. consumes some 15 million barrels a day of oil and it imports 10 million to 11 million barrels a day of that oil and by our forecast that importation of oil will continue for decades to come.</p>
          <p>Let me be clear, Keystone XL is not a pipeline built to export crude oil from the United States. It's meant to fill that need. It will directly displace heavy crude oil that is currently being imported from Venezuela, Mexico and the Middle East, which is currently being refined in the Gulf Coast. It will replace that supply with secure stable, supply of U.S. and Canadian crude oil. Contracts U.S. refiners have in place with the Venezuelans and the Mexicans for crude oil are set to expire in the coming years. There will be a gap in the supply that must be filled and Keystone XL will help fill that gap with Canadian and U.S. oil.</p>
          <p>Another point that's often overlooked is the fact that Keystone XL will help meet the objectives Americans have of wanting their own oil developed, produced and consumed in the United States. We have provided 25% of Keystone XL's capacity for the delivery of U.S. oil to U.S. refineries. We've been successful in signing long-term contracts to bring oil from the Williston Basin in Montana and the Dakotas, and crude oil from Cushing, Oklahoma on to our system for delivery to U.S. refineries.</p>
          <p>In addition or in December 2011 we signed contracts that would add additional supply to the Cushing Marketlink project, which would transport crude oil from Cushing, Oklahoma to Port Arthur in Houston, Texas. The $50 million Cushing Marketlink project would use a portion of the Keystone XL facilities, including the Houston lateral.</p>
          <p>Also, in December, we completed a successful open season where we received contractual support to transport crude oil from Hardisty, Alberta to Houston, Texas through our 80-kilometer Houston lateral project. This $600 million pipeline extension and expansion would increase the capacity of Keystone XL to 830,000 barrels a day. The Houston Lateral would more than double the U.S. Gulf Coast refining capacity directly accessible from the Keystone pipeline system to over 4 million barrels a day.</p>
          <p>At this point, the capacity of the entire Keystone system has largely been reserved under long-term contracts, a clear sign that the marketplace needs and wants this pipeline in place as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>Moving now to our Natural Gas Pipelines, as I told you last quarter, TransCanada filed an application on September 1 with the National Energy Board that addresses tolls for the Canadian Mainline for 2012 and 2013. TransCanada is presently charging approved interim tolls at the level of the 2011 final tolls.</p>
          <p>Components of this application are related to the restructuring of services and tolling on the Mainline and respond to the significant changes that have occurred over the last few years in natural gas supply, natural gas demand and transportation in North America. We believe approval and implementation of the proposals in the application will enhance the long-term economic viability of the Mainline and the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, as a whole.</p>
          <p>What our application proposes is significantly reduced long-haul tolls for 2012 and 2013 compared to the existing levels. The Natural Energy Board will hold a hearing on the application beginning in June of this year, at the beginning of June and it's scheduled to run through August and September and we expect a decision by late 2012 or early 2013.</p>
          <p>TransCanada also re-filed an application in November of 2011 that included supplemental information for the approval to build the $130 million new pipeline on the Canadian Mainline that would transport about 350 million cubic feet a day of Marcellus shale gas from the U.S. to eastern markets in both Canada and the United States.</p>
          <p>The Mainline remains a very important piece of North American gas infrastructure. We saw a very cold winter in 2010 and 2011 where volumes in the Mainline peaked at around 5.5 billion cubic feet a day and the eastern end of our pipeline was pretty much full every day during that period of time. This winter so far has been one of the warmest North America has seen it about the last 100 years. Gas storage is full and gas transportation is down on all pipelines of North America, including the Mainline. Volumes are at the low end of the scale, as I said right now, but at 3 Bcf a day it's still the single largest transportation system on the continent.</p>
          <p>The Alberta natural gas delivery system continues to grow through new connections of supply, primarily in Horn River and in the Montney shale plays in British Columbia, as well as the Deep Basin in Alberta. TransCanada has filed applications with the National Energy Board to expand its system to accommodate requests from companies to get their gas to market throughout the Northwest and Northeast portions of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin.</p>
          <p>We've signed contracts to transport 3.4 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from Western Alberta Northeast BC by 2014, and we're looking &#x2013; and we're working on dealing with further requests to transport additional volumes on the Alberta System from those Northwest portions of the WCSB.</p>
          <p>In 2011, the National Energy Board approved $910 million worth of natural gas pipeline projects in this region. Further projects with a value of about $800 million are awaiting an NEB decision.</p>
          <p>In addition, we continue to pursue pipeline infrastructure to connect the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin to markets that support further developments of Alberta oil sands. We continue to look at opportunities that would deliver LNG for export on the West Coast. And we continue to look at the potential of a $500 million to $600 million investment in an extension of our Tamazunchale pipeline in Mexico.</p>
          <p>The Alaska Pipeline Project team continues to work with our shippers to resolve the conditional bids received as part of the project's open season. The team is also working towards a FERC application with a deadline of October 2012 for the Alberta option that would transport gas from Alaska to Alberta and on to other continental markets.</p>
          <p>TransCanada has also started discussions with Alaska North Slope producers on one of two options that were first presented in 2007 that is the LNG option that would see a pipeline built from Prudhoe Bay to LNG facilities in Valdez, Alaska.</p>
          <p>On the Energy side of our business, the refurbishment of Units 1 and 2 at Bruce Power are continuing as we had hoped. The two units are now being prepared to supply power to Ontario's electrical grid. Unit 2 is expected to come operational by the end of the first quarter and Unit 1 is on target to be producing power in the third quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>Our share of total capital cost is still expected to be $2.4 billion. Once refurbished and complete, Bruce Power will be the world's largest nuclear facility providing more than 6,200 megawatts or about 25% of Ontario's power. This emissions-free power is backed long-term power purchase agreements with the Ontario Power Authority.</p>
          <p>In late December of 2011, our company agreed to purchase nine Ontario solar projects with combined capacity of 86 megawatts for approximately $470 million. All nine projects have 20-year power purchase agreements with the Ontario Power Authority. Each of the nine projects will be developed and constructed by Canadian Solar Solutions utilizing photovoltaic panels. TransCanada will purchase each project after it begins commercial operations subject to certain milestones being met. We expect these solar power projects begin producing power between late 2012 and mid 2013. These solar projects would allow TransCanada to expand and add to our diverse generating portfolio where a third of the power we own or have interest in comes from alternative or renewable energy sources.</p>
          <p>So, to conclude, fourth quarter results were solid and overall 2011 was a very good year for our company. TransCanada continued to advance many of its strategic initiatives and brought several critical energy infrastructure projects into operation. We expanded our Keystone pipeline system, constructed new infrastructure to deliver natural gas right across the continent, continued to build low emission natural gas fired power plants and brought Canada's largest wind farm closer to completion.</p>
          <p>It is clear that our strategy is working and we're seeing very tangible results of our discipline and focus. Our company delivered a record $4.8 billion of EBIDTA in 2011, versus the $3.9 billion in 2010. This represents a year-over-year increases of about $865 million.</p>
          <p>As we move into 2012, low gas prices will impact the commodity exposed parts of our business and throughputs on our pipeline systems, but, as we've said many times, the majority of our revenues are derived from regulated assets and facilities backed by long-term contracts.</p>
          <p>We look forward to completing the Bruce nuclear restart, the final phase of the Cartier Wind project, construction of the nine solar projects in Ontario, continued extensions and expansions of the Alberta System and moving forward on our Keystone XL project.</p>
          <p>Today, we have over $50 billion of energy infrastructure projects being evaluated by our very capable business development team. They're focused on meeting the needs to move shale and conventional gas within the continent and from frontier regions, attaching crude oil production to key refining centers and developing new power generation as the North American market revitalizes it aging infrastructure and evolves to a less carbon intensive mix.</p>
          <p>These opportunities match extremely well with TransCanada's strategy, our growth aspirations, our existing presence and deeper organizational capabilities. While we don't expect to capture all of those opportunities, I'm very confident that these projects combined with appropriate acquisitions will provide us with the opportunities to reinvest our substantial discretionary free cash flow.</p>
          <p>As we bring on new projects and gas and power prices recover, we expect to continue to grow earnings, cash flow, and dividends into long-term, enduring value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Don Marchand to provide you some additional details on our fourth quarter financial results. Don?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Russ, and good afternoon, everyone. As you know, earlier today we released our fourth quarter results and announced a 5% increase in the common share dividend. This is the 12th consecutive year the Board of Directors has raised the dividend.</p>
          <p>I'd like to start my remarks today by highlighting the following. TransCanada had another solid quarter driven by good performance from both our new and existing set of high quality assets. The $10 billion of new assets now in service are contributing highly predictable earnings and cash flow underpinned by long-term contracts or regulated cost-of-service business models.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2011, comparable earnings per share increased 13% and funds generated from operations increased 10%. The company continues to advance its large capital program and seek out new investment opportunities in all segments of its core businesses and geographies. These projects will further contribute to sustainable earnings, cash flow and dividend growth in the future. And last, we are well positioned to fund the remainder of our current capital program as well as pursue new initiatives.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to take the next few minutes to expand on the details for our fourth quarter. Comparable earnings in the fourth quarter of $366 million, or $0.52 per share, decreased by $18 million or $0.03 per share compared to the same period in 2010. Incremental earnings from recently commissioned assets combined with higher power prices in Alberta were more than offset by lower contributions from Bruce Power related to planned plant outages, higher interest expense as a result of lower capitalized interest, reduced earnings from U.S. Power and net realized losses in 2011 compared to gains in 2010 from foreign exchange derivatives.</p>
          <p>As mentioned in our last conference call and at our Investor Days in November, Bruce A commenced a six-month outage on November the 6th, known as the West Shift Plus program that will extend the life of unit 3. Also Bruce B Unit 5 completed a planned seven-week outage in the fourth quarter. Both outages combined to reduce comparable earnings by about $0.05 per share in the quarter.</p>
          <p>New assets contributing significant incremental earnings included Keystone Phases 1 and 2, Bison, Guadalajara and Alberta System extensions and expansions and the Coolidge Generating Station.</p>
          <p>I'll now briefly review the business segment results at the EBITDA level. Natural Gas Pipelines reported another solid quarter. The business segment generated comparable EBITDA of $739 million in fourth quarter 2011 compared to $737 million last year. Results demonstrated from incremental EBITDA from Bison and Guadalajara, which were placed in service earlier this year. This was partially offset by lower incentive earnings in the Canadian Mainline and the Alberta System and lower revenues from certain U.S. pipelines.</p>
          <p>With respect to the Canadian Mainline tolls application until an NEB decision is received earnings from the Canadian Mainline in 2012 will be lower than 2011 as results will reflect the last approved ROE of 8.08% on deemed common equity of 40% on a somewhat lower rate base and will exclude incentive earnings that have enhanced results in recent years. Using the last approved ROE and deemed common equity is consistent with past accounting practices for our Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines awaiting regulatory decisions.</p>
          <p>Turning to Oil Pipelines, Keystone generated $179 million of EBITDA in the fourth quarter. This represents its best quarter since the company commenced recording earnings since February of 2011. Throughput volume on the system continued to rise in the period averaging approximately 490,000 barrels per day, including about 20,000 barrels per day of spot volume. During its 11 months of operations, Keystone has generated significant new EBITDA for the company totaling $587 million. In 2012, which will be its first full year of operation, Keystone is expected to generate approximately $700 million of EBITDA.</p>
          <p>In Energy, comparable EBITDA was $295 million in the fourth quarter compared to $301 million for the same period last year. Slight year-over-year decrease was a result of combination of factors. Higher realized power prices in Alberta and incremental earnings from the startup of the Coolidge in Arizona were positive factors although these were offset by a reduction in Bruce A and B generation volumes and higher operating cost resulting from planned plant outages mentioned at the outset of my comments, lower realized prices at Bruce B as legacy contracts continue to roll off and lower contributions in U.S. Power and natural gas storage.</p>
          <p>As outlined previously, TransCanada continues to fully record revenues and costs under the Sundance A power purchase arrangement, in the fourth quarter recognized $57 million in comparable EBITDA bringing the total to $156 million for 2011.</p>
          <p>TransCanada has disputed TransAlta's force majeure and economic destruction claims under the binding dispute resolution process provided in the Sundance A PPA and both matters will be heard through a single binding arbitration process.</p>
          <p>The arbitration panel has scheduled the hearing for April 2012 and assuming the hearing concludes within the time allotted, TransCanada expects to receive a decision in mid-2012. The outcome of any arbitration process is not certain, however, TransCanada believes the matter will be resolved in its favor.</p>
          <p>Turning to unregulated natural gas storage, revenues were lower in the fourth quarter as storage spreads narrowed. While returns on capital remain very good, in 2012 we expect EBITDA from this business to be lower than the past couple of years in light of the current gas price environment.</p>
          <p>Finally, in Energy the Bruce A Unit 3 six month West Shift Plus planned outage will continue throughout the first quarter of 2012. This will continue to impact our earnings in the near term, it is critical for the life extension strategy for the units at Bruce Power and an excellent example of maximizing the full life value of our existing assets.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the other income statement items on slide 21, comparable interest expense in the fourth quarter was $251 million compared to $173 million last year. The $78 million increase reflects lower capitalized interest related primarily to Keystone. In the fourth quarter, $71 million of interest was capitalized to assets under construction compared to $150 million for the same period of 2010. As mentioned in previous quarters, capitalized interest has declined as projects have been placed into service somewhat offsetting the impact of rising EBITDA associated with these new assets.</p>
          <p>Comparable interest income and other for fourth quarter 2011 decreased by $53 million to $8 million. The decrease reflects realized losses in 2011 versus gains in 2010 on derivatives used to manage the company's net exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations on U.S. dollar income. In combination with U.S. dollar denominated interest expense, this hedging program largely counterbalances the currency impact of translating U.S. dollar Pipeline and Energy income recorded in the business segments.</p>
          <p>Comparable income taxes of $123 million in the fourth quarter 2011 were $20 million higher than fourth quarter 2010 primarily due to positive tax adjustments, which reduced taxes in the prior year and higher flowthrough income taxes on the Canadian Mainline in 2011.</p>
          <p>Moving on to cash flow and capital expenditures on slide 22, cash flow was again robust in the fourth quarter and continues to grow primarily from incremental earnings from our new assets. Funds generated from operations increased by $69 million to $881 million in the period. For the full year 2011, the company generated $3.7 billion of funds from operations, an increase of $330 million or 10% over 2010.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures were $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter 2011 principally related to the expansion of the Alberta System, advancing the Keystone XL project and the Bruce Power restart program.</p>
          <p>Looking to 2012, including capitalized interest, our expectation is we will spend approximately $2.7 billion on capital projects primarily related to Alberta System extensions and expansions, Keystone, Bruce Power, Canadian Solar and maintenance capital. We expect the Canadian Solar deal to close in stages between late 2012 and mid 2013 as each of the nine solar farms are completed and placed in service.</p>
          <p>Now, looking at slide 23, our liquidity position and access to capital markets remained strong. At the end of the year, our consolidated balance sheet consisted of 43% common equity, 4% preferred shares, 2% junior subordinated notes, and 51% debt, net of cash. At December 31, we had $765 million of cash on hand along with $4.3 billion of committed and undrawn revolving bank lines.</p>
          <p>In December, we established a new U.S. domiciled commercial paper program, fully backstopped by committed credit lines. This will further diversify the company's sources of funding and along with our two other well supported commercial paper programs in Canada, provides a flexible and very attractive source of short-term capital.</p>
          <p>In November, we closed the medium term note issue in Canada totaling $750 million, $500 million for a term of 10 years at 3.65% and $250 million of 30-year money at 4.55%. The proceeds were used to fund the Alberta System and Canadian Mainline rate basis.</p>
          <p>Next, just a quick a reminder of TransCanada's adoption of U.S. GAAP effective January 1, 2012. The principal difference between Canadian GAAP and U.S. GAAP is the accounting for joint venture investments, which, in TransCanada's case, is predominantly Bruce Power, as well as Northern Border, TQM and Iroquois. Rather than accounting for these investments using proportionate consolidation whereby we pick up our share of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows, these investments will be recorded using the equity method of accounting, which essentially means various line items will be collapsed to one line on each of the balance sheet and income statements. There will be no impact to net income in moving to U.S. GAAP.</p>
          <p>On the balance sheet both assets and liabilities will drop by about $1 billion as joint venture debt and other liabilities are moved onto the asset side in a new line item called 'equity investments.' On the income statement, a new line will be created for these equity investments above the EBITDA line. As a result, reported EBITDA is expected to drop by approximately $300 million, as this will effectively move about $200 million of depreciation and the $100 million of interest costs above the line into EBITDA, which is essentially just geography.</p>
          <p>Funds from operations will reflect actual cash distributions that we receive from our equity investment going forward versus our proportionate share of their collective funds from operations, that amount is likely less than a $100 million different on an annual basis. The investing and financing sections of the cash flow statement will no longer reflect our proportionate share of the joint venture's activities, rather the investing section will reflect cash equity injections made by TransCanada into the joint ventures.</p>
          <p>Finally, we expect to file our 2011 Annual Report to shareholders tomorrow, which contains the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes as well as the related management's discussion and analysis.</p>
          <p>In closing, 2011 was a very successful year on a number of fronts. Comparable earnings per share rose to $2.23, an increase of 13% over 2010, evidence our plan is working. Having now completed and placed into service approximately $10 billion of assets since the spring of 2010, we've added about $1 billion of incremental sustainable EBITDA from assets that are largely underpinned by long-term contracts. In addition, we have invested approximately $5 billion into projects that are part of our $12 billion committed capital program. We are well positioned to fund the remainder of that program.</p>
          <p>Finally, we expect to continue to generate significant cash flow that can be used to invest in additional accretive growth opportunities, continue to grow the dividend and further enhance our financial strength and flexibility in the years ahead.</p>
          <p>That's the end of my prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to David for the Q&amp;A.</p>

          <p>Thank you. I was wondering if you could maybe give us an update as much as possible on your Keystone XL discussions with your shipper group and what the feasibility might be developing it in phases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we've had a great deal of discussion with our shippers. Our shippers all remain completely committed to the Keystone XL project. And from our perspective, our number one priority is going ahead with the entire project. That being said, there is an obvious and real need to take care of that bottleneck in Cushing. And over the last month, we've received a lot of inbound interest from potential shippers as to whether we could go forward with the Cushing to Gulf Coast phase. We're having a lot of discussions about that. We think there is &#x2013; there is potentially a lot of merit to it and we're just working through that right now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. You've mentioned that you are pursuing natural gas pipeline opportunities to support proposed LNG facilities on the West Coast. Just wondered, if you can tell us if you've had any active discussions with shippers in this regard and perhaps the timeline or timeframe you'd be looking at to construct this infrastructure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. It's Greg Lohnes, as you've seen there is a couple of expert permits that have been obtained now, one for 1.3 Bcf another smaller one 200-250 range. So, there is about 1.5 Bcf of export permits and then there are two or three other proponents who have all indicated an interest. We certainly have had discussions with most if not all of those. If the market wants to go to the West Coast, we think we're a strong candidate to build that pipeline. We're one of the few that have the experience to build in very difficult mountainous conditions. We've done that in Canada. We've done that in South America. We've done that in Mexico and continue to do that in Mexico. So, we think we're well positioned should a pipeline need to be built until to the West Coast.</p>
          <p>We continue to talk to our shippers and to interested parties about the merits of the Alberta System and the fact that the Alberta System has the ability to gather gas from different parts of British Columbia and Alberta and provides the liquidity of the net hub which would allow volumes to be built up and transported in an interim period before the LNG facilities are completed. Because, as you know, with an LNG facility, once the trains are in place, it's best just to fill it up and run it full basically immediately. So, there is some prebuild and we would hope that then we'd see gas flowing on our other infrastructure including the Mainline as those volumes build up. So, we do continue to have discussions down those lines. The timeframes are, in our view, in the 2018 to 2020 timeframe.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, John. It's Alex. Not really anything very material, we've always said that the time period for construction of Keystone XL would be two full years and we're just taking a look at the timeframe. We believe that a reasonable date to get a new Presidential Permit is in Q1 of 2013 and it was really just simple math.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on your gas storage business and around how much of your storage is contracted, how much is currently utilized, your outlook, a little bit more color around the metrics there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I can maybe start this. We have two gas storage businesses, one is regulated and one is non-regulated, and they basically area both exposed to the same factors, one is more contracted than the other one. But one is run by Alex and one is run Greg. So, why don't I them to individually respond to your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. It's Alex. So, I'll start out first with the unregulated storage business. I mean, we're, obviously, right now kind of at the bottom of the cycle for gas storage spreads. I would expect to see the gas storage business produce modestly lower EBIDTA in 2012 than it did in 2011 and we would see that improving as we come out of the bottom for this industry. We're pretty well hedged in 2012. I think, we're probably &#x2013; about two-thirds of our total capacity is hedged in 2012 and then that drops off very significantly as we have anticipation of some improvement in spreads going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the regulated side of the business, which is about 250 Bcf of storage, we've got about 5% available this year, more on contracted for 2013. And we are seeing some interest in that capacity, but only on an annual basis. So, I think the marketplace is taking a wait-and-see attitude with regard to what's going to happen next winter with storage. As storage is quite tight, I think as we go through this next year, as you know with high storage levels throughout North America, demand for that limited space is likely to be fairly high.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. A question on the U.S. power market, your forward sales going to 2012 seems to be a lot lower than they were going into 2011. Can you give some color around what your thoughts are on that, the thought process is on that and do you have expectations of stronger pricing as we go into 2012 or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think basically from our perspective, we're at a pretty low level for pricing. We have incredibly low gas prices right now and as a result we're much more inclined to be more open than we have been in the past going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I was wondering if you could provide some loose guidance on when you expect the re-filing for the Presidential Permits on XL and how that squares with the ongoing process in Nebraska to re-route. Is one dependent on the other?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Chad, we've said we're going to re-apply for a Presidential Permit. I would imagine we're going do that pretty quickly. At the same time we want to be really careful and make sure that we're putting in the best application possible. We have a little bit of work to do in Nebraska. We're collaborating very well with the state, with the Department of Environmental Quality and there is few things we got to get done in the state, but I would expect to see us re-file in the relatively near future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for that. I was wondering if you could also provide an idea of the sort of leverage that Keystone, base Keystone, has as volumes move beyond the contracted 530,000 barrel a day level. I know they're not there yet, but with the potential that they could move higher than that, could you just give me some context for where EBITDA could go if you reach that contract at that fully utilized level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have that in front of me. Let me think about that and we'll get back to you on that one. But I think I would generally say we're not, as I said earlier, we're not expecting very significant spot volumes certainly in 2012 and let us just &#x2013; let me think about if we can give some sort of help with where we could see that going, going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I'm wondering if you could talk about any implications of coal to gas substitution whether it's in Alberta or in the East that you might be seeing them, I think specifically? With gas prices being so low, you might see some of your coal plants in Alberta &#x2013; in the West not running there, but I'm not sure what your fuel costs are, so maybe that's not an issue for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The marginal cost of operating our coal entitlements are very, very low. So, we don't actually see a lot of coal to gas switching going on in Alberta.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful and then on the CapEx, the $2.7 billion. I think that's up a little bit from your Analyst Day. I guess I would have thought it may be down some because you've pushed back some of the Keystone spending, but maybe you can just walk through kind of the drivers of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's up a touch. Keystone's probably $600 million, $700 million including capitalized interest, $1 billion for the big Canadian reg pipes, probably about $300 million for Canadian Solar this year and then the rest would bring us to about $2.7 million, including completion of Bruce.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, you think you'll still have some decent spending momentum on Keystone even though we're still sort of waiting here on the permit and whatnot?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's consistent with what we noted at our Investor Days that we do have some momentum spend. We have to carry through on some of the commitments for some of the steel that we've already made. So, it's &#x2013; that's pretty much the extent of it right now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. My first question is, could it be possible for you to spin out some of your low growth potential, but high free cash flow Canadian assets into what is a more yield vehicle as we've seen others do?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that that's, I'm not sure exactly, Steve, what vehicle you're referring to or what examples. Certainly in the U.S., we continue to use our MLP. When we needed cash we dropped down assets into the limited partnership last year that worked successfully for us as it has in the past. Looking forward, we don't have a large need for the capital and as well on the Canadian side, obviously, there is the regulatory construct that needs to be kept in mind as you move assets into these tax advantaged vehicles. Some of the players that would normally buy those kinds of assets aren't eligible on the tax advantaged side where they can't buy those assets. So, at this point of time, I'd say, Steve, there is really nothing that we're thinking about doing outside of the normal need for capital, which we don't have right now and to use our U.S. MLP in that regard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. My second question, there is a ramp-up time between first volumes and full EBITDA generation on the first Keystone. Would you be able to give a sense on when you expect K XL to have full EBITDA generation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said, we're targeting sort of Q1 2015 and I'd have to talk to our operating guys to see how quick they think we can get to full pressure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I suspect that on base that you'd expect to see a period of time that was measured in months not as long as the issues that we had on base Keystone, certainly the issues that we had with the valves and the couplings. We have taken that into account when we designed Keystone XL and wouldn't expect to have those same sort of vibration issues; you learn as you go, so I would expect that the timeframe from sort of first flow to full operations would be substantially compressed from where we were on Phase I.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the other comment I was just thinking about is on the Canadian portion we did have that pressure limitation when we started out and we obviously wouldn't be expecting anything like that either.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Alex, I'm wondering if you can just characterize the discussions with shippers on XL about trying to extend their commitments. Obviously, they are committed to the project in general terms. but in more specific terms, what are the discussions like? Are you committing them in contract to extending commitments or how is that going and what can you say about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously there is some confidentiality associated with this, but what I can tell you is with that Q1 2015 in-service date we're talking about Keystone XL, we expect to have no problems whatsoever maintaining the vast majority of our shipping commitments through to that in-service date.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. Thanks for that. My other question is on the whole West Coast LNG strategy and certainly I understand Greg, your commentary about going into the Alberta System and the benefits to shippers in terms of optionality from there, especially given timing uncertainly about when LNG will be developed and in what quantity and the optionality of going in the Mainline. But I'm just wanting to be clear, is your pitch to shippers that they have to go into the Alberta System in order for you guys to ultimately take them to the West Coast or would you consider developing other pipelines to the West Coast that don't come directly off Alberta System maybe come off from other points whether it's Spectra or some other point like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we're a pipeline developer and if someone has a proposal that they want us to look at to build from any particular point, we would always look at those opportunities; my point being that it seems logical with gas coming where you have different partners, if you look at some of the proposals that are out there that have permits or don't, with gas in different regions of the basin that it seems to make economic sense for those kinds of consortiums to use the Alberta System, but we have the expertise to build pipe and we'll build it for people from where they want us to build it to, what market they want to go to.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. My first question is for Greg and it's a broader perspective on just pipeline returns in the natural gas world, and how do you think about returns and what's the appropriate level of return on equity for a pipe in an environment right now where you have the 10-year roughly around $2 and gas prices relatively like most around $2.50.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well. I think, Andrew, you have to think about always in the North American context whether it's a Canadian pipe or a U.S. pipe. Keep in mind that you need to be competitive in this environment. And so, when we're looking at settlements, for example, we've had two successes this year with GTN and with Tuscarora. We've got parties there with longer term contracts. They recognize that there is volatility in the marketplace. There is certainly this year volatility in weather and we see that. So, you can't just look at it on a 12-month basis. You have to look at these assets and these contracts over the longer term.</p>
          <p>So, I think what we're seeing in the U.S. is this kind of 11 to 12 or 13 range on quite a bit thicker equity than we've traditionally seen in Canada equities in the excess of 50% on pipes. We got a lot of older pipes that are getting more depreciated and the contracts are getting shorter and so that's driving some change in contracting strategies as we go forward. And as shale gas is causing flow patterns to change, it's driving changes in how tolls are structured whether it's seasonal, whether it's higher tolls on shorter hauls where the supply has moved to a different spot on the pipe, but generally large diameter already in the ground infrastructure that partially depreciates tends to be able to compete.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very helpful and then my second quarter is targeted to Alex and it's really on your storage business and this is somewhat similar and related to the question to Greg, but how do you think about expanding that storage business in the current market environment where there are some storage operators that are really struggling in the current market? Do you see some opportunities for M&amp;A or just development at this point with gas being so cheap in any kind of historic context or with near term history that development costs for new storage would actually be rather inexpensive versus trying to put in pad gas at $7-$10?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, no, I think that that's a really good question and I would say, I mean, certainly from an acquisition perspective, it's always our preference to be buying at the bottom of the cycle. And I think we clearly are, if we're not there in storage, we're pretty darn close And we are seeing some pretty attractive opportunity, a lot of previously high-flying companies are now struggling that have storage assets. So, I think we are going to take a hard look at that.</p>
          <p>On the development side we're always open to development opportunities and we always have a couple that we're working on. I would say right now when I look at the economics, it looks like at the present time it probably is cheaper to buy than to build in the short-term, but as &#x2013; we're always kind of doing the math.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just you had some comments earlier on where the Mainline volumes were, Russ, and I'm just wondering if you can just talk about how the cash came in for 2011 versus the revenue requirement. And then I know it's very early 45 days into the year, but can you give a sense of how far behind you are on budget for the 2012 revenue requirement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Greg, I'll tackle it, and then Russ can add any color he would like. We had filed for in our restructuring a deferral of about, that we would have short fall, about $175 million. That included the short fall from 2010, so we would have dealt with that deferral. And we're working towards a number that would have got us right there may be a little bit better and we did come in right around that number. So, I think $175 million versus $174 million, so right on top of that number.</p>
          <p>In the restructuring proposal, we've suggested we would defer a $100 million longer term and then the other $75 million would be part of the revenue requirement. When we file for 2012 tolls, we were expecting something closer to a normal as opposed to a really cold winter like we had last year, but more normal winter with volumes averaging about 3.4. We now see and expect that because we are a couple months in the year, a month and a half and we didn't get the winter volumes that we had last year that we'd expect to average more in the 3.2 range for 2012.</p>
          <p>I don't have an actual revenue number for you, but I would say that as to a total impact of what we're trying to do which is achieve a much lower toll on the Mainline, that couple hundred million a day would not have any kind of a significant impact, it'd be single cents.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to confirm, so for 2011 you were square versus plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just last question here, you talked about certainly trying to be self funding with the capital plan or at least the equity components of your projects, yet you still have $5 billion or so of CapEx that's in limbo for Keystone XL. So, I'm wondering how do you think about committing capital at this point with respect to projects that has multiyear lead times or are you really focusing on some of the shorter, quick deals like the solar or acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sort of it's all of the above. As we think as we said it at Investor Day, one of the benefits, there are benefits of delay from Keystone is that it spreads our capital expenditure over longer period of time and we do find ourselves with some financial capacity and there are some things that we hadn't done that we would like to do. Obviously, if there are short-term accretive opportunities that we can &#x2013; acquisition opportunities that we can go after in the short run here that can add earnings to our shareholders we will do that. There is not a whole bunch of that out in the marketplace right now, but there are few things that we're looking at, but I wouldn't say that they're substantial. I'd say that the bulk of the capital will be allocated to term projects as they arise and we do &#x2013; we have been working on a lot of those in our portfolio as well.</p>
          <p>So, it'll be a combination of things. Obviously as we said we want to make sure that we only spend within our own capital generated means and we will continue to do that and &#x2013; but some of this, Robert, will be opportunistic over the coming months, there is no sort of guiding force either direction right now. We want to add value to our shareholders and we'll do that, we'll allocate the capital as best we can to do that.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I just wanted to have a little bit more color on the Alberta System. We've seen the applications going up and the approval also going up and just wondered going into 2012 and 2013 the rate of applications and new projects there, how do you see that evolving, do you see the current trend continuing in terms of booking, and booking new projects and getting into construction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Greg Lohnes. So, we have both $900 million worth of projects that the NEB has now approved and $800 million of applications that are currently before them, and we expect to have contracted volumes come on about 3.4 Bcf by 2014. We stay in constant contact with our shippers, we're always dealing with them and all of those projects are moving forward and our shippers want to move them forward recognizing that our infrastructure is only piece of a much bigger expenditure that our producers in the area have. So, those projects are moving along.</p>
          <p>We are seeing with these low gas prices a shift in interest from more dry gas as you can expect to more of the wet gas areas, the Montney, the Duvernay areas, so we're seeing a shift there and move from interest in expanding in the dry gas area, see some of that maybe being pushed off a couple of years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Greg. And maybe you can tell me, what is the project completion timeline there for the $900 million, is it expected to be in service mid-2012, what is the timeline over the next couple of years for the deployment of that $900 million and the other $800 million that is likely to come?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't actually have in front of me the in-service dates, but they obviously vary, these are projects of number of different sizes, some would be a small loop, some would be a compression project, et cetera. So, they all &#x2013; they're kind drift in over that period of time to be ready for 2014. We do have 72 kilometers of 36-inch pipe we're building into the Horn right now and that project is going forward, we are hoping to have that in service in the spring. So, it's kind of spread out over that timeline. Some of those Northern areas its winter construction only. So, they wouldn't be starting until next fall.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys, few questions from me. I guess first of all just to put a finer point on your potential financing needs, you've already retired about $500 million of debt due this year and you have a little bit left. Given your lower CapEx budget year-over-year, should we expect to see TransCanada in the bond market or not this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we still have a need of &#x2013; we do &#x2013; about a $1 billion would be a rough number in the bond market this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of some of your U.S. natural gas pipelines, can you give me a sense for what you're seeing directionally maybe even quantify it in terms of tolls specifically any color on Northern Border, Great Lakes or ANR?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We wouldn't expect to see any change in the toll structure for any of those in 2012. I think the &#x2013; it's a question of volumes and some of our short-term sales. Northern Border is running pretty much full, strong tolls there, volumes would be expected to be pretty much on top of last year around sort of 1.7 Bcf a day. Great Lakes volumes are down right now a little bit, but we'd expect to be flat, maybe down a little bit to last year, and we are selling some of that capacity at a bit of a discount to our tolls, about $0.31 and we've been selling some of that slightly below there. And GTN, we just settled on GTN and we recognized we're losing some volumes from the Ruby project coming into service and we're seeing that come around, but we weren't counting on those volumes, we do still have some long-term contracts there, so we have very steady revenues coming in from GTN and we'd be running similar to last year, about 1.6 Bcf, 1.7 Bcf a day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then on Bison, can you give me a sense for utilization right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bison is contracted, so utilization doesn't impact our revenues there. But there are some pricing dynamics down in the Rockies area that have caused some of our shippers to take a different path and actually not use their contract commitments there every day. And so we have seen some volumes dropping down to some quite low levels on some days, but what happens then is, is that Bison comes in at about station 6 on the Northern Border line, so those volumes end up being replaced with volumes from Alberta because the Bison shippers hold matching contract capacity all the way down Northern Border. So they resell that capacity and we're actually moving higher volumes from Alberta than we had forecasted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Is it fair to say that you haven't really seen any signs of interest in additional compression capacity on Bison at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that would be fair. We do have one project and we are in talk with some shippers, but with the changing dynamics there, I think that's a ways off yet.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then last question, there are likely to be some pipeline assets on the market this year, can you just give us sense for your current thoughts on M&amp;A. I know you mentioned that it's in general cheaper to buy versus build, but are gas pipeline assets is something that TransCanada will take a look at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Definitely, that's our business. It's one of our core businesses and we're always looking for assets that are complementary to the assets that we have. We certainly keep track of what pipes are out in the market and what may or may not become available and, of course, we have some areas where if you look at the map, you see that we don't have as much penetration as we might like to have. And we certainly keep an eye on those pipes and try and stay in contact with the marketplace to understand what assets might come up. But it certainly &#x2013; our view is that existing infrastructure is very valuable and we've seen that with a few transactions that have taken place. So we view our assets as being valuable and we would look to expand that to the extent we can.</p>

          <p>Hi, there. I had two follow-up questions to some of the information that's been out in your presentation and with the analysts. One was in terms of the southern leg and whether you might proceed separately with the southern leg, what kind of timeline are you looking at in terms of making a decision on that?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, in terms of &#x2013; you mentioned, I believe, and correct me if I'm wrong, that you're looking at perhaps $600 million to $700 million in additional capital spending on Keystone XL in the next &#x2013; I'm not sure of the timeframe &#x2013; is that right and how much would that bring the total to in terms of capital spending on the XL line? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to the southern leg, as I've said in my earlier comments that is &#x2013; those discussions are ongoing right now. So far we've certainly had a high level of interest from potential shippers. Obviously, the differentials between Cushing and the Gulf Coast are at a pretty significant level right now. We think there is a pretty compelling need for the project. So, we got to do our homework with the shippers, but I would expect this is a kind of thing we'll be considering over the next couple of months here, a month or so. With &#x2013; I'm sorry what was the second question, again?</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">

          <p>Capital spending, and just to be sure who is speaking, is it Russ or Alex...?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And with respect to capital spending, I think we've said that at the end of 2011 we're about $2.4 billion all in on the Keystone XL project and the expectation is that over the next year we will probably invest another $600 million to keep the timeline and to maintain our equipment and material contracts that we've entered into.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your other question I think with respect to the $600 million or $800 million of additional capital, that's tied to three projects, the Cushing Marketlink project and the Bakken Marketlink project and the Houston Lateral, all of which we have obtained contractual support for. It does expand the capacity of the Keystone XL pipeline from some 700,000 barrels a day up to 830,000 barrels a day of which we're sort of fully contractually committed now for all of those volumes and it's moved the capital from I think, our estimate was around $7.5 billion and now we're sitting at around $7.8 billion in that kind of range. Our original estimate was about $7 billion and now we're sitting at about $7.8 billion.</p>

          <p>Hi, I think both my questions have got answered, but maybe I can ask given your interest in existing gas lines, whether or not you've looked at all at the potential of acquiring the Pacific Trails line that will serve the Kitimat LNG plant?</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I have a couple of questions. One, I would like to find out how you regrouped as a result of the delay that was announced last month? Have you had to lay off any staff, have you had to cancel any contracts associated with Keystone XL?</p>
          <p>And my second question is, this is obviously a major political issue in the United States, I would like to find out whether you're going to participate in this debate in any way or whether you're just going to stand on the sidelines and wait for the election to be over?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I guess, I'll try to answer them as best I can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to the delay in the process, of course that impacts the number of people that have working on our project. We were gearing up for construction at the end of the year and we've had to go back to our contractors and let them know that we aren't gearing up for construction at this point in time for the overall project and that has impacted their workforces. They have impacted the orders for equipment. Obviously, we don't need things delivered this year, we'll need them delivered next year and we have delayed those things as well.</p>
          <p>That said, our primary focus is on getting this pipeline built. With respect to political issues in Washington, that's not our focus, our focus is around the re-application, as Alex said, around the rerouting in Nebraska and doing what is necessary on the ground to move our project forward.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I just wanted to ask kind of a broad follow-up. How would you characterize the challenge to the company that's involved in building big infrastructure projects after the BP Macondo spill?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, the BP Macondo spill had an impact on the public awareness with respect to oil and gas infrastructure. It was followed by a couple of other very serious events in North America. I think that, obviously, shift the confidence of the general public in the safety of pipelines. I think the pipeline industry has responded extremely well to those and changed our practices and procedures.</p>
          <p>I think it's very important to distinguish the difference between a pipeline incident and Macondo. In Macondo incident there was natural pressure that couldn't be capped and we had a situation where that spill went on for an extended period of time because they didn't have the capacity to shut it down immediately.</p>
          <p>And I'd distinguish that very distinctly from a pipeline break where the instant that we determine that there is a minute change in pressure on our pipeline system, we have the ability to shut down our pipeline system immediately and remotely. We have about 35,000 sensors, for example, on our new pipeline system that are remotely monitored by satellite. The data is refreshed every five seconds and we have the opportunity to know exactly what's going into the pipeline or what's going on in the pipeline at any given point of time. So, if there is a break, we shut it down right away and once you take the pressure off the pipeline, the oil doesn't go anywhere, it stays contained in the pipeline.</p>
          <p>So, I think it's very important to distinguish between Macondo, but there is no question that Macondo changed how people view what we're doing and the bar at which they expect us to operate at, and we're up for that as an industry, and we're up for that as a company. We understand that people expect us to deliver oil safely every day, and want to know that that's being done in a way that they can be confident and that's probably good thing for all of us that those &#x2013; it's a never good thing if these events occur, but I think on the positive side we're all more aware and all more willing to up our game to make sure that the public remains safe.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick follow-up, given that more than half your capital for the $12 billion in projects for 2015 that you want to bring online, given that half of that is tied up in Keystone XL, and that's the biggest infrastructure project in North America, what do you say to investors who are sort of questioning the notion of having all your eggs in one basket <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:15:55) projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, this is what I'd is that TransCanada is a $50 billion corporation and while Keystone is a large project it by no means is a risk too large for our shareholders to just move forward. At the end of the day this is a pipeline, we're into it about $2.4 billion, we have secured about 95% of the right of way. The pipe is all sitting on the ground and the pumps are ready to be hooked up. For all intents and purposes, we're ready to go, we have a final environmental impact statement that said that the route that we've chosen doesn't have environmental impacts. We have the issues that we need to deal with in Nebraska, they are not insurmountable. The State of Nebraska, political and regulatory authorities are supportive of what we need to do, we will work collaboratively to get it done. I don't have any reservations that this pipeline is going to get completed. The U.S. needs to import some 10 million barrels a day of oil every day and currently get it from places like Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and Nigeria. We are just going to replace that oil with Canadian oil.</p>
          <p>The consumption in the U.S. doesn't change by us building this pipeline. It just makes sense all the way around. So, it's not too large for TransCanada to manage and we have a number of other projects underway, which fill up &#x2013; say the other half of the projects including expansion of Alberta System. We've got, say, Cartier Wind underway. We've got solar projects underway. We've got a lot of things going underway and I think, as I mentioned in my opening comments, we've about $50 billion worth of projects that we're looking at between now and in &#x2013; over the next decade. Now, we're certainly not going to be able to land them all. But those are the size of projects that a company like TransCanada has the capacity to execute and we'll continue to look for projects of that order of magnitude.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Lauren Krugel with The Canadian Press. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, hi, good afternoon. I just had a quick question about jobs and specifically ones that would be created after the pipeline starts up, not construction jobs, the permanent ones. We've seen a variety of estimates from as low as 20 to as high as 100. I am wondering if you can kind of flush out your own estimates and kind of explain how you came up with those figures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think at the current time that's not &#x2013; that we haven't discussed what our operating numbers are going to be. The debate publicly has been around does this project create jobs and I guess my first point is it's a $7 billion piece of infrastructure that needs to be constructed and built and that does create far more than a few jobs and we've been pretty specific in the 13,000 construction jobs right down to clerk that checks everybody in and out of the job site on a daily basis, as well from a manufacturing perspective when you have to buy what looks like some $3 billion or $4 billion worth of goods and services for the pipeline, obviously, that creates a lot of jobs as well.</p>
          <p>Then operating a $7 billion piece of infrastructure is a complicated function that does require bodies. We have operating staff in place along our pipeline system, and our synergies with our existing operations, but it will create new jobs. There is no question about that. It will also create ongoing secure employment in the refineries where we're going to deliver that oil to, processing, trucking and all the other ancillary benefits of operating via the pipeline. So it's a $7 billion piece of infrastructure with tankage and terminals and all those other kinds of things are going to create lots and lots of term employment. I don't have a number for you today as to what that exact number would be.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I just have another quick question, just wondering if you can comment on the latest Republican efforts to speed up a decision. It looks like they're adding some more legislative provisions today in Capitol Hill, are you banking on that? Is there any hope of that speeding things up, is it even helpful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our focus, as I've said, is on building the pipeline, that's what we do and that's what we have expertise in. We're focused right now on our re-application, as Alex said, we're focused on our re-route in Nebraska and working with Nebraskans to find a suitable route that meets their needs and advancing our project in any way we can. Obviously, any initiative that advances approval is positive for the project and positive for putting people back to work as quickly as possible. With that said, I mean, I'm not focused on what's going on there at all, our focus is 100% on the things that we know how to do, which is permit and construct pipelines.</p>
