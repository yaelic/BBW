          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Volvo's Conference Call and the Report on the First Nine Months 2008. It will start with a presentation, and thereafter, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. The conference will be chaired by Mr. Leif Johansson, CEO of Volvo.</p>
          <p>Mr. Johansson, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. This is Leif Johansson, President and CEO of the Volvo Group. Good afternoon, good evening and good morning to all of you and most welcome to this third quarter 2008 conference call.</p>
          <p>We have, as we normally have, we have our CFO with us, we have our business area leaders and we also have representatives for Investor Relations here. We have also on the Internet for you the slides that we will speak to.</p>
          <p>And I will start speaking on the first slide, slide number two, that says Group highlights and then we will switch the slides as we progress through the presentation here and after presentation comes the Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>The third quarter was a difficult quarter and you remember that we came off all time high in Q2 2008 with record sales, record profits, record margins. Now, what happened in the third quarter was that as we progressed through the quarter, we started seeing a very steep braking curve from our customers as they became more and more impacted by the downturn and the following liquidity crisis they have.</p>
          <p>And that meant that while the quarter started reasonably well off of quarter two over the progression of the quarter, it actually meant that quarter-on-quarter comparison, non-comparative for last year, we actually ended up with 2% growth or really no growth at all while you see the comparison there of 21% &#x2013; 26% in Q1 and 13% in Q2.</p>
          <p>Operating income, because we put our foot on the brake, came down 37%. We will speak more to that as we go through the presentation here but what we have elected to do is to immediately react and make the adjustments in production capacity as we see the different business areas generate slower sales and indeed also looking at order intake.</p>
          <p>We think that is the right way to address this situation rather than building for inventory and end up with both cash flow problems and potentially also a margin issue. So, we have decided not to build inventory. We were, in the main, successful in that in quarter three.</p>
          <p>Now, the business environment in Europe clearly has falling volumes and heading towards a downturn or we are in a downturn there from all of our different business areas. It's also so that we had, especially on the truck side and I'll speak more to that in detail, we had a number of cancellations of orders.</p>
          <p>We've seen some of that also in the other business areas if not to the extreme. So even customers, who in the short-term who have been looking for to take our products have actually had even to go back, sometimes even when the products have been produced and say, we cannot take them because we don't have the credit facilities that we thought we had because of the failure of the banking and financial system.</p>
          <p>Now unlike what we had expected, also, second point there, North America and Japan actually declined further. You remember that in Q2 we had a little of a scenario here that order intake had actually increased a little on the truck side and that would translate into slightly higher volumes in North America. What actually happened in the third quarter and progressively more difficult as we went through the quarter was our North American customers ending up in an acute liquidity crisis and actually we ended up with sales down by double-digit numbers. And while that has not been the case in Japan, Japan has been a more reasonable liquid market &#x2013; financially liquid market, we still see a great amount of uncertainty in Japan.</p>
          <p>And then over the quarter, you can say we still had very good development in South America and other international markets, but I think it is fair to say that in October we have begun to see signs also here, especially in India, China, to some extent also in Latin America of them being impacted by the global downturn.</p>
          <p>If you look at slide three the one that says Volvo Group net sales, there you see sales down minus four in Western Europe of off some very strong quarters there. Eastern Europe still holding up. North America actually in double-digit declines here, rather than the scenario we had where it would possibly go up. Asia still up off of some very powerful numbers, we are now down to plus three, and there is still a strong South America, and especially Brazil there.</p>
          <p>Now I'll be coming back to order intake as we speak through the presentation here. If you look at the operating income there, we actually had still good performance in Europe and international. And we did that as we delivered the order books that we had, but the order books obviously then shrunk in the quarter, but still good performance in Europe and international. The difficulties we've had when it comes to Europe and international has been that in many cases we had to reallocate production from Europe to international markets and that have put little of a pressure on margins here and there. But in general, you can say had we only looked at Europe and international, we would have had quite a decent quarter.</p>
          <p>Now what didn't turn out well at all in the quarter and actually produced negative results in the quarter was operations in the U.S. &#x2013; truck operations in the U.S. Basically, we had to send home a lot more people there in the third quarter and make reductions both in Hagerstown and in New River Valley, yet again.</p>
          <p>Volvo CE also contributed negatively here in operating income development that's off of the same type of problems that you have seen on the truck side, more so also on the material cost side and then also we took in a one-time cost in connection to that.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D expenses on comparative &#x2013; comparable quarters is actually up by almost 800 million. That's on the base of some aggressive programs when it comes to new and competitive products that we are in the midst of introducing right now. Some of which is Volvo trucks new product range, also hybrids and of course also the emission standards running up here. And we will see how that rolls out over the next couple of quarters.</p>
          <p>Cost inflation of raw materials was one billion higher. Most of that of course has been offset in pricing, but some of it obviously &#x2013; on a real comparative only on the cost side. It was actually a billion higher quarter-on-quarter comparison there.</p>
          <p>Restructuring then in North America, as a consequence of the much lower North American market, both at Volvo Construction Equipment and Mack and we took the charge of that of 330 million. And then just to make the point, even if it might be self-evident, when you put the brakes on as much as we have here, there is no way to get rid of costs or be able to part with people at the same rate that we have put the brakes on here. So, clearly it was a quarter of under absorption. Which, of course, is a cost that one pays when one puts the brakes on as much as we have here. We think it's the appropriate thing to do even if it means underabsorption in the quarter like quarter three, so as not to build inventories.</p>
          <p>Flip slides with me to the Volvo Group, sales growth over year-on-year, there you just see, the impact of putting the brakes on, and we have actually in, done, parted with most of our temporary people in different countries, coming off of that base there in &#x2013; last year and the start of this year. Then we are now biting in and we have given notice all in all to between 6 and 7,000 people so far as we progress through the downturn in Q3 and also trying to adjust to a much lower market than we had at the end of last year and beginning of this year.</p>
          <p>With that, let me switch over to Mikael Bratt, our CFO, for him to take us through, first the cash flow slide, slide five.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. I will today focus my presentation on cash flow and also the funding activities for the Group.</p>
          <p>Starting with cash flow then on page five. This quarter we presented a negative cash flow for our industrial operation of SEK 6.1 billion. And let me also underline that Q3 is normally a tough quarter from a cash flow perspective. And as you have seen in '07, we also were negative even though only 0.4 billion.</p>
          <p>The negative effect could first to be found in inventory and payables primarily. We have seen an increase in inventory all with today 2.4 billion in the quarter and this is then adjusted for currency and a reduction in payables with 6.5 billion, which also is the biggest factor. And this is an immediate effect of the reduction in our production volumes.</p>
          <p>With this development, we now have a cash conversion cycle of 38 days and a net debt position of 23.8 billion taking us to 32.4 of shareholders' equity. In this net debt position is also the net effect from the Eicher transaction of 1.2 billion that took place in quarter three as well.</p>
          <p>Moving on to our funding situation on page six. Starting on the asset side, which is the bar to the left. You can then see there as we have a strong cash position of 26 billion. We have an objective here to be between 6 and 10% in cash over sales.</p>
          <p>On top of that we also have our committed facility as a reserve for funding purpose with another 23 billion. Those facilities is maturing in 2011 and 2013, so they are long commitment there.</p>
          <p>On the debt side, which is the smaller bars you see here, is portfolio. And then the debt side or the industrial side, I should also say, is around 43 billion and has an average maturity of 4.6 years. And if you look at the maturity structure, you can see that this asset is well distributed with a maturity profile that stretches out couple of quarters here. And going forward the cash flow is, of course, on top of the agenda.</p>
          <p>And also in the market, you could say that we have primarily used the bilateral funding in order to manage the volatile time that has been during the last couple of weeks here. The normal funding sources have been used very limited and when this market returns to more normal stage, we have more than 50% of our ordinary program unused, so we have good results there.</p>
          <p>And if you look also on page seven, you see there the debt portfolio for commercial finance activities. And it's a fully matched portfolio, somewhat shorter maturity, 1.4 years, but as I said it's fully matched against the receivables in the customer finance portfolio.</p>
          <p>Finally, on page eight, a few words on pension and residual values which many of you have asked us about in the last couple of weeks. The pension plan asset is something we primarily have in the U.S., Sweden, and the U.K. And we are at this stage fully funded and we currently do not see any need for additional cash contribute in that at this point in time.</p>
          <p>Residual values, I could say it here, that we use a very conservative approach when setting residual values. And we have a much more stringent policy in place than what we have had those time around when we saw downturn. And we are in the residual value setting, taking into account the use, geographic area where the truck is sold et cetera, et cetera. So, there are a number of parameters taken into consideration. And then it's set and reviewed on a quarterly basis where the residual value commitments are valued and provisions are taken when necessary. And they are done contract by contract basis &#x2013; on a contract by contract basis.</p>
          <p>Now, for Q3 we have made about SEK100 million in provisions related to the U.S. exposure. And on a global perspective, I would say, we still have headroom left until we get into &#x2013; move out of some territories.</p>
          <p>Yes, as a follow-up on the question we got earlier today on &#x2013; during the press conference, regarding the capability in the mother company to handle dividend of the size they have done in the past. I just wanted to comment there that we are managing the group through group contributions and dividends up in the structure here throughout the year and you should not read only in this quarter what's available there and there will be sufficient sums available. So from that perspective, there are no formal issues related to the dividend. And I will stop there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, somewhere with us again then to the slide with a truck. And let me comment on the trucking group's performance and operations.</p>
          <p>And obviously you look at the net sales there, you can say we came off of a quarter of almost 53 billion in sales into a quarter where the actual number turned out to be 46. And that hit margins also all the way from 9.2 in Q2 to 5.8 in Q3, on the back of putting the brakes on, slamming the breaks here, in big parts of the world.</p>
          <p>First of all, we had a significant slowdown in demand in Europe and most relevant perhaps to discuss a little of the order intake there. So the order intake actually netted, it looks like we had a 100% fall and that of course is netted in reality. We had 20,000 new orders come in, in the European business and 20,000 new orders were then offset by around 20,000 cancellations.</p>
          <p>What happened there was that the order book then many of our customers decided to cancel their orders or push forward orders even sometimes in the real near-term, you can say within the quarter. And we had a number of opportunities to use production slots that were particularly aimed for Europe for international business. But the 20,000 number, of course, is not such a bad number for the whole of Europe. And that means that we had &#x2013; there is life in the European market. But I think the best way to describe what's happening here is that given the great uncertainty, frankly the very non-working financial factor, when it comes to liquidity and credit promises, our customers simply just take the uncertainty as a reason to say, let's now be careful and see what's going to happen here before we put in new orders.</p>
          <p>Any which way 20,000 new orders in Europe, we are looking at a very significant slowdown, compared to where we have been even in the quarter one and quarter two, so clearly a declining market in that sense.</p>
          <p>Operating income then went about 1 billion less than last year down to 5.8% margin and obviously significantly lower than quarter two profitability. And the main that was driven by North America, you can say we are still reasonably pleased with their performance. Actually our European truck group, but trends that we thought would be slightly on the positive side for North America, coming out of quarter two, the OEM quarter three, turned out to be very negative and we ended actually up with double-digit minuses in North America.</p>
          <p>And that seems to have gotten worse over the quarter and of course, for a couple of weeks there in September and also in part of October, there were acute liquidity crisis in North America. Obviously aimed at impacting, well had an impact in the way we were doing business and the way our customers felt they could do business. We have decided then in the truck group as we have in other parts of the group to make the adjustments in production system and overhead costs rather than to wait for turnarounds and we have adjusted them to lower demand over the quarter and we will continue to adjust. And we have made a number of announcements also in October to make adjustments to output in the next couple of quarters here.</p>
          <p>Now some of the trouble we have here of course is that when you have to step on the brakes as hard as we have here, and we normally have noticed times between three and six months, those noticed times in general if you can use them for productive work can be a fairly low cost way of parting with costs. But obviously, if you cannot use them for productive work they turn out to be un-absorption in the manufacturing system.</p>
          <p>If you look at, in-focus then we have production management obviously and frankly busy days with the amount of changes that we have here, reworking shift changes and getting a lot of people out of the system, and with that comes all of the efficiency issues translated with moving lots of people in terms of happening from moving lots of people around in the productivity production system.</p>
          <p>Cost efficiency and productivity is high on the agenda to make sure that we can deliver good cost efficiency and productivity through the next couple of quarters also. Let me say that we had the whole of the AB Volvo Board out to visit India and we saw the integration projects going on with Eicher and we also had the opportunity to make a real visit with Nissan Diesel. All of which sounds good and we're quite happy with those acquisitions and the way we are bringing them into the Volvo Group.</p>
          <p>Then we have this unique issue of a couple of quarters now Q3 particularly, Q4 will be there also where we are still trying to manage to get across to the customers some very high material cost inflation, which is really now what we know now historic numbers as most of the raw material have started to come down. But we're still in the process there of convincing our customers to take on extra prices because of the material cost inflation to the extent that we can't do that, material cost inflation actually comes out as a negative in the third quarter here. Big, I should say in general price increases there have been technology related like emission standards we have been quite successful in getting across to the market, even in the downturn for example in North America.</p>
          <p>If you flip with me to the slide 10 it says heavy-duty truck market, Europe and that we have actually put a question mark there for 2009 numbers really on the basis that we have no good information from which to guess or forecast in '09. So that makes it less meaningful to forecast. We have noted the clear down trend there and we certainly think that is the case. And while all of us are now focused on that downturn, let's just remember that trended dotted line there &#x2013; the trend &#x2013; dotted trend line there. It actually shows and we expect that to be the case that we will have an increasing longer term, medium and long-term increasing transport market. Nothing in our basic view of how the market has changed at all. It's actually so that the Greater Europe is still a very interesting market that one that will continue longer term to go. But, we think in '09, we are going to have to address the downturn, price of which we cannot forecast.</p>
          <p>Likewise, you can see the trend line there on the North American truck market where we have now been a couple of years very much below that trend line. And our basic forecast on last quarter was for the market to start coming back second half of '08 and possibly to increase in 2009.</p>
          <p>We're making the same question mark here for 2009 in North America with little to have to go on forecasting is obviously very much dependent on how liquidity and credit crunch plays out and over time also how the economic cycle plays out. But let me make the point here, again same reasoning that we had in quarter two, that even with a downturn in the economic cycle, we actually have a very low output of trucks into the North American markets. We are beginning to see a quite old population of trucks there.</p>
          <p>So, sooner or later, the market is going to turn up and come closer to or possibly overshooting the trend line. We also have the emissions standards coming with remarkably higher cost products in 2010 and it would surprise us if everything was reasonably normal, if that didn't have a good effect on the American truck market in 2009. But of course, it is dependent on where the whole of the economy and the financial crisis takes us.</p>
          <p>Flip with me to trucks, to the trucks slide on number 12. In general then, good market share development in trucks, Volvo Trucks, Renault Trucks and Nissan Diesel. Slightly less good on the Mack Truck side, because Mack is so heavily involved in construction business in the U.S. and obviously that is a negative industry to serve with equipment right now.</p>
          <p>Production adjustment being made in all parts of the Group, all four brands, and as you can see here then, the Japanese market also considerably down in 2008, off of a week 2007. So, again an effect there on the financial crises. Integration work actually going well on Nissan Diesel and we are quite proud to see Mack Truck here registering well both in the Dealer Service and JD Power but also a 32% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions that made EPA happy with us. It made also us happy because it translates directly into fuel savings from a operating cost point of view.</p>
          <p>And with that, let me conclude the quarter for trucks and hand over to Tony Helsham and ask him to speak about Construction Equipment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Leif. Yes, let me say and start by saying after a good Q1 and Q2 this year, obviously and clearly, we had a very difficult Q3. And I can overall summarize and say that the comment that Leif has made regarding liquidity around the world and the market effects are very much relevant to Construction Equipment as well, with one exception and that is the Construction Equipment industry has also being hit hard in Q3 in Europe whereas I think the comments were that the truck business in Europe was still fairly reasonable in Europe in Q3.</p>
          <p>So, despite lower volumes overall, our sales were up slightly in the quarter, however clearly the operating income was sharply down and quite frankly a great disappointment to us all, driven mainly by us hitting the brakes hard and taking the effects there by the downturn of the business in Europe and the combination of the effects of continuing higher fuel prices for the quarter, some portion of currency effects and one-time effects taken in the quarter for some structural changes that we've announced regarding Motor Graders.</p>
          <p>From a market perspective, the market conditions are not looking all that favorable. Europe now was down 24% for the quarter and North America continues to deteriorate from a rather low level. And for the first time for a long period, we see in totality Asia also starting to decline. And in these declines in the totality cannot be totally compensated for now by the increases that we still see in a region international.</p>
          <p>So, for the full year 2008, we expect Europe now to be down some 15 to up to 20%. North America to continue to decline up to maybe another 20%, and if we take the combination of all the other markets around the world, we do see growth still some 15, maybe up to 20%.</p>
          <p>So, of course, in focus and moving forward here of course, our focus is on recession management. We have taken some tough decisions in the last few months regarding adjustments to the production system to reduce the volumes and reduce the overhead costs and to adjust for the lower demand. So, we, of course, announced in September we have decided to consolidate our industrial operations in the road machinery in order to improve competitiveness and profitability and also reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuation and we recorded a cost of SEK300 million in the quarter for closing down our factory in Goderich in Canada and consolidating that into our factory in Shippensburg.</p>
          <p>And as you have seen in the press, also in September we announced that we gave notice to around 500 employees in Sweden affecting all our Swedish entities. And as we continue to see the demand next year continuing to level out at a lower level than perhaps what we saw a few months ago, we as early as yesterday, announced a further redundancy program in Sweden for another 850 employees. So I would say, in Sweden as we have already done in France and in Germany and now also in Korea we are taking the tough decision to make the adjustments as we see the volumes going forward.</p>
          <p>And then finally, also we have clearly still work to do to fully integrate the acquired road machinery business as well as the Chinese business Lingong. So there is still much work to be do there &#x2013; to do there and a good focus being paid to that as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Tony, thank you. Flip with us to slide 14 at buses and we have H&#xE5;kan Karlsson, President of buses, to speak to us about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. The bus market shows, I would say, greater differences between coaches and city buses. In the coach segment, we are in a downturn mode, I will say, while the city bus segment is still holding up globally. And I think this reflects in our order intake which was improved compared to last year with 14%.</p>
          <p>The sales in the quarter were slightly above last year and the profit was still weak on the same level that we had last year. We got some significant currency revaluation in Brazil. The real is weakening with 20% which hampers the result in Q3.</p>
          <p>We have finished our industry restructuring in Europe according to the planning in the slower third quarter and that means that we are 500 people less now in the industry system in Europe.</p>
          <p>We have launched our hybrid bus in Europe with extremely big interest, I'll say, from the market. And then now, we will run the field test vehicles in London and G&#xF6;teborg from November this year. And we are starting selective sales to them, with deliveries in the end of 2009.</p>
          <p>In focus, the global profitability program will continue to deliver during the next coming quarters. We focus hard on the inventory management on the coach side and we also there made some capacity adjustments to the coach segment. Whilst in the city segment we are focusing in much on winning some big tenders and there's been a strong order book for 2009.</p>
          <p>Thank you, Leif.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. Thank you H&#xE5;kan. Come with us to slide 15, at Volvo Penta and G&#xF6;ran Gummeson, who's the President of Volvo Penta there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you Leif. The global market for marine engines in Europe and North America declined during the third quarter and that was mainly due to the financing problems at bolt dealer level but also the underlying lower demand for bolts and we actually expect the marine market to come down even further.</p>
          <p>Sales on the contrary of industrial engines were quite strong during the quarter and &#x2013; but because then of the decline on the marine engine market, our total sales was flat compared to last year. Operating income and margins were weakened due to lower sales and we had an unfavorable product mix, but also on deliberate decisions on products and process development costs.</p>
          <p>Last week we gave notice to 90 people at our engine factory in Vara, Sweden, and we will finalize these negotiations then with the unions during the fourth quarter. We are also reviewing the structure in both North America and Europe as we speak and that, the total operations in these countries in order to increase efficiency and also reduce the operating expenses.</p>
          <p>We had for instance already restructured our operations in Scandinavia and also in South America. We've then had an acceptable momentum for our IPS systems in the marketplace and we will be able to capitalize even further on this engine range because &#x2013; we can say that we are now launching new and IPS packages with larger drive units and compare, and also with larger engines based on the Volvo Groups diesel engine platforms base. So that's everything from Volvo Penta.</p>

          <p>Very good. Thank you, G&#xF6;ran. That's takes us to Olof Persson and Volvo Aero, and Tony was the last time, I think, on Construction Equipment to make a presentation. Olof is the last time on Volvo Aero, because next time he will be presenting the Volvo Construction Equipment as the new head of Volvo Construction Equipment. Olof, shall you talk about Volvo Aero this time?</p>

          <p>Yes. If we start on a market side, we can see that the air traffic growth is now flattening out. Basically all regions report lower growth rates and particularly on U.S. domestic market has been decreased during 2008. However, on the order book side for large commercial aircrafts there has been an increase and continues to grow. And that shows also in our order backlog, which is actually 37% higher this quarter compared to the same period in 2007. That means also that our component business continued to grow in a fairly good manner and with good margins.</p>
          <p>In this quarter we have been negatively affected both on the sales side and on operating income side by lower volumes in the after market business, due to lower activity in the market. We had in the quarter a successful test and also confirmation on our new composite technology, where if you remember, we bought a company named ACAB in December last year. And we are now moving forward with that technology and had a successful test together with our source proving that we are on the right tracks strategically on that. And we will see a &#x2013; on a comparable basis with the metro composite structural component of 30% decrease in weight, which is quite a lot.</p>
          <p>In focus, we are now re-intensifying the market profitability program. We are doing that by cost structure reorganization but also aggressively going after new, new contracts, which can help us lifting up the volumes in the after market. Since we have very long contracts, we are continuously working on the product cost rationalization and even though we have a key products partnership structure and we continue to work on the product cost continuously. And of course in quarter two and quarter three we took large orders with Rolls and with Pratt &amp; Whitney and in focus right now, it's, of course to execute on these new contracts. That was extra Leif.</p>

          <p>All right. We have the financial services &#x2013; this is Sal Mauro on slide 17. Sal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. In the third quarter of 2008 we had good, strong new business volume at SEK10.9 billion, as Volvo was rolling we had 43.3. So obviously, in a downturn, it's a good time to have a captive finance company and we're looking to grow volume with good credits. Our income has remained stable from the fourth quarter of 2007, obviously a bit lower than in quarter three 2007, but still on a good level at SEK391 million.</p>
          <p>After tax, return on equity has come down along with the profitability from the year-over-year quarter, and most of that has to do with adding credit provisions, especially in our North American portfolio. Penetration is steady and we're looking to grow penetration, as we are going into the down part of the cycle.</p>
          <p>In Focus, we have heightened portfolio management as a reminder of VFS as a collateralized lender. We secure our loans with the Volvo Group product that we finance. We have a matched portfolio from an interest rate perspective, liquidity, currency and tenure, so we do not have any interest rate risk in the portfolio. The portfolio structure is quite conservative. We have 36% installment credit, 36% in financial lease, which carries a very small or nominal residual value, typically the last payments or under 5%. And we also to do dealer financing at 16.5.</p>
          <p>We do operating leases or operational leases where they do carry a market residual that is guaranteed by the business area and that makes up only about 10% of the entire portfolio. We do engage in fee income products. We do not have at-risk insurance or maintenance contracts. We provide service there and we do that for a fee only.</p>
          <p>Taking a look at the global financial market, obviously it's been challenging times in the credit and liquidity market, but for VFS it's been business as usual. We have funded every deal, we have wanted to fund from a credit perspective and I think that's good news for the Volvo Group. We have seen interest costs increase from treasury, our in-house bank, and we've been passing those interest cost increases to our customers.</p>
          <p>We actually see opportunities in the downturn. We are looking, as I said, for greater market share with good credit customers, an opportunity also to increase margins and also look for some good talent. We are here in good times and bad times. We are not fair-weather friends as some of our competitors have proved to be.</p>
          <p>We will continue to look for good credit standards and good credit customers, and we look to expand the portfolio and support the Volvo Business areas and Volvo customers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sal. Takes us to slide 19 and a short summary, the one, the slide that says Group Summary. You see earnings there after the couple of fairly decent quarters. We obviously came down by 37% in compared to Q3 '07. That's on the base of reducing sales compared to Q2 this year by 13% in the quarter and really hitting the break hard here to make sure that we don't produce inventory, especially.</p>
          <p>We &#x2013; the reason that we are so uninterested in producing inventory is that we've been, think that not only does it have a cash flow negative aspect to it, it also has a margin aspect to it. We don't want to be out there with a big inventory. And in the main, we have been able to take that, you saw from Mikael's slide here that we put a couple or a little more into inventory in the quarter but not very much. And most of the cash flow effect was actually the payable effect of breaking as we did.</p>
          <p>We are releasing also competitive new products. We are in the midst of the new Volvo truck introduction here in Europe. We feel great enthusiasm around those products. And likewise on the Renault truck side, wherein many new products have been introduced and all of that came together to actually giving us 20,000 new orders in the European system there.</p>
          <p>And likewise on across the board, we have competitive new product releases, that includes Mack and VCE and we think they have been well received with their focus on fuel efficiency and greater productivity, which we think right now our customers need to stay competitive in their respective businesses.</p>
          <p>In Focus Going Forward, we have made in September but also during October a lot of announcements when it comes to adjusting production capacity and cost. The way we do that is for each business area or even each part of business area to work out what the numbers look like and order intakes are quite different across different parts of the group.</p>
          <p>And therefore, we are announcing as quickly as we have decided what to do, we are announcing locally as we can to make sure that we don't get tangled up in the internal workings of the Group. So each business area leader, but internal, so the people who report today are charged with making sure the production capacity and cost is in line with the actual demand that we have.</p>
          <p>We have an issue here, when it comes to the global crisis and normally in a normal down cycle the Group would have had fairly big opportunities to move production capacity with a diversified footprint. We have to move production capacity from, for example, Europe to international.</p>
          <p>Now we are beginning to see a global situation, that's because of the financial crisis is coming down most everywhere. And hopefully, as the financial crisis is coming under control, we will come back into a more normal mode of a business cycle to go through. I think what we have right now is actually a fairly normal business cycle in its own right, but then much impacted by a global financial crisis.</p>
          <p>Integrating acquisitions is on track and doing well. We are happy to see how those reports are coming in and that's not only on the truck side, it's also true on the Construction Equipment side. Obviously, a key target for us when it comes to going through as steep a cycle as this is to make sure that we can deliver cost efficiency and productivity over the business that we have been, and to be able to operate efficiently on lower volumes that we have. And obviously, that becomes an issue of how to break and get into those modes. But we clearly have them &#x2013; have that on our top of our agenda.</p>
          <p>And then, of course, we are in the midst here of introducing environmentally friendly, but in the main, that also means fuel efficient, products, and that has met with great interest from our customers and most specifically, perhaps, on the hybrid side, which is seen during 2008 as mainly as cost but we think over time in 2009 is going to contribute nicely to the group's development, also from a profitability point of view.</p>
          <p>And with that operator let me stop the presentation and open up for any Q&amp;A that you may have.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Could I just clarify, did you say on the earlier call that you are taking out 30% of your blue-collar staff? Or did I get that wrong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well if you are taking catch-all number and it is very different in different parts of &#x2013; the truck group and it's different in different parts of the CE. But if you wanted a catch-all number and someone did, then you can say somewhere between 20 and 30%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then can I ask &#x2013; do you have any order book coverage for the rest of Q4 or is it more on a day-to-day basis that we are back to the good old days when you booked an order and got delivery reasonably quickly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, No. We have quite an order book, as we said on the truck side is actually back to normal and normal now means two or three months' lead time still on trucks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you have two or three months, yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on R&amp;D expenses you mentioned that we will see what happens with that &#x2013; are you contemplating a move, pushing forward projects or delaying projects so to speak and to delay and to negate the negative impact from R&amp;D?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes sure. We are taking a look at that if &#x2013; when the market comes down as dramatically as they have here, there should be no sacred cows. So, we are taking a look at all types of costs. We have high ambition when it comes to, in connection with the emissions standard, changes, to also make good changes in the rest of our product ranges. And we have said internally here no sacred cows and therefore we are going to take a look at that also. But our basic inclination at this point in time at least is to make sure that we deliver competitive products to our customers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then a final question on construction equipments maybe for Tony. You know, you generate about the third of sales in construction equipment from emerging markets, Asia and the other. Have you seen any increased presence there from the Chinese? So what I understand is that the domestic market in China is weak and you have some very big players. Have you seen that coming in to a greater extent now?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't seen it at a greater extent. We have seen over the last 12 months or so selected Chinese manufacturers moving into or testing the market in particularly Latin America and also Southern Africa. But we haven't seen an increase in their export as a consequence of perhaps the slowdown in China.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Mr. Alexis Albert from Natixis. Please go ahead with your question, sir. Mr. Alexis, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Excuse me, can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry. So, Alexis Albert of Natixis Securities in Paris. I have three questions, if I may. The first one is regarding North America, there is something, I have trouble to understand because last year during the Q3 2007, your revenue in North America went down by 50%. And I think this quarter it went down by 10%. And it looks like the burden you got from North America this quarter was much more higher than it was last year. And if I remember last year you also had some layoff in North America. So, just like to understand better what happened this quarter in North America?</p>
          <p>My second question is regarding Russia, can you share with us the order intake in Russia? How down is it?  And my last question is regarding the, I would say, the operating guidance for trucks over the cycle. I would like to know if the &#x2013; your guidance for the operating margin, although the cycle was a plus and minus, is still valid if the European truck market is going down by 20% in 2009? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On North America, I think you're a little in between the different quarters here in comparison. We have a real effect in North America this quarter. Really based on the fact that our assessment was and our order intake showed that we should have a slight uptick in quarter three. And we actually had a scenario, that said we are going to have to meet higher demand in quarter four. And then over the quarter that reversed itself into an actual &#x2013; real, already in Q3, a real negative double-digit negative. And on top of that hesitancy on the order book for quarter four.</p>
          <p>So we've decided to take the &#x2013; the consequences of that was to make reductions in quarter three much different to what we have planned. You could, might say it's somewhat abrupt and it had a negative effect. But again, we are in the midst of making sure that we don't build unnecessary inventory in this situation. So, we had perhaps more of an effect there than a normal quarter-on-quarter comparison rollout would give you.</p>
          <p>Russian order intake, I don't have the specific numbers but it's clearly on a downward trend. And if you do the 20 to 42, if I remember then I'd say about minus 50% real order downturn. That's -- then Russia is about the same. So, Russia behaves as greater Europe, you can say.</p>
          <p>Then on the operating margin, we have no reason to change our guidance on operating margins. But I must admit also that it's very difficult to, and as you hear we are not even calling what the market will be next year. So, we are living in very extraordinary times. But in normally &#x2013; normal ordinary times we would not give any other guidance at all. These extraordinary times we're going to have to swing &#x2013; take the swings as they come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just one follow-up if I may, regarding North America. Would you say that, I know you don't comment on this usually, but the times are not usual. Would you say that this quarter North America was not at breakeven?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you know I normally don't quote this, and even though this is abnormal times, I won't comment on that either.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Mr. Jeremy Taylor from AllianceBernstein. Please go ahead with your question, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon, gentleman. Two questions please. The first one on customer financing, where you say that you expect penetration to rise somewhat in the downturn. Could you tell us a little bit more about how you're thinking about that? Does that reflect looking to stabilize new lending, or would you actually look to grow lending.?And what sort of limits would you place on that through the cycle?</p>
          <p>And the second question, the cleansing process that you've been to, through the order book in European trucks. How much &#x2013; how confident are you that you squeezed out most of the cancellations now, or do you think there's a risk of further cancellations in Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's have Sal start with the financial question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good one. And the first thing I would like to say is that we will hold our credit standards as we have in the good times and now in the bad times. So we have to make sure that our customers are creditworthy. But we're coming from a level of about 28% overall for the group, and I believe we will be looking towards more 35, 40, and I'd say we'd start to top out at about 45%, so if I had to put a limit, I would say at about 45% is where we would like to be.</p>
          <p>So, it is on new lending. We think we have greater opportunities in the market to penetrate the different business areas, customers, build relevance and also increase margin and get some good profitability into the group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And let me &#x2013; Leif here, talk about the cleansing process. We have gone through a most dramatic quarter here in Q3 and for that matter October also. So I &#x2013; and when you do a &#x2013; you take out 100% of real order intake, and you actually cancel, then I think you can say we have gone very deep into the books and we have done a very thorough job.</p>
          <p>So our basic assessment would be that the orders that we have now on our books have gone through not only a real cleansing period during one of the most difficult quarters, but also all of the impact of the financial crisis and everything else from our customers. Even with that said, we live in very extraordinary times. We have a situation here where we hear customers daily calling us to say that credit promises that they thought they had only a week ago is no longer viable et cetera, et cetera. So we cannot say that there is &#x2013; that, that the present order book is without risk either. But real cleansing has gone on here and hopefully that's enough, we don't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Mr. Colin Gibson from HSBC. Please go ahead with your question sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Colin Gibson at HSBC again. Yeah, Jeremy just asked one of my questions, so I'll focus on the second which was regarding R&amp;D again. I think earlier in the year you guys were indicating that you expected R&amp;D to turn into a bit more of a tailwind in year-on-year comparisons as opposed to the headwind it was earlier in this year, based on your beliefs about the amount of R&amp;D that you would be capitalizing as opposed to the amount of R&amp;D which you would be expensing. So coming from a high level of expensing and moving towards a higher level of capitalization. Is that something you still expect and if so, is that something whose effect is going to be concentrated in Q4 or has something changed significantly there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me see. I'm looking at Mikael, our CFO to sort that out. There were not so big effects in Q3 here in capital...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Q3, the net effect was only a negative 59 million coming from R&amp;D capitalization. So with that said, the majority is to the growth spending. And to really make a prediction I would &#x2013; would look forward &#x2013; going forward is very difficult depending on how the projects are developing and the timing of them. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're a consequence of how we actually start up manufacturing our products and we start &#x2013; we will try to sort that out a little for you. My comments earlier were also on the growth spending side. Frankly on the difference between the capitalization and the projects that they roll out, we should not have big differences as we move into more normal states, then obviously you have un-normal divide here to look at, but we'll try to sort that out a little for you if there are big changes coming up. My comments earlier and I might say that that I think is more relevant, is the actual spending for quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. And then a related, but slightly broader follow-up, if I may? When it comes to Euro 6, given the current business climate, would you be in favor of bringing forward Euro 6? Now there has of course been some discussion in the marketplace, I understand. Would you be in favor of bringing forward Euro 6 on the basis that would level the playing field between SCR and EGR players because even EGR players would have to ease SCR for Euro 6. Or would you be against bringing forward Euro 6 on the basis it will cost you more money right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, right now we are in the midst of really having a big debate between the Council and the European Parliament and then industry on the side. I would probably say that Euro 6, whether it's one year earlier or later which is really not the timespan that we were discussing about, strategically or operationally has little effect. SCR is beginning to be the winner altogether when it comes to technology moving forward. And Euro 6, I think, we &#x2013; as far as we know, it will be there. So I would probably say, less of an issue for us. We could live with either or it would have fairly little impact.</p>
          <p>But let me make another point and that is come U.S. 10 and also then the &#x2013; both new long-term standards in Japan, the relevant standards in Japan, from our point of view, of course, it would be a great effect, if our different lawmakers on either side of the Atlantic, and Japan could actually come in to harmonize tail pipes. Because we are spending a lot of money, and I should say unnecessarily so, on trying to fulfill different standards on different sites in different parts of continents in the world, without it having any realized effect. If you measure the real effect that comes out of the tailpipe, very, very little effect. So we would certainly argue strongly for harmonizing emission standards all over the world.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon it's Nico Dil from JPMorgan. Three quick questions please. First of all on the working capital, as you highlighted yourself, inventory was exceptionally high during the quarter and payables maybe on the low side. How do you expect this to develop going forward, and especially on the payable side?</p>
          <p>Second question is on the raw material impact. You highlighted about 1 billion for the quarter, and even a bit more next quarter. So I was wondering whether that will perhaps reduce to let's say half the size or should we be thinking of even less?</p>
          <p>And then perhaps the last question is you've highlighted almost a freeze in the capital lending for your customers. And I was wondering what you're hearing from your customers or even their bankers, when that could perhaps start to lighten up a little bit? So when could we see these orders coming back? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Right. On the cash flow side, obviously our desire here is to build down inventory and to have the right amount of inventory, as it relates to the market that we have. And since the market has now come down our intention is clearly to build down inventory in Q4. And what you will see then we think, but it all depends on the credit crisis, is for the inventory to reduce, but of course over the quarter that will in the main be translating into accounts receivables. And then depending on how hard we have to brake, you will see the same calculation effect, arithmetic effect on the payable side. But all of our focus is on making sure that we can get good cash flow going here over the next quarter and over the next couple of quarters.</p>
          <p>And let me talk a little about that too, because I understand here that we have quite a big discussion on cash flow and as it relates to the dividend and I've answered a couple of times now and I've also done comments in media on that. And obviously from a cash flow and dividend point of view they go together.</p>
          <p>Cash flow is on the top of our minds and let me just remind you that the whole of the management group has more than half of their total remuneration package coming from our ability to get cash flow, so we have this in our focus. The Board recommends in Sweden to the shareholders for the general assembly to decide. And that's the way you can say, it's going; the Board doesn't decide, but the shareholders decide, but the Board recommends.</p>
          <p>So far when the Board has recommended, they have basically done three things:  they've looked at how was the year in terms of cash flow and profits, they have looked at how is the situation in the relevant quarter, what is the situation right now -- and that would be Q2 2009. And perhaps you can say given the financial crisis and what have you that rolls over quarters, and obviously that now situation is going to be an important input in the Board making that recommendation.</p>
          <p>And then of course, the Board also values in and weighs in, what do we have in front of us? What do we know in terms of cash needs and acquisitions? And I answered earlier in the day here that I don't see big acquisitions on the horizon right now. Obviously that's something that in the final end when the &#x2013; when the decision is made in Q2, 2009, we are going to have to value it. But those three things, how was the year, how is the situation now and what do we have in front of us, is going to be on the Board's mind. And in the meanwhile, we will do anything we can to make sure that we get good cash flow.</p>
          <p>On raw material, we had quite an impact in Q3, really a billion year-on-year. And then that's of course that's if look at comparising [sic] the two quarters cost only and in reality of course much of that has been offset in price increases and then we had other things like under absorption coming in to hit the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>We think we have at least a quarter or two ahead of us with high levels on raw material, but as you have all seen, the raw material costs are coming down. We have been &#x2013; gone short in the market. And then of course, you have the flow through in the production system in itself. So give a couple of quarters and I think you will see raw material actually coming down and through the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>Then on the freeze in capital lending, I think it is very different in different countries and for different customers. So, it's difficult to give you an overall flavor that would symbolize the whole of what we see. We have customers, especially those that have been with banks that have gone bankrupt or whatever, that are in an acute financing situation. They had to switch banks and find other ways of financing their business. And we have customers that are quite pleased with their situation and have no trouble at all in getting liquidity. So very different in different countries, very different even between customers and sometimes different between segments of customers. For example, we have noted that if you take the housing market in Europe and especially in Southern Europe, that's come down more dramatically than it has in Northern Europe. So I can't give you an overall flavor there. We're going to see how that works out over the next couple of quarters.</p>

          <p>Could you give us a little bit of flavor on the Western European truck market perhaps?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Obviously, you've seen the order intake of &#x2013; on Greater Europe there of 20,000 orders. Gross orders then offset by cancellations, but those are &#x2013; I think the 20,000 number is a better number to look at, which means that the market isn't dead, it means that it's lower than last year, but it's great difficulty to make any forecast there as we said. We won't make a forecast for 2009. The forecast for 2008 has come down, which of course with three quarters already gone, that's a sign that the market is heading south.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon, gentlemen. Two questions please. I think they are maybe for Sal. Could you please talk about your truck residual value exposure in North America and Europe? Maybe just the trends you're seeing in the market; have the residual values in North America stabilized after the downturn and now they are deteriorating in Europe?</p>
          <p>And the second question could be in &#x2013; relating to your European exposure, could you give us a sense of how many trucks do you plan to buyback in the next three years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I could talk a little bit about the used truck prices from a Volvo Financial Services perspective. But I would just like to say and remind everyone that from a residual value or buyback perspective, it's the BA that takes that exposure and set those residuals and is responsible to remarket them. And I may ask Mikael for an overall view on that from the different BAs' point of view.</p>
          <p>What we've seen so far is that obviously the severity of the losses especially in North America have increased during the downturn, and I'd like to remind everybody that from a financial services point of view, there has been a downturn in America since September of 2007. That's at least when we started to see it getting into a downturn. So the severity has which is our loss per truck or piece of construction equipment, has generally increased. Overall, for the used truck prices, we're seeing some decreases. In Europe, what we've been seeing is the FS is about 10 to 12%, in North America from last year about 19 to 20%. So it's obviously having an effect on the severity of the losses that we're taking. I don't know Mikael if you had any overall comment on the residual situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sure. As I mentioned earlier on, I mean we evaluate the contracts on a contract-by-contract basis. It depends on when they are done and so forth in time. And if you put the U.S. first here, we have made a provision here during Q3 of about SEK100 million and that is taking into consideration a 25% reduction in residual values in that region. If we then go to Europe, we still have headroom left and also both on the truck side and also on the construction equipment. So there we have a much better position than in the U.S., and in the U.S. we have had some downward pressure for quite some while right now.</p>

          <p>All right. Thank you, Mikael. That concludes the telephone conference call quarter three at Volvo. Thanks all for being with us and any contacts or further questions you may have, direct them to Investor Relations, otherwise we will see you next quarter here. Thanks greatly.</p>
