          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Audi's audio webcast on the first half year of 2011. My name is Martin Primus, and I'm Head of the Financial Communication and Analysis Department of Audi AG. Today, I'm joined by Axel Strotbek, Member of the Board of Management of Audi AG responsible for Finance and Organization.</p>
          <p>To begin with, Mr. Strotbek will present the company's vehicle delivery figures for the first six months of 2011. After this, Mr. Strotbek will give you an overview of the company's financial results from January to June 2011.</p>
          <p>Before I hand over to Axel Strotbek, I would like to mention that you have the opportunity to send your questions for our Q&amp;A session already during the presentation. Therefore, please use the textbox on the website.</p>
          <p>I would now like to pass over to Mr. Strotbek. Mr. Strotbek, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Primus. Ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to wish you a warm welcome to our audio webcast to discuss our first half figures. Today, we're looking back on the most successful first half year in the history of our company. Over the next few minutes, I would like to explain the key figures to you in greater detail. And I will start with the development of the market as a whole and the Audi vehicle's deliveries.</p>
          <p>Growth and worldwide demand for cars continued in the first half of 2011. From January through June, international car sales rose by 6.1% to a total of almost 31 million vehicles. However, while the rate of growth was still high at the start of the year, the growth momentum progressively slowed from March onwards.</p>
          <p>The factors here included the terrible natural disaster in Japan in March, but the scaling back of state incentives for buyers and the important growth market, China, also played a role. And consumers were further unsettled due to the unsolved debt crisis in various major industrial nations. Despite the increasingly difficult economic environment, we increased Audi deliveries worldwide in the first half, to the new record total of around 653,000 cars. That represents growth in vehicle deliveries of 17.7%, compared with the first half of the record-breaking year 2010.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, in each individual month, we also outstripped the performance of the market as a whole in achieving high double-digit growth rates. That is despite having to handle the model changeover for our important Audi A6 core car line since April. And will only start gradually introducing our new A6 Avant model on various markets from the fall.</p>
          <p>Let us now take a look at the sales region. In the first half, we achieved growth rates well into double figures for sales of our vehicles in every sales region without exception. The highest growth in absolute terms was in Western Europe where we succeeded in delivering around 41,000 vehicles more to customers than during the same period of the previous year. That is equivalent to a growth rate of 12.9% in the market that contracted overall.</p>
          <p>The brand with the four rings also continued to experience very high demand in the Asia-Pacific region. With deliveries climbing by 26.5%, we delivered around 36,000 more vehicles there than in the previous year. Over the same period, the market as a whole grew by just 2.6%.</p>
          <p>Audi deliveries also easily outperformed the overall market in North America, rising by more than 10,000 vehicles or 17.2% compared with the first half of 2010.</p>
          <p>Eastern Europe was the region delivering the highest overall market growth. Incentives by the Russian state to bolster sales of domestically-built vehicles fueled sales growth of more than 35%. Although, the Audi brand did not benefit from these incentives, deliveries were increased by more than 25% compared with the previous year.</p>
          <p>I would now like to look more closely at the core markets in the above mentioned sales regions. Let us start with Western Europe. We achieved the steepest volume growth here in our home market Germany. With almost 126,000 vehicles delivered around 17,000 more than customers chose to buy a vehicle with the four rings than previous year.</p>
          <p>The main driver of growth here was the all new A1. The new A7 Sportback and the new model generations of the A6 Sedan and the A8 also developed extremely successfully. This enabled us to specifically strengthen our position in the full-size class of the C and D segments as a result. But there was also strong demand for Audi models in the major European export markets. For instance, we increased vehicle deliveries in the UK by almost 12% to 63,400 cars, and in Italy by almost 7% to almost 34,000 cars.</p>
          <p>Growth in France was even more impressive, with vehicle deliveries reaching around 33,000 cars, we're better than the prior year figure by more than a quarter. The development in overall market demand in Spain was slowed down by the generally difficult economic environment as well as by the reduction in state subsidies. Although the car market declined by 25% as a result, Audi succeeded in increasing deliveries by almost 3,000 to around 24,000 vehicles.</p>
          <p>In Russia, the most important car market in Eastern Europe, we increased deliveries by around one quarter. In the first six months of the current fiscal year, we delivered some 11,800 vehicles to customers in the Russian market.</p>
          <p>And North America's biggest car market, the United States, we continued our success story. Having delivered over 100,000 vehicles to U.S. customers for the first time in 2010, our sales figures from January to June reached the new record of around 55,900 vehicles, a rise of more than 15%.</p>
          <p>With around 10,000 vehicles sold in June alone, we in fact delivered over 10,000 Audi models to customers for the third month in a row. The new A8 in particular was in high demand in the United States. But our SUV models, the Audi Q5 and Audi Q7 also provided a huge boost to demand with growth of 14% and 41%, respectively, in the first six months. This brought about a further improvement in our model and equipment mix in the U.S. market.</p>
          <p>In addition, our strong image and price position and the continuing low level of incentive payments are further improving the quality of our profits in the United States. The Canadian markets, too, progressed very well, around 8,800 vehicles with the four rings or almost 19% more were sold in Canada.</p>
          <p>In the Asia-Pacific region, we consolidated our market lead in the Chinese premium segment. In what is now the biggest sales market for Audi vehicles, we increased deliveries in the first half by 28% to around 140,700 cars. That was despite local production being restricted at the start of the year as a result of the expansion of our local assembly capacity to 300,000 units per year. In the month of June alone, about 27,700 Chinese customers choose an Audi, more than in any previous single month.</p>
          <p>The brand with the four rings is also among the leaders for model variants, such as sports cars, coupes and SUVs, which are above all bought by private customers of an ever-growing middle class in China. This evidenced by the increase, the number of imported vehicles sold in the first half by 76% to more than 25,700 cars. For the full year, we are planning to deliver 280,000 cars to Chinese customers, which will include around 50,000 imported vehicles. This means that we will also continue our high-growth momentum, particularly, for these models as well.</p>
          <p>The consequence of the natural disaster in March of this year left its mark on the Japanese market. Despite this, however, Audi sold almost 10,000 cars in the entire first half, an increase of more than 12% on the prior year period. The Indian car market is becoming increasingly important for Audi. Deliveries to customers there doubled in the first half of the year, to around 2,800 vehicles. That means India is already ahead of important growth markets of South America, Brazil and Argentina, where we increased our deliveries by 47% and 29%, respectively.</p>
          <p>As we aim for high-quality growth, this impressive rise in our deliveries is also reflected in the development of the Audi Group's key financial figures.</p>
          <p>Let me first of all give you an overview of the main items on the income statement. We increased revenue of the Audi Group in the first half of 2011 by a clearly disproportioned rate of 22.5% compared with deliveries to &#x20AC;21.5 billion. Alongside increased vehicle sales worldwide, the main factor driving this increase of almost &#x20AC;4 billion was the extra revenue generated by the all-new A1.</p>
          <p>Higher demand for the A7 Sportback and A8 models provided a further boost to the C and D segment. And in addition, the higher revenue SUV models Q5 and Q7 performed extremely well. Both our new car and used car business is moreover benefiting from a further improvement in the equipment mix and a strong price position, which was achieved thanks to our increasingly high image and prestige ratings.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the impact from the new generation A6 will only probably take effect in the second half of the year along with its increasing availability worldwide and the launch of the A6 Avant. As of the end of June, the cost of sales was up by 19% at &#x20AC;17.7 billion. This below average increase compared with revenue can be attributed in particular to the positive cost effect from the growing modularization of our product portfolio.</p>
          <p>This means we substantially improved the gross profit to &#x20AC;3.8 billion. The gross margin rose correspondingly to 17.8% compared with 15.3% in the previous year. Despite strong growth and deliveries, distribution costs increased by only 3% to a total of &#x20AC;1.6 billion as of the end of June. The steady pattern compared with the previous year is mainly driven by the market support measures. The administrative expenses for the first six months reached &#x20AC;189 million, particularly as a consequence of the enlarged group of consolidated companies.</p>
          <p>Over the same period, the other operating result amounted to &#x20AC;523 million. We consequently improved the operating profit by &#x20AC;1.2 billion or almost 91% to the new record total of &#x20AC;2.5 billion. The financial result fell by &#x20AC;272 million overall in the first half. The decrease is largely attributable to higher expenses from the measurement of derivative hedging instruments at the reporting date. Meanwhile, the investment result developed very positively.</p>
          <p>Overall, we therefore increased the profit before tax of the first half by two-third to &#x20AC;2.4 billion. We have new moved up a gear in terms of profitability, too. With an operating margin of 11.8% and return on sales before tax of 10.9%, we continue to make steady progress along our path of profitable growth in the first half of 2011.</p>
          <p>And the rolling average for our operating margin over the past five years is now 8.4% despite the huge economic challenges and the financial crisis we have faced over that period. We have now moved into our corridor of sustainably between 8% and 10%. This welcome development lends further weight to the Audi Group's profitability and high competitiveness.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to look at the main items in our cash flow statement. In the first half of the year, we've increased cash flow from operating activities by 12% to more than &#x20AC;2.9 billion. At the same time, we continue to invest substantially in the future growth of our company. For example, the cash used in investing activities for current operations rose by almost 30% to &#x20AC;975 million.</p>
          <p>We also stepped up our activities for the development of future products and technologies. In keeping with the pattern of recent years, we again financed all investment from operating business and still generated the surplus. Net cash flow is almost &#x20AC;2 billion, actually improved on the previous year's high figure.</p>
          <p>The Audi Group's financial strength is also reflected in the performance of net liquidity. It has improved by &#x20AC;944 million since the end of last year to a current &#x20AC;14.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the key ratios for the first half of 2011 underline the healthy structure and sustained qualitative growth of the Audi Group. For us, qualitative growth means not simply increasing revenue by a faster rate than deliveries. Rather, we simultaneously want to improve our profit quality. This corporate philosophy, again, brought us success in the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>We once more improved our operating profit disproportionate to revenues. Our extensive investment into new products and technologies is a foundation to continue to delight our customers in the future and will strengthen our company's overall competitiveness.</p>
          <p>We will continue our policy of systematically managing our investment and continually optimizing our cost structures and processes because we are aware that we can only achieve our ambitious goals if you adapt a highly disciplined attitude toward cost.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, there remain some major risks for the automotive industry from a more general economic situation. And these risks include in particular, firstly, the immense sudden death of major industrial nations. Secondly, the expectation of a volatile, heterogeneous development in national economies and deferrals in car markets. Thirdly, the high volatility in the currencies that are relevant for us. And last but not least, price development for important raw materials that are being driven by speculation in particular.</p>
          <p>All in all, we nevertheless feel that we are generally well-equipped to deliver more than 1.2 million cars of the Audi brand in 2011 and thus set a new record. We are targeting a substantial increase in deliveries in all sales regions. We expect to see continuing growth above all in important sales markets such as China and the United States, thanks to outstanding prestige and image ratings.</p>
          <p>Our young and attractive product range will also help us to grow in the established markets of Europe. We expect the new A6 Sedan and the models that will be available from the fall, the A6 Avant and the all new Q3 to provide an extra boost in the second half.</p>
          <p>Knowing this dynamic growth in volume, we have set ourselves the goal of further improving the key financial figures, too. Working on the assumption that there is no significant deterioration of the general economic environment, we intend to set new records for revenue and profit and significantly improve on the previous year's figures.</p>
          <p>After the very successful first half, we expect the operating margin for the second half to remain in double figures and exceed our long-term target corridor of 8% to 10%. The 2011 fiscal year will therefore represent yet another important milestone along our road to becoming the world's leading premium brand.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention and I'm now looking forward to your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Strotbek. For the presentation of the development of the key figures of the first half of 2011. We will now continue with the Q&amp;A session. Please feel free to post further questions by using the textbox on our webpage.</p>
          <p>The first question we received is from Adam Hull from WestLB. He states that the revenues rose by 25.5% in the first half year that are 7 percentage points more than unit deliveries to customers. He thinks that there should be a positive mix from the new A6 and from the full impact of the A7. And his question is whether there are any reasons that half two should be much different in the development of revenues compared to unit sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Adam Hull, let me try to explain that we &#x2013; also in the second half see a positive development as you mentioned there will be positive mix on the A6 Avant, and unless there is no major deterioration from overall economic developments, I don't foresee a major change in that in the near future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Strotbek. There is another question from Adam Hull from WestLB. He would like to know when we will start with a locally produced new A6 in China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will see production start by the very end of the year and market introduction being followed in 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Strotbek. Another question which reached us by Adam Hull, he states that the exports to China were up 76%, roughly what the units exports were by key models.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All the improvement and the growth presence of China were mainly dominated by the new A8, A5 Coup&#xE9; and then we have seen a doubling against the general to June 2010 figures. But in general, what I mentioned in my short speech we have seen that in the SUV and the Coup&#xE9; segment as well in the sports car segments, so that's why we are taking over the lead in the premium segment and that also reflects the overall positioning of the Audi brand which is showing the success of the development of the brand in China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Strotbek. Now we have a question from Andreas Cremer from Reuters. He would like to know whether we can repeat the operating margin of 12.9% that we reached in Q2, also in the coming quarters Q3 and Q4, or whether we will have to expect a decrease in that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Things are good and well, as I've just explained in my speech, we foresee double-digit marginals in the second half. We have seen a strong development of our brand over the last four quarters now in a row. And unless there are no major changes in the overall economic environment such as the points I mentioned earlier in the volatility of exchange rates or in higher prices due to speculations on raw materials, et cetera, we don't foresee any major &#x2013; this effect will come true.</p>
          <p>More importantly for me is, however, that this is a pattern we see in the long term. We are now, over the last five years, at an average rate of 8.4, having had four quarters now in a row, with more than 10%, fits to our long-term strategy and shows that we stick to our long-term target of 8% to 10%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Strotbek. Now, we have another question from Adam Hull. He states that in the cash flow statement that there is a &#x20AC;251 million net add back from provisions. And he asked whether we can give a little more detail on this, and if it relates partly to the non-cash charges from hedging or if it is also from new provisions in the gross profit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Adam, those additional provisions or the increase in provisions is mainly related to our operating business and has no direct impact on hedging effects and those we have seen in our financial results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And another question from Adam. He said that our Asia-Pacific revenues rose by 56% in the first half year of 2011. And he would like to know whether the Chinese rise was greater than this or less.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, due to the increase of the imported cars, the overall rise of our revenues into China was greater than into the rest of Asia-Pacific region, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then we have a question from Andreas Cremer from Reuters again. He would like to know whether we will be able to have double-digit growth rates in the second half year in China or if we expect only single-digit growth rates or even losses compared to the previous year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In general, our outlook for the second half is still very positive, however, it's less strong than in the second half of 2010. Nevertheless, it will be another successful year for Audi and we expect in total deliveries to customers of more than 280,000 cars and thereof about 50,000 imported cars. Our long-term horizon is also very positive and we see further growth potential and specifically in the premium segment. And for us, the next target we would like to achieve is to make the next millionth car sold in China within a period of three years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Strotbek. And we have a question from Chris Avery at Wellington. He would like to know how the dealer network expansion in China is going on and if this is the biggest constraint for the Audi brand there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We see a growth rate this year of almost 50 new dealerships in China. Today, we have a dealership network of roughly 175 dealers and within the next two years, we plan to more than double this dealer network and this is necessary, of course, with the expansion of our portfolio and the demands of the Chinese market and reflect also the development of growth, not only in the top cities but also in other cities in China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Then we have a question from John Lawson at Citi Investment Research. He would like to know some more details about the recent capacity utilization and our ability to increase production in the second half of this year and a capacity build out &#x2013; potential capacity build out in 2012 and '13.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you know, we just introduced the all-new Q3 and had the first test drives in June and July <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:20). And we add here a new capacity of roughly 100,000 cars at our facility in Spain. And at the same time in the first half of this year, we increased our capacity in our factory in Changchun in Northern China to an annual capacity of 300,000 units.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, last September we announced that we will have an enlargement of our capacity in Hungaria at our gear factory, an achievable set up a capacity of 125,000 units. So those will be the next steps into 2012 and '13 to cope with the growing demand of Audi products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Then we have a question from Sebastian Raabe at DPA. He would like to know when we think that we will outrun BMW.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, yes, it's our goal to become the number one premium brand, but I, of course, cannot comment on plans of our competitors and the development, the future development. We have a clear strategy and a clear goal, and at the core of this we want to delight our customers worldwide. And for this, we of course have a clear plan, a growth plan in terms of volume, but underlying of course a healthy financial structure that comes along with that growth pattern. And what I can say today is that we plan about 1.5 million vehicles being sold one year earlier as planned in the past, so we believe that we can achieve 1.5 million vehicles already in 2014.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, we have a question from Jose Asumendi from RBS. He would like to have an explanation on our currency hedging strategy as well on the negative earnings impact that we expect from currency in the fiscal year 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have not changed our overall hedging strategy and as in the past, so we are also in the future, at a hedging rate of about two-third of our main currencies like the U.S. dollar, British pound and the Japanese yen. So, two-thirds in the short and medium-term horizon is settled by hedging instruments. And those are helping us to navigate as volatility in the currency market is moving up and down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Strotbek. Then we have a question from <mark type="ph" /> Roland Roush (30:06) at DAPD. He has a question on the delivery development in the U.S. And in detail he would like to know whether we will pass Lexus in 2011 or if we did already sprint by already?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have to see that Lexus certainly had a different situation this year due to the natural disaster in Japan. From our point, with Audi we saw an increase of volume of more than 15% in the U.S, market in the first half. And we will stick to double-digit growth for the full year. And, of course, I cannot make any comments on future of Lexus figures. But once again, we are looking forward to double-digit growth for the full year in the U.S. market.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Strotbek. Then we have a question from Lother Lubinetzki from MainFirst Bank. He asked whether we can give a bit more details regarding research and developments. In detail, capitalized R&amp;D totaled at &#x20AC;251 million and he would like to know what Audi's cash R&amp;D was in the first half year of 2011. And he would like to know what the P&amp;L number was and how much amortization Audi booked in the first half year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, our R&amp;D expenses in the first half were about &#x20AC;1.5 billion. We had a depreciation of roughly &#x20AC;220 million, so that profit &amp; loss statement showed roughly &#x20AC;1.470 billion in the first half.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Strotbek. Then we have another question from Adam Hull. He thinks that our unit sales guidance for the fiscal year 2011 looks conservative. And he wants to know whether there is anything that we should or that you should be worrying about apart from the slightly higher comparables in the second half last year, the A6 rollout in China and the general economic uncertainty.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Adam, with deliveries of more than 650,000 units in the first half, we had a very, very strong development, as I mentioned, in Europe, in the U.S., in Russia, but of course also in Asia. We see the strong demand now for our SUV, but also and of course for the new A6. So, we are very confident for the second half. We're &#x2013; for the full year, steady deliveries of more 1.2 million. And we will track that number and in fall we will come out with a new forecast and then we will how July and August look like. I'm very confident on July. But with figures of July, August and September in our pockets, we will give you a more detailed forecast.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Strotbek. Then we have another question from Adam Hull from WestLB. He would like to know when the A7 arrives in China, and if there is any particular restriction on the A7 production and if you could feasibly produce over 30,000 A7 vehicles a year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's no general restriction from a production perspective. We follow the demand and we're very happy with the introduction of the A7 Sportback and we will bring that into the Chinese market in the fourth quarter. It's been out into the U.S. market with great success, so we're looking forward to the respond of our Chinese customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks again, Mr. Strotbek. And we have another question from Adam Hull from WestLB. He states that we increased our capacity in China in the first half year and he would like to know what the new capacity of the Q5 models is there now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't want to dig into the specific capacity numbers of each and every single model. In overall, we increased capacity and flexibility, so we are now able to produce 300,000 cars in Changchun. And in the first half we had a production of roughly 26,000 Q5s in China and this comes along with the demand in the Chinese market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then we have a question from Andreas Cremer again from Reuters. He would like to know when we will make a decision about our own plant in North America and the pros and cons for participating in the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's -- to be honest there's nothing new to say today. We have a clear &#x2013; we see a clear growth strategy in the U.S., and in Canada and North American region. And we definitely will give an answer to the production side and decision in the near future. It will be definitely far ahead of 2015. But internally we are still working out where and what kind of models. So, it would be &#x2013; it's simply too easy to dig in to more details.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Strotbek. Then we have a couple of questions from Michael Punzet from DZ Bank. There was one question which was has already been asked and already answered regarding the expectations on our operating margin on half two. So, I will jump to the next question. He would like to know whether we could give an update on the burden that we could have from rising raw material prices. And if you could provide us a <mark type="ph" /> state of when (36:36) the first half year and the second half year of 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course we saw some effects on aluminum and copper, et cetera. But even for those raw materials we are using hedging, financial hedging tools. We do that within the Volkswagen group, as we do that also with our currency hedging tools. And of course it's one of our risks I mentioned earlier. For the near and medium term there are very good settlements. But in the long-term of course, I cannot make further conclusions. So this of course, we see it in most cases driven not only by real tradings, it's rather driven by speculation. So, we will continue our hedging strategy for the short and medium-term horizon. And once again, there are some risks in the future coming up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Strotbek. There's another question from Michael Punzet. He would like to know about <mark type="ph" /> the positive (37:55) effect on the development of the results of Audi in the next quarters from using the MLB, the modular longitudinal toolbox and whether we could quantify the effect on the results in the first half year of 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, of course, we have a high number of impact, not only on the variable cost side, on material costs we have a lot of development cost, investments, pendings that we'll be gaining out of our modularization strategy. We talked about the A4 family, A5, A6, and we continue this modularization on the A7, A8, and further on also, on the Q5 and Q7 family. So we're having major impact today in synergies. And in the questions on the investment side and in the next step we will of course learn out of this, the first generation and move on into the next generation of the modular longitudinal platform.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Then we have a question from Lother Lubinetzki at MainFirst Bank. He would like to know how many cars we produced in China in the first half year 2011. And if you would mind giving a breakdown by model.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Production was about 110,000 cars in total. The driving force was the A6 long wheel base with more than 50,000 cars, and the A4 with around 36,000 cars. And last but not the least the Q5 with more than 20,000 cars.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then we have a question from Jose Asumendi from RBS. He would like to know whether there is any reason why you should expect the revenue per unit to decline in the second versus the first half year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is no reason for a deterioration mix. The only reason could be that there is a deterioration in our exchange rate positions. That the U.S. dollar for example or the British pound. But from a portfolio mix and point of view, we would rather see an increase of the C and D segment with the A6, A7 and the A8 family.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we do only have a few more remaining questions that we are going to answer. Afterwards we are going to end the conference call, the webcast. The next question I have is from <mark type="ph" /> Jimmy Dong (41:02) in Beijing. He would like to know whether the Audi AG intends to increase the stake in FAW-Volkswagen to 19%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have explained this successful partnership with FAW on an extremely successful joint venture with FAW-Volkswagen where we produce our Audi products. And I don't want to comment on any speculations or changes in the shares we have in that organization. We will focus on our common growth plans and the successful development of the Audi brand in China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we have another question from <mark type="ph" /> Jimmy Dong (42:01) from Beijing. He would like to know when the Audi Group could be independent and whether there are any plans for an increase in the issuance of shares?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To make it very clear, Audi is part of the Volkswagen Group. And we're responsive to our business plan and our product planning. And the development of our Audi family in the last year shows that we can act successfully only on the market while belonging to one of the biggest car groups in the world and this is the Volkswagen Group. And I think the first half figures of the whole group and the first half figures of Audi is a very true evidence to this successful strategy and there is no need for any changes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Strotbek. And I have two last final questions. The first one is from Lother Lubinetzki from MainFirst. He would have closer explanation of the main drivers in the other non-cash items in the cash flow statements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, those are mainly driven by the temporary devaluations we had on the last day of June due to the losses from evaluation of our hedgings and this is the main driver on the other non-cash items in the cash flow statement. But they have no impact and therefore no -- therefore, we have to eliminate in the cash flow statements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Strotbek. And there's the final question, <mark type="ph" /> Jimmy Dong (44:03) would like to know whether Audi is going to join in Formula One.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very short answer, no.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Strotbek. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now close today's audio webcast. We would like to thank you for joining us for today's presentation by Axel Strotbek and participating in our Q&amp;A session. Enjoy the weekend. Thank you and goodbye.</p>
