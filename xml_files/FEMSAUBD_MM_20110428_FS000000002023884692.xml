          <p>Good morning and welcome everyone to FEMSA's First Quarter 2011 Earnings Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.</p>
          <p>During this conference call, management may discuss certain forward-looking statements concerning FEMSA's future performance and should be considered as good faith estimates made by the company. These forward-looking statements reflect management's expectations and are based upon currently available data. Actual results are subject to future events and uncertainties which can materially impact the company's actual performance.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would now turn the conference over to Javier Astaburuaga, FEMSA's CFO. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to FEMSA's first quarter 2011 results earnings conference call. As always, Jose Castro from Coca-Cola FEMSA; Juan Fonseca from FEMSA IR are with us today.</p>
          <p>In terms of the operating results, we will focus on the FEMSA Comercio and on Coca-Cola FEMSA results, although many of you likely had the opportunity to participate in Coke FEMSA's conference yesterday.</p>
          <p>As was the case in the last three quarters, our results reflected different impacts of the Heineken transaction on our income statement and balance sheet. And we will, of course, be happy to address questions on the subject during this call and at any time later time through our investor relations teams.</p>
          <p>As we often do, let's begin by spending a brief moment on our perception of the environment and the drivers for consumption, particularly in our key Mexico market. GDP and manufacturing activity as measured by the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:40) of mid single-digit year-over-year, unemployment rates continued to improve and the Mexico consumer confidence index is at its maximum for the past two years. So we're optimistic that consumer demand is slowly up and catching with the macro data. Still not a robust consumer demand but as I said slowly catching up. Clearly, some industry data points for retail activity showed the effect on the timing of the Semana Santa holiday period, which made for some tough comparables for the month of March. However, our own numbers are encouraging and our overall view is one of optimism as we get into the key summer season.</p>
          <p>And now let's move on to discuss our consolidated quarterly numbers. On a comparable basis, that is without the beer operations, total revenues increased 12% and operating income grew 9.4%. For the first quarter, the line labeled participation in Heineken results represents FEMSA's 20% participation in Heineken's first quarter net income. There will be times when Heineken's quarterly information will not be made public ahead of FEMSA's results. And in those cases, as we said in the past we will need to use our information one quarter in arrears as a proxy as we have mentioned before. However, in those cases where Heineken does come out with the net income numbers in time for us to incorporate them into our results as was the case this first quarter, we will do so. And so we will always use the most recent quarterly information to incorporate Heineken's numbers into our net income figures.</p>
          <p>The next line, net income from FEMSA's former beer operations is also relevant and corresponds to the first three months of 2010 before the transaction close. On the balance sheet, as was the case since we closed the transaction, for March 2010, you see that the assets of the beer operations are no longer there. For comparison purposes, in the 2010 column, the figures of the beer operations were subtracted from each line and are being presented, grouped in four specific lines in accordance with accounting standards.</p>
          <p>On the asset side, we're showing lines for current and non-current assets of the beer operations and we're doing the same on the liability side. Those four lines go to zero for 2011. Conversely, the line investment in shares now reflects our position in Heineken.</p>
          <p>In terms of our cash build up, during the first quarter, we went from having a consolidated net cash position of Ps. 2,350 million at the end of December to having Ps. 3,000 million as of the end of March, reflecting cash generation at both of our operations.</p>
          <p>On the subject of potential uses of cash and the pursuit of strategic opportunities, while we continued to make progress, exploring and developing certain initiatives, there really isn't much news to report from our last conversation two months ago. As we have said before, this process has taken a while, but we are moving in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Moving on to this course of operations and beginning with FEMSA Comercio, we should highlight that the rollout of new store openings continues to move forward according to plan. We opened 195 net new stores during the first quarter, which means we opened a new record high of 1,129 stores in the last 12 months, slightly ahead of our objective for 2011. As has been the case in recent years, this is driven by our continued effort to smooth out the curve of new store openings across the four quarters and away from the backend loading of a few years ago.</p>
          <p>Revenues for the quarter increased 19.5%. Same-store sales were up by 9% for the quarter, reflecting improvements in traffic as well as average ticket. Traffic rose 5%, reflecting progress in our management of category and purchase allocation mix. Our average ticket increased 3.7%, a solid number but not much above last 12 month inflation. This number reflects favorable weather trends across Mexico as well as price increases by several of our suppliers for important category such as soft drinks, beer, plastics, cigarettes and others and mix.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, gross margin expanded 40 basis points driven mainly by a positive mix shift due to the growth of higher margin categories, a more effective collaboration and execution with our key supplier partners, combined with a more efficient use of promotion related marketing resources, and also by changing the structure of commercial terms for certain supplier partners. While the impact of these terms also used to be skewed towards the fourth quarter, it is now more evenly spread throughout the year.</p>
          <p>In terms of operating margins, this quarter FEMSA Comercio posted an expansion of 20 basis points, mainly due to an expansion in the gross margin which offset incremental expenses such as the strengthening of FEMSA Comercio's organizational structure, mainly IT related. Also as is always the case, rapid pace of store openings put some pressure on the selling expenses line as the new stores generate expenses from day one, while revenues take a while to get up to speed.</p>
          <p>And finally, Coca-Cola FEMSA revenues for the quarter increased 9.5% versus the comparable period of 2010, with Mexico showing very strong trends and Mercosur continuing with good momentum. Operating income increased 10.4%, margins expanded 20 basis point at the gross level and 10 basis points at the operating level on the back of good operating leverage in Latincentro achieved in spite of the strike that curtailed our production early in the quarter in Venezuela. If you are unable to participate in Coke FEMSA's conference call yesterday, you can access a replay of their webcast for additional details on the results. So summing it up, I believe we are off to a solid start in 2011 and we look forward to another interesting year.</p>
          <p>And with that I would like to open the call for your questions. Operator, please.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> your first question comes from the line of Lauren Torres from HSBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My question relates to the Comercio business and I guess there has been some recent activity with respect to regulation or efforts in Mexico City to protect public markets or the more informal markets. Just curious, how does or will it affect you as we have these OXXO stores continue to open, if you feel that you're becoming more limited as a result of this regulation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure good morning Lauren. Well, I guess most of you know what the regulation states and as you know OXXO is part of the ANTAD and the National Modern Trade Association here in Mexico. And we're basically at this point of time addressing the Norma 29 as it was issued as part of the ANTAD process. If you may have any specific questions about it, please contact Juan or Max for more details about this. But what I can tell you is that we're basically coordinated with all retailers within the ANTAD and we feel positive about that this Norma is not going to affect our business in Mexico City.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, meaning your planned openings for this year, from what you understand right now you could basically still hit that target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And also, can you just elaborate too on your build out outside of Mexico? I know, we've heard some things about Colombia, any update there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Colombia is still in the phase in which we said we will enter the country and establish a beachhead and grow slowly the number of stores and take time in fine tuning the value proposition of the store to Colombians. We're basically still in that phase and we have plans to open maybe a dozen stores during this year, still again refining the value proposition and understanding consumer behavior in different places within the still the same city. And, I would say that that's basically where we are and our game plan for 2011 is continue developing the value proposition, to expand moderately the store base and to continue learning about how to better serve Colombians with the Colombian OXXO as well call it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just finish up by asking if you open more stores this quarter versus last outside of Mexico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't get that, again Lauren?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Did you open more stores in the first quarter outside of Mexico versus what you discussed in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. no. We didn't.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, additional. Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lauren.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Alan Alanis from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Javier. Hi, Juan. My question has to do &#x2013; trying to understand the same-store sales growth in OXXO seems substantially higher than ANTAD and then other supermarkets there. You mentioned in your prepared remarks, that it's largely driven by traffic. Could you elaborate a little bit more on what's driving, what drove this traffic growth during the quarter, Javier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Hi, Alan, how are you. I would say that as you know the categories that OXXO serves and the occasions of consumption that OXXO serves are quite different from other retail formats in Mexico and particularly the ones you describe, such as hypers and supers. So I would say that most of the traffic it's coming from a number of things. I would say that in the quarter, weather was a significant one, and again talking about categories and consumption occasions that OXXO serves within that weather was a significant boost for the quarter in terms of traffic. But also as we have said in the past, the better we are at bringing into store solutions for consumers that they care of their needs, problems, and desires, the more traffic we are going to be able to keep bringing to our stores.</p>
          <p>And in that regard, in different regions and through different mechanisms I think we have been successful in building better promotions for consumers to be interested in coming to a store. Another one would be that we have been also able to structure some arrangements, we for example public transportation services in certain cities, important cities throughout Mexico, in which now consumers are more inclined to go and acquire electronic cards to pay the public transportation service as opposed to paying every time they get up into a bus. And we think that we have to get leads also from that. And I would say that the number of things for what we're doing inside the store, how we're communicating with the consumers and of course with the nice help from the weather in this quarter, I would say that those are the main drivers behind the growth of 5% on the traffic we are presenting today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just to put Javier's comments on weather in perspective, Alan. If we look at average temperatures in the country, generally February and March were almost 16% above normal. That's meaningful in terms of the generation of thirst. And in terms of rain, if we look at an example, for example for Nuevo Le&#xF3;n, it rained almost 40% less during the quarter than normal. So it's certainly not trivial, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I completely agree with you. I mean to add to what you're saying, the first quarter in Mexico City was the warmest first quarter in ten years. So, yeah all the data supports that. If I may ask a second, last question also regarding OXXO but specifically regarding working capital. We see a big improvement here in using the numbers that you report in the quarter in working capital. And apparently everything is coming from days payable, Javier and Juan. And the question is, is this new level of days payable &#x2013; according to our numbers, it goes up from more than 150 days to this quarter to more than 190 days in terms of days payable. Should we &#x2013; is this a level that it's sustainable and should you expect this kind of working capital benefit, which I know that OXXO's already good, but this benefit to come through for the full year as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Alan. A good point to be raised. And I would say that the behavior of working capital during the first quarter and even not heavily noticed by a lot of people, even at the end of December, I would say are more things related with the special negotiations on how to manage inventories as well as days of credit, which are not there to be there for the future. So, I would be very clear about this, but we have a I would say not an anomaly. And in that sense, it was a good one for us, but it's more like a one-time event. The large majority of the variance in working capital is more a one-time event than something that you should assume is going to stay there for forever.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, no major changes in the working capital in terms of -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no. I would say that you might find that from time-to-time, we will go into situations as one I'm describing. But that doesn't really represent a fundamental structural change in the terms on which we operate with major suppliers in terms of days of credit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Okay. Well, thank you so much. Have a great day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, same to you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your next question comes from the line of Celso S&#xE1;nchez from Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. My question has to do with, as you think about the strategic alternatives and you go through this process and that you said is thorough and then fairly gradual. How do you view where cash rests between the parent company and the subsidiary? I guess, specifically I'm talking about cash that might be held at the FEMSA level versus cash that might be held specifically the Coke FEMSA level. There was a comment made yesterday, that if there are no obvious M&amp;A opportunities, Hector said this I think. I think he alluded to the fact that that the top managements are on the same page with respect to potentially paying out that cash and increase dividends next year with the board's approval. So given your oversight of the company, how do you view that, is there an advantage or disadvantage to having cash at one level over the other? From a tax perspective is there are fundamental view as to where you prefer to have that cash in terms of flexibility strategically? How should we think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Celso. Thank you and good morning. As you know Coke FEMSA being a public company, we are very careful about being sure that the company has enough degree of flexibility to take care of opportunities that may be available in the Coke space, as well as while having such an unlevered financial structure, not in core, in incremental efficiencies both from the financial point of view as well as from tax point of view. So we are basically looking at those two variables as the main criteria for us to make decision on if it would be better to have cash sitting at the subsidiary level or at the holding level. And in that regard, that's basically how we do it. At this juncture, Coca-Cola FEMSA as you know just recently tapped the bond market, taking advantage of what we think is a very, very attractive environment for having the right level of liquidity we think is good enough for having at this stage. And at this point of time we are not I would say that for the remainder of 2011 at least thinking of doing anything additional but paying the dividends, both Coca-Cola FEMSA and FEMSA just decreed in their last shareholders meeting in April. So that's basically where we stand. We don't have a significant difference in terms of the tax consideration, if cash sitting down there or up here. And of course today Coca-Cola FEMSA still has some net debt position which is not significant, but at least that's the case. And we have as you know excess cash at the holding level sitting here today. So, that's basically how we do it, where we stand, Celso.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up on the working capital issue at OXXO. I understand there is some seasonal peaks, but is there maybe a number that you can share with us in terms of what's your &#x2013; when you look throughout entire year, what's your target? Let's say, a number for both, days of inventories and suppliers that you think you can reach I don't know probably a year from now or two years from now. I don't know if the commercial relationship with your suppliers do you think is now at the level it should be or there's even more improvement that we should be expecting for the next couple of quarters? And what's kind of taking out seasonality and normalized number that you would expect for both, days of inventory and suppliers? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Antonio. Hi, good morning. As opposed to trying to give you a clear guidance on the number of inventory days or supplier days, I would just reemphasize the fact that again because of special negotiations and handling of inventory levels and credit days in the first quarter, the numbers that we are reporting in the first quarter shouldn't be taken as a basis for projecting going forward on a stable basis. I would say that that going backwards in terms of looking at the simplicity of the business from quarter-to-quarter, which is very, very big as you well know. I would say that past inventory and credit days, with a degree of variability but a small one, I would say that's the best reference I can give you on how to project going forward. And by that I'm just reassessing that there is not a fundamental change in the way credit terms are established with the main suppliers on a permanent basis. So I would encourage you more to look at &#x2013; looking at the simplicity of the business and looking at the past performance through 2010, and then that would be the best basis to think through for the reminder of the year and even going into then 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course this is ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. And of course this is &#x2013; I mean, credit terms is just one component of the many, many variables that are part of a commercial relationship that we have with the partners. So what I'm saying is just trying to explain the indicator of the first quarter and with that I'm not saying that credit terms could not change in the future as margins <mark type="indiscernible" /> (24:14) marketing cooperative or not as the degree of promotional activity. So I'm just trying to say that just by looking at the first quarter, I don't want anybody to fall into the trap of then saying what we have this nice free liability sitting on the balance sheet and then I'm going to assume it's going to stay there for as long as the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would just add, Antonio, this is Juan, To Javier's point about the different variables that play in the relationship with suppliers. I mean generally speaking I think also have the position that all other things being equal, they will rather privilege margin over working capital just as a general position so just to complement and to give you an idea of how they thing. Obviously, we like to extend our days as much possible but you have to keep in mind that depending on the size or the characteristics of the supplier, in some cases you don't want to push them too much especially with the smaller ones. So we keep a balance and as I said, focus on margins first and foremost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Juan. So they change that we saw since last quarter in supplier has more to do with the seasonality that you are trying to establishing your commercial relationship with them. And if I understood correctly I shouldn't expect excluding seasonality any big changes or big improvements let's say in the base of suppliers that you will have going forward, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct, Antonio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>Hi, thanks for taking the follow up. On the OXXO strength in same-store sales which clearly was very impressive and as Alan said in context particularly relative to some of the other formal retailers. Do you have a sense for if that reflects perhaps some alteration in consumer behavior? I don't know if I heard you mention it or maybe mentioned in part quarters and I missed it, but in terms of not perhaps having a big enough amount of money to go load up at the supermarket or rather to I think kind of as they need them. It's a comment we heard reinforced today by PepsiCo on their call, presumably relating to the U.S. But I wonder if you're seeing that in Mexico as well as a sign of relative benefit with kind of a very slow consumer recovery?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. My pick here Celso is that the coming &#x2013; if I had to describe what we're doing internally with the business in terms of again the both assortment of the stores and the price points that we're trying to hit and incremental knowledge that we have been gaining on consumer habits and preference and how they prioritize their decisions when they are looking for different products and occasions. I think my belief is that I would say that the reputation in the consumers' mind that also has been building in terms of bearing a very balanced alternate in terms of price, affordability and availability and the guarantee that what they are going to. People don't say we're going to OXXO to try to find the novelty of the week. They go because they want something, and they know they're going to get it. And they basically know that at some points they are paying maybe an extra premium for the convenience, for proximity I would say and again being able to go in and go out quickly and basically solving their needs in a much more faster way and convenient way.</p>
          <p>I would say that &#x2013; I would tend to believe it's a little bit more of that as opposed to people having less affordability and having to go more times to the store or not going to the supermarket, because of the way the categories are developing within the OXXO store tells me what I'm trying to explain to you that's what's driving traffic into the stores. And I would tend to believe that's what's taking place. I think that the OXXO guys have been making a lot of progress in precisely understanding again what consumers want, what they are willing to pay, how they make decisions as opposed to; how they behave in different circumstances. So I think all of that is being could serve in a much better way for consumers and I think in the end that's what's driving consumers into the stores more frequently than in the past.</p>

          <p>I would add Celso. I mean, we mentioned in &#x2013; Javier mentioned in his remarks, another reason that probably comes into play when you split same-store sales into traffic and ticket. Normally traffic is a main driven of same-store sales for OXXO and what we've seen maybe it's three of the last four or now it's probably four out of the last five quarters, is an improvement in the average ticket. And in this case the beginning of the year you also have that some of our large suppliers or large categories for their own reasons implemented price increases and you saw that was the case with Coke FEMSA. And of course that plays a role in our own average ticket and in our own number. Maybe we're more exposed to this staple foods and beverage than other retailers. Not maybe, I'm sure that's the case.</p>
