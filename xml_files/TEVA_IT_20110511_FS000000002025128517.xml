          <p>Greetings, and welcome to the Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited First Quarter 2011 Results Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Elana Holzman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Diego. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Teva's First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. We hope you've had a chance to review our press release, which we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the release is available on our website at www.tevapharm.com. Additionally, we are conducting a live webcast of this call that is also available on our website.</p>
          <p>Today, we are joined by Shlomo Yanai, President and CEO, Eyal Desheh, Chief Financial Officer, Bill Marth, President and CEO of Teva Americas, Dr. Gerard Ven Odijk, President and CEO of Teva Europe, and Professor Yitzhak Peterburg, Group Vice President, Global Branded Products.</p>
          <p>Shlomo and Eyal will begin by providing an overview of our results. Please note that Shlomo will be referring in his prepared comments to non-GAAP gross margin, operating profit, net income and EPS. Eyal will provide additional detail on the items excluded from our non-GAAP results. We will then open the call for question-and-answer period. Before we proceed with the call, I would like to remind everyone that the Safe Harbor language contained in today's press release also pertains to this conference call and webcast.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Elana. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review Teva's results for the first quarter of 2011. During the first quarter, we enjoyed double-digit growth across the major financial parameters. Net sales reached $4.1 billion, representing 12% growth over the first quarter of 2010. Quarterly operating profit was $1.1 billion with net income of $936 million. This brought us to EPS of $1.04. As you can see, these results are in line with the guidance we shared with you in February that 2011 would build gradually. We continue to expect that growth will accelerate in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>I would like to share with you the highlights of the first quarter, a quarter, which I believe provides a good demonstration of the power of our balanced business model, our global presence and the successful initiative we took to expand our presence in high growth markets. Contributions from our branded and European businesses, as well as from Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia, play exciting role in our long-term strategy. In the U.S., generic sales totaled $952 million. As you know, the comparative quarter, Q1, 2010, was a particularly strong quarter where we benefited from new launches and sales of key products, such as the generic equivalent of Mirapex, Eloxatin, Protonix, Adderall XR and Lotrel, which were absent or diminished in the first quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>As expected, we had no major launches in the U.S. during this first quarter. In addition, quality issues in Irvine and Jerusalem led to a loss of approximately $100 million of sales versus 2010. To be clear, we do not view the challenges we faced in the U.S. during the quarter as representing a trend. And in fact, we anticipate an improving trend for the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>As you know, last March we resumed production in Irvine and I'm very pleased to announce that on Monday we release our first lot of VINCASAR, which will be followed shortly by ZANOSAR. These steps, along with others we are working on with the FDA drug shortage, will ultimately improve availability of several products for the U.S. injectable market. This is the beginning of a process, which will take the remainder of the year to complete. Furthermore, we submitted a complete response to the FDA's warning letter related to our Oral Solid Dose facility in Jerusalem. After we completed the required corrective actions, we have requested that the FDA re-inspect this facility.</p>
          <p>Quality in Teva is Teva's number one priority. As CEO, it is my own top priority and it is Teva's responsibility and it's our privilege to provide patients around the world with access to high quality medications. As you know, growing our generics business in Europe, an high growth generics market, is a key element of our long-term strategy. And during the first quarter, our efforts in this region bore fruit. In fact, during the quarter, half of our generic sales came from this region.</p>
          <p>In Europe, the acquisition and successful integration of ratiopharm and our overall leadership position enabled us to grow our sales by 66%. We grow organically in every key European market outside of Germany, with especially high double-digit growth in Spain, the U.K. and Italy. Teva is the number one player in all of these markets and poised for continued growth. We also experienced very nice growth in France and Poland.</p>
          <p>In Germany, sales declined in low teens on the back of price reforms that occurred in the second half of 2010. Despite these anticipated reforms, Teva's performance was markedly stronger than the competition. In terms of value, we narrowed the gap between Teva and the nearest competitor by six market share points and we became the number one player in Germany by volume. In addition, according to the preliminary results of the most recent AOK tender, Teva won 20% of the tender value, representing significant improvement over last year. Given this result and our current momentum, we are optimistic about the second half of 2011 in Germany. I would like to point out that excluding Germany, Teva achieved organic growth of 7% in Europe and we believe that we are very well positioned for growth in our European business in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, we also made good progress in our Eastern European business. For example, in Russia, we enjoyed record sales of generics, which increased by 52% over the first quarter of 2010. Organic generic growth was 25%. We also had a very good quarter in Latin America, another high growth region where Teva has established a strong position. We achieved organic growth of 16% over the first quarter of 2010. In Mexico, we grew by 20% and in Argentina, by 29%.</p>
          <p>Now for the first time, I would like to discuss the progress we are making in Asia. In Japan, the world's second largest pharmaceutical market, we enjoyed 29% growth in local currency, or 43% in U.S. dollars. As you know, we regard Japan as a key growth driver and we will continue to invest in building this important business.</p>
          <p>To conclude my review of the highlights of our generics business, <mark type="ph" /> happy (08:35), Teva's API business grew third party sales by 32% over the first quarter of 2010. As you can see, Teva's global generics platform is enjoying growth in the high double-digit and we believe that, in line with our long-term strategic growth, we will continue to see strong growth in these markets.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our branded business, let's start with our Respiratory franchise, which grew by 19% globally. In the U.S., our Respiratory brands performed very well with ProAir and Qvar solidifying their number one and number two positions in their respective markets. ProAir crossed the 50% mark in PRX market share, an increase of two share point in the first quarter. Qvar reached 22% PRX market share during the quarter, up more than three share point over Q1 2010. In addition, we are on track to file our nasal BDP HFA, formerly known as QNAZE, with the FDA this quarter. Sales of our Respiratory products were especially strong in Europe, growing by 46% over the first quarter of 2010 and driven by strong sales of Qvar.</p>
          <p>Let's go now to Azilect, in-market sales of which grew by 16% over the first quarter of 2010. Total prescriptions of Azilect grew by more than 22% and Azilect now is the leading branded product to treat Parkinson's Disease in the U.S. market.</p>
          <p>Finally, Copaxone. Copaxone continues to be the global leader among MS therapies, as its efficacy and its proven safety and vulnerability profile continue to make it the first choice of physicians. Copaxone global market share increased to 31%. In-market sales of Copaxone grew 14% over the first quarter of 2010 to reach $907 million, outpacing the market growth of 9%. Copaxone's share of PRX in the U.S. was over 40%.</p>
          <p>The first quarter of 2011 has been an active one for Teva in terms of business development. Last month, we announced a joint venture with Procter &amp; Gamble that we expect will make us a leader in consumer health care. This unique alliance will enable Teva to participate in all three categories of pharmaceutical scale, branded, generic and OTC. And of course, our planned acquisition of Cephalon will transform our branded business and will enable us to fulfill the second pillar of our long-term strategy, to expand our generic business into a diverse specialty pharma business and become a leading player in this area.</p>
          <p>Before I turn the call over to Eyal, I would like to reiterate our guidance for 2011, which of course does not take into account Cephalon, or any other acquisitions. We continue to forecast sales to be in the range of $18.5 billion to $19 billion and EPS in the range of $4.90 to $5.20. We had a solid start to the year, and I would like to remind everyone that we continue to expect the second half of 2011 to be significantly stronger than the first half. Thank you very much for your attention.</p>
          <p>And now, let's turn the call over to Eyal for a detailed financial review of the quarter. Eyal?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Shlomo, and good day to everyone. I hope you've had the opportunity to review the press release, which we issued earlier this morning. We reported a solid first quarter for the year, results for the most part, both the positive and the negative, were in line with our expectations. Despite the many challenges of the quarter, including the lack of significant new generic launches in the U.S., we delivered double digit growth in sales, non-GAAP operating profits, net income and earning per share.</p>
          <p>We continue to generate strong cash flow with cash flow from operations of $900 million and free cash flow of $513 million. Before I delve into the numbers, I would like to touch on two technical topics. First, I would like to remind everyone that we are presenting GAAP and non-GAAP results. In our non-GAAP presentation, we have excluded the following items this quarter: amortization of purchased intangible assets amounting to $158 million, of which $151 million are included in GOGS, costs of goods sold, and the remaining $7 million in selling and marketing expenses. I'd like to remind you that we started recording amortization of ratiopharm intangibles this quarter.</p>
          <p>An inventory step-up of $10 million relating to the acquisition of Theramex and Infarmasa, costs related to regulatory action taken in facilities of $50 million related primarily to the remediation of quality issues in Irvine, restructuring acquisition expense of $22 million related primarily to the acquisition of ratiopharm, and permanent assets of $11 million, mostly intangible assets related to the acquisition of Barr. These expenses were offset by income of $4 million in connection from a provision for legal settlement and a related tax effect of $72 million.</p>
          <p>You should note that the items excluded in arriving at our non-GAAP results for the first quarter of 2010 are not identical to those in the current quarter. Please review our press release and related tables for a reconciliation of our GAAP numbers and more complete information. As indicated in the past, we present non-GAAP figures to show you how we, the management team and our board, look at our financial results.</p>
          <p>Second, foreign currency, which played a minor role in our profit and loss result this quarter was a greater influence on our balance sheet. In the first quarter, foreign currency differences had a small positive impact of approximately $27 million on sales and $7 million on operating income, as compared to Q1, 2010. Teva's diverse geographical presence continued to provide us with a good natural hedge that mitigates much of the risk involved in currency fluctuation and minimizes the impact on our bottom line.</p>
          <p>Foreign currencies also had a positive impact on our equity. The weakness of the U.S. dollar on March 31st, primarily relative to the euro, increased our equity by approximately $940 million compared to December 31st, 2010. Looking at our consolidated results from Q1, sales totaled $4.1 billion, an increase of 12% compared to Q1 last year. Sales in North America declined 11% due to weaker generic sales in the U.S. New generics had a particularly soft quarter primarily because several products that were major contributors to sales in the comparable quarter in 2010 had little or no sales this quarter. And this was one of those quarter in which we had no major launches to offset this.</p>
          <p>But as we said when we gave our guidance last quarter, we expect U.S. generics to grow about this level in each of the next three quarters. Europe grew 66% mainly through the consolidation of ratiopharm's results, but it's important to note that we saw a real organic growth in Europe on an organic basis, as well. In other words, calculated as if ratiopharm and Theramex as being part of Teva already in Q1, 2010, this is pro forma calculation.</p>
          <p>Total sales in Europe grew organically by 3% while sales, excluding Germany, grew 7%. Given the price reforms in Germany in the second half of 2010, our performance was markedly stronger than the competition. We reduced the market share gap with the number one player on a pro forma basis from almost 10% in Q1, 2010 to just over 4% in this quarter. And we believe that Germany will resume its contribution to European growth in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>Europe is a tough and dynamic market, which provides great opportunities as our market leadership and our competence in managing complexity give us a real competitive advantage in Europe.</p>
          <p>Sales in our emerging markets, Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, Latin America and Asia grew by 26% with significant growth in key markets, such as Russia with 25% organic growth for generic sales, Mexico, 20%, and Japan, 29% growth, all in local currency. As a result, our sales are now significantly more diversified geographically, with North America accounting for 51% of sales, Europe for 33% and Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia combined for 16% of sales.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP operating income reached $1.1 billion, up 11% compared to Q1, 2010 and benefited from strong gross margin, tight expense control and the take-back of Copaxone royalty of North America sale from Sanofi. Non-GAAP net income reached $936 million, up 13% compared to Q1, 2010. Non-GAAP fully diluted earning per share were $1.04, up 14% compared to Q1, 2010. The weighted average share count for the fully diluted non-GAAP earning per share was 902 million shares. As a result of the early redemption of the 1.75% convertible debenture, we had no add-back this quarter and this also reduced our share count by an additional 15 million shares.</p>
          <p>Now let's discuss profit margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross profit margin, which excludes amortization of purchased intangible assets, inventory step-up, and costs related to regulatory action taken in facilities was 58.8% in the reported quarter, compared to 58.4% in the quarter last year. Non-GAAP operating margin reached 27.3%, similar to the 27.4% recorded in Q1, 2010. Net R&amp;D expenses were up 15% compared to Q1, 2010, totaling $239 million or 5.9% of sales. The growth in net R&amp;D expenses over the comparable quarter last year is attributable primarily to greater investment in our branded R&amp;D. Gross R&amp;D, which exclude participation of third parties, was $265 &#x2013; sorry, it includes participation of third parties &#x2013; was $265 million, or 6.5% of total sales.</p>
          <p>Selling and marketing expenses, excluding amortization of purchased intangible assets, totaled $825 million this quarter, or 20.2% of sales, compared with 20.4% of sales in Q1, 2010. As already mentioned, the decline in selling and marketing expense as a percentage of sales resulted primarily from the termination of payment to Sanofi-Aventis, which were recorded as sales and marketing expenses in the past, offset by higher royalty payment in connection with certain generic products sold in the U.S., and by the addition of ratiopharm's branded generic business.</p>
          <p>Total G&amp;A expenses this quarter were $221 million, or 5.4% of sales, compared with 5% of sales last year. We recorded $38 million of net financial expenses in Q1, 2010, compared with $27 million in the comparable quarter of 2010. The increase in net financial expense resulted primarily from higher interest expenses due to the debt incurred to finance the ratiopharm acquisition and, to a lesser degree, expenses incurred in connection with hedging activities.</p>
          <p>The non-GAAP tax provision for the first quarter was $121 million of pre-tax non-GAAP income of approximately $1.1 billion. Our current estimate of the non-GAAP annual tax rate for 2011 is 11% compared to 15% for 2010. The low non-GAAP tax rate for 2011 resulted from a particular mix of product that our manufacturer in geographies where Teva benefits from tax incentives. This is not a rate we currently expect in 2012 and beyond. The estimated tax rate for 2011's GAAP results is 6%.</p>
          <p>Now let's have a look at our cash flow. Cash generated from operations this quarter totaled $900 million, up 2% compared to Q1 2010. Our free cash flow, excluding gross capital expenditures of $234 million and dividend payments of $203 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of certain assets of $50 million, amounted to $513 million. Free cash flow was influenced by payments on account of the ratiopharm integration program accrued in previous quarter, coupled by a higher dividend payment following the dividend increase we declared in February and higher capital expenses.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we bought back approximately 7.9 million shares at an average price of $54.41 per share for a total of $400 million. Since we started this buyback program, which our board approved in December 2010, we bought 9.8 million shares for a total of $500 million, reflecting an average price of $50.54 per share. Let me remind you that we did not buy shares during Teva's blackout period, which started March 22nd, and ends tomorrow.</p>
          <p>At March 31st, cash and marketable securities totaled $1.1 billion, down approximately $500 million from December 31st, as we used cash in the quarter to pay for the acquisitions of Theramex and Infarmasa, as well as to repurchase shares and continue to pay down our debt. Our total outstanding loan, bonds and convertible debentures stood at $6.8 billion, and financial leverage as of March 31st, was 23%, slightly down from 24% at the end of December.</p>
          <p>DSO, days sales outstanding, improved to 46 days this quarter compared to 53 days in Q1 2010. We calculate DSO after netting out, from the receivables, our sales reserves and allowances. Inventory days stood at 195 days, up from 180 days in previous quarter, or 183 in Q1, 2010, due mainly to foreign exchange differences. Net capital expenditure reached $184 million this quarter compared to $208 million in Q4, 2010 as we continue to invest in production capacity.</p>
          <p>Dividend, Teva board approved a quarterly net dividend amounting to approximately $207 million. On a per share basis, our dividend, which is declared in Israeli shekels, is NIS 0.80 per share. Based on the rate of exchange on Monday, on May 10, 2011, of the shekel to the U.S. dollar, this translates into approximately $0.232 per share.</p>
          <p>Thank you all for your time and attention today. And now, we would be glad to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Hi. Just the first question I had was with respect to Copaxone and Lovenox. I wanted to understand how you would weigh your options with respect to what you could do with these products.

          <p>Sure. Sure. Good morning, Louise. How are you? Just wanted to let you know on the Momenta &#x2013; I should clear this up. There have been and there are no settlement discussions at this time. We're really enthusiastic about our case and we look forward to the upcoming trial. With respect to Lovenox, our Lovenox file is alive and well, but as you know, we're not going to comment further on it until such time that we get the approval.</p>

          <p>Okay. Got you. I will just remind, we don't provide specific quarterly guidance. However, we said very clearly at the beginning of the year, we would provide guidance for the year, and so far I think we are on track. Now the first half will be slower than the second half. I think we said approximately 40% of EPS will come in the first half, and we definitely see it this way. Second half, we'll see major improvement and we'll see that in all parts of the business. And I think that there's no change to what we have guided originally.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So just so that we're clear, we should be looking if, by that math at a 2Q that is similar to 1Q? Would that be a fair statement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's &#x2013; on the buyback, we'll probably continue with the buyback program that we have, buying when the market allows us. But remember, the buyback &#x2013; in a current quarter, you have to average this, and you don't &#x2013; never have the full effect. The full effect will only be in the next quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then a follow up for Bill. I heard you guys talk about $100 million impact from Irvine year-over-year, but if we just look at the generic and other line in the North American number, it looks like, if my math is right, it was down $330 million &#x2013; sorry, $338 million sequentially. Can you just help us understand what drove that sequential decline? Understanding that you had a couple of facility issues and a lack of generic launches, but was there anything else in there that we should think about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Randall. Thanks for the question. When you look at the year-over-year, you were missing Mirapex, Pantoprazole, you were missing about $113 million. Protonix or the Panto, we lost about $93 million in top line sales, Lotrel, about $45 million and the oxaliplatin or Eloxatin, about $44 million. And then, what's really beginning to be a hangover for us is the first Q1 mixed amphetamine salts, the Adderall XR, about $97 million over the year and of course sequentially, a second quarter where we're not getting sales. Now we expect that to even out over the next couple of quarters. But as you know, the DEA's been having some issues with quota and that continues to be a drag.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean was there anything else, just thinking about 4Q versus what you reported in 1Q that would be driving that sequential down tick? Or is there &#x2013; just trying to think of &#x2013; it seems like a big number relative to the year-over-year impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, sure, the fact that there's no launches and again, you don't &#x2013; we don't have quite the same amount of <mark type="ph" /> Xanabine (31:38) shipped quarter-to-quarter. We're in the latter half of the exclusivity. Our customers are beginning to wind down their inventory. So we had significantly less in sales in Venlafaxine. Again, didn't pick up on our Adipex ER. We had some of the issues with respect to Jerusalem and about $53 million that we did not get from Irvine. When you add it all together, it pretty much hits your number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Bill.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, our next question comes from David Amsellem with Piper Jaffray. Please state your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, just a couple. Regarding Jerusalem, can you provide more color on the steps taken to address the FDA's issues? And when you talk about the slowdown in that facility, can you quantify what the impact is and how that will impact the P&amp;L as the year progresses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, David, it's Bill Marth. With respect to Jerusalem, I think Shlomo laid it out fairly well, but let me say that our laboratories have been fully remediated. We've gone through them and they have been certified and they are back online. It did create a slowdown for us, but we have addressed all issues and are very excited about asking the FDA &#x2013; we have in fact, asked the FDA to come back in. And we're looking forward to a re-inspection. So we're getting back on an even path. What we &#x2013; no, we don't know, at this point in time is we've had no approvals from Jerusalem, although we've none to have yet this year. We would like get that re-inspection in so that we can get approvals. We assume that at that point in time, our approvals from Jerusalem will continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then a question on the Cephalon transaction, regarding the synergy target, and given that Cephalon had near a billion and a half in operating expenses, a product portfolio that's maturing on the whole, is it possible, conceivable that the $500 million synergy target is conservative and also that the year three timing is also conservative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this Eyal. Yeah, first of all, we believe it's very possible by year three. We have mapped as much as we had time, and we had time to do a pretty thorough due diligence on the Cephalon expense structure. We can clearly see us integrating company in an efficient way and extracting synergies of $500 million at least by the third year after following the acquisition, and that is after we &#x2013; we assume that we keep the product portfolio, without closing any major R&amp;D project.</p>
          <p>It's mostly on the G&amp;A side when integrate two companies and eliminating the expenses of the public company, the generic piece in Europe, the <mark type="ph" /> net of our (34:47) price, which will be fully integrated with our European generic activities and activities outside, sales and marketing combined with our sales and marketing forces both in Europe and in the U.S., which we have a nice sales team, and all that lead us to believe that the $500 million is a very, very reasonable assumption even on the careful side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just, as a quick follow-up, what's the extent to which you're going to downsize the Cephalon U.S. sales force? How much of that infrastructure do you think you can pare back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, David, we're not going to go into that level of detail at this point in time. Remember that we just announced the purchase. We've looked at the synergies, we're pretty confident there. And I would always remind that I think, as Shlomo has well said before, when we think about synergies, the synergies aren't necessarily just on Cephalon's side.</p>
          <p>When you think about what we've done in Europe with ratio and that ratio largely became our back-end in Europe and that Teva became the front-end, the synergies can come on both sides. So we're very confident on the synergy side. It's a great company and we're very excited about getting it. And we think we got it at a very reasonable price for both the Cephalon shareholders and, of course, for our shareholders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And finally, add on that, David, you should bear in mind that Teva has a very long history, successful history of integrating companies in a very successful way. Usually, we are conservative when it comes to how much synergies you are going to drive out of any acquisition. And usually, we are exceeding the number that we are providing in the announcement. I know that this is a different kind of acquisition, but I would like to remind you that we have been there. We already integrated the respiratory product when we bought IVAX. We integrated the women's health business when we integrated Barr, and we have a $4.5 billion business in branded business, so we know something on that, as well. So, we &#x2013; fully confident that we will do the integration the right way and we will generate at least the number that we told the market on synergy.</p>

          <p>Next we have Chris Schott from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. The first question was just looking at sales for the remainder of 2011. I guess if we take the low end of your top line guidance, it looks like you need to average about $4.8 billion of quarterly revenue, that's $700 million higher than you just put up. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on the drivers that we should think about to see that type of a sales acceleration? And just how comfortable are you with your top line range at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Should I take that? Yeah, well, looking at where we are from now, I think we're very comfortable. We re-did the guidance as you have read it. It's in the press release for the first time. And we do see the U.S. generic business recovered from the current Q1 level, with some of the launches coming in the second half of the year, as we've already said. Continued growth in Europe, and Europe is well positioned for nice growth in Q2 and definitely in the second half, as Germany will also contribute to the growth in Europe.</p>
          <p>Our emerging market business is going on, or progressing very, very nicely. So, when we look at all the parts and definitely the branded business is doing well, the API, although small, is doing well. So, we look at all the pieces, we're pretty confident at that level. That of course, subject &#x2013; we said that &#x2013; subject to foreign exchange. If the euro will reverse on the rate, that could have an impact on the top line, but not so much on bottom line. But as things look now, yeah, I think that guidance looks very reasonable to us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, and this is Bill Marth, and I just wanted to remind that we still have Zyprexa coming through the back half of the year, products like <mark type="indiscernible" /> (39:11), Aricept, Nasacort, there's a variety of products left to launch for the balance of the year in the U.S. market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great, and just as a follow-up as we're talking about guidance, and I know you've talked a little bit about this, but can you comment on your 2012 targets, and how the Ceph deal impacts that guidance, especially top line? I guess what I'm looking at here is adding Cephalon to your 2011 range, it basically implies not a whole lot of organic growth going on here. So, I just was trying &#x2013; was just wanting to hear your latest thoughts about how 2012 is looking at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, one thing that we've done on 2012, you remember last year we provided guidance and we believe that this guidance is definitely in place. <mark type="ph" /> Probably will be narrower when we (39:53) get to the 2012 summary and numbers, at that time we'll have more details on how Cephalon really integrates within our business and we'll provide more details. But right now what we have provided, originally a year ago or a little more than a year ago, on 2012, is &#x2013; definitely holds and we reserve the right to go back to that later on this year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on Chris's question. I know you don't want to give us details on 2012 guidance, but qualitatively, I guess which segments of Teva's business do you see organic growth coming from in 2012, or even later half of this year? And then, separately, does your guidance for 2012 assume further acquisitions, or could we pretty much get to the range with just Cephalon alone? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Shibani, Shlomo speaking. First of all, you may expect us to grow significantly in all the areas that I mentioned in my part, i.e., in Europe where I believe that what I guided you for the long-term, we may see &#x2013; and again, this is not the focus for 2011, it's just looking for the longer &#x2013; long-range time in organic growth at the level of 7% to 9%. And I believe it will be in this number this year. I do believe that in Eastern European, Latin America, Asia, you may expect high double-digit numbers as this quarter presented in very nice way.</p>
          <p>And so, all in all, from the generic part, and of course the U.S. has been just jumping on here, I remind the audience on the coming launches in North America in the second part of the year. So all in all, there is &#x2013; that's what you should expect for 2012 as well. We are not referring today for potential next year launches, but that will be taken care in a different time.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, definitely our latest announced acquisition, Cephalon will bring us a very significant addition to our sales. I believe that there is a potential there to grow sales in a very, very nice way. You usually don't speak on sales synergies, but I believe that we have a proven track record that we know how to do that as well. And definitely this time, we are going to do it in the branded part. So all in all, I am very optimistic about 2012. Back to your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So can you confirm you're not assuming additional acquisitions in your '12 guidance? And then just a follow-up on potential new product launches at the end of this year or early '12, are any of those dependant on the Jerusalem facility passing re-inspection?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, let me clear, and I think that I said it regarding 2011, the guidance is not including any acquisition. As for the future, I think that I'm not in a &#x2013; I would like to leave that when we will be there and I don't want to comment on any future potential acquisitions. You know it when we do the acquisition, we'll of course do the necessary update or change in guidance as it's necessary due to the kind of the acquisitions that we are going to have in the future. And for the second part of your question, Bill, you would like to take this on about future launches?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, with respect to the future launches, I think the only ones we're really talking about for the U.S. market right now are the Zyprexa, which you all know, and it should happen in the back half of the year, as well Levaquin, <mark type="ph" /> Danipadolarecept (44:10) and the Nasacort AQ, to just name a few.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, can you tell us what your expectations are for Irvine sales for the full year? And second, can you help us understand this consolidation impact of Japan? What was the impact in the quarter and how should we expect that to impact for the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, you take the first one and then Eyal will take the Japan part? Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The impact from Irvine, or actually the future sales from Irvine are quite minimal, Marc, moving forward. We should get to about $100 million run rate, that's a run rate, by the end of the year. Just started to ship, we just started to ship the <mark type="ph" /> Bancazar (45:09), and the <mark type="ph" /> Zanazar (45:11) we're hopefully going to be shipping sometime over the weekend. It's product-by-product, working hand-in-hand with the agencies, so I really wish I could tell you more than that, but we're shipping what the agency drug shortage is asking us to ship first. And that's why we're bringing up the lines the way we are. It's really a hand-to-hand process with FDA. And so it's really &#x2013; I have to be a bit vague at this point in time, however, we should be up to that $100 million run rate by the end of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And Bill, this question is not meant to annoy you in any way. So just wanted to ask on the settlement, Louise asked you a question about potential settlement. So just wanted to ask you, have you been approached, and this next part of the question may be na&#xEF;ve, but what would be a reason why you all wouldn't just compare terms? Not reach a settlement, but just compare terms to see if anyone is on the same page with each other. And then just lastly, for my question on BG-12, can you just describe what you all meant in your press release when you indicated that there may be different definitions of endpoints between BG-12 of Laquinimod and other studies? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks for the question, Ken, and I'm not annoyed. The &#x2013; but, there just, there haven't been any discussions. So really &#x2013; at this point in time, there have been no discussions. So I guess there's no way to compare notes, since there have been no discussions. So, that's the simple answer. You know, we're enthusiastic about our case, and we look forward to putting it on at trial later part of the year. So, that's where we remain on that. So, I'll let Dr. Peterburg take the second part of the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So regarding BG-12, there is one thing I want to reiterate, you know that in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (47:52) we are saying this each time, it's very strongly advised not to compare between the clinical trials. And so we know they are different. There are differences that were on the primary endpoints between what we are looking and they were looking.</p>
          <p>There is a difference in the changing in the baseline patient population, and there were even on the definition of <mark type="ph" /> EBSA (48:17) but at the end, you know, it's coming back to the same issue that we say, we have a wonderful product, we really believe in it, we think it <mark type="ph" /> will phase out the four pillars, that are (48:30) important for any MS oral. And we think that based on that, we are looking forward after opening, you know that we need still to look into Q3. And we have the double results at that time, and we are sure that we'll have a very good product <mark type="indiscernible" /> (48:50).</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thank you for taking my question. I actually have three of those. Firstly, <mark type="ph" /> to (49:06) Peterburg, Yitzhak, I'm almost certain that you guys went back and recalculated the Laquinimod result using the endpoint as defined, as the primary endpoint that was defined for BG-12. That is time to first relapse as they define it. I was wondering if you wouldn't mind sharing that number with us?</p>
          <p>Second, to Bill, Bill, you guys are coming back to the market in the U.S., or increasing your manufacturing capability. Apotex just announced they can now ship that product to United States. There's been some stability in the market for a while, but are we really going to start facing more pricing pressure as two fairly large manufacturers come to the market?</p>
          <p>And third, on the biogeneric, I'm not quite &#x2013; biosimilars, I'm not sure who is going to take it. My understanding of the very nice uptick with G-CSF in Europe, can you confirm that? And perhaps give us an idea about the run rate for the numbers there? And can you confirm that you will be in the market by the end of 2013 on both your primary care &#x2013; your primary &#x2013; your first generation G-CSF as well as the albuminated competitor, <mark type="ph" /> Neulasta (50:18)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Ronny, you know I would love to go back and do all these calculation, but first of all I need to understand exactly what the competitors are doing. <mark type="ph" /> You know we're fully sure and the way Baucus will end this (50:34) it makes &#x2013; mask everything and we cannot announce it even to ourselves. So, I can only say again and again, we are waiting for <mark type="ph" /> Bravo (50:47), it's in another several months. We are sure <mark type="ph" /> that at then (50:51) we will have what we think a very good product and we are &#x2013; if the next phase <mark type="ph" /> the most fun we will have (50:58) a product with a new mechanism or function that could deal and most probably deal with the most important thing right now is in MS, is the question of how to get patients out of the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (51:14), let them go into it. So it's not enough information. We would love to hear more information about by competitor, but probably they have their reasons why we don't know all the information about it.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ronny, with respect to the Apotex question, it's an open question, right? They're going to come back to the market. It was a complete import ban, so I think that they're going to probably come back to the market in some sort of orderly way. And I think the progress will be slow. I don't think customers will flock to them. And they're going to come back to our product, but what I would remind, only a small part of our product was really affected. There was a slowdown. There was not an import ban on our product. So I think that customers will be cautious as Apotex moves back into the market. I don't expect that price stability is going to be immediately upset.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And what was the third question regarding, the G-CSF, Ronny?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I only had two part. First on &#x2013; an idea about the run rate in Europe. My guess is that you've taken, based on the numbers I saw the leadership on G-CSF in Europe, very costly. Can you comment about the run rate? And how much did that influence the European growth this year, year-over-year? And in the United States, can you confirm you expect to be in the market at the latest, by the time the <mark type="ph" /> compositions might have patent-expired (52:39) on both G-CSF, both Neupogen and Albuminated G-CSF?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So Gerard will take the European part and be followed by Bill on the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ronny, for G-CSF question. Yes, we've seen gradually increasing penetration across Europe of G-CSF, though be it slower than a classical generics, you can imagine. We see tender business across Europe and even in the tenders, it's taking some time to get penetrated. There are still doctors need to prescribe actively. The business is nicely growing and I think it's more than doubled year-on-year. It's still a small number, so if you would like me to give you an indication of whether or not that's been the driver for our performance in Europe, the numbers are simply too small for our overall business to really move the dial. So it's moving in the right direction. It's moving slower perhaps in terms of penetration than one would have thought, but it's moving in the right direction across Europe. Not a big number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Ronny, on the second part, the two G-CSFs, of course are &#x2013; our regular G-CSF, which we called Neutroval, that name will likely have to change. That product, we have a Complete Response Letter, we hope to respond to that in the third quarter and be in a position to launch that in 2013. We also hope that by the end of this year, and hope and anticipate that we'll be able to file our albumin-fused G-CSF in the U.S. by the fourth quarter of this year putting us in a position potentially, if all goes well, to be in the market with both products in 2013.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. You've been on the road the last couple weeks, post the Cephalon deal, and when you go on the road, all of us get the questions, do you believe they said this? And what do you think of that? So, I want to turn it around a little bit and ask you, especially in light of where the stock price is, after you go on a road show like this, what are the takeaways or the concerns that you're hearing from investors? And does it cause you to think about doing anything differently, either message-wise, management-wise, strategy-wise? Or do you just say, "Well, look, we're executing on how we've always executed and the stock goes up, the stock goes down, this just happens to be an out-of-sync period?" Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Should I start? Well, hi, David. This is Eyal. Let me start and then Shlomo would like to add a few things. First of all, if you're asking if we're taking it for granted our stock movement, no, we don't. We believe &#x2013; I don't want this to sound as a beaten clich&#xE9;, but our major role is to create value for shareholders. And as a public company, there's one way to measure this value. And when we get on the road and we meet with investors, we want &#x2013; what we want to do is to make them understand the Teva business model, the short and the long, the strategic direction that we're taking, why we're taking the steps that we're taking, where is the value and how we believe that this is going to &#x2013; and these steps are going to impact the Teva share value.</p>
          <p>We never talk about share price. I don't think it's our role. The audience of this call has better understanding in share prices. We talk about the business, but we don't ignore the fact that our share is traded out there. And it's our responsibility to make sure that more of you believe that there is a great opportunity in Teva shares, we do, and would buy the share to benefit from future <mark type="ph" /> returns (56:51).</p>
          <p>Something you want to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, David. Let me try to answer your very -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sophisticated. Sophisticated question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>different kind of question. First of all, I think the first feedback that we got from the market, the very thing that we did the right move on was this acquisition. Some of them, or some of your colleagues wanted to get more understanding on the strategic background of this acquisition and we provided, actually, we reiterate what we shared with you last year when we explained our strategy, that this is about diversifying our business as we go to the future. We took one step when we did the move in Europe, and we are doing right now the second step, which is taking care for diversifying our branded business.</p>
          <p>As a company that believe in growth and as &#x2013; when we look into our future, when we would like to maintain our growth and even to increase the pace, that was the two concern that we had to make sure that we are taking care for that going to the future. And I think that as the ratiopharm that we just proudly explained how well it has been integrated and how we can see the first fruits of this move, I do believe that we are going to see the same from the Cephalon integration.</p>
          <p>Second concern that we got was around whether we are able to generate the level of synergies at the $500 million and whether we are able to integrate a different kind of a business. Everybody understand our track record in generics. Some of them questioning our capability or ability to do it with an innovative company. Here I have to tell you first of all that only time will tell. But I have to share with you, also, that we are &#x2013; have the full confidence that we can do it and we can do it successfully. We did partially discount things in the past, we have a long track record of doing integration in a different kind of way, and that's why we're so successful in doing integration. We have the skills, we have the capabilities and we're doing it together with Cephalon. And that's the recipe for successful integration.</p>
          <p>So we are confident and we are looking forward for another successful move in Teva. And that's basically, as I said, what we think and how we shared it with your colleagues in our road show, as you mentioned it, last week or the week before. And that's basically were the major takeaways of this show, the road show, that we done.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This is <mark type="ph" /> Curt Caponetti (59:51) for Dave Risinger. Three questions, very brief. First, what is your conviction level on the Jerusalem facility issues being behind you very soon? Two, do you expect Germany to return to constant currency growth in the second half due to the recent tender wins? And finally, what should investors be assuming for the fully diluted share count in the second quarter and later this year, given that you still have $500 million left on the buyback? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me take first, your first question and then Gerard will answer the European questions, to be followed by Eyal on the last question on the shares. To answer your question on Jerusalem in a simple way, I believe it's behind us. We, of course, have to wait 'til the FDA officially comes to do the requested re-inspection, but to be very simple and very clear, I think we did all the corrective actions that we, I think we had to do and I think this is behind us. Gerard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Thank you <mark type="ph" /> Chris (1:01:01). Well, I think we were very happy with the Q1 in Europe and it was across Europe, true. And there were basically no surprises as far as the German market is concerned. You heard about our growth year-on-year. It's very nice to also announce that we &#x2013; our profitability even went even further up, it quadrupled over the same quarter across Europe. So we had a wonderful quarter, as far as that is concerned.</p>
          <p>Germany was no surprise for us. We planned for that, we planned for that when we announced the ratiopharm deal, we planned for that when we announced our plans for the year because we knew that on the back of price reforms last year in Germany, there would be a decline of the marketplace in the first six to seven, eight months of the year. And that happening as we speak. Our decline, which is in the low teens, is about half of the decline that was reported by the number one player in the German market. So relatively, we did very well. We became number one by volume and we're on track to become number one by value, if you look at the current trend that we see in the market. And as Shlomo already alluded to, we're closing the gap quickly year-on-year. So we know where we're going and we expect the German market to really come back to growth in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>The second reason was the market itself will recover, simply because you see an <mark type="ph" /> absorption (1:02:26) of some of the measures that were taken in last year. The second reason why we're optimistic is because the ingredients that we have in place, the revitalization, if I may say, of the dynamics around the ratiopharm company, since they were let's say unleashed out of the selling process, we really see a re-energized group of people there who are going after the wins in the German market. That's one. The second point is of course the AOK tender win that we did very well this time, still needs to be implemented, but we believe it will help us tremendously in making a strategic position, cemented on the shelves with every single pharmacy in Germany. And you can build on the back of that business as well. So we believe it should and can happen, and it will happen. We've got all our ducks in a row to do so, so we're optimistic about Germany.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, David, on the share count. This is Eyal. Since this buyback is actually impacting in a weighted average, then you don't get the full impact in the quarter when you buy the shares. So &#x2013; and we also have to make assumption of how many shares we will buy in Q2, which is &#x2013; which is not &#x2013; which is never, never a final decision. Having said all that, I assume that anywhere between 895 million to 897 million shares would be a good number on the share count. So it's about 5 million &#x2013; at least 5 million share less than the 902 million that we had at the end of Q1. 897 million would probably be a safe number.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Frank Pinkerton with SunTrust. Please state your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thank you for taking the question, <mark type="ph" /> if I ask one in all-player (1:04:17). The first one is on multiple sclerosis and just generally in that category, as we're seeing more and more products come to market, but price increases being taken, how does Teva ultimately look at managed care in that market? And with more products coming to &#x2013; some of the older generation products ultimately be at a discount, or does managed care have any way to kind of control pricing for some of those therapies? And then a follow-up, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Frank, this is Bill Marth. I think the key in the MS market right now is those patients treated versus non-treated and where the orals are having an impact here. I mean there's about 250,000 &#x2013; approximately 250,000 people that are treated and about 250,000 people that are, for one reason or another, either needle phobic, in denial, have failed on other therapies and just aren't in treatment paradigms today. And I think that those individuals, of course, are where the orals are likely to have an impact.</p>
          <p>Managed care, at this point in time, has had very &#x2013; has had very little impact with respect to treatment paradigm in &#x2013; with Copaxone or versus with any multiple sclerosis therapy. But over time I think as the treatment options open up, there may or may be more &#x2013; there may be more pressure for prices to be somewhat mitigated. So in any case, I think right now the real trend is to get more patients into that, into the treatment paradigm.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then just as a follow-up, with the Cephalon acquisition, assuming that closes, kind of two parts. Number one, would Teva go to reporting segments, say branded versus generic or something, once that acquisition closes, given the size of the brand division at that point? And then number two, can you just make any comments related to, from a management standpoint, given that branded will be much larger, how does Teva feel about the management in place? Or does there need to be a bolstering in management for the branded division? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the accounting question, this has not been determined yet. We need to give it a close look and determine based on segment reporting. Right now we don't think that we have to, but we need to look at it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as for the management  &#x2013; this is Shlomo, Frank. I think that first of all, as I pointed out when we announced the Cephalon acquisition, one of the major reasons that we were so attracted by the Cephalon is the Cephalon people, or the Cephalon team. We believe that they have an excellent management team with a proven track record of bringing a product to the market. And we definitely, as we did always, we are going to take the best employees and to make decisions by merit, and I believe that that will make part of the Cephalon, or Cephalon will definitely help us to beef up the management that we need in order to have a successful, leading, specialty pharma business. So we are optimistic &#x2013; optimistic and confident that together with the Teva people and the Cephalon great team, we will make a great management that will take us to where we believe we are going to be.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Eliot Wilbur with Needham &amp; Company. Please state your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Good morning. Just a couple of Copaxone related questions. First, on the o-U.S. performance in the quarter, how much of that was related to sort of one-time bids, one-time tenders? I know last year, we saw a strong, very strong performance of first quarter ex-U.S. and then it tapered off the next couple of quarters. So, I'm just trying to get a sense how much of that may be sustainable versus more of a one-time effect this particular period. And than, if you could just remind us, just for the timing of and current structure of the Copaxone, ex-U.S. royalty agreement and how that is going to impact the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>And then for Bill, probably will be a couple months before we hear from you guys again, and I think in this timeframe there's an action date pending on your latest iteration of a Citizen's Petition regarding Copaxone and basically criteria for any potential ANDA application. And I'm wondering if just basically you think we should expect a repeat performance of what the FDA has done the previous two occasions, which is basically to say, since we can't grant you what you're asking, and move on from there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Eliot, it's Bill Marth. How about if we start with the last first, and then we'll flip back to Eyal. I think that &#x2013; and your question about the ex-U.S., and the tender business, our Copaxone business ex-U.S. was fairly flat this quarter and there was very little tender action. With respect to the Citizen's Petition, I think you got it about right. It is our anticipation at this point in time that we are likely to get that Citizen's Petition pretty much handed back to us without any activity on it, as we do not believe there is anyone close to approval at this point in time. And I think the last part, Eyal would talk to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, regarding the take-back in Europe, it's mostly in European countries. This is &#x2013; the only major countries currently that we took back from Sanofi is the U.K. Gerard will correct me if I'm wrong. He's nodding with his head. And the rest of the major markets between the second half of this year and 2011, I think Germany the <mark type="ph" /> first (1:10:09) quarter. And basically, it will have a positive impact both on sales, a little less than that on profit, but positive on profit. You've seen in our recent filing, there's a 6% royalty associated with that. So it's not a free lunch, but will definitely give us some back-wind on the top line and a little on the bottom line also with the take-back until it's completed. It will be completed by the end of 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It's a pure revenue impact. No impact on SG&amp;A?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Yes, there is. It's very similar on a smaller scale to what had happened when we took it from the &#x2013; from Sanofi in the U.S., but it's smaller. Overall, the total impact of revenue will probably be around $50 million when we complete it. We'll deliver higher gross profit as a result of that and higher sales and marketing because we'll be doing it ourselves. Overall, to the bottom line from those numbers, maybe half will stay at the bottom line or a little less than that after the royalties, and the sales and marketing expenses that we'll have to <mark type="ph" /> find ourselves (1:11:30).</p>
