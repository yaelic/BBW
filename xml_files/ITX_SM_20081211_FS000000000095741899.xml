        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to all the participants in this webcast conference call regarding Inditex results for the interim nine months of 2008. I am Pablo Isla, Deputy Chairman and CEO, and here with me are Antonio Rubio, CFO, and Marcos L&#xF3;pez, Capital Markets Director.</p>
          <p>To start, let me tell you that we are satisfied with these results obtained in the first nine months of 2008 against demanding comparables and in a challenging retailing environment. These results show the strength of our business model.</p>
          <p>I would like to cover a few of the highlights. In the first nine months of 2008, sales in local currencies and constant perimeter have increased 14% to &#x20AC;7.4 billion. Additionally, store openings in the first nine months have reached 456.</p>
          <p>Let me point out that operating expenses remain tightly under control, as we keep on implementing our efficiency programs and while space growth remains significant.</p>
          <p>In the interim nine months of 2008, net income has reached &#x20AC;843 million, a 4% increase year-on-year in constant perimeter.</p>
          <p>Let me also highlight our strong cash flow generation. Our net cash position has increased 9% to &#x20AC;525 million at the end of the period. And finally, I want to underline our strict capital allocation process. Capital expenditure in the year so far has been &#x20AC;806 million, similar to that of 2007, while space addition has been substantial.</p>
          <p>I am now handing over to Antonio Rubio, who will provide some of the detail behind the headline numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. As you can see in this slide, the results for the interim nine months of 2008 ,when excluding gains due to change in perimeter, keep showing significant growth in all the key lines of the profit and loss account.</p>
          <p>Inditex gross profit have increased 12% to &#x20AC;4.2 billion. The gross margin has reached 57.6% on sales, 46 basis points higher than in the same period of the previous year.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, operating expenses had grown at 15%, in line with the space, and include all the start-up cost for new openings. Operating expenses remain tightly under control as we continue to make progress in implementation of our efficiency plans.</p>
          <p>Our operating efficiency is growing.  Operating expenses plus capital expenditure have grown 11% in the first nine months, compare to sales growth of 14%. Regarding the working capital, all lines keep showing tight control.</p>
          <p>Let me highlight our strong cash flow generation. Funds from operation have increased 6% in the interim nine months 2008 to &#x20AC;1.3 billion. I would also like to underline our strict capital allocation process. Capital expenditure has reached &#x20AC;806 million, a stable level over last year, while our commercial surface has experienced substantial growth.</p>
          <p>In the current year, we're also continuing our investments in the 2006-2008 logistic plan. Over this period, we have been making significant investments to prepare our logistic capacity for future growth. With these investments to be finished by year-end, our logistics are now scalable until 2012.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Marcos L&#xF3;pez, who will provide some of the detail behind the performance of the Inditex concepts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. In the first nine months, we have added 456 megastores to our retail park, reaching a total of 4,147. Examining the performance the concepts, Zara and the younger concepts grouped together, have performed at a similar pace over the interim nine months.</p>
          <p>Over the quarter, Pull and Bear, Stradivarius and Bershka have performed above the average while Zara Home and Oysho have performed below the average. I am now handing over to Pablo for the closing remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marcos. I would like to highlight the strong reception of Uterq&#xFC;e, our new format focused on accessories. Uterq&#xFC;e has opened 24 stores since its launch last July and the performance of these stores is above our initial expectations.</p>
          <p>Uterq&#xFC;e is currently present in many relevant cities -- Madrid, Barcelona, Athens, Porto -- and we plan to close 2008 with around 30 stores. In 2009, we will continue the launch in other relevant capitals and we plan to open 30 additional stores.</p>
          <p>Regarding the rate of 2008, the six weeks since the beginning of the fourth quarter show similar growth patterns to those of the third quarter. However, as you all know, the Autumn-Winter season is influenced significantly by the performance over the Christmas period and after-Christmas sales due to their important sales volumes.</p>
          <p>In this regard, our full year results for 2008 will be released on the 25th of March, 2009. And this is all from us. We will be pleased to answer your questions regarding these results and other subjects.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the telephone Q&amp;A session will start now. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> From 10:40 onwards, we will start answering questions received through the webcast platform.</p>
          <p>The first question comes from Mrs. Flora Trindade from BPI. Please go ahead with your question.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I would like to get your insight on the evolution of operating expenses.  In the quarter alone they were up by over 16% year-on-year, accelerating from the levels we've seen in first quarter and second quarter. And if you could share with us what's your view on the evolution of operating expenses going forward? And also on if you could share your view on the evolution of the Spanish and European clothing retail markets? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Well, regarding operating expenses, what we can say is very similar to what we said in the first half results presentation. The main driver for operating expenses growth is the space growth.  And if you look to the figures of operating expenses growth, it's around 15%, which is very much in line with the space growth. This means that a like-for-like closed book cost growth is close to zero.</p>
          <p>Perhaps later on, Antonio, our CFO ,can elaborate a little bit more about operating expenses and the actions we are taking and how are we managing our efficiency programs. But what I think is that most of our factories this one I am mentioning, that operating expenses are growing in line with the space growth. So this means that like-for-like, operating expenses growth is close to zero, as I was saying before.</p>
          <p>And regarding your second question and before giving the floor to Antonio, what I would say is that also regarding the operating performance in the different European markets, what we can say today is not very different from what we said in the first half results presentation. There are markets which are above -- first of all, I would like to say that if you look to our sales evolution and you have in mind the context of the retail sector, I think having that in mind is why we say that these are satisfactory results now, this 14% sales growth.</p>
          <p>There are markets which are above the average, particularly Eastern European and Asian markets and there are markets which are in the average and there are market, Spain, as you were asking particularly about the Spain. What we can say about the Spain is our total sales in Spain remain positive. This is something which we think is also remarkable having in mind the evolution of the -- of consumption -- global consumption. And the evolution of retail sales in Spain, as we always have said, is Spain as most of the markets is a very fragmented market.</p>
          <p>Independent retailers continue representing 40% of the market. These are markets that we know quite well, in which we feel very comfortable. And, as I was saying you before, in which our total sales are positive. We think that the best way to look to Spanish sales sales, is total sales much more than like-for-like sales. And in a market which is decreasing, our total sales evolution is positive. This means that we are gaining market share as it has been the case in the last few years. And this is what we can say right now about the Spanish market. Perhaps, Antonio, you want to elaborate a little bit on costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to remark in the case that the operating expenses are highly under control and that the process by which we are retaining efficiencies on an ongoing basis and especially focused on expense remain in place. And that we are continuing working on new initiatives, and we are developing and expanding the formats. Probably <mark type="inaudible" /> some complete initiatives. Logistic, for example, we are improving our transportation with the borders of different countries from the custom to the store through the finalization of their routes or using more than one way for entering to the country. And this can be applicable, for example, to Italy or Russia <mark type="inaudible" /> area, this year -- this period, we have developed our own photographic studio at headquarter, which permit to us the centralized production of catalogue's webpage, and photography for Zara, Zara Home and Uterq&#xFC;e. And this can be only two example of the amount initiatives we are continue generating for maintaining this operational efficiency.  Not only in the operational expenses, but also in the capital expense.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Richard Chamberlain from JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Good morning, gents. Just a question, so just to follow-up on the point about operating expenses.  And I see you're sort of combining your OpEx and CapEx lines now when comparing the growth versus sales growth. Does that mean that you've now got a different sort of target going forward in terms of OpEx growth for future years? And I just wonder why OpEx really should be growing in line with space growth rather than actually below space growth, given that you're now expanding, I guess, in more sort of provincial locations. You've already got a lot of the key flagship sites in the major markets. Maybe you can just explain why OpEx isn't actually growing at a lower rate than space growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we can say that our OpEx growth is mainly driven by space growth. You were mentioning why -- what you were saying and regarding the fact that new openings should have lower costs. Well, when you look to the aggregate figures, we continue opening flagship stores. We continue maintaining the combination between flagship stores and shopping mall stores.  You think about the recent months. I can give you several examples of very  flagship stores, knowing St. Petersburg, for example, we have just opened very flagship store. In Korea, we have just opened one of the, I would say, most relevant stores of the year.</p>
          <p>So there is always this combination between flagship stores and, of course, shopping mall openings. And new openings, you have in mind the start-up costs, which are very relevant. You have in mind the rental expenses. You have in mind the personnel expenses regarding any store opening. So in -- having OpEx growth in line with the space growth shows how tightly, as Antonio was saying, we are managing our costs.</p>
          <p>You were also mentioning this in reference to the operational efficiency combining OpEx and CapEx. Well, OpEx plus CapEx compared to sales has a lot to do with the cash flow generation. And what we think is that, these results show our strong cash flow generation. Our net cash position has increased 9% in the first nine months of the year. We continue generating a lot of cash. Our funds from operations are growing 6%. So in -- that is why we are showing this figure.  Know that our cash flow generation remains very, very strong.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning, everybody. I just have two questions. First of all, the percentage of stores opened in Spain in the last nine months, of all the stores. And the second one is...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, because we don't hear you very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. Can you hear me now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, much better. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My first question was the percentage of the stores opened in Spain in the last nine months of the total stores opened. And the second question was the lag between sales performance and the variable part of rentals in your stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Regarding your second question, you were asking about the proportion between fixed and variable rental expenses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no, I mean the difference in timing between sales performance and variable costs in rentals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't understand very well your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Your variable part of rentals is related to the sales performance, I understand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what is the difference in timing? Is it related to this quarter performance, or is it related to the last year performance in sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it is always when there is a variable rent, typically you pay at the beginning of the month, you pay a certain amount which is in advance of the potential variable rent and then you adjust on a monthly basis, typically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Or quarterly basis so -- but you pay an initial amount, which is supposed to be in line with what will be the variable rent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And regarding your question about the Spain, it's less than 10% of store openings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, 10%. And...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Less, less than 10%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. Perfect. And just one question regarding operating costs, but you haven't do into this previously.  Why it is -- why are operating costs growing by 16% this quarter, and in the last quarters it grew around 14%, more or less? Are you opening more surface in this quarter or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you know, what we mentioned is that we believe that operating expenses are growing in a very strict way. As we mentioned, operating expenses for the year -- for the nine months, are growing by 15% and space growth is growing accordingly. So timing differences over a quarter are very difficult to analyze, but what you must expect is that with this underlying like-for-like cost growth of sale, operating expenses will grow in line with the space growth for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, perfect. Thank you.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Anne Critchlow from SG [Societ&#xE9; Generale]. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Anne from SG. I've got a question on CapEx.  How do you expect CapEx to resolve next year, given that it's flat so far year-on-year? And in particular, are you seeing sufficient new store opportunities come up to maintain the same growth rate that you're seeing at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, regarding CapEx for the next year, the first thing we can say in -- as we were mentioning during the presentation, is that in CapEx related to logistic investments in the last three years, including this one, including the year 2008, has been very significant. It has been more or less 20% over total CapEx, because of our strategic logistic investment program. This program is coming to an end at the end of this year, and then in the next three years, 2009, 2010, 2011, you could assume that CapEx related with logistics will come back to what used to be its normal levels, around 10% over total CapEx. So from this point of view, you could see a decrease in CapEx thinking about the next few years.</p>
          <p>Of course, also, we are trying to invest more and more efficiently our capital. As Antonio was saying when he was mentioning our cost programs, we are not thinking only about costs, but we are also thinking about capital efficiency through many different ways. As we have mentioned in previous meetings or conference calls, it has to do with negotiations with the shopping mall developers. It has to do with our suppliers regarding furnitures, regarding the different elements that have to do with these stores. So with this combination of our normal level of logistic investments after the strategic logistic investment program and all these capital efficiency initiatives, we could assume a decrease in CapEx for the next year.</p>
          <p>Regarding growth opportunities, we continue seeing many growth opportunities in many different markets. There are markets, as we were mentioning, which we are just beginning. There are other markets which remain very fragmented, and we have presence since several years ago, but our market share is very low. So globally, we continue seeing a strong growth opportunities and we think we are going to be able to manage significant space growth with a, I would say, decrease in the CapEx.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. Thank you. I had a question on the gross margin, if you could elaborate on the resilience that we've seen also in the third quarter. And how, potentially, downside you see going into the fourth quarter, pressure from promotional activity? How much of debt protection may decelerate in the last quarter of the year, if you can give us some comments on that? As well as maybe elaborate on the consumer's trend that you are seeing towards your performance in other European markets, such as Italy and France. I don't know if you can expand a little bit on that as well. That will be great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Luca, regarding the gross margin, you know that we have quite sustained vision on that, and our vision is to -- what we target is a broadly stable gross margin this year compared to the previous one. As you see, the numbers for the nine months are consistent with this vision. We have a 46 basis points increase as of today, and as of today and obviously, so what we can say is that we stick to that target. So what we expect this to be broadly in line with the target, obviously the Christmas season is ahead of us, and there is a significant volume of sales in that period. But as a target, this is very much what the company is envisioning.</p>
          <p>Your second question about consumer trends, well, I believe that you are in following the results of many companies. You also seen the evolution of the market. And you are well aware of what is the situation. So what is very important for us is to keep on operating with our business model. And we believe our business model provides advantages to -- in any kind of circumstance. So I prefer not to elaborate much on the different consumer trends per market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question is on cost inflation. I wanted to understand whether you can give any indication on the cost inflation, excluding the new opening on the shops. And second, if you can give us some indication on how Christmas is going? You're very vague in your statement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding the second part of your question, I think it is the statement we have mentioned during the presentation that, up to now in the beginning of the fourth quarter, sales are following similar growth patterns than those of the third quarter. Of course, we always have in mind that the Christmas season is very relevant and the sales period after Christmas is also very relevant from the point of view of sales. Now this is -- that is why we mentioned that during the presentation. But what we can say up to now is that sales are following similar growth patterns than those of the third quarter of the year. And regarding like-for-like cost inflation, you were mentioning it is what we were saying just before, that most of the OpEx growth is related to space growth. So like-for-like cost inflation is close to zero. It is not zero, but it's close to zero.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. A question on your operating costs, please, again  going back to that. You said the first nine months' operating costs have been growing in line with space. I was just wondering whether you could say the same for the fourth quarter that is ahead of us. And staying on operating costs, could you just explain what the nine million other net operating loss is, just to clarify that, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The end part of your second question, it is related to the launch costs of Uterq&#xFC;e. Following the conservative accounting approach of Inditex, would be fair to fully expense all the cost related to the launching of this new format in the profit and loss account of the period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And regarding the first part of your question, what we can say is that, as we always say, we would prefer to look at costs thinking on a yearly period, not on a quarterly analysis. And thinking about the year, our expectation today is that OpEx growth in the year will be broadly in line with the space growth during the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Could you spell out what your current expectations are for space growth in 2009-10 and to what extent have you've been affected by developers' hedging and funding problems? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, first of all, what we can say as, I was saying, just before is that we continue seeing very significant opportunities to continue increasing our space in the different markets. Now you must have in mind that we are present in 72 different markets, in most of them with very limited market share, and with high growth potential. So we continue seeing significant opportunities to continue increasing our space in the different markets. Of course, there could be some shopping malls that could have a delay in -- because if the shopping mall developer is not having access to the financing for the shopping mall, there could be shopping malls that could have a delay. But you must have in mind that the world remains very big, no, and we are present in 72 different countries. What we think we can achieve is to continue having significant space growth, in any case we are -- we continue thinking about double-digit space growth. And if you think about the year 2009, the compound annual growth rate between 2008 and 2009 will not be very different from the current space growth rates. That is our expectation right now.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Thanks. That's SEB Enskilda in Sweden. Gentlemen, I was wondering if you could give us just a flavor of how the worst performing markets, if you stay in Europe, compared to, let's say, the average or the slightly better markets in the past quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we prefer not, always in our quarterly results presentation not to enter a market-by-market. But what we can say is what I was saying in the previous conversation.  There are markets which are performing above the average. You can think about Eastern European markets, you can think about Asia markets, there are markets which are performing in line with the average.  And Spain is performing below the average. That is what we can say today, no. But having said that, as we were saying before, what is remarkable about the Spain is that in the nine months and in the quarter itself, total sales in Spain are growing, are positive, no, which we think that having in mind how the market globally is performing is quite relevant, and as Marcos was saying, showed the strength of our business model.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Richard Chamberlain from JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Yeah, I just had a follow-up actually on pricing in the quarter. Could you say what's happened to average selling prices in the quarter and also how you see prices particularly for the Zara brand trending over the next year? Given the strength of the dollar recently, do you see upwards pressure on pricing going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we can say is that in the quarter our average prices remain stable and what we are targeting for the next year is the same, stable average prices. And regarding our -- the dollar evolution, as we were mentioning, well you must have in mind our sales structure, now in our case only one-third of our total sales is dollar related, no? We have a lot of sales in -- well, you know perfectly, because of our business model, our proximity sales in Spain and Portugal, in Morocco, Turkey, is a very relevant market also for us. So our exposure from that point of view is limited. But regarding our pricing policy, we are not planning big changes in our pricing policy.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Can I ask about your targets for sales growth because I would assume given the step down in European markets over the last few months that you have probably abandoned your target of achieving two year compound like-for-like growth of 8%? Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we can say is that the 4% like-for-like target is our medium and long-term target. If we think about our target for the next year, well of course, as a management our target for the next year is to have a positive like-for-like sales figures in the next year. That is our target as a management team, having in mind, as I was saying before, all the markets in which we are present, our presence in more than 70 different markets and the growth opportunities and the market share that we have in those markets. In -- so our target for the next year as management remains to have a positive like-for-like sales figures.</p>

          <p>The last question comes from Tony Shiret from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, gents. I'm going to give you a lot of three questions, in fact. First of all, just you've been sort of skirting around what people have asked you about the amount of space increase in Spain, is it year-on-year sort of roughly about 5% is the first question? Second question, you talked about the cost efficiencies and the cost control that you've put in place and you outlined how Reduce 3 would have some residual effects in the current year. Can you tell us what costs would have increased by without the cost containment programs? And can you also tell us what the pre-opening expenses were year-on-year within the OpEx? Those are three questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding the space growth in Spain, is more 7 to 8% than 5%, okay?. Regarding pre-opening, you know that the pre-opening costs are significant. This have been significantly reduced by the program we have to obtain efficiencies, but is still important when space is growing at the current rate. I cannot obviously quantify it on a quarterly basis, but they remain significant, especially in a company which is expanding at the pace that we are doing it. But they have been significantly reduced by the program we have put in place. And regarding initiatives of Reduce 3, Antonio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think your question was more related with some hypothesis that we have not gone through, it was cost growth without Reduce 3 program. So this is something we have not gone through and what we can say because Reduce 3, as we have mentioned in many different times, it's much more to introduce this efficiency culture all across the company.  And this is what has been more relevant about Reduce 3. We are not talking only about a cost control, but we are talking about efficiency at every level inside the company. So it is -- it would be, I would say, impossible for us just to say without all the initiatives that have been going on in the last three years, cost growth would have been this or that.  For us it would be impossible to give that figure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the telephone Q&amp;A session has finished. And we now open the turn of those questions received through the webcast platform.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question coming from the webcast is coming from Carlson from Eco Capital which is asking about the inflationary pressures on sourcing countries, if we are seeing a special trend coming from -- he mentions Spain or Turkey or China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we can say is that nothing really relevant. As I was mentioning before, our sales structure is very diversified, 50% of it is proximity, one-third of it is in Asia, half of that in China. We are not seeing particular inflationary pressures from that point of view right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second question, I think, has been covered basically which is coming from Jaime S&#xE9;melas from Banesto which is talking about the like-for-like in the Q3 that -- I mean, as you know, we do not disclose on a quarterly basis. And then there is another question coming from Marcos Smeed from MFS talking about sales performance in Spain that I think has been already answered.  I don't know you can add any further color on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just to stress the fact that we have positive total growth, which we believe is the right metric to examine our performance in the Spanish market when the global market has seen a decrease. I believe this is the message that we would like to convey that we are still growing in the Spanish market, a market that we know every well, a market in which we feel very, very comfortable, in which we have been present for many years and we know in detail. And I believe that this is remarkable in the current context.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is another question coming from Rolf Karp from Ohman Securities talking about the number of stores to be opened in 2009 I think has been already addressed regarding the space growth for next year. And there is another question coming from Marta Llano from Fidentiis talking about having in mind the capital discipline that we are showing on the cash flow generation is it would be reasonable to assume any kind of improvement in shareholders' remuneration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we can say about shareholders' remuneration is to explain once more the dividend policy that was approved two years ago by the shareholders' meeting and the Board of Directors. Our dividend policy has two elements, one of that is a 50% payout ratio and at the same time has a second element according to which we feel comfortable with a neutral balance sheet.  This means not having debt, not having cash, always having in mind the average net cash position during the year. So what we can assume is that dividend policy is a combination of two elements, net profit evolution and average cash position during the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. And there is a question coming from Anna-Karin Envall from ABG Sundal Collier talking about that it's his understanding that now transportation costs mainly from Asia is decreasing or is easing, at least raw material costs are declining rapidly and also capacity is very high to the cautious orders from other retailers, if this will be a positive impact in the margin for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, of course, all these elements that you are mentioning have a positive impact, and petrol costs going down, these things have a positive impact. But at the same time you always must have in mind that as we always say that the gross margin is a combination of many different positive impacts and many different impacts on the other side. So what we can say right now is that we are not seeing significant elements to change this global statement about the stable gross margin, having in mind all the different, I would say, positive and negative impacts. We always say that to try to isolate one, two, three particular impacts on the gross margin, sometimes it could us to the wrong picture, because it is a combination of many different things.  And having all the elements in mind, we continue thinking about this stability of the gross margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And there is a follow-up &#x2013; or a question coming from Frans Hoyer talking about having in mind decline in logistic CapEx going forward, if we foresee any kind of similar effect on logistic costs as a percentage of sales as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we can say, but of course, also regarding OpEx, there are a lot of elements related with cost. But what we can say, the question is truth in the sense that when you open a new big logistic platform, that year you have immediately a cost increase has to do with electricity, it has to do, well of course, with amortization. Now that it has to do with many different factors. And then the next year tends to normalize again the situation. But so the answer to the question would be yes, but nothing so significant to change the global picture. But of course, the answer to the question is yes in the sense that the year in which you open a new logistic platform, as it is the case, for example, with our logistic platform. In Madrid, you have an additional impact on costs, that particular year with the following year comes back to the normal situation. But nothing as relevant as to change the global picture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And there is a question coming from Amy Chamberlain from Churvus. I think it has been already answered that is total growth in Spain was positive in third quarter. We have already mentioned that it was positive. And there is another question coming from Fahad Siddiqui from MFS. Siddiqui is assuming that we should have still some positive impact in the gross margin in the Q4 and having in mind that the gross margin has been up 50 bps in the first nine months, what's the reason for having the stable expectation for the gross margin performance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We always say that a stable -- the gross margin is a combination of so many different factors that 50 basis points above or below means a stable. So within that the nine months, gross margin is a stable according to our concept of a stable gross margin. And this is what we think will happen in the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. There is another question coming from Eva del Barrio about the mechanics of the P&amp;L that we can address after from the IR Department. And then there is another -- there is another, there is a question coming from Stephen Sipe from MainFirst Bank in Germany, talking about our performance in the German market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we can say is that the German market we have seen a normal evolution over these first nine months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fine. There is a follow-up question coming from Robert Miller saying that -- and giving what -- using our reviews like-for-like sale expectations for 2009, if this has resulted in a lower like-for-like level required to keep the cost of sales flat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we have been growing through with the, in, what we are saying during all the conference call is that cost growth is growing in line with the space growth. So this means that like-for-like cost growth is very low, very limited. We were saying it's not zero, but it's close to zero. So this means that in order to maintain sales growth and cost growth in line from the point of view of like-for-like sales growth, because well costs related to a space growth have to do with the space growth. But cost -- like-for-like cost growth is close to zero, so this means that with a low level of like-for-like sales growth, it could be stable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. There is another question coming from Frans Hoyer that is about the different drivers of the topline on a quarterly basis that we are not going to address. And there is a follow-up question coming from Anna-Karin again, talking about our performance in Russia and if we are still expecting to open 40 stores before year-end basically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>40 stores, right now before the year-end.  Well, I think at the stage of the year. I don't think there will be 40 stores between now and the end of the year, because we are in the final weeks to open stores. Now, I am think about the natural year. But what can say is that in Russia, we continue growing and sales continue growing very significantly and we have -- we continue with our store opening plan. As anywhere else, our store opening plan in Russia is a combination of flagship stores. I was mentioning before the St. Petersburg store we opened one month ago and it's always a combination of flagship stores and shopping mall stores. And we are opening stores in a lot of shopping malls which are developed by IKEA in most of the different Russian cities.  And we continue having very good sales performance and we continue planning to open stores in a relevant way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a follow-up question coming from Anne Critchlow talking about depreciation charge that I think that's we can address after the conference call. I think there is one follow-up question coming about about the inventory position, coming from Nicklas Fh&#xE4;rm, from Enskilda, talking about the inventory position at the end of the Q3, if we are prioritizing markdown management and gross margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not really. What we can say is what we have said always, know that in our case the inventory position is not the best measure, because for us what is more relevant is what we call internally the commitment. But having said that, well, the inventory position is very much inline with sales evolution. So, no, we are managing our purchases in a very normal way and nothing really is relevant from that point of view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And there is a question coming from Andy Hughes, talking about the relatively weak performance of Zara Home, if this is a reflection of the market or it has something to do with the commercial position of the concept.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I -- on that, still I believe that in environment like this one we're seeing, clearly the fashion forward concepts tend to outperform, while those concepts which are more functional like those based on <mark type="inaudible" /> tend to underperform. This is our historical experience and this is very much what we expect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the last question so far is coming from Eva del Barrio from Bankinter. If we are planning any similar initiative to stimulate sales as the promotional activity put in place by M&amp;S, Marks &amp; Spencer, something like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From that point of view, nothing relevant. We'll continue with the same policy in the different markets, so nothing relevant from that point of view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I think we can cover the rest of questions after the call then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So thank you very much to all of you. And we are of course ready to continue answering your questions directly through the Capital Markets Department. So thank you very much for joining us during this conference call.</p>
