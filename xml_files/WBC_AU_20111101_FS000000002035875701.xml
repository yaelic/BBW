          <p>Well, good morning, everyone. And welcome to Westpac's Full Year 2011 Results Presentation. My name is Andrew Bowden and I'm Head of Westpac's Investor Relations. Presenting today, of course, will be Gail Kelly, our CEO; and Phil Coffey, our CFO. And under the normal protocols, Gail and Phil will open up with the presentation and then we'll open the floor to questions.</p>
          <p>Particularly a welcome to all those on the webcast and on the phones today, and we look forward to questions after this session.</p>
          <p>Thanks very much and I'd like to invite Gail to the lectern. Thanks, Gail.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Andrew, and good morning, everyone, lovely to have you here. And thank you for joining us for our 2011 results presentation.</p>
          <p>Let me say at the outset that this year has been an important one for us. This November marks the three-year anniversary of our St. George merger, and it marks the three-year anniversary of our Westpac local implementation and effectively the halfway mark of our SIPs agenda.</p>
          <p>So for us, we've got to the end of the first stage of this strategic agenda that we set up in the early part of 2008. And you'll see me outline in the later part of the presentation today, moving into the second stage of that agenda, which is very much about driving value from the position that we've established further investment and delivery in terms of the platform that we have.</p>
          <p>But let me start by just saying a few words about the results itself. For 2011, it is a sound overall financial result, really pleased with the strengthening of the balance sheet that you can actually see in this result and the record dividend that we provided for our shareholders. Also really pleased with the progress that we've made on our strategic agenda, which I think is evident in this result; evidence of the depth of customer relationship coming through in our customer metrics and coming through in core earnings, also evidence of the business distinctiveness of our brand position, being there for all to see.</p>
          <p>On SIPs, we're half way through, as I indicated earlier, and on time, on plan, on budget, which is a really important thing in any key technology agenda. And then lastly, a razor sharp focus on productivity, which as I know you know will continue into the next phase.</p>
          <p>So, let me therefore enter into the results themselves. And this slide provides an overall summary. As you can see, cash earnings are up a sound 7%, with statutory profit up 10%, boosted by the finalization of the tax consolidation of the St. George merger. Our impairment charges to average loans were down 10 basis points over the period and we remain sector leading at 20 basis points. ROE is steady at 16% and we have an industry leading expense to income ratio.</p>
          <p>Overall, we're pleased to be in a position to provide our shareholders with an $0.80 dividend this half, taking it up to $1.56 for the full year. This speaks to be strength of our business, the strength of our capital position, which was up a further 59 basis points to 9.68%.</p>
          <p>The very pleasing element of our results is how our Wealth and Retail businesses have performed. And I think this slide tells the story. The top chart maps the components of earnings, showing strong net interest income and the improvement in impairment charges driving the uplift in our cash earnings.</p>
          <p>If you look on the right-hand side of the chart, you can see the softer performance from Treasury and Markets, which reduced cash earnings growth by $262 million or around 5%. So, without that impact, cash earnings would have been up 12%. The bottom chart looks specifically at core earnings, so excluding the benefits of our lower impairment charge, and it shows a very solid performance for Westpac RBB, New Zealand and BT, up 7%, 10%, and 9% respectively on a core earnings basis. St. George core earnings is up 3% and that included the Bank of Melbourne launch costs.</p>
          <p>I'd like to just reflect briefly on each one of our key business divisions, starting with Westpac RBB. This has been a very pleasing result, with strong evidence of the investments we've made in our retail distribution beginning to pay off. Core earnings are up 7% and cash earnings are up 11%. All the key metrics we use to judge performance have shown positive momentum. For example, customers with four or more products are up 180 basis points to 29.3% with particularly pleasing wealth cross-sell. Net promoter score for key segments has improved solidly over the year, with Westpac ranking clear number one of the majors in commercial, SME, and agri. From a market share point of view, Westpac RBB has grown mortgages at 1.1 times system and customer retention is at all time high at 97.6%.</p>
          <p>Moving to WIB, and what we have here is a portfolio of businesses with outperformance in a number of areas helping to offset the decline in Markets' income. In terms of its customer focus strategy, the division has a lot to be proud of. For example, in a very competitive market, WIB has maintained number one position in our three key measures of overall customer satisfaction, relationship strength and lead domestic bank in the Peter Lee Transactional Banking survey, which is conducted every year. And this is the eighth year in a row that WIB has occupied this number one spot for Transactional Banking, which is at the heart of our customer relationships. Transactional Banking revenues, up 10%. Asset quality as you can see, was also a standout for the year and demonstrates the strength of our institutional portfolio.</p>
          <p>Reflecting on St. George, I'm very pleased to see the restoring of momentum in the second half. If you look at mortgage growth, deposit growth and core earnings growth, in the second half it was double that of the first. It's also good to see the repositioning work that we've done take effect. Within the St. George business division, we now have a family of regional brands.</p>
          <p>St. George itself, which is focused primarily on New South Wales, with a challenger position in Southeast Queensland and Western Australia, and then we have BankSA which continues to do very well in its core geography, South Australia, where it is the largest bank and our newly launched Bank of Melbourne, which is a bank for Victorians. And overall, there it's early days but momentum is ahead of expectations with new customers per month doubled as of the same time last year.</p>
          <p>Overall for St. George, it's pleasing to see that we've consistently grown customer numbers since the merger and we've retained our leadership position in NPS for retail and business customers. So in contrast to how I felt at the end of the first quarter this year, I'm very happy with the progress being made.</p>
          <p>With regard to BT, we're reaping the benefits of the wealth cross-sell culture that has become embedded within the Group. Notwithstanding the headwinds from weaker asset markets, cash earnings is up 9%, which is a particularly strong result relative to others. The highlight here is the excellent positioning the division has across the wealth value chain in super, advice, asset management and insurance. BT continues to outperform the industries in a number of key aspects, including our sector-leading platforms, with BT Wrap and Asgard winning almost 40% of annual net flows.</p>
          <p>We also delivered a strong insurance result, despite being negatively impacted in the first half by unusually high insurance claims. Life insurance has been the quiet achiever in BT, delivering a 22% rise in cash earnings.</p>
          <p>Finally, Westpac New Zealand, which delivered a strong rebound in full year '11, with core earnings growth of 10% and cash earnings up 41%. This is an all-round strong performance. Market share gains have been achieved in all key product areas, and our net interest margin has strengthened. Revenue per employee is up 8% and employee engagement is up three percentage points to now stand at 82%. So a very good set of outcomes and overall, I'm pleased with our divisional performance.</p>
          <p>It's a good lead-in to outline the progress that we've made on our strategic agenda this year. And five areas to briefly cover here. Firstly, we have seen a step-up in net customer growth and in our customers with four or more product symmetric, both in Westpac RBB and in St. George. Cross-sell of wealth and insurance product is happening everyday throughout our branch networks. Westpac RBB leads the major banks in this regard, with 20% of our customers with our wealth products. And St. George has shown strong momentum, up 12% off a lower base.</p>
          <p>On multi-brand, the platform is now in place and is one of the differentiating features of our strategy. Westpac Local is delivering, St. George is repositioned, BankSA continues to perform well in its local market and Bank of Melbourne has been successfully launched. RAMS continues to grow strongly, and BT is our standout wealth brand. So overall, a strong position with significant strategic optionality for future growth. We have more to do to truly leverage this. And that is a key part of the next phase.</p>
          <p>Regarding productivity and SIPs, I'm pleased with progress here. We delivered $289 million in productivity savings over the year. And on SIPs, we're almost halfway through. The sixth of our 14 SIPs program's complete, on time and budget. Of the eight still underway, three significant programs will be completed in the next 12 months, including our new online platform. We are fundamentally so much better placed in this arena than we were three years ago.</p>
          <p>Lastly, on the St. George merger, and Phil will have more to say in his presentation. This has been a huge effort and the merger has transformed the Group. What I'm most pleased about is the strength of St. George's position with its customers. We set ourselves the task of not losing customers and I'm pleased to say customer numbers and customer business have grown.</p>
          <p>To the last slide for my section. Now our core strategy's to ensure that we build a company for the long run, and this slide speaks to this; I think it's self-explanatory. We have a much-strengthened Tier 1 ratio, now at 9.7%, up from 7.8% in September 2008, with core capital at 8.1%, up over 200 basis points. Liquid asset growth has been phenomenal, well up on three years ago, reflecting our conservative positioning through challenging times.</p>
          <p>Similarly, our deposit-to-loan ratio has shown good improvement, although we have more to go here. Stressed assets as a percentage of total committed exposures tells a good story for 2012, now at 2.48%, down from its peak last year of 3.20%. We are best in class here.</p>
          <p>Our focus on people has been consistent throughout the past three years, and it is pleasing to see our People Leaders Index now tracking ahead of the global performing norm. Employee engagement is strong and turnover has steadily reduced.</p>
          <p>Lastly on technology, three years ago, we were in a very poor position. Enormous focus and effort has gone into this area, which has driven a significant reduction in the average number of Severity 1 incidents, down to an average of six per month in 2011 across Westpac and St. George, from an average of 34 per month in 2008.</p>
          <p>Not on this slide, but important to note, is the external recognition we have received, with Dow Jones recently voting us the global leader in sustainability for the banking sector in 2011. And earlier in the year, the World Economic Forum rated us number 18 in the World's Top 100 Sustainable Corporations, the only Australian Bank on the list.</p>
          <p>With that, let me hand over to our CFO, Phil Coffey. And I should mention that it's Phil's birthday today. So, if you can be pleased to give him a smile. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks, Gail and good morning, everyone. And it is great to be here today. Similar to prior presentations, I'll elaborate on some of the key elements of the result, and I'll focus more around the half-on-half picture, given that Gail has elaborated on the full year.</p>
          <p>The second half of the year had some common themes to the full-year performance, particularly with the strong contribution from our Retail and Business and Wealth divisions, and you can see that in the top part of the slide. Both cash earnings and core earnings were up solidly across these divisions in the half.</p>
          <p>The revenue composition was also similar to the full year picture, with lower treasury and web trading income proving to be a headwind. The timing of asset sales also contributed to lower revenue growth half-on-half, such that non-interest income fell in the half. As we outlined in our third quarter market update, the half was also impacted by an uplift in costs, especially in the fourth quarter, from some one-off events and certain investment spending, which also weighted more heavily at the end of the half. I'll give you some more details on that later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>The combination of reduced revenue growth and higher expenses meant that core earnings only had a small increase in the half. Cash earnings was slightly lower, as impairment charges were modestly higher in the second half, and that mostly reflects the timing of changes in the economic overlay and if you look at the underlying impairment charges, actually lower half-on-half.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet and lending and especially deposit growth was stronger in the second half. In lending, growth was broadly in line with system in Australia and total credit growth, that's consumer end business, at 2.6% in the second half was a nice improvement when compared with growth of only 1.4% in the first half. In addition to improved momentum, lending tends continued to reflect our decisions to focus on the quality of lending and you can see that in the chart. In the mortgage book we continued to emphasize distribution via our own network.</p>
          <p>The impact of this focus was felt most heavily in St. George because of the greater weighting of broker introduced lending to their back book. In St. George, mortgages grew $1.9 billion over the full year, but the momentum was building half-on-half. And of the increase, 70% was put on the books in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Westpac RBB has had a particularly good year growing comfortably above system and was well supported by strong growth through RAMS. Business lending remained soft, but broadly consistent with system. We've seen a further run-off in commercial property in the institutional and corporate books, while we've had modest growth in SME lending in St. George and Westpac RBB.</p>
          <p>We continue to see good business inquiry and there was some improvement in growth in the fourth quarter, but it is too early to call a rebound in business credit. The deposit story shows growth picking up strongly in the second half. This was supported by an increase in consumer and business caution, which lifted system deposit growth through the year and we've continued to grow slightly ahead of system.</p>
          <p>We can also see that business and consumer caution playing out in the mix of the book, with a particular preference for term deposits and a pickup in mortgage offset balances as people look to put more liquidity into their mortgages. This is a trend that is continued into the new year. Term deposits have been the main source of our growth and we've also sought to avoid some of the more aggressive online <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:17:11) specials in the market.</p>
          <p>When looking at, if you like, the sources and uses of funds, the overall balance sheet, the uplift in deposits has been a key feature, exceeding lending by $11 billion over the year and providing increased flexibility for us in managing the balance sheet. Long-term wholesale issuance exceeded maturities and that led to a $4 billion early repayment of government guaranteed debt. Short-term wholesale increased as long-term funding rolled in under 12 months to maturity and as the A dollar fell, especially late in the second half.</p>
          <p>Derivative revaluations and collateral receipts from that sharp A dollar fall was also significant especially again at the end of the half. So, in summary, this combination of factors facilitated the improved deposit funding for the balance sheet and a big increase in liquid assets.</p>
          <p>As we move closer to the new liquidity requirements, we are continuing to boost the level of our liquid assets and these topped $100 billion for the first time. It's worth noting that you should expect some movements in the balances of liquids both up and down over time and that will reflect the active management of our overall liquids portfolio, including our collateral balances.</p>
          <p>You can see on this slide that the bulk of new liquid assets were in the higher quality end of the liquidity spectrum, with cash, government and semi-government paper doubling over the year. Wholesale long-term maturities over next year are equivalent to about what we raised in new term borrowing in 2011. What we actually raise in the year will, of course, depend how the year plays out, and we'll be heavily influenced by the net deposits to loan balances and the condition of markets through the year. We're particularly pleased to have covered bonds now available to further diversify our funding pool, and our strong liquidity position gives us a lot of flexibility in dealing with unsettled markets.</p>
          <p>Our improved volume momentum was not at the expense of margins. Our overall margins improved over the half by two basis points, with a four basis point uplift across the banking divisions and that was partially offset by a softer contribution from Treasury and Markets.</p>
          <p>All our banking businesses recorded an uplift in margins over the last half. In Westpac RBB, the rise was three basis points, with better mortgage margins somewhat offset by mix effects and from the impact of higher cost deposit funding. St. George had a better margin outcome, the reduction in broker lending and some business re-pricing helped here. In WIB, the division delivered a good outcome, with the result assisted by re-pricing of lending from write-backs and the early amortization of fees.</p>
          <p>New Zealand's margin performance was a standout, with margins rising nine basis points in the half mostly from the impact of mortgage refinancing. Higher deposit costs were experienced over the half and wholesale funding costs continue to rise, but the effects from wholesale were more limited through the past year given the lower growth in term borrowing. Our overall treasury and trading activities were impacted by extreme volatility in markets, with lower half-on-half revenue of $95 million all in the fourth quarter. The custom elements of the WIB Markets business, however, did very well as customers sought to manage their exposures to the extreme moves that we were seeing in rates. And you can see that customer flows provide a good foundation for earnings in this category.</p>
          <p>Looking at trading activity, there were number of influences on the result. FX did well in navigating the steep fall in A dollar at the end of the half, but debt markets suffered from the sharp widening in credit spreads on their securities portfolio and from a $30 million negative swing in CVA in the second half. Net <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:21:52) revenue was also lower in the second half, not surprising given the sharp volatility and the sell-off in equities markets that we saw in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Treasury revenue was also lower in the half. Benefits of the lower short-term interest rates pushing the cash bills spread lower were offset by the negative level of liquid assets. The larger liquid asset portfolio will probably give rise to more associated earnings volatility over time and that'll be most to do with changes in the bonds to swap spreads.</p>
          <p>Expenses were well managed over the year, rising by just under 2%, but as we called out in the third quarter update, we expect it to pickup in the fourth quarter and this led to a 3% rise in the half.</p>
          <p>Looking at the second half more closely, this slide highlights that productivity benefits and the tail end of additional merger synergies more than offset our business as usual expenses and they included the full period impact of our 4% salary rise that was processed in January this year, along with higher marketing and higher property costs.</p>
          <p>Restructuring costs also picked up later in the half as productivity initiatives played their way through. Over the full year, the Group reduced FTE by a net 767, notwithstanding new hires in Bank of Melbourne, IT, Compliance and the operational center in Adelaide. Expense benefits from lower FTE will be seen in 2012. The timing of investment spending also saw much of the costs occurred in the latter months of the year and additional investment was the driver of the expense growth in the half. This included expenses associated with our SIPs program and also with our successful Bank of Melbourne launch.</p>
          <p>Distribution expenses also rose as we expanded our advisor and private banking numbers in BT and increased our presence on the ground in Asia. The chart at the bottom demonstrates the success we've been achieving in reducing our cost run rate over the past three years. Productivity is a key focus for us and we are pleased with the progress we are making.</p>
          <p>Given the three-year anniversary of the merger with St. George and that there will be no further merger integration cost adjustments, it does seem opportune to review the outcome and to look at what we have delivered versus the merger business case. We are a fundamentally different company today in scale, in strength and optionality. And there are all fundamental benefits from the merger. And our acquisition price, post consolidation, at 1.4 times NTA, is at the very low end of all Australian banking transactions.</p>
          <p>Of course, given the dramatic changes in the environment over the past three years, it's not surprising that events have developed in some ways differently than what we assumed at the time of the transaction. For example, we are holding much higher capital than previously and therefore, our share count is higher and asset markets are considerably weaker than we assumed and wealth income has been impacted by that. Having said that, many of the elements of the merger are much better than expected.</p>
          <p>We were ambitious in our goals around customer retention and exceeded even those goals by growing customer numbers rather than seeing defection. Along with better margins, this achieved interest income quite a bit better than expected. And our expense synergies at $413 million were around $50 million per annum better than expected. When looking at additional outcomes, the ledger is overwhelmingly positive. The business options we have now through the comprehensive suite of regional, national and wealth brands, gives us unique scope to target differentiated growth. And that is something we're only beginning to utilize. With our teams in any large merger you expect a degree of disruption and while we were working to minimize that, the outcome of higher employee engagement was much better than we assumed.</p>
          <p>And in IT synergies, it has also been much better than we anticipated. We recognized that St. George had some elements of its technology that was more modern than Westpac, but it's only become clear through the merger that the technology was scalable for the larger organization.</p>
          <p>In summary, the merger has more than covered its cost. But more importantly, it has given us scale opportunities that continue to be capitalized on and has set up the foundation for our strategy to achieve customer focused, multi-brand and efficient growth.</p>
          <p>Turning back to the result and the further improvement in asset quality has been a real feature of this performance. All categories of stressed exposures to TC were down over the year, with the total fallen by another 37 basis points in the second half. The biggest reduction has been in the watch list and substandard portfolio, in our early warning group if you like. However, there has been a steady decline in new and increased impaired assets that have declined over each of the past two halves.</p>
          <p>The commercial property portfolio has been a significant element of the improvement, with the size of the portfolio falling in aggregate along with the stress in the portfolio. The commercial property book represents just 6.5% of the TCE today, some 3.5 percentage points below the peak in December 2008. And stress in this book is now down to 11.7%, which is around a quarter lower than it was just over 12 months ago.</p>
          <p>Essentially quite a bit of focus on the economic overlay component of the collective provision and I've included in this slide the moving parts for the second half. You can see that some of our overlays for natural disasters were reduced, mostly because they weren't required. Offsetting that, we topped back up the overlay for emerging deterioration in economic conditions, especially the higher A dollar impact on tourism, education and the retail sector.</p>
          <p>This year, we've been pleasantly surprised by the mortgage performance. We've always been confident about the mortgage book, but it has ended the year in stronger shape than we anticipated with 30, 60 and 90-day delinquencies all lower over the half. This slide breaks out the delinquency picture on both a product and regional basis. On the product side, the top half of the slide, you can see the delinquencies of key product or customer sets are pretty much all the same, with first homebuyers, owner occupiers and investors all performing in line. There's no evidence that any of these segments are experiencing undue stress.</p>
          <p>The state-by-state picture is a little more diverse but essentially reflects the economic trends in each region. Over the half, improvements were recorded across all regions, although Queensland and Western Australia are still relatively high. In the overall portfolio, as earlier and bigger mortgage vintages season, I wouldn't be surprised to see delinquencies in Australia move higher again. However, security is strong, and losses remain very low at only $44 million for the full year in Australia.</p>
          <p>There's been quite a lot of developments on capital standards here and internationally over the past period. We've had additional clarity as to APRA requirements, including the timing of implementation and there's also more clarity as to the Global Cities category and we don't expect to be affected by that.</p>
          <p>Our current position is clearly strong. We're generating good organic capital from our operations and that's seen our common equity and Tier 1 capital ratios higher over the year by 59 basis points. Our end of year common equity ratio at 8.9% converts to 7.37% under APRA Basel III metrics. And that compares to a minimum required at the beginning of 2013 of 4.5%, or 7% after including the conservation buffer.</p>
          <p>If we want to compare with global peers, we need to fully align with global Basel III standards. We estimate this would add 239 basis points to our common equity ratio and at 9.76%, we're comfortably in the top range of all global banks.</p>
          <p>It's also important to note that we have plenty of unused capacity in our capital ratios, with over $3 billion in hybrid capacity. And there's also a further 30 basis points of tax consolidation benefits yet to flow through. Together, these elements give us almost 150 basis points in additional Tier 1 capital potential.</p>
          <p>That strong capital position, combined with a significant franking balance and supported by good quality financial performance, allowed the directors to declare an $0.80 per share final dividend. Over the full year, dividends at $0.156 per share were higher by 12%. Our payout ratio is somewhat higher, and that reflects our strong capital position and good organic growth, as risk-weighted asset growth is relatively lower at this point in the economic cycle. We continue to focus on lifting our dividend per share payment each half.</p>
          <p>FY '12 is shaping up as another very challenging period for the banking industry globally. Changes to operating models, directly from regulatory and compliance requirements and indirectly from economic conditions, capital markets and sovereign debt workouts are likely to be very material and there are bound to be twists and turns through the year.</p>
          <p>These developments are likely to present opportunities and risks to the Westpac Group. Our management approach is to ensure the Group is strongly positioned to deal with those circumstances, and we will look to maintain a strong balance sheet, capital funding and provisions.</p>
          <p>The momentum we have in our customer businesses across all divisions is pleasing and we would expect that to continue, with balance sheet growth reflecting continuing customer preferences for high savings and perhaps only a modest increase in credit growth. Our Wealth business is well positioned for the changes to that industry that are already emerging. Of course, revenue in any particular period is sensitive to the strength of asset markets.</p>
          <p>Trading results are similarly difficult to predict, but importantly, we remain confident in the quality of our team and the underlying customer driven business. We are stepping up our focus on productivity to help offset the impact of investments and higher amortization and new compliance costs. We aim to continue growing core earnings and our initiatives around expense management are targeted to optimally achieve that.</p>
          <p>Productivity initiatives will also include major changes in our sourcing arrangements, and we expect changes to what we bring in-house, what we outsource domestically and what we outsource internationally. We are actively planning these initiatives now and we are in contract negotiations. We anticipate significant benefits in quality, flexibility and lower unit costs, and they will flow through from 2013. But there are likely to be additional one-off costs in 2012.</p>
          <p>Lastly, the credit quality of our portfolio continues to be a real strength. Whilst it's unlikely that we will have further large reductions in impairment charges, it's important to note that our ratio of impaired assets to gross loans remains the lowest in the sector, while our provision coverage remains around the top, and that's clearly the best way to be.</p>
          <p>With that, let me hand back to Gail.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Phil. What I'd like to now is sum up with a few comments on the Westpac Group's strategy and also talk to some of the measuring sticks that we have with which we'll be using to track our performance.</p>
          <p>Now, as I shared earlier, 2011 marks the end of the first phase of our strategic journey toward becoming a truly customer centric company. At the end of this phase, our strategic position is strong. Today, Westpac is one of the world's leading banks. We're within the top 20 globally and we have an enviable record of earnings consistency and risk management. We've achieved that result while maintaining leadership and sustainability and corporate governance.</p>
          <p>Part of our success can be traced back to the markets in which we operate. Australia is an attractive market for banking and particularly for wealth. The economy's solid fundamentals and links to Asia continue to provide significant opportunities. In addition, the decisions we have made have positioned the Group as a much stronger company for the long term. Indeed, we've emerged from the last four years with a set of capabilities that distinguish us from our peers and set us up well for the period ahead.</p>
          <p>At the top of that capability list is risk management where under virtually any measure, we've outperformed and been a leader globally, whether it be impaired assets, provisioning cover or impairment charges through the cycle, Westpac's performance has been strong. We were one of the safest banks through the last four years and this is a position I am determined to maintain.</p>
          <p>Equally, I am determined to maintain our superior efficiency position. We have an expense to income ratio comfortably below peers and at the leading age of banks globally. We also have specific capabilities that set us up for growth. Our set of distinctive brands across Banking and Wealth is a key differentiator for us, as is our capability and customer relationship management and our ability to link Banking and Wealth at the front line. That's something that banks around world have really struggled to get right and we've made huge progress on that in the last few years.</p>
          <p>I think our success in Super for Life where we achieve over 1,500 sales per week through our branches is a great example of what we're achieving there and yet, we know there's so much more opportunity.</p>
          <p>Finally, we're very well placed in our home markets. With the benefit of the St. George merger, we are number one or number two in most banking markets, with the leadership in wealth and superannuation platforms. We're also the clear leader in institutional banking, including in transactional banking.</p>
          <p>So, on this slide, you can see just a few of the metrics that demonstrate our strong position. On the expense to income ratio, for example, apart from the Chinese banks, we are one of the more efficient banks in the world. And similarly on capital, the bottom left-hand part of the slide, you can see our common equity ratio places us very well relative to others, both locally and in other parts of the world on a like-for-like comparison.</p>
          <p>Before turning to our priorities in the next stage of our strategy implementation, it would be appropriate to say a few words on the operating environment. Clearly, there remain significant challenges in global banking that still have some way to work their way through. In Europe, the resolution of debt issues will take a considerable time. The size of their task is material and is likely to feed through to lower growth in the region for some time to come. With continuing uncertainty and volatility, funding costs are likely to remain elevated.</p>
          <p>For the U.S., a troublesome housing market and the problems in Europe will continue to weigh on confidence, and with the lack of policy flexibility to counter this, there is no quick fix.</p>
          <p>Australia by comparison is well positioned, with strong differences to the U.S. and Europe that will help deliver better growth. These include our stronger economic fundamentals, our monetary and fiscal policy flexibility and a robust mining sector, with a significant committed investment pipeline. Our proximity to the growing emerging markets of Asia is a positive. It will help support our growth profile.</p>
          <p>A further factor in the operating environment is, of course, the raft of regulatory change that is coming our way. And while this is a heavy load, we are as prepared for this as we can possibly be at this time.</p>
          <p>So, let me then turn to my last two slides, which really talk to the next phase of our journey. And I believe it will be an exciting one. And it involves a step-up in our plans. In particular, we're looking to leverage the investments that we've already made, to continue our targeted investment plan and return value to shareholders. The five elements of our approach that I'd like to call out and these next two slides outline what we're planning and how we will measure our progress. The five areas are customer relationships, multi-brand, productivity, people and balance sheet.</p>
          <p>So, on customer relationships, the next phase involves driving hard for further dips and strengths, particularly in deposits, wealth products, payments, transactional banking and trade. Preferred segments are our relationship managed ones, corporate, commercial, agri, SME and affluent. These segments are the value segments and our analysis shows that the deeper the relationship and the longer the relationship, the more revenue we earn and the better credit quality.</p>
          <p>So the measures that we track here include cross-sell, particularly wealth cross-sell, products per customer, especially in customers with four or more products and customer return on credit risk-weighted assets. If you look at our IDP, you'll see the data on cross-sell and on customer return over the past period. They all show improvement corresponding with our earnings improvement.</p>
          <p>The second area of priority is that of leveraging our multi-brand platform. Now, this goes hand-in-hand with the customer relationship priority because through our set of brands, we can appeal to more customers. Again then, the focus is on those preferred segments and we drive our deep relationship agenda.</p>
          <p>So the next phase for us involves further enhancing brand distinctiveness and leveraging the optionality inherent in the model, while obtaining the scale benefits. We'll think through geography-by-geography and segment-by-segment how best to compete and how best to optimize the set of assets that we have. A key metric here will be growth in customer numbers in each of our brands. We'll also be seeking to grow overall deposits above system. In Victoria, with our Bank of Melbourne initiative, I expect both Bank of Melbourne and Westpac to grow their share of footings, so good overall growth for the Group.</p>
          <p>The next area is productivity and we've evidenced good traction here already. This next phase involves following through on existing initiatives such as our SIPs programs, while stepping up with a new emphasis in certain areas. And I'll give two examples. Firstly, in optimizing our multi-brand platform, we're pushing hard to further streamline and standardize all common or shared activities. And we have significant further opportunity here. For example, in mortgages and in business lending, the processes &#x2013; mortgage and business leading processes, also our channel management processes because St. George, Westpac and RAMS all have different processes and systems, which add cost and complexity and even overlap. And what we're going to do is work really hard to significantly streamline this. The other area's that of best sourcing where we plan to make a step change in 2012, bringing to our critical technology applications work, the same rigor, discipline, and cost efficiency that we introduced in the infrastructure space through our new IBM contract.</p>
          <p>So, what do we mean by best sourcing? Well, at its heart, it involves systemically identifying and engaging the most skilled and cost-efficient resources to identify functions or processes, whether they work for us directly or indirectly through one of our local or offshore supplier partnerships. We recognize we will need to invest to achieve an upscaled and well government best sourced environment. But the benefits and efficiency and in the effectiveness will be significant. A critical metric for our productivity agenda is to maintain the lowest expense to income ratio of our peers, and we also ensure we deliver the balance of our SIPs on plan.</p>
          <p>The fourth area is our people agenda, because key to driving customer advocacy and depth of relationship with customers is having engaged and committed people. And key to that is having strong leadership across the organization and aligned values. I believe we've made very good progress here. As I indicated earlier, our People Leader Index operates above global best practice and this is great to see, especially in times of change and in a situation where overall employee numbers are coming down.</p>
          <p>So raising the bar on leadership development and people management, including diversity management, is part of the next phase. What we measure is clear, and we report on this regularly. For example, we look at employee engagement and our People Leadership Index relative to the global high performance norm and the percentage of women in management roles.</p>
          <p>Lastly, balance sheet strengths, as Phil said in his concluding remarks, this is a paramount priority. We have enhanced our asset and liability governance processes across the Group. We've built specific measures on balance sheet management into line leaders' scorecards. In terms of measures, what we want to see that translating into is a higher customer deposit to loan ratio. We also want to retain lowest impairment charges to peers through the cycle, and we want to ensure that our common equity ratio remains at the upper end of the peer group.</p>
          <p>So, in summary, this next phase is an exciting one. We have a strong agenda and we're building on a strong platform. We're a management team that's focused and determined, and we're very clear on our measures of success. And we'll be sharing our progress with your on those measures as we go.</p>
          <p>So, with that, thank you for listening to Phil and I. And we'll be happy to take your questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, James, here. First, James. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's James Freeman from Deutsche Bank. I know it's still early in the process, but I was hoping just to get an idea of the size of the benefits from the new sourcing plans and also the size of the cost that we can expect in the 2012 year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is just too early James to provide that detail. We sought today to give you some flavor of how we're going about that and what we're tackling, but as Phil indicated, we're still in some discussions and contract negotiations with suppliers. But it is a sizeable initiative. We're actually fundamentally changing the business model that we have in technology. So if you think about what we've done in recent times, and you can see our staff numbers in technology through our SIPs have gone up by over 1,000 over the course of the past couple of years. So what we've done there with suppliers is leverage people through our suppliers. We've grown through contractors and people are being brought to bear on our projects through suppliers to actually assist us with our work.</p>
          <p>We're changing that model to actually taking pieces of work. Our functions, application, maintenance functions and other functions and working with suppliers that they own that function. And then we measure and manage them on an outcomes basis. So we can actually get the flexibility and scalability of that scenario and we can reduce our overall fixed costs. We'll also get innovation and we get the value-add that suppliers bring in those dedicated areas.</p>
          <p>So it is quite a significant change to our operating model. And, as Phil indicated, has some upfront setup costs because one of the things we do is we build out very clearly the processes that we're handing over, so that they're documented and clear. At the moment, a lot of processes sit in the heads of individuals who have been in our organization for a long period of time. We now take the time to document them really clearly. So that as we hand that work over to the supplier, they have those processes and they then work to improve them and maximize the efficiency out of that process.</p>
          <p>So you can expect sizable benefits, but there are some upfront costs. We'll be clearer on that during the half half.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Just quickly, Phil, the accounting for the one-off cost, is that going to go below the line and capitalized? What's the planning for that, above the line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're still working that through, James. I mean if you look at the results this year, where we've taken restructuring charges that are part of our ongoing business, we've taken them above the line. I think this year we had about $19 million of costs that we've absorbed which are part of that. We'll look at applying our accounting principles consistently as what we've done always and we'll look at that when we get to that point.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Jon Mott from UBS. Just a question on phase two of the strategy, which you outlined at the end of the presentation on the multi-brand and the other parts of it. Just want to get a bit more color around it. Firstly, how long do you think it's going to take to roll out this next part of the strategy? You said phase one was around three years. How long does it go? Does this roll into project 2017, which has been mentioned on and off for about the last few years now anyway, so can you put those two together? And also, do you intend to see this project through yourself?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Thank you. Certainly, the first phase was three years, I'd envisage this phase will be pretty much three years too. Hard to say, but that's the way we're shaping it up. So, three years is a manageable period of time. You can put your arms around it. You can plan out three years. Our business planning cycle is typically a three-year cycle. So you can put your arms around it. So, first phase, three years. This next phase, pretty much three years. It's absolutely part of the 2017 work. So, that would be another three years. So 2014 to 2017 would be another three years.</p>
          <p>As for me, as you heard me say earlier on, I'm very excited about this next phase. So absolutely committed to leading the organization through this next phase. The first phase has been jolly hard work. It's been rewarding work. I think we've developed a solid platform. Not for a second, and I'm not thinking the next phase will be jolly hard work too, but we'll be able to see the benefits coming through even more strongly.</p>

          <p>Hi. Jarrod Martin from Credit Suisse. I notice that you're looking to issue new shares for satisfying your DRP. Is there any thought being given now that you have more clarity around the capital position to actually neutralize that type of dilution and how that goes into some of your comments about managing growth and returns?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we had that discussion...</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With our directors at every half, Jarrod, and it's quite interesting the feedback we get. At the end of the day, one of the other factors that we have is it's part of our overall capital base is a very strong franking surplus. And what we've elected to do over the last few halves is to use the opportunity of keeping the dividend up a little higher through that issuance of our DRP, which will allows us to return those franking credits at a faster pace than would happen otherwise. And so that's been the balance that we've been trying to achieve. We look to make sure that we don't offer that DRP with a discount, so that it's not as if we're disadvantaging existing shareholders by selling shares cheaply. And we're looking to kind of get that balance right. And so that's always in the mix and that's how we're going to begin this half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couldn't you still have the high dividend payout but instead of actually issuing shares to have capital to buy them on market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You could, you'd just have a lot of capital ratio. So the last thing you're trying to do is make sure that your capital ratio also achieves that strength that you're trying achieve.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're still in that stage of the cycle where we prefer to do it this way and use it to help grow the capital, so it's just a stage of the cycle piece as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Ben Koo from Goldman Sachs. Just another question back on the costs side, and one of the slides where you just talk about the benefits that you've had from the synergy benefits, and also there's the productivity benefits this year. If you sort of take those, add those back on and just think about the underlying level of cost growth for the year, excluding those benefits and I know there's some areas, there's project spend that you might have done otherwise, but it looks like the underlying level of growth rate and your costs is around 6%. And I'm just trying to get a sense as we look forward and you say that we are going to a low growth environment, but you've also got a 2% headwind from the capitalized expenses this coming year in terms of the amortization effect of that on your cost base. So I'm just trying to get sense of what's the underlying level of cost growth that you're managing to, then you've got some productivity benefits, which sound like they're more fiscal '13 benefits as opposed to fiscal '12.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So look, I think it's a bit harsh to sort of say, well if I don't look at your productivity benefits, your cost rate is higher because part of what we do through that whole productivity exercise is look to manage our costs. And we're firmly of the belief that right now is the time when you can't afford to have inefficient costs in the company and you should be looking to do everything that you can to reduce that. And so, I think, you need to look at the whole picture of our cost base over the year to try to look at what does it mean for 2012. So you should say, okay over 2011, they achieved a 1.9% expense rate, we know that there's some additional amortization costs coming through, but we also know they're looking to try to get additional productivity saves. And all of those factors will be what that drives our expense growth rate next year.</p>
          <p>The other thing that I called out because people talk to jaws all the time and I just think that the problem with jaws is that if you've got a very low cost to income ratio, you're actually looking to try to get as much revenue growth as you possibly can because that's what is going to give your highest core earnings. And so that's why we've been focusing around well what's the opportunity that we have to grow our core earnings and then how do we best achieve that.</p>
          <p>And so we hadn't shied away from investment. So, you've seen us invest in advisors and planners because we think that's the way to grow in wealth. We haven't shied away of putting people on the ground in Asia because we think that there are growth opportunities there. We've put people into Bank of Melbourne and other distribution areas because we think we can get revenue growth that way. So all of that is around yes, we are prepared to invest, but we're looking very carefully about how do we do that in a way that optimizes our core earnings. So I know that's a long-winded answer and I know there are people in the audience who'd like us to come out with an expense target, for example. I think the problem with that is, that it actually potentially limits what opportunities that you have to grow. And we're not prepared to do that at this stage.</p>

          <p>Victor German from Nomura. My question relates to funding. If I look at your government guaranteed debt which is maturing over the next two years, it adds up to just over $20 billion. Would you be able to just highlight to us what your expectations, in terms of wholesale funding, given that the markets are still remaining somewhat challenging? How the covered bonds are fitting into that picture and also what the margin impact is going to be?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me kick off and then Phil can pick up, we've probably got Curt here somewhere too, as well. We raised this year, as you would have seen, $25 billion. So our ask for next year isn't &#x2013; in terms of a dealing to the maturity profile of our term debt, it's pretty much the same, it's about $20 billion, $26 billion next year. Now, we're raising very strong retail deposits, so that's the extent to which we're able to raise really strong retail deposits, so we need to do less in the term markets. Over this year, we raised $30 billion in retail deposits and lent out $19 billion, so well more than covered the requirements for our loan growth. So, we'd expect to continue to grow really strong retail deposits over the next period.</p>
          <p>That means that, over the entire course of the volatility in August and September, we've really effectively sat outside of the European and U.S. markets and not needed to issue at all. And that's, of course, assisted us in our margin management towards the latter end of this year.</p>
          <p>We've also got very strong liquid assets, as you will have seen, sitting at over $100 billion, so, if we needed to, we could actually not do any term funding at all over the whole course of next year, if we needed to. Now, we don't think that that's going to be the situation and then your question around covered bonds comes in. Clearly, that's additional diversification of funding for us. We'll be out there, you'd expect, in the first quarter of this year. We've got capacity for &#x2013; well, it's up to 8%, is it?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Of our lending balances. So, that will be a further element of cost management for us, because it should come in at a better price than term funding. So it's just part of the mix for us. Phil, do you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think the only thing &#x2013; covered bonds might make up about a quarter of what we're looking to do over the next few years, sort of, in that order of magnitude. One of the great things about covered bonds is that it's continued to be a market that has functioned at a time when the unsecured lending market has been unsettled by what's been going on in Europe. And so that is a really helpful element for us.</p>
          <p>In terms of what it means for margin, obviously, covered bonds will be cheaper than unsecured. But what does the unsecured term borrowing come in at? It's a difficult one to determine. If you look at my credit default swap margin, or price as an indicator of that, it's been in the 70 basis point range in the last two weeks. So I think we'd be brave to be trying to tell you where that is. Overall, do we think wholesale funding costs are going to increase? Yes. And, therefore, we have to manage the margin impact of that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks very much and good afternoon. After the third quarter, you expressed confidence that NIMs were likely to strengthen and you sort of painted the picture in your slides today of an interest margin which is strengthening half-on-half. But just taking on your recent comments on wholesale funding costs likely to remain elevated, the fact that NIMs probably dropped a little in the fourth quarter, and that interest rates have now fallen in terms of cash rates in Australia and you've passed through the full extent of the drop. Can you talk about your net interest margin outlook for 2012?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Craig. We've worked really hard this year to manage the margins. So to manage the various levers we have of volumes and margins across the portfolio, and I think we've actually done that pretty well. And you'd expect us to work really hard on that mixture as well. As you say, there are a number of moving pieces on margins. There's some elements that actually should assist us with our margin management. There's still some repricing to be done on business, both here and with St. George's, as well as with Westpac. And in New Zealand, there's still some rollover of that fixed-term lending into the variable product. So there's some benefit that will come through there.</p>
          <p>A lot will depend on what actually happens in wholesale markets, as we've just discussed and what actually happens to the cost of raising money there. And then, of course, in the deposit side as well. But we don't want to give guidance, particularly on margins, other than we're going to continue to manage these various levers really quite tightly, and seek to avoid any significant deterioration or change.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. My question related to your target to improve the customer return on credit risk-weighted assets on Page 28. Just interested in the drivers there, given the 4.02% you have today is very high globally. I'm just interested whether you see that purely from positive jaws over that time period going forward, or whether you see that metric more from business mix changes, or further optimization of the risk-weighted asset base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me talk about setting up the metric first, and then Phil can talk a little bit more about the drivers going forward. We sat down and thought, we're measuring a lot of the indicators of depth of product relationship, customers with four or more products, the wealth cross-sell and all of those. They should come together into a high level of customer return over credit risk-weighted assets.</p>
          <p>So we wanted to set that up really clearly internally, and we'll report it externally, but this is an internal measure for us, to actually drive our people on the right outcomes. So it's not about cross-sell for cross-sell's sake. It's about cross-sell of the right products to the right customers in the right segments with the best value, leveraging the wealth elements of that, because the wealth element, of course, is not balance sheet intensive, to actually drive a better return.</p>
          <p>Now we exclude trading and treasury income from that metric, because that doesn't directly connect to the customer. So we've set it up internally in order to get a razor sharp look at the strategy and how that translates into better returns flowing through the bottom-line outcome. So that's the metric and its construct. Phil, I don't know if you want to talk to its current position and trends.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think, just to add to what Gail said, we should be able to drive a better outcome in that measure if our cross-sell is effective. If we utilize the relationship we might have with a customer through a loan to sell other things that are less capital-intensive, like wealth, like transactional to that customer, that'll lead to the improvement in the return. And if we use the balance sheet in a smart way, that'll also help to ensure that we don't have a growth in credit risk-weighted assets that's not being justified. So that's both in terms of who the customers are and, therefore, what the kind of credit weighting of them is over time, but also, just what's the mix of business that we do with that customer.</p>
          <p>And so it seemed to us, as Gail said, that it absolutely fits fair and square with our strategy. If we hang it out there, then it sort of forces us to be clear around, are we executing against our strategy or not.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike Wiblin from Macquarie. Just a question on the liquid assets. Can you just comment maybe, Phil, just on the level of margin drag, because obviously, that's picked up quite a lot? You talked a bit about volatility in that number as well, so what would have you holding more or less? And then, how that maybe fits with the LCR? I guess it's on the way down from APRA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So the margin drag for us was about a basis point over the course of the year. In part, that was because we had quite an uplift in those liquid assets towards the end of the year. In terms of what the volatility is, the biggest part of that volatility is our collateral balances. And that tends to be driven by the currency more than anything else, and we had a 10% drop in the A dollar, kind of in the last few weeks of the half, and that really played through. If you looked at our liquid assets today, there are somewhere between 95 and 100. So they've come down as those collateral balances have also been kind of more regularized, if you like.</p>
          <p>I think that that margin drag is going to be something that we just have to recognize as part of what we do. We'll have a better idea on what that might be when we get the rules from APRA, which we expect in the next few weeks actually, as to how the liquidity standards will play their way out, what proportion of our liquids we have to hold in that kind of highest quality component of liquids. And that'll determine both, do we think we're right now, or do we need more to do, and what the margin drag might be.</p>
          <p>Obviously, the margin impact will also be affected by what the arrangements are with the reserve bank, which is kind of the buffer for achieving the overall liquidity requirements and we neither know what the cost of that is, nor how much we can use. So, that's more information that we'll have in the next few weeks as well, Mike.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Richard Wiles from Morgan Stanley. In Westpac RBB and St. George, you've had a pleasing recovery in core profit in each of the last three halves after a tough first half '10. However, this year, you've certainly had some benefit from the standard variable rate rise that you put through in November last year. And, arguably, in the last half, you've had an improvement in the cost of deposit funding via less competition. So my question is, do you think that you can maintain that sort of pre-provision profit momentum in those two franchises going into 2012? And, if so, what are the factors that you think will kick in in 2012, if you don't do another home loan rate rise and if wholesale funding costs continue to go up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Richard. Look, that's a great question. Absolutely, we believe we can continue the momentum, and let's look at each one. In St. George's case, it's really been a steady program of repositioning the Group. St. George's have indicated being the primary brand New South Wales, BankSA, now Bank of Melbourne. So, absolutely, they've had a tough time and even in the first-half of this year, the second-half you've seen a substantial pickup from there. So there's an inherent momentum in the business that's underway.</p>
          <p>With that, the critical element of that is growing more customers. So it starts with growing more customers and then the depth of relationship with those customers and the wealth cross-sell to those customers. So that's an absolutely key component of the additional momentum that we'd except to get in St. George.</p>
          <p>Bank of Melbourne, I'll have more to say about Bank of Melbourne when we come to the first-half, but we're literally doubling the volume that we would have done a year ago in Bank of Melbourne. Very strong growth in footings through deposits in particular, because there's a bit of a lag coming through with mortgages.</p>
          <p>Overall, from a system growth point of view next year, we'd expect to see a high level of system growth too. So this year, system growth &#x2013; credit growth overall was about 3%, with mortgage growth being around 5.5%. Next year, we'd expect to see credit growth coming in closer to 5%, with mortgages being 6% and business credit picking up to around 4%.</p>
          <p>So both Westpac and St. George should benefit from those stronger levels of growth, and we'd expect both of those franchises to grow at or around system growth in lending. St. George, I need to qualify that, in its core geographies. So St. George in New South Wales and South Australia; Westpac, you'd expect to see that in a more national basis.</p>
          <p>Now critically to that, there is growing deposits above system, so deposits above system and then lending growth at or around system. Remember, we're very focused on driving for overall balance sheet strength and improving our deposit to loan ratio. So, that's the key driver of momentum. Then there's the depth of growing customer numbers, the depth of relationship in the wealth cross-sell. So those are elements that are the underpinning momentum which will carry through to next year.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> Ben Zuga from CBA (1:09:13). Just a question around funding and deposits in particular. Gail, you talked a lot about deposit growth. And you've actually got a good level of customer deposits to loans at the moment. But you're still clearly emphasizing a need to build that up further. I guess I'm just trying to understand the extent to which you think you need to get that to, and the pace. And then likewise on the other side, I suppose related to that, is the strength of credit growth. You've commented about subdued credit growth, business and consumer. Maybe could you just talk a bit to how you're thinking the credit growth landscape may sort of play out, or what you're preparing for, I suppose, business to consumer, within that subdued outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well as you've just heard me mention to Richard in the earlier question on the credit growth side, I think next year we'll have a high level of credit growth than we've just come through. Clearly, it'll be interesting to see what level of confidence materializes as a consequence of the 25 basis point reduction in interest rates that we've just had. Personally, I think, it'll take a little more than one 25 basis point reduction to see a material lift in demand. And I think we'll also need to see less uncertainty in Europe. We'll need to see a little bit of a clearer path to the issues in Europe before we see a material pickup in demand here.</p>
          <p>Having said that, our current forecast is that we'd have credit growth of around 5%, with housing 6% and business credit picking up at around 4%. We have seen some pickup in SME growth over more recent time, but it's still quite hard yards, and don't want to claim that those elusive pipelines are actually coming through. So, it's still quite hard yards, but we'd expect to see a higher level of credit growth there.</p>
          <p>The other question was on the deposits side. Look, deposits are something I've been working on ever since I've been in the Group, which is to really try and pick up the ante with regard to a capability in our front line of growing deposits. The multi-brand platform should assist us with this: having people in the frontline, talking to customers, driving the relationship with a specific focus on raising deposits. I've been pleased with progress we've made this year, although there's more to go.</p>
          <p>We're not happy with the current ratios that we have. We have improved them from what was 55% to 59%, to now 63% deposit to loan, but we think we need to get that higher. Now, that'll be staged and managed, and we're going to manage that in line with growing lending at a reasonable approach as well. So, it's a balanced approach. I don't want to put a particular target out there. We have them in our own business units, but we're going to manage it at our portfolio effect. But we want to see a steady improvement in that ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just maybe lastly to that, do your plans for deposit growth at all constrain your pricing flexibility, I suppose, in the deposit space, in terms of your resolve to get those deposit growth levels higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's going to be a managed, sensible approach. You've seen the way we've done that with our margin this year, and margins have been stable year-on-year and there's been some increase, if you just look at the customer-related margin and exclude the Treasury and Markets business.</p>
          <p>So we're going to manage our margin really, really tightly. We think, because we've got strong regional brands and a strong national brand, with bank managers and a strong local footprint, that we can actually raise everyday deposits and get more than our fair share of the everyday deposit raising. So we'll also be going to those segments and prioritizing those segments that are most deposit rich: self-retirees, the affluent segment, the SME segment. So particular focus on particular segments that we best think will support our strategy.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Scott Manning from JPMorgan. Two slightly different questions. Firstly, just on the term deposits, market pricing would indicate that the cost of six month TDs came down and the cost of three month TDs went up around August and September, when the expectations of those cash rate reductions came through, obviously, trying to incentivize the shortening of the duration of the term deposit book. So those deposits that you did raise through the term markets towards the end of the year, what was the average duration of those? And, therefore, is there a bit of margin headwind that we can expect next half?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on the funding side, why the sudden attraction on the loan-to-deposit ratio when the story over the last two years has been really focused around the net stable funding ratio, of which the deposits have simply been a part of?</p>
          <p>And the second question is, does the APRA push towards living wills and the extra requirements there inhibit, in any way, the push toward some offshoring?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you want me to have a go? Well look, I don't know the average duration, Scott. I don't think it was particularly different at the end of the period compared to prior months. I can look into it for you, but it doesn't &#x2013; nothing came across my desk that suddenly said, gee, we're doing something shorter or longer, particularly, in that area. And the behavioral maturities of our term deposit has continued to be as long as they have ever been. So that makes me think that that's probably not going to be the issue that potentially you're worried about. Look, I think stable funding is still an important metric, so if we've given the impression that we've forgotten about it, that's not right.</p>
          <p>We know that there's an additional longer term funding prudential measure that's coming down the pike at us. What it's going to be eventually, still got work to do. But we do look, obviously, at stable forms of funding and also markets for long-term borrowing. And we talked about covered bonds are clearly part of the answer there. It's just that there's an opportunity for us that's totally consistent with the strategy that Gail's been talking about, to utilize our distribution forces better to help us raise one form of stable funding, which is deposits.</p>
          <p>In terms of the living wills, that's a good argument, or good question. We're really working our way through what that's going to mean. We're quite a long way, I think, from being in a position to know exactly how that will affect us, in terms of organizational structure and legal structure. At this stage, it doesn't feel like it's going to prevent us from doing things in terms of outsourcing domestically or offshore. And that's not been the feedback that we've had from global banks, and we've been talking to them about this in the last few months as well.</p>

          <p>Brett Le Mesurier from BBY. A question on the divisional ROEs. They're increasing, but the Group ROE is not increasing, and it seems to be caused by an increase in the amount of capital that is not allocated to the divisions. It's increased over the last couple of years from 30% to 40%, which basically means that your increased capital ratios are being pushed out to the divisions. If they were pushed out to the divisions, may we not get a bit of Group ROE outcome, and can you comment on why you take that approach?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We absolutely agree with you, Brett, in terms of wanting to ensure that the economic capital model is actually effective in operating, and that economic capital is allocated out to the divisions. It's difficult when the model that we were working with throughout Basel II has been sort of overwhelmed by the prudential requirements to hold more and more capital, that actually don't necessarily fit with the economic capital model that we are operating with. We're looking right now at saying, if we change the sort of statistical degrees of probability in that overall model, could that lead us to a more aligned economic capital model and regulatory capital model. That's something we'd like to do and you'll see if we do that, that economic capital then lists in the divisions and reduces in the Group, and we get a better picture of where ROE is being generated, because we think that's important as well. So we agree with you.</p>

          <p>Yeah, we're pretty happy with it. We're not looking for it to shrink more, but as you can expect, as you've got still a number of commercial properties in a stressed scenario, that takes a while to run off. But we're pretty happy with the percentage that we've got at the moment and wouldn't be seeking to have it fall further. Now, it may fall further in the short run while we're still working through stressed exposures that are property stressed exposures, but from a strategic point of view, we're not looking to have it fall further.</p>
