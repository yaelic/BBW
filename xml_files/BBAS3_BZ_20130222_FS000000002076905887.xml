        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Thank you for participating in Banco do Brasil's earnings conference. Starting this presentation on page three, we have some highlights of Banco do Brasil's performance. The adjusted net income for the full year at R$11.5 billion, the loan portfolio growing at 24.9% in 12 months, the NPL at 2.05% so the lowest in the banking industry. And also, a highlight of diversification in funding sources that enable business expansion with the highlights on the LCA and on foreign borrowing.</p>
          <p>Moving to page four, we highlight the growth in NII. On the year-over-year comparison, we have NII growing at 12%. We also highlight a growth in fee income that follows our overall business expansion. A reduction in Previ, Previ specifically on the first half had revenues of R$130 million per month, on the second half of R$96 million per month. Even with this reduction on the Previ items, Banco do Brasil was able to boast an impressive net income.</p>
          <p>In terms of operating expenses, we have a 13.9% growth in admin expenses and a growth in allowance for loan losses that was in line with the growth in the credit portfolio. The adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was at R$3.18 billion.</p>
          <p>On page five, we have a breakdown of sources and uses. Total sources at Banco do Brasil grew 19.8% on the last 12 months. We present the concept of commercial funding and that includes total deposits, Agribusiness Letters of Credit, Real Estate Letters of Credit, and repos with corporate bonds. This total amount grew by 14.5% over the past 12 months with a highlight on LCA, the Agribusiness Letters of Credit. The majority of these resources is invested on the loan portfolio, the net loan portfolio which represent 78.1% of the total investment of resources.</p>
          <p>Moving to page six, we have a breakdown of Banco do Brasil's NII. Starting on the graph on the upper right-hand corner, we have a reduction in spread in the different credit segments. However, the overall NIM for Banco do Brasil on the graph on the upper left-hand side presented a slight gain on the fourth quarter at 5.1%.</p>
          <p>If we look at the breakdown on NII, we see that NII grew because of the overall volume of earning assets at Banco do Brasil mainly credits. Also, we had an improvement in funding expenses related to a strategy to migrate from time deposits to LCAs. We also see a stability on the item of credit recovery. This item had some seasonality. But within the seasonality, it's a stable item.</p>
          <p>And the treasury income that shows a slight decrease and that's because we had a reduction in some reserve requirements. These resources that were released were invested in credit and generated credit revenues.</p>
          <p>On page seven of this presentation, we have Banco do Brasil's loan portfolio. This portfolio grew by 24.9% over the past 12 months. The agribusiness book grew by 20.8%. This is the segment with the lowest delinquency ratio across the different portfolios at Banco do Brasil. The main portfolios of Banco do Brasil mainly agro, individuals and companies. The portfolio with individuals grew by 16.3%. However, we will show you a slide with the organic growth which was greater than that and the portfolio with companies that grew by 30.3%.</p>
          <p>On the next page, we see the organic portfolio with individuals. This portfolio excludes the proportion or consolidation of Banco Votorantim and also the acquisition of portfolios from other banks. We can see that in this context, the portfolio grew by 25.9%. And we also highlight the growth in payroll, auto loans and mortgage credit. Specific in mortgage credit with individuals, Banco do Brasil is now the fourth in the lead table amongst the domestic banks.</p>
          <p>And we also highlight that the first four items on this table mainly payroll, salary loans, auto loans and mortgage credit, all of them high credit quality segments represent 74.1% of Banco do Brasil's organic portfolio with individuals.</p>
          <p>On page nine of this presentation, we have a breakdown of the loans to companies. This growth was fueled by an expansion with both small to mid-sized companies, but most importantly with large size operations.</p>
          <p>On page 10, we show you a growth in agribusiness portfolio. Banco do Brasil has a very dominant position on this segment. This portfolio grew by 20.8% over the last 12 months, specifically 37.2% with mid-sized and large-sized rural producers. This portfolio, again, has very low integration fees and with a slight increase which is completely normal on this fourth quarter. It is at historically low level.</p>
          <p>On page 11, we show you the delinquency ratios and coverage ratios of Banco do Brasil. On the dark blue lines in our left, we see that Banco do Brasil posted an improvement on the fourth quarter. On the yellow line, we see the same thing. The yellow line excludes the proportion of consolidation of Banco Votorantim. When we look at the graph on our right, we see that at 196.5%, Banco do Brasil is considerably above what we see in terms of coverage ratio in the industry. Banco do Brasil has the best coverage ratio amongst the large banks in the country.</p>
          <p>On page 12, we have a view of delinquency per segment and we see improvement in the individuals' portfolio, in the portfolio with companies, and the slight increase in agribusiness as we discussed, which is completely normal.</p>
          <p>On page 13, we see a substantial decrease on the delinquency on the auto loan portfolio at Banco Votorantim. And on page 14, we have other data related to Banco Votorantim. Specifically on the first graph on the upper left-hand side of the slide, we see that the most recent vintages are gaining participation in the overall balance of auto loans at Banco Votorantim.</p>
          <p>On the graph on the upper right-hand of the slide, we see the substantial decrease in credit provision expenses at the auto loan book of Banco Votorantim. If we compare the peak of those provisions which happened on the first quarter of 2012 with what we saw on the fourth quarter, we see a 40.3% reduction. If we look at the full year of 2012, our projections for 2013 on this specific item is of a reduction of above 40%.</p>
          <p>On the graph on the lower left-hand side, we see an improvement on NPL plus 90 days. And on the graph on the lower right-hand side, we see the gradual improvement on the overall credit provision expenses at Banco Votorantim.</p>
          <p>On page 15, we show you our admin expenses. The growth that we saw on personnel expenses on the fourth quarter was related to the wages increase that the banks negotiated with the bank union. And on page 16, we adjust the administrative growth by some events that were present throughout 2012 but that impacted only half of 2011. With this adjustment, we see a 10.1% growth in admin expenses.</p>
          <p>On page 17, we have Banco do Brasil's cost-to-income ratio. We highlight that even with a lower contribution of operating item, Banco do Brasil is posting an improvement on its cost-to-income ratio.</p>
          <p>On page 18, we see Banco do Brasil's BIS ratio at 14.8% at the end of 2012. We highlight that in January of this year, Banco do Brasil issued subordinated <mark type="indiscernible" /> (10:57), the financial letters in the amount of R$ 5.2 billion and also a hybrid that was distributed globally in the amount of $2 billion. These instruments, once approved by the Brazilian Central Bank, will add 128 basis points to Banco do Brasil's BIS ratio.</p>
          <p>On page 19, we see Banco do Brasil's performance and compare that to the guidance that we had for the year. So ROE was within the guidance. The growth in NII was also within the guidance. The total deposits growth was below the guidance. But as we have discussed, if we were to look at the commercial funding item, if we were to expand the total deposit concept to include both LCAs, LCIs and also the repos with corporate bonds, this item will be growing by 14.5%. You will note that for 2013 when we present you the guidance, we are already changing from total deposits to commercial funding.</p>
          <p>The domestic loan portfolio grew above the guidance. The loans with individuals a little below the guidance against the comment that the organic loan growth grew considerably above that. Loans to companies surpassed the guidance and loans to agribusiness also outperformed the guidance. When we look at the relationship of credit provision expenses to the loan portfolio, we were within the guidance at 3.2%. Fee income grew within the guidance range. Admin expenses, we already saw a slide about that, was above the guidance range and the tax rate was a little below the guidance range.</p>
          <p>On page 20, we show you the guidance for 2013. The guidance for ROE is between 14% and 17%. The guidance for NII growth is between and 7% and 10%. The guidance for commercial funding growth between 15% and 19%. The domestic loan portfolio between 16% and 20%. And the breakdown is individuals 18% to 22%, companies 16% to 20%, agribusiness 13% to 17%.</p>
          <p>We are presenting a slight reduction on the range of credit provision expenses to loan portfolio. This metric was between 3.1% and 3.5% in 2012. And the projection for this year is between 3% and 3.4%. The growth in fee income between 10% and 14% and admin expenses growth between 7% and 10%.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. And let's now open the Q&amp;A session please.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Mr. Marcelo Telles from Credit Suisse would like to make a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the opportunity. I have two questions. The first one is kind of a more specific question. What is the &#x2013; I mean, there was a big decline in legal provisions in the quarter. I know this is not part of your core OpEx guidance. So what can we expect in terms of the line going forward? And exactly what happened there to explain such decline? And the other question is on your 14% to 17% ROE guidance. I understand Previ is not including there because of the accounting change, correct? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marcelo, this is Gustavo. Thank you for your question. Starting by the first question on the legal item, the issue with the legal item is that following that quarterly is probably not the best way to look at this item. You'll see that there is some volatility on this item. Some events depend on some Court decisions. So it is very hard to project a quarterly number. So we at Banco do Brasil usually look at the 12-month figure. So a decline or increase that you see on a given quarter is not an indication of a trend or anything of that nature.</p>
          <p>And when we talk about ROE, what's on the radar is a continued trend of this lower interest rate scenario that we saw this year. So some of this impact were already on the performance of this year. The rates are now at the level that we understand that they should be. And also, a continuation of what we saw this year of the decrease in interest rate in the banking industry because of the reduction of the basic interest rate <mark type="indiscernible" /> (16:20).</p>
          <p>About Previ, just to give you the full view of how we look at Previ in terms of ROE. The Previ revenue was included on the ROE number for 2012. And if there is a revenue or an expense at Previ, it will be included on the ROE. However, if there is a shareholders' equity adjustment related to Previ, we will exclude that from the calculation of ROE. So what goes to the P&amp;L counts toward ROE, while increases or decreases to the shareholders' equity will be isolated when we present you the calculation of the ROE for guidance purposes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. Thank you, Gustavo. Just one additional question that I'd like to ask. I mean, there were higher equalization revenues in the quarter, I mean roughly R$200 million. Is this is &#x2013; now, I think you probably have close to R$1 billion in the quarter. I mean, what is the level that we should see as sustainable in 2013 you think that's more or less the level we should see going forward because of the size of the portfolio? Or should go back to the R$800 million quarterly average? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marcelo, if you look at this increase that you mentioned in equalization revenues in the quarter was around 25%. If you go and look at the breakdown of the growth that we saw in the agribusiness portfolio, you'll see that the, let's call it equalizable resources, the resources that are eligible for equalization, they grew by 22%. So this growth in equalization revenues was completely in line with the growth of the disbursement that are equalizable, if the term even exists.</p>
          <p>But for 2013, the best metric that we can present to you for equalization revenues is the growth that we project for the agribusiness book. We don't project inside of this growth what is equalizable and what isn't. So I understand that this may be hard to project. But the best projection that I can give you in terms of the agri book is the guidance for the agri book growth which is between 13% and 17% for 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful. Thank you so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marcelo.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Carlos Macedo from Goldman Sachs would like to make a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Gustavo, Ivan. Actually a couple of questions. One is a follow up on Marcelo's question regarding the Previ treatment. Just to make it clear, so now on a quarterly basis where you continue to have the monthly accrual of the benefit from Previ and flowing through your income statement and then be also on the same thing, will you have the mark-to-market every six months? My understanding from the notes in your financial statement was that in both situations, you would not have that any more. And then I'll ask my second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the question, Carlos. So about Previ, let me just go back to the explanation on ROE, okay? So if there are items that go through the P&amp;L and they could be revenues or expenses related to any type of adjustment, they would impact ROE. However, if we do what you were referring as mark-to-market, if we do an adjustment in our shareholders' equity position, that will be isolated for ROE calculations for guidance purposes.</p>
          <p>Now, let me talk a little bit about CPC 33, which is what is changing the rule related to the accounting of the actuarial assets. Before the enactment of CPC 33, you had the semi-annual confrontation of the present value of Previ's assets with the present value &#x2013; I'm sorry, of the fair value of Previ's assets with the present value of Previ actuarial liabilities. So if the result of this confrontation exceeded what was the corridor method, you would have something flowing through the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, we had that monthly accrual effect that on the first half of 2012 was in the magnitude of R$130 million and on the second half was at R$96 million. With CPC 33, the new rule, this changes. However, this rule was approved by the CVM, the Brazilian SEC as you know, but wasn't approved by the Central Bank yet.</p>
          <p>So we are already consulting with the Central Bank to understand how we will do the accounting procedures related to that. According to our understanding at this moment, and this may change depending on the final interpretation by the Central Bank, we are not foreseeing the accrual items that you were mentioning for 2013. This interpretation may change once we see the final regulation from the Central Bank. Was that clear, Carlos?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So just going back to your slide four, you have R$1.35 billion in Previ revenues. That would not &#x2013; your interpretation right now is that that would not be present in 2013? Well, whatever magnitude it ends up being, but that line would not be there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But the semi-annual adjustment to fair value would flow through only your equity or would it flow through you income statement as well as you guys have used to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I also have to say this comment that it's no &#x2013; according to our current interpretation and that's pending on final rules, yes. Most of the impact would flow through shareholders' equity and not through P&amp;L anymore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, perfect. Now for the second &#x2013; thanks, Gustavo. For the second question, would &#x2013; Banco do Brasil had very substantial growth in the fourth quarter whereas peers didn't have anywhere near that kind of growth. Going into next year, your guidance is 16% to 20% loan growth for the domestic book, whereas most of your private sector peers are around roughly 5 percentage points below that.</p>
          <p>I was just wondering what do your credit scoring models now tell you about the appetite for credit and the credit worthiness of the Brazilian consumer and small and medium company, given that you seem to have a guidance that indicates that you will once again gain market share in 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Carlos. We didn't expect to gain market share because we didn't have a specific target for that. We believe that we have a very good environment there, much better than 2012 and 2013. You see the forecast for the GDP growth. That's why you know that our activity in our business model is always <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:35) in Brazil <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:37) globally.</p>
          <p>That's why we feel comfortable that it could be a better year for the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:43) to do business for <mark type="ph" /> the firms (23:44) and everybody. That's right. We believe that there are some specific movements. I can tell you about the real estate business. I can tell you about the infrastructure.</p>
          <p>But again, you see the same targets for the risk, the same movement that we have that we are doing in the last five years we focus on. For example, on the individuals, we focus on payroll, car finance, real estate, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (24:11). We'll do the same. That's why I believe that we saw all the information that we had now that the guidance, it's the best information that we can give now to the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Ivan. Just one question. Just what's the outlook you have for GDP growth in 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>3%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Would a lower GDP growth have a bigger impact on loan growth or on asset quality for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In my opinion, not in asset quality because we have focused on the lines that I mentioned before. But GDP growth is a very important metric for us, especially for example for the investment, for the infrastructure. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (24:56) to feel comfortable to invest. That's why it's so important for us. If we didn't do this, you'll see that the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:03) growth <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:04) would be lower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Ivan. Thank you, Gustavo.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Mr. Mario Pierry from Deutsche Bank would like to make a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Let me ask you two questions as well. The first one is on Banco Votorantim. You're showing that Votorantim continues to show losses even though they're diminishing. In previous calls, you had talked about Votorantim breaking even in the first half of 2013. I was wondering if you still expect that will happen.</p>
          <p>Also on Votorantim, we're seeing the Tier 1 ratio of 9.3%. How comfortable are you with this level? Because last time you did a capital increase at Votorantim, the Tier 1 was at 8.7%. So I was wondering if you see the need to make another capital increase at Votorantim in the short-term.</p>
          <p>The second question is related to your slide on page six. You are showing that your spread for pretty much all your loan portfolios have been declining now for two consecutive quarters. I was wondering what is your expectations for spreads going forward. And in particular, one number here that surprised me is the sharp drop in corporate spreads. I was wondering if this drop was related to a change in mix, you focusing more on large corporates rather than SMEs. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mario, I'm going to start with the last question, the question on spreads. We don't make projections about this item. But what you see here in terms of reduction in the fourth quarter is a consequence of what we saw throughout the year of a lower interest rate environment because of the lower <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:08) rates. You are right. What you saw in terms of reduction of corporate spread is related to a specific growth that we saw on the fourth quarter in a segment what we call returning to large corporate segments.</p>
          <p>About Banco Votorantim and its capital levels, even as this Tier 1 ratio level that you are mentioning, we are not envisioning, we are not projecting another capital increase at Banco Votorantim at this moment. And about perspectives for a breakeven at Banco Votorantim, Ivan here will make a comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Thank you, Mario. You'll see that improvement in the results quarter-by-quarter I would like to give a number. If you get the provision charge for the car finance was R$4.2 billion in 2012. We forecast the same line without the recover in R$2.2 billion. You'll see that there is an important improvement on the performance of the bank and you'll see this quarter-by-quarter in 2013. That's the best that we can give you now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me ask then a follow up then, Ivan. Was this provision of Votorantim declining so much your expectations for a sharp drop in provisions? But at the same time, you're not really expecting to see a sharp drop in provisions at Banco do Brasil. When you look at your provision guidance, provisions to loans you're expecting to remain flat. So does this mean that you expect a deterioration in Banco do Brasil's portfolio in 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. There is no projection of any kind of deterioration in our portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So why then wouldn't you guide for lower provisions in 2013 as a percentage of your loan book? You're pretty much guiding for flat provisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mario, on this specific guidance item, you'll see that not only this year but also on the past two years, we are very conservative in the guidance of credit provision expenses to loan portfolio. We have been usually performing on the bottom range of the guidance, on the lower side of the guidance range. But the best answer that I can give you is that we are &#x2013; if there is one item where we are extra conservative, it's this one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then Gustavo, just to go back to your answer you gave on the spreads. You said a big reason for the drop in spreads was related to the drop in the <mark type="ph" /> said leak (29:43). And like you said, you don't expect this leak to fall much further from current levels. Does this mean then we should see a more stable spreads going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. At some point, because bear in mind, Mario, that there are still parts of the portfolio that are being renewed at the current level. So, yes, once the entire portfolio cycle is through, you would see a furtherization of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When do you expect that to happen? Now, are we talking about like two more quarters or is it like another year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. This is a hard projection to make. But two more quarters is a fair projection. But this is not very accurate because that depends on the action by the client. The client has to require to renew that specific line.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I just had a basic question. We're shareholders and we're not Brazilian experts. But it seems to me you offer a substantial discount to all the other Brazilian banks. And the feedback I get from the analysts is because you're a state-owned bank. And the only negative I see out of it is if the state is making you make loans which you would otherwise make. So let me bluntly ask, in this quarter, did you guys make any loans that the state called you up or you the federal government said you need to make this loan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your question. Well, I have a long answer for that. And in fact these are the short view. Well, Banco do Brasil has committed for every decision that we make about rates or about credit quality and credit approvals. Every credit decision, if we're talking about the mass retail, goes to a credit scoring system that is tested time after time at Banco do Brasil.</p>
          <p>And the largest decisions go through the different committees that we have, depending on the size of that decision up to the Board of Directors at Banco do Brasil. There are no decisions that we make related to credit rates or any other type of characteristic rates influenced by the government. Those are all decisions that take under consideration the credit quality and profitability for Banco do Brasil's shareholders, the government being one of them.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I mean, I just think that at the end of the day, your numbers look increasingly as good or better than any other private banks. And you have a lower ROE because of the agricultural business, but it seems increasingly likely to me that your valuation gap should narrow to the peers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, from our end, we can say that we never agreed with such a discount that we have when we compare ourselves to our peers.</p>

          <p>Hi, Gustavo. One last question here. Last year in 2012, you delivered an effective tax rate much lower than your guiding for. You delivered 28%. And I saw that you did not provide any guidance for your tax rate in 2013. Should we assume that we shouldn't see any changes on your tax rate?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mario, we are not &#x2013; you're correct. You're precise. We are not projecting that for this year. So, the best projection that you can make is to use what was presented in 2012.</p>
