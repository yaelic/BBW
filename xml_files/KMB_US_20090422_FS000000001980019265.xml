          <p>Excuse me everyone, we now have your speakers in conference. Please be aware each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of the presentation, we will open the floor for your questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you'd like to ask a question.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Masseth. Mr. Masseth, you may begin, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David. Good morning everyone. We appreciate your interest in Kimberly-Clark. And with us today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mark Buthman, Senior VP and CFO; and Randy Vest, Vice President and Controller.</p>
          <p>Here is the agenda for our call today, Mark will start with a review of first quarter results. Then Tom will provide his perspective on the results for the quarter and then also discuss our 2009 outlook. That will leave us plenty of time for Q&amp;A. For those wishing to follow along, we have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website, kimberly-clark.com.</p>
          <p>First, let me remind you that we'll be making forward-looking statements during the call today. There can be no assurance that future events will occur as anticipated or that the company's results will be as estimated. Please refer to the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to point out that when discussing 2009 results, we'll be comparing to adjusted results in 2008 and those results exclude charges for the strategic cost reduction plan that we completed last year. Management believes that reporting in this manner enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. For additional information on why we made these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, see today's news release and additional information on our website.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it over to Mark.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mike, and good morning. I hope you had a chance to review our news release this morning with all the details of our results. I'm going to briefly review the quarter and I'd like to start with a few headlines. First, organic sales growth was over 3% in the quarter. That was more than offset by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Second, we delivered strong gross margin improvement of about 200 basis points. Of our operating profit and bottom line EPS, each declined 9% were weighed down by significant currency losses and incremental pension expense. Third, cash provided by operations rose 56% driven by strong benefits from our focus on improved working capital.</p>
          <p>Now let me get into the detail of the quarter and I'll start with the top line. Overall sales decreased about 7% to $4.5 billion including a currency drag of 10%. Organic growth of more than 3% was driven by our focus on improving net realized revenue, which led to an approximate six point gain in net selling prices and a slightly better product mix. Total sales volumes were down about 3%, reflecting the challenging business environment as well as our continued emphasis on price realization.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to the top line for each of our segments. In Personal Care, sales were down about 3% including an 11 point currency headwind. Organic growth of approximately 8% was driven by higher net selling prices of about 6% and a one point improvement from both volume and mix.</p>
          <p>In North America, organic sales increased about 3%, net selling prices rose about 5% due to increases implemented in 2008. Those were partially offset by competitive promotional activity, primarily in diapers.</p>
          <p>Overall sales volumes were down about 2%, mostly due to softness in childcare and the baby wipes categories. Regarding HUGGIES diapers, although volumes were off slightly versus year ago, I was pleased to see our market shares improved a point sequentially compared to the fourth quarter. Meanwhile our adult care business delivered 7% volume growth, including benefits from the launch of gender-specific Depend Underwear.</p>
          <p>Now moving to Europe, Personal Care organic sales were off nearly 4%, volumes fell about 3% driven by lower results in our childcare business, while HUGGIES diaper volumes were about equal to last year. Net selling prices were down less than 1% overall.</p>
          <p>In developing and emerging markets, although Personal Care sales were off about 5%, organic growth was strong at nearly 16%. Price and mix contributed more than 10 points of growth and volumes increased 5%. Volume highlights included low teens growth in the fast growth BRICIT countries, as well as double-digit growth in Vietnam, Israel and South Africa.</p>
          <p>Turning to Consumer Tissue, sales were down about 8%, including a 10 point drag from currency. Net selling prices were up about 6% with product mix delivering an additional point of growth. Volumes fell about 5% were broadly impacted by our continued focus on revenue realization, some category weakness and consumer trade down.</p>
          <p>In North America, net sales increased 1% and that gain was driven by higher net selling prices of more than 5%, and improved mix of 2%, mostly offset by lower volumes of about 5%.</p>
          <p>On the pricing front, we had continued solid realization from the increases taken last year, partially offset by somewhat higher promotional spending.</p>
          <p>Regarding volumes, branded volumes were down across all categories with relatively softer performance in towels and facial tissue than in our bathroom tissue business.</p>
          <p>Switching to Europe, consumer tissue organic sales were off 3%, net selling prices rose 3% and product mix contributed another point of growth.</p>
          <p>Those gains were more than offset by a drop in sales volumes of more than 6%. In the developing and emerging markets, consumer tissue sales were lower by more than 11%, including a currency drag of approximately 19%. Selling prices increased in most markets, and improved mix contributed a total of 12 points of growth, while sales volumes fell about 4%.</p>
          <p>Moving to K-C Professional and Other, sales increased about 14% including nine points from currency. While we generated five points of growth from increased net selling prices, sales volumes were down by more than 5%. Now KCP results were impacted more than our other businesses by the challenging economic environment, particularly in North America and Europe where sales volumes were down 13 and 10% respectively.</p>
          <p>Lastly, Health Care segment sales were even with last year as organic growth of 4% was offset by weaker currency rates. Sales volumes advanced 4% in the quarter, including double-digit gains in exam gloves. Our glove business is seeing good early results from our new lower cost LAVENDER nitrile glove that launched in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now moving to operating profit, margin and cost savings. Gross margins improved nicely from 30.5% a year ago to 32.4% as we benefited from price realization, cost-savings efforts and lower input costs of about $75 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>First-quarter operating profit fell approximately 9% to $628 million with an operating margin of 14%. Results included currency transaction losses and other income and expense of $76 million, negative currency translation of about $65 million and, as expected, an increase in pension expense of $46 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>In addition, we incurred production curtailment that reduced operating profit by about $90 million as we continue to drive lower inventory levels. Although margins are still down year-over-year I was encouraged that we delivered our second consecutive quarter of sequential improvement, despite the drag from currencies and pension expense. Meanwhile we continue to invest in our brands with strategic marketing investment up in local currency terms.</p>
          <p>Now turning to cost savings. Total savings were $45 million in the first quarter. Our ongoing FORCE program generated savings of $24 million. In terms of strategic cost reduction plan, we realized $21 million of benefit from activities completed in 2008. We're off to a good start with our cost savings efforts so we continue to target 2009 total savings of about $150 million.</p>
          <p>Now let's briefly look at first quarter segment operating margins. Our margins improved year-on-year and sequentially in Personal Care, Consumer Tissue and our Health Care businesses. Input cost declines benefited all three segments while higher selling prices also boosted profitability in Personal Care and Consumer Tissue. Health Care margins also reflect a stepped up focus on cost reduction in that business. Lastly KCP profitability was somewhat lower than prior year as a result of lower sales volumes and production curtailment related to managing inventories.</p>
          <p>Turning to equity company results. Net income from equity companies declined 26% in the quarter, primarily due to lower earnings at K-C de Mexico. KCM delivered high single digit organic sales growth and improved gross profit margin, but operating profit and net income were significantly reduced by currency losses stemming from the weaker peso. Our share of KCM's currency translation and transaction losses in the quarter totaled about $18 million, that's equivalent to about $0.04 per share. KCM has recently taken steps to significantly reduce its U.S. dollar balance sheet exposure going forward.</p>
          <p>Now moving to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash provided by operations was $692 million, that's up 56% from a year-ago, the increase was driven by improved working capital performance, partially offset by lower cash earnings. Our businesses have done a terrific job taking aggressive action to deliver a seven-day decline in inventory levels compared to the end of 2008. Now that said, we still have room to further improve our working capital and we're continuing to aggressively pursue opportunities to generate additional cash flow.</p>
          <p>Looking at capital spending, we invested $211 million in the quarter. That's in line with our plan for the full-year spending to be in the range of 800 to $850 million.</p>
          <p>So that wraps up the financial review. To recap the quarter, we achieved 3% organic sales growth driven by improved revenue realization while sales volumes were impacted by the challenging economic environment.</p>
          <p>Gross and operating margins continued to improve sequentially and importantly we delivered excellent cash flow. Now I'll turn it over to Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark, and good morning everyone. I'll give you my perspective on our first quarter results and then I'll review the outlook for the rest of the year. Then we'll move on and get to your questions.</p>
          <p>In summary, we're managing through a very difficult environment. We're aggressively moving to address the near-term challenges that we face, while at the same time maintaining a strong focus on the strategies that will ensure our long-term success. So let me begin with our first-quarter results.</p>
          <p>As you just heard from Mark, our results reflect the weak economic conditions that I'm sure you are all very familiar with. The recession has impacted our demand in North America and Europe, most notably in our K-C Professional business, but also in our Consumer Tissue and childcare businesses.</p>
          <p>In addition, consumer trade-down has affected our market shares in some categories. On that front, I'm cautiously optimistic that private label market shares in the first quarter were flat or down slightly in most major U.S. categories, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. And then lastly, bottom-line results were significantly reduced by currency losses and by increased pension expense.</p>
          <p>Together, those two items reduced our first-quarter earnings per share by about 35%, compared to last year. So despite the difficult environment we made progress with several of the priorities we talked with you about in our January earnings call. First, we continued to pursue our targeted growth initiatives. In developing and emerging markets our organic sales rose 12% in the quarter, and that was highlighted by 18% growth in the BRICIT countries.</p>
          <p>So although growth has moderated somewhat in developing and emerging markets, we remain optimistic about our prospects in these parts of the world. In addition, last week we announced acquisition of Jackson Safety. This transaction is consistent with our strategy to extend K-C Professional into higher-margin segments.</p>
          <p>Second, we continue to strengthen our brands, innovation such as new Depend Underwear for men and women are off to a good start and we have more product news coming in this year. We also continue to support our brand building and product initiatives with strong marketing programs.</p>
          <p>Third, our focus on improving profitability is beginning to pay off. I was pleased to see our gross margin improve in the first quarter. Although in some cases our sales volumes continue to be impacted by our focus on revenue realization, that's a trade-off we're making to get our margins moving in the right direction.</p>
          <p>We also generated improved operating margin in three of our four business segments. And we're off to a good start this year with our cost-savings efforts. And then fourth, we delivered a strong improvement in cash provided by operations with outstanding progress in driving down our inventories. As Mark said we'll continue to push hard in this area to allow us to free up additional cash. So all-in-all, while results are down, I'm encouraged by our performance in a number of areas.</p>
          <p>Now let me cover the outlook. Based on what we've experienced so far we expect business conditions to remain challenging this year. In this environment we remain focused on improving our margins, maximizing our cash flow, pursuing our targeted growth initiatives and further building our brands in key capabilities that support sustainable growth.</p>
          <p>Moreover we're accelerating cost reductions and driving organizational efficiency. In fact we've just announced two actions that affect much of our U.S. workforce. First we've decided to freeze our defined benefit pension plan at the end of this year for all non-union employees. This will reduce 2009 defined benefit pension expense by about $40 million compared to our previous estimate with virtually all of that improvement coming in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>In addition, expense for future years will be less sensitive to changes in discount rates and actual plan returns. And then second, we've announced a voluntary severance program for salaried and hourly non-production employees. This is a first step in our plan to further improve our cost position and optimize the effectiveness of our organization.</p>
          <p>We expect that there will be additional head count reductions during the second and third quarters after each business unit and functional area have completed their detailed plans and made final decisions. Although at this point it's not possible to quantify the potential cost or ongoing savings that will result. These are difficult decisions but they're necessary to improve Kimberly-Clark's competitive position and to help us emerge from this challenging environment in a stronger competitive position.</p>
          <p>This morning's news release included several updated planning assumptions for the year. Let me review the key points starting with the top line. We're now planning for overall sales volumes to be flat to down modestly this year. This reflects a more severe downturn in K-C Professional and slightly lower expectations elsewhere. And we continue to be disciplined to strike the appropriate balance between sales volume and profitability and we are carefully monitoring market shares, the competitive environment and the financial health of the consumer.</p>
          <p>We continue to target a two to 3% benefit from higher net selling prices and bringing estimated organic growth into the one to 2% range. We're not assuming any broad-based price rollbacks but we are planning for somewhat higher promotional spending, some of which has already begun.</p>
          <p>With an estimated negative currency effect of eight to 9%, total sales are expected to be down six to 8% this year. This assumes currency rates for the balance of the year are pretty similar to where they were in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of cost and operating profit drivers, at this point cost deflation is estimated to be 600 to 700 million for the year, that compares to our previous plan for deflation of about 300 million and is based on oil and pulp prices generally in line with current levels for the rest of 2009.</p>
          <p>We're anticipating more currency losses than previously estimated, although in certain markets we're taking action to reduce the bottom line impact where we can. In addition, we remain committed to improve our inventory levels and drive our cash flow, even as we've slightly lowered our expectations for sales volumes.</p>
          <p>As a result, production curtailment will be more significant than we previously anticipated. So putting it all together, although some of our individual assumptions have changed significantly from three months ago, we're on track overall with our plan for the year, and we continue to expect our earnings per share will be in a range of $4.00 to $4.20.</p>
          <p>As we discussed in our January communication, there is more uncertainty around these estimates than normal and we recognize that the environment could cause significant changes in key variables including consumer demand, net selling prices, currency exchange rates and input cost.</p>
          <p>We continue to expect that earnings per share in the first half of the year are likely to be down versus adjusted earnings in 2008, with improvement expected in the second half of the year. So we will carefully monitor the environment and we'll adjust our plans as appropriate to deliver the best possible results in this environment.</p>
          <p>So to summarize, while the current environment remains challenging, we'll continue to do the right things for the long-term health of our businesses and manage those things that we can control. In short, Kimberly-Clark teams around the world continue to execute our global business plan and are committed to improving our performance.</p>
          <p>I'm confident we're building a leaner, stronger, faster company and that we have the right strategies in place to drive sustainable growth and deliver shareholder value over the long term.</p>
          <p>Now that wraps up our prepared remarks, and we'll be happy to begin to take your questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, at this time the floor is now open for your questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Ali Dibadj from Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys how are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, Ali how are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you help us &#x2013; well, can you talk through the currency impact on the bottom line a little bit. You had said in the past several times I think, CAGNY is the last time I heard it at least, that the impact percentagewise from a top line versus a bottom line would be roughly one to one, i.e., there is no as we call it, there is no multiplier. It looked like this quarter was like negative 10 on the top line, negative 23 on the bottom line, so 2.3 time multiplier. What should we expect going forward and maybe a part of an answer has to be that $76 million and figuring when that $76 million disappears going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and a good chunk of that, probably two thirds of that $76 million really relates to a split between the official rate and the unofficial rate for certain Latin American currencies. And so part of that was related to moving cash balances from local currency to U.S. dollar. So we took a transactional hit on that. But part of it was related to importing at the unofficial rate and selling at the official rate, and so that that negative spread winds up in other expense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But then beyond that &#x2013; beyond just that, what is the impact on the bottom line versus the top line? It sounds like it probably would be more than one to one, more like one to 1.5, or one to 1.7 something like that. Is that a reasonable way to think about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think certainly in the first quarter when you have situations like that it's a question of how quickly your pricing catches up in the local market. And so, in the quarter we were able to import some product at the official rate and some at the unofficial rate, and that's going to ultimately lead to price increases, but we didn't get that fully realized in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Whether there will be a lag effect, is the point &#x2013; ideally you'd like to get it back to one to one, but if you're having the currency fall away from you, you're going to be short of that in any given quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. One of the other things you mentioned at CAGNY as very important for this year is trying to get a sense of elasticities and the potential changes in elasticity curves. Can you give us the little bit of what you're learning in Personal Care, Consumer Tissue, KCP about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. If you look at the categories where you're meeting people's probably most basic needs like diapers and bathroom tissue, you're seeing the category and unit volume has been pretty flat. So you're not seeing a lot of demand change, which is what you'd expect. There you're seeing maybe a bit more sensitivity around absolute cash outlay as opposed to price per unit. And so, we're making sure we've got the right packings at the right promoted price points.</p>
          <p>In some of the other categories that you might argue are more discretionary. Household towels were a little soft, flushable moist wipes were a little soft, facial tissue category was down, we had a weaker cold and flu season but I also think that's a category that could be a little bit more discretionary. You're seeing category weakness there and so it's how do we make sure that we've got the right offering and the right price.</p>
          <p>I think for us the encouraging thing in the quarter is that private-label shares sequentially were flat in most of our categories. I think they were flat in five, down in two and up in one and the only one they were up in was adult care and really we didn't have much of a promotional program for Depend in the first quarter because we were getting ready to transition to our pants for men and women that we were launching late first quarter, early second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you seeing any change in the curve particularly in the emerging markets? So any change in the elasticity between the emerging markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not at this point. I mean I think you're seeing things slow down and it's a question of how many new households come into the middle class and can afford your products. And so it's more about changes in category penetration rates as opposed to individual usage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just my last one around downtime. It look like it is about 200 bps this quarter and you said it was &#x2013; it's going to be more than we previously anticipated I think is the exact quote. What should we expect that 200 basis points to be going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess I'd say we're going to probably have a similar level in the second quarter for example, I mean, we're going to continue to push inventories down, do it early. So we get the benefit this year of the lower working capital and the improved cash flow. We've got obviously big pension contributions coming. So we know we've got to generate cash early in the year to be able to fund those and we'll just see how demand goes but we're committed to getting inventories under better control and we'll take as much downtime as we need to get where we need to be on that front.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys. Tom, on the FX transaction issues again. Can you just talk a little bit about how it's flown through I guess so far, so besides the translation of cash in Venezuela, I mean what about the rest of the business in &#x2013; the effect on gross margin for feeling U.S. dollar-based commodities causing a margin drag internationally. I mean has that &#x2013; because of LIFO &#x2013; or FIFO accounting? Has that flown through to the full effect, or will we see an incremental FX drag from a transaction perspective over the next couple of quarters?</p>

          <p>I think it really depends market-by-market and where you're able to get price to offset it and where you're not.  You have a lot of markets where the currencies are off 20 or 25%. Commodities in some cases aren't off quite as much, you're not able to get price, so you're seeing a little bit more margin pressure on that front. So it in terms of the other expense line most of it is, as you describe, was the transaction exposure in Venezuela, but beyond that it's difficult to tell.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I guess purely related to timing, have we seen the highest of cost inventory driven by that strong U.S. dollar hit the P&amp;L already or might we see more of that, assuming currency rates flat and no change to pricing, I guess all else equal. Have we seen that flow through the inventory levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I would say for the most part, yeah. It's been-- the commodity costs have come down substantially in the fourth quarter, so that should have flowed through most of our inventory at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then I guess last quarter you had been pretty clear that, commodity costs coming in lower than what you'd expect would alter a little bit of a balance in your guidance, meaning if commodity costs come in lower, pricing may be more at risk than you guys had thought. And obviously, you guys have more than doubled the commodity deflation estimate, and pricing still holds the same. So I guess has pricing held up better than you thought &#x2013; and I assume it has, and I guess why do you think that is and is there anything going on by geography to call out on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So far, the pricing has held up probably better than we would have expected. I think, obviously we were certainly planning for it to hold and have been doing everything we can to try and reinforce that in the marketplace. I think like most other companies, we're using other strategic levers from a marketing standpoint to reinforce the value equation, making sure we get our promoted price-points right, that we've got the right packings and distribution, trying to drive innovation wherever we can to justify the value of our products to the consumer. And so those are the levers that we'd much rather pull than the price decline lever. And we're also watching private label shares, and so the fact that they've stabilized at this point &#x2013; or seem to have for the most part is encouraging to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just finally, do you feel like that sort of second derivative is better now, I mean certain things you're seeing are going to continue to remain challenging, but from your business perspective, I mean even into April, I mean things don't seem to be getting worse from your perspective, globally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I mean I think that, it's difficult to tell, I would say in &#x2013; early in the first quarter, you probably saw a bit more of inventory pull down across-the-board as everybody was preparing for it to get worse. It felt like thing &#x2013; like momentum picked up a little bit during the quarter, but it's also difficult to tell on a month-to-month basis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>Good morning.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Connie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Could you describe a little bit the kind of increased promotional activity that you're starting to see in, and I think you also said it's underway? So what it is it that you're doing differently now than maybe a couple of months ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, for example, in diapers, we're probably doing a little bit more direct mail couponing to make sure that we've got the coupons in mom's hand at the right time. So where there are size changes to make sure that we've got the right prenatal sampling, so that her new baby is starting with Huggies right from the start. So we're doing more strategic marketing on that front to make sure consumers see the value equation. But we're also launching a super premium product like Pure &amp; Natural because we know that mom will still pay more for a truly better product for her baby. And so being willing to do that even in a face of a challenging environment is something that we're continuing to focus on.</p>
          <p>In tissue, it's really getting the right packings on the shelf at the right price point, and finding &#x2013; if a $5 price point is what moves the volume more effectively with some accounts, making sure you can get there with the right product that's got a reasonable margin for us as well as a reasonable value for the consumer, and maybe less of the big bundle pack promotions. So it is trying to focus on that to get the mix right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How different is Huggies, Pure &amp; Natural than &#x2013; I read the text and everything, but there is something out there called gDiapers, which are flushable and organic. Is the industry moving in that direction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what mom tells us is that she wants us to take even a small step toward a better product environmentally. She recognizes there are challenges in getting to a perfect solution. But if we can do something &#x2013; so making it hypoallergenic, doing it without dyes and fragrances, using some organic cotton in the product, just something that she feels like she's doing her part to try and contribute to a better environment. Looking at putting recycled polymer in the packaging, all of those things are small steps that can make a difference collectively over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what's the price premium of Pure &amp; Natural?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's about 15%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what's retailer response towards it been?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So far it's been great. I think the retailers are all looking for innovation right now. In the early days, I was as just talking with our team in Neenah earlier this week, and I think in the first week we were out there we had 200,000 hits to our website. So mom is interested in it as well, which is what is really exciting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one final question on FX. If currency rates stay where there are, going forward will there be a balance sheet impact from FX transaction, or is the transaction impact that's coming just going to be running through the cost of goods?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, most of the balance sheet impact, because we translate the balance sheet at the end of every quarter at the then current rate, flows through the unrealized translation adjustments. So beyond that there shouldn't be a big balance sheet impact except if you have a big shift in a particular market and we're holding local currency cash there, you'll see some impact there, but that's about the only other thing you'd see.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First thing was just if the incremental head count reductions &#x2013; I know you said it's tough to quantify for our purposes, but is that sort of already assumed in your planning assumptions for the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We haven't put any cost or benefit from the head count changes in our current guidance assumptions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we'll give you a more complete update on that once we have the details of how many, how much and when the savings will occur.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you think you'll know that sort of around the time of second quarter earnings or is it like an intra-quarter thing that...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It should be sometime between now and then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the second thing was you mentioned you were taking steps to mitigate transaction losses going forward. So outside of the K-C de Mexico refinancing can you explain a little bit of what it is that you're doing and then of course would that mean that within the current outlook for FX that there's maybe a little flex there that if some of these actions actually go into effect it ends up being a little bit less bad?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think part of it is looking at our hedging to see if there's other things we can do there. Looking at more local manufacturing and markets where we've had a bigger currency impact from imported products. So things like that could have a mitigating impact. It's a question of how quickly we'll be able to do those, and I think the guidance range that we've given you for the year is a pretty reasonable guesstimate, based on what we know now as to where it will come out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So this mitigating stuff is more so that &#x2013; from a longer-term perspective to mitigate exposure to currency more than something that was about the here or now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I would say Lauren that if you think about it as just increasing our cost of goods, we're looking at pricing actions to offset it in certain markets too.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I have a follow-up to that. Are you seeing pricing accelerating in developing markets into the June quarter compared to the March quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In some cases. And a little bit depends on by category. As you saw, where you've had real currency weakness, you're seeing more pricing activity. Brazil, for example, we were pretty aggressive on price. In some categories you'd see it more across most of Latin America would be areas that we'd be focused on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would it make sense to assume that through the course of the year that pricing in developing markets accelerates and volume decelerates a little?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, If you think about it year-over-year, it really started in fourth quarter of last year. So as you start to get late this year we'll be lapping that. So you may actually see on a year-over-year change basis a little bit of deceleration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And as far as private label is concerned here, can you tell us what you think might happen in the untracked channels, importantly Wal-Mart. We keep hearing they're going to be pushing private label a lot more aggressively. Can you tell us what you're seeing there, through the June quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Our estimate is an all outlet estimate. So we have private label shares. In the &#x2013; versus prior quarter we were flat or down in most of our categories. The only one that was up a couple of share points was in adult care. If you look at year-over-year, the ones that were up significantly were &#x2013; I think feminine care was up 1.5, adult care was up about three points, bath and towels and facial tissue were each up about 1.5, so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think going ahead that's going to get &#x2013; they'll gain more share because Wal-Mart, etcetera is going to push private label more than they have in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think a lot of the private label discussion you're hearing from retailers is primarily aimed at food, although we certainly aren't taking that for granted in our categories. I think the thing that makes us feel cautiously optimistic is that at least fourth quarter to first quarter it seems to have stabilized, but it's something that we watch on a month-by-month basis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. A quick question about the Safety acquisition you guys talked about. If we look at the performance of the Professional business, it definitely is more cyclical, more volatility what have you. I mean, I think from an investor standpoint it might be viewed as a little bit of a drag on the business. So I guess the question is, why try to improve the margins through acquisitions as opposed to saying, look is this a business we want to get bigger in relative to the rest of our portfolio. So can you talk about just philosophically how you're looking at the Professional business given the volatility and the drag on overall returns and results?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sure. I think the focus for the Professional business has been to grow in the higher-margin segments, and some of those are less cyclical than some of our traditional business. And certainly that's the hope with Safety and with some of our higher margin products that are sold more into the higher-end spaces in the marketplace. And so, Safety is a good example of that. And certainly it will have some economic impact, but it should be less than the average of our overall KCP portfolio. And so this is a chance to buy a good company with a good portfolio at an attractive price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess then is it less &#x2013; you mean how much more cyclical and how much lower margin is it than let's say the overall portfolio then? I mean is it still, it sounds like the issue is it's a better mix than Professional, but negative mix relatively. So I'm still trying to get an idea, you improve one business, but still sort of hurt the overall?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think our vision is that the mix would be accretive to the Kimberly-Clark portfolio overall, and there's a good global opportunity here, where you build a balanced portfolio of those products around the world, and you should be able to do pretty well with that in most reasonable economic scenarios.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah sure. Thanks, guys. I was just wondering, quickly if you could touch on how you'll think about share buybacks as you go through the balance of the year, especially with free cash coming in pretty strongly. When will those decisions be made, and how should we think about the way you're approaching that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've got a write a pretty big check to our pension plan before the end of the year. So I think we only had about, I don't know, 60 million of pension contribution in the first quarter, we're going to be close to 500 million for the full year. So we've got to deliver cash early in the year here to be able to fund our pension plan commitments. So we're watching that, as we go through the year, we'll make those pension plan contributions.</p>
          <p>We also didn't have really an estimated tax payment in the first quarter because &#x2013; or significant one, because of some of the pension plan contributions that we have coming. So, our tax payments will be higher in the balance of the year than they were in the first quarter I would guess. So the combination of that, I would say that it's unlikely that we'll probably do any share repurchases this year, but we'll give you updated guidance as we go through the year. Obviously if we generate significantly more cash in the business than we need, we haven't historically accumulated it in the balance sheet.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just following up on the transactional FOREX and I hate to beat a dead horse too much here. But I guess you're stepping up the impact from that in your guidance by about $175 million as far as a drag goes. And currency exchange rates haven't changed that dramatically. So this is really a reflection of capital controls being imposed in a few countries, particularly Venezuela?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's more of a difficulty in getting exchange at the official rate for imported product.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I mean, I guess if you're stepping up by 175 million for the year, and you had 70, 75 or $75 million impact in the quarter, we should think about this moderating across the year. Can give us a sense of how much of that $76 million was purely the cash balance moving. So how much of that 94 million in cash you had at year end in Venezuela. Did you translate back into U.S. dollars?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean that's difficult. We didn't bring it all back into dollars. We bought a portion of it back into dollars and of the 76 million of other expense, about two-thirds was related to the Latin American currency issues and a portion of that was related to the cash balance shift.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just kind of in principle, Venezuela is a $400 million business for you guys in a revenue sense, at current exchange rates in &#x2013; if you use the black market exchange rate it's only 150 million. It's not a very big business, but it's causing a pretty outsized negative earnings and cash flow impact on your business this year. Is how you evaluate whether you want to shrink that business and make those sorts of strategic decisions in light of what's going on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess, Andrew, the only thing I'll tell you is that running a business in developing and emerging markets is an exciting and challenging opportunity every day. So I get up and read the Financial Times just to see what new thing happened that I get to worry about. So whether it's a coup in Thailand or something going on in Venezuela, there is risk.</p>
          <p>I think the good thing for us is we don't have a disproportionate amount of our business in any one market. We're spread across a number of markets. There are going to be hiccups and surprises in various places, but overall we've been there for a long time, we think we know how to operate there. We'll operate through this and come out the other side with a strong, healthy market position in Venezuela.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Linda Bolton-Weiser with Caris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I was just curious about your cost savings in the quarter. I mean it seemed pretty good and yet I thought that production curtailment actually would tend to reduce those amounts. Are you just really trying to achieve a lot in the beginning of the year or should we think about even excluding the additional head count reductions, should we think about possibly higher numbers than 150 million for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's a good question, Linda. And I think last year we talked about how we don't charge the unabsorbed overhead from downtime in &#x2013; against our FORCE savings. We track that separately but we talked about when we were down, we were doing more maintenance, we probably didn't manage the cost of those as effectively. And so we &#x2013; it wound up hurting our FORCE savings. We did a little better job of managing that in the first quarter. And so our teams are focused on delivering both their inventory objectives and their cost savings for the year. So I'm pleased to see we were off to a good start and expect that to continue, and perhaps even build a bit this year as we go through the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, I'm just curious about the new Depend product for men and women?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You should try them. They're great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I may need them. I'm just curious about the &#x2013; it just seems to increase the number of SKUs at retail quite a bit, because you've got the different absorbencies and then the men and the women. Is that a push back by retailers or is that not really an issue in getting acceptance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think whenever we're go into our retail partners with a new program that has got increased SKU count, we're already thought through what the issues are going to be. Typically, they're been exposed to the innovation. We've done some things with compressed packaging to try to fit the product lineup into the same linear feet on the shelf. And so obviously, you'd like to have an infinite amount of excess shelf space available for you. You know you're not going to get that. So we think through how we're going to execute our innovation at retail, and usually have had discussions with our driver customers upfront so that they are working through how to fit it onto the shelf.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the K-C Professional and other operating margin in the quarter. I mean, I guess it was the only business unit that had a decline year-over-year. And I would have expected the Commercial Tissue, the Tissue piece to actually have margin improvement. Was that the case or were both parts of the business down in terms of operating margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. K-C Professional &#x2013; I mean it's such a volume hit in the quarter that that was really &#x2013; the overwhelming impact of it was from that. So, when you're down 10-plus percent in some markets, that's a pretty big deal.</p>

          <p>Good morning. I'm sorry, I just want to make sure I'm clear on the FX impact on operating profit. So you have the 75 million or so that was transactional flowing through other income. And then you talked about $150 million hit to operating profit from FX. Was that purely translational at the operating profit line?</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

          <p>Okay. And so, is there an FX hit to the cost of goods line that you guys have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is some level &#x2013; yes, there is some level of transactional hit there, where in local currencies you're buying different currency denominated inputs.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I know what it is, I was wondering how much impact it had on cost of goods?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say it increased it. It's not something that we disclose specifically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll circle back to you on that -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not as big as the other factors that we laid out in terms of the changes in operating profit for the quarter. So, we really talked about the big swingers, the pension expense increase, the curtailment costs and the inflation or the deflationary impacts as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. And then just lastly the production curtailment cost. Is that occurring across all segments fairly evenly? I'm sorry if I missed if there was an area of focus on this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say the Consumer Tissue, Personal Care and K-C Professional had most of the curtailment cost, Health Care, their curtailment. They took more of their curtailment in second and third quarter last year. So you saw the impact on their margins last year, you saw some of the rebound in their margins this year. They didn't have as big of an impact.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey guys, good morning. Can we get some more color on the production downtime, maybe some guidance on how that's going to trend as the year progresses, because at some point, the inventory is obviously going to catch up with consumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we would probably say, we're going take more of it in the first half of the year, as much of it as we can and hopefully get our inventory in good position. So some color would be, we had a number of outside warehouses when we started the year that had overflow storage, we were out of virtually all of those by the end of the first quarter, so &#x2013; in the U.S. So that was an opportunity.</p>
          <p>I'd say D&amp;E is still an area that's got some work to do on that front. So D&amp;E has probably got more opportunity to take inventory out in the second quarter and third quarter. K-C Professional made good progress, but their volumes were falling at the same time as they were curtailing so they didn't make as much progress as they would have hoped. And so they're going to continue to push to get their inventory in line.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we're also starting &#x2013; continuing to reduce SKUs, so that we &#x2013; as we simplify our product lineup, we can also run with less inventory, run with a more efficient manufacturing operation. And I'd say that SKU reduction is probably at the early stages, so there will be more benefit coming from that as the year progresses as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Are you going to take down any production capacity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think that that's the nature of where we're at. I mean I think given the volume declines that we're seeing are fairly modest. So I think it's more of managing your downtime across the organization.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Got you. And then you sort of hinted at it, but did you &#x2013; any implications of the planogram changes we see, we saw Wal-Mart and Walgreens is talking about 15 to 17% reduction in SKUs. I mean has your business been impacted by that at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it depends on the strength of your brands. Typically, it either helps you or hurts you. If you're the big brand and you come out with more share of the shelf and better pack out and better in stock, it can help you. Obviously, if you're in a weaker position, you can lose distribution and it will hurt you in those particular areas. So I think it's a trend that's been continuing for a long time. It seems to be accelerating a bit lately as retailers are really trying to be more focused on what they carry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So &#x2013; but has it impacted you guys specifically? I would think that Huggies is probably in pretty good shape, but you would probably question Kotex and some of the &#x2013; their SKU proliferation and some of the smaller brands?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, probably the areas &#x2013; we've generally done fine in personal care, facial tissue has been fine. The areas we probably worked on a little bit are in the towel category, making sure that Viva and Scott towels are representative of where we want them to be. So and have had some wins and some losses on those fronts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then just if I can ask one more. Have you changed your hedging activity at all? I mean, because it sounds like you have a lot more confidence I guess in some of the planning assumptions on the commodity side. So have you locked in oil prices more than you had in the past, and the same with natural gas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, with natural gas, we're a little bit more hedged than we have been. I mean we're probably &#x2013; we were 80% hedged in the first quarter, I think we're 75% hedged for the balance of the year. Now, it's at prices that are above the current market price, but we've limited some of the volatility. On the oil front, we really &#x2013; we don't have a lot of direct oil, so we haven't been able to do much there. And so I think it's more just the momentum feels like it's moving in the right direction right now.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a question on, I guess the developing and emerging markets. Clearly, the headline news that we see, softer economies, GDP slowing across-the-board, certainly, doesn't seem like it's kind of filtered into the consumption trends yet. And I was just wondering how much has really trickled down to the consumption? Do you think high single-digit sales growth is more the floor on this business as you look out to 2009? And then I just have a follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. First it depends on the market. If you looked at Korea or Australia,  we're trying hard at developing an emerging markets bucket, you saw pretty flat category volumes there. And so those are very developed economies and as they slow down a little bit, they'll look more or like the U.S. probably in terms of how they respond.</p>
          <p>Other markets like China for us, I mean we're still picking up cities as we go. We're still only represented in a small part of China. So there is a huge growth opportunity for us to continue to push out. Brazil will be somewhere in between. We've got a good presence there. We think there's a lot more opportunity. We see even in parts of Brazil, we're not represented the way we'd like to be. So we're continuing to focus on maximizing growth opportunities in places like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then separately I know you talked about taking pricing to offset currency. Can you just talk about in those areas where you're facing local competition, who don't have to take pricing what you've seen in terms of the trends there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, it depends on the marketplace. If everybody is buying pulp that's priced in dollars then we're all dealing with the same approach. In other cases, where you're bringing in high-end diapers and high-end training pants in some markets where there really isn't a relevant local competitor it hasn't been a problem. But it's a bit like the private label issue in the U.S. You want to watch it and then make sure you get your value equation right and that you're not too far off from where the consumer sees the value difference.</p>
          <p>So it is a market-by-market approach. Vietnam was a good example. There's been very high inflation in Vietnam and our products have certainly reflected that, not every local competitor has followed and we're watching that price, value equation closely to see if something happens with share and with both volume share and dollar share.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks for taking my follow-up. I was hoping you can help me figure something out, and it's building on Alec's question from before a little bit. If you just look at the difference in your gross margin, call it 190 basis points something like this on a recurring basis, you've FORCE and SCR which are about 100 basis points, pricing which probably gave you 400 basis points plus, commodities gave you call it 170 basis points, deleverage was call it negative 200 basis points, pension was somewhere in the negative 100 basis points range. And then you have a gap, right to get to 187. So negative as high as maybe 300 basis points. And how much of that is currency? I know you say you don't want to disclose it, but I think it's a bigger deal than a small thing. So I want to understand what else maybe going on in there that I'm not understanding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. There's a number of other things in that analysis. I mean I think some of it is going to be product improvements where we've added cost back to the products in some cases or are driving a little bit better mix. So that will be another variable that you're not modeling. But I don't know, Mike, if you want to add anything to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
