        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone.  We have issued an ad-hoc statement only this morning, so therefore thank you for joining us on short notice.  On the call with me today is Peter L&#xF6;scher, our President and CEO; Joe Kaeser, our Chief Financial Officer; Wolfgang Dehen, who heads our Energy Sector; and Heinrich Hiesinger, who heads our Industry Sector.  After brief introductory remarks by Peter L&#xF6;scher, further details given by Wolfgang Dehen and Heinrich Hiesinger, we will be available to take your questions.</p>
          <p>Peter, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Michael.  Good morning everyone and welcome also from my side.  As you've seen from the announcement this morning, we expect charges up to &#x20AC;900 million in the second quarter.  This is based on intermediate results of a thorough review and audit of turnkey and other similar projects.</p>
          <p>At our Q1 call, I mentioned that we are assessing these projects across the company.  This is very much in line with the openness, transparency and accountability.  This is at the heart of how Siemens is reenergizing its organization.  And before giving details, I want to stress that the actions we are going to discuss today, including the charges taken in Q2 do not alter any of the financial and operational priorities we have been talking about since November.  This is a painful, but necessary step towards getting our businesses moving forward faster and it's also clearly a step that we force a no surprise, no excuse culture going forward.</p>
          <p>Let me share some findings with you.  The bulk of the project I referred to are turnkey project in Fossil Power Generation as expected after negative surprises in four out of five most recent quarters, additional project time mobility as outlined in Q1 related to delays in the tender process of large projects and our clean up efforts for Combino.</p>
          <p>The issues which we are addressing and communicating today are clearly related to Legacy Project.  For both businesses we have new sector and division CEOs in place since January.  They are accountable going forward for driving the necessary changes and delivering the results committed.  And before handing over to them to give you more details, let me make a few remarks on Siemens IT Solutions and Services.</p>
          <p>Problems at this are related to a project for the U.K. Department for Work and Pensions, DWP.  This contract intended to modernize the way DWP makes, manages and accounts for the 111 billion of benefits, pensions and allowances paid annually to 17 million people, it had a volume of approximately 85 million and was terminated.  Regrettably, we are unable to come to terms with the DWP on a process to make the project feasible and it is important to note however that we do not see any other project of similar risk profiles in the order books of SIS.</p>
          <p>As I said, the audit project is under execution and the project backlog is ongoing.  And now, Wolfgang Dehen and Heinrich Hiesinger will give you details on the Fossil Power Generation turnkey and Mobility businesses.  Over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you Peter.  To start with, I would like to underline what Peter L&#xF6;scher said regarding the outlook for growth.  The outlook is indeed excellent and all of our divisions are on track with their orders and revenues.</p>
          <p>In short, we will reach the sector target of GDP-square in the coming year and five of the six divisions in the Energy Sector are also showing positive trends with their earning.  Unfortunately, we have realized that the power plant solution business in the Fossil Power Generation Division has bigger earning problem that we could have foreseen.  That doesn't relate to the product, instrumentation and control and service part of that division.  Let me give you a chronological breakdown.</p>
          <p>PG has reported negative one-time effects in three out of four quarters from Q1 to Q4 of fiscal '07.  The first measures to counteract these effects were initiated in January '07 and an internal division task force was established.  Unfortunately, project earnings erosion of roughly 200 million euro happened in Q1 of fiscal '08.  In view of this development, we, as Peter has already mentioned, immediately launched a comprehensive and rigorous analysis of the power plant project for our central audit department with the support of Siemens Management Consulting.  Up till today, two-thirds of the 62 projects are analyzed that represents more than 80% of the total turnkey volume.  Additional provision for Q2 may amount to 600 million euro.</p>
          <p>As a result, first, these legacy projects must be thoroughly executed.  We will complete over half of the total volume in the current fiscal year and a further 35% in the following year.  This means that the division Fossil will reach a target range of 7 to 9% in fiscal '09 and the business will be in the target range in fiscal '010.  Power plant project typically take from 2 to 5 years to complete.  Product and service business and instrumentation controlled business of Fossil Power Generation are well on their way as I already mentioned.</p>
          <p>Second, we are taking actions for execution to prevent similar developments from happening again.  We have identified the main root causes behind this development and have implemented a comprehensive package of corrective measures.  The main causes are deficits in resources.  We have turnkey competent, yet as a result of the power plant boom, the number of projects have grown so big that we have overreached the limits of our capacity.  We have acted to correct this situation by hiring new employees.  By training and educating them for the job and building up their competencies takes time.  Some 40% of our engineering experts today have less than 3 years of experience.</p>
          <p>Further, at the same time the energy boom has confronted us with massive price increases for raw material such as stainless steel, copper, nickel and concrete as well as for key components such as piping and boilers, where price binding agreements have run out.  Price increases for power plants are more than offset by these costs.  And, as a result of the high demand, there are today severe bottlenecks for important components.  These developments strain not only suppliers, but also consortium partners.</p>
          <p>All necessary actions are now underway and will be rigorously implemented.  This means, (a) A further buildup of additional resources, particularly in engineering, supply management and project implementation.  (b) We have implemented improved structures and processes such as the bidding process in the fossil power plant business.  (c) Improved risk management.  The internal process strengthens the LoA process which means limit of authorization project approval, technical as well as financial in all divisions, business units and business segments in order to minimize project risks.  Projects will be approved by the sector CEO, by myself and the CFO together with divisions CEO and CFOs.</p>
          <p>The external part &#x2013; together with our customers, we are developing new strategies to distribute and balance the risk.  Example, a new project such as a steam turbine power plant, the project risk is divided evenly among all participants, the consortium partners and the customer.  Major sub-works such as coal supply for the facility and removing the ashes as well as key structural part are the responsibility of the customer and are integrated into the facility.  Another example of reducing the risk profile in projects is in a combined cycle plant, we do not include the boiler in the contract.</p>
          <p>D) Further improving the efficiency of supply chain management, rigorous monitoring of critical materials and components early in the bidding and LoA process.  Highly critical materials will be ordered in advance independently of individual project.  Further, an introduction on an early warning system in order to ensure timely identification of possible risk through suppliers and consortium partners and to take countermeasures and we look into a strategic refocusing.</p>
          <p>The ratio between turnkey and component business will be shifted to favor a greater share of component business.  Goal is one-third product, one-third service and one-third turnkey business.  That means being very selective in the acceptance of orders so that our resources can be used in a much more focused way.</p>
          <p>We have established the following priorities:  First, single-cycle gas turbine power plant; second, combined-cycle power plant; third, steam power plant, including the conventional items of nuclear power plant.  In addition, standard modular solutions will be developed for the power plant business in order to increase project profitability.</p>
          <p>My third point, the sum of additional provisions will of course have a major impact on the Sector Energy's profit margin in fiscal '08.  However, by implementing the measures in the Fossil Power Generation Division and with a more than solid contribution by the other divisions, we will continually improve the sectors' profit margins after Q2 in fiscal '08.  By fiscal '10, we will deliver well within our target ranges.</p>
          <p>Let me finish.  I am very convinced that we can profit substantially from the outstanding market perspectives and contribute to the success of Siemens.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much and now I want to move to Dr. Hiesinger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Wolfgang.  Ladies and gentlemen, despite many apprehensions and to some extent increasing uncertainty about the industrial environment, growth continues in the Industry Sector.  Five of the six divisions operate within the target margin ranges &#x2013; targets of 2010.  So our business in the Industry Sector has a broad, solid and stable base.</p>
          <p>Our Mobility Division is the only exception, to be more precise it's the Transportation business within the division, the former Transportation Systems Group.  To meet our general objective of achieving transparency and rigorously eliminating weak spot, we have started to review the entire order backlog.  This made risk visible that are significantly higher than those indicated by previous assessments.</p>
          <p>According to information available to us now, new project risk amounted to a minimum of &#x20AC;200 million in the current quarter.  Causes for this are the Combino repair project and the significant delay in the Transrapid project in China, as well as further individual projects.</p>
          <p>I am sure you are wondering why the Combino project is repeatedly mentioned and why it has to be reevaluated.  The project calls for rebuilding of 475 Combino cars.  At the end of February, we had completed rebuilding 241 cars, that's more than half.  Because the damage patterns are not uniform, estimates contain risks until the processing of the customer project can be started.  Based on these insights, estimates of the project risks were increased by about &#x20AC;40 million.  We will in future regularly report on the status of completion.</p>
          <p>Let me turn now to the Transrapid in China.  As was reported in the Chinese press, the awarding of the contract for expanding Shanghai Transrapid will be delayed significantly.  Since the customer's timetable was tight, Siemens had already started to process the order and had provided a significant volume of services in advance.  This applies especially to engineering services.  Given the significant delays that have recurred, we expect the negative impact on profit to about &#x20AC;50 million.  Further risks are spread among a number of individual projects.  The comprehensive review of our order backlog continued.</p>
          <p>To eliminate weak spots, the organizational structures of our rail business will be realigned. Here execution is proceeding at full speed.  One countermeasure we took immediately was to make our approval process to new offers more stringent.  As I mentioned at the beginning, the operational performance of all the Industry Sector Division is excellent in terms of growth and profit.  All-in-all, the Sector Industry has firmly set its sights on the margin target in business year 2008 despite the risk of Mobility.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much, back to Peter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me sum up.  We are obviously very disappointed about the deterioration of the legacy projects and please have no doubt about that.  We identified the problems in this project, we detailed how they got to, where they are and we have set out how we intend to remedy them.  Going forward, we'll be much more selective with turnkey projects in order to ensure an attractive risk return profile.  Our order books continued to build up across all of our businesses, especially in Energy, we'll grow our business on the back of the very strong cycle.  The operational performance of new orders is in line with the targets and let me reinforce that all divisions have to deliver on their margin target by 2010.  This is the commitment we made to deal with the top problems along with the great opportunities in an open and forthright manner.</p>
          <p>We are also working hard on several more of our priorities, including the SG&amp;A cost reduction process and senior management compensation plan.  We are on schedule to deliver as we committed to do so.  We continued to move forward on delivering the performance we have targeted.  Again, nothing we have spoken about today changes the timing or the numbers we have committed to.</p>
          <p>And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Your first question comes from the line of James Stettler with DKIB, please proceed.  Mr. Stettler, your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Thank you and good morning.  You stated that you've gone through 80% of the projects.  When do you expect to complete that?  And, indeed, if I understood correctly, you are looking for 7 to 9% margin fossil in '09, I mean how much conviction do you really have that you have provided correctly here?  And did I get that correct, the 900, the breakdown is 600 power, 200 rail, and 100 SIS, and can you maybe talk a bit more about the risks in that division?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, to the first part of your question, Mr. Stettler, I confirm the 7 to 9%.</p>
          <p>For the second part of your question, up to today, we went through 39 projects which represent 80% of the sales volume at LSS.  There is another 23 and we expect them to be finished and finalized by the end of this month.  Just to give you an insight, we have 19 projects where we performed a deep dive, two weeks onsite project reviews and also discussions with all the involved people, which represent roundabout 45% of all critical projects which we have selected in terms of scope, critical consortia and country.  Then, the other 20, we looked into combine cycle, consortia and high impact on supply base, we get up to the 80% as I mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Mobility, we clearly have reevaluated 20 risk projects which were already on our schedule, and most prominent the Combino business.  In the rest of our backlog, we have roundabout 350 projects, about 2.5 million which accounts for 10 billion.  Here, we have assets roundabout 20%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, for the question I received, I want to correct myself.  We are looking for the end of this month but we are not sure whether we are able to perform them all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, do you see a risk of further charges in Q3?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's probably a little premature to kind of jump into when we are going to be done with it.  I think it's fair to say that we've done a very thorough review of the bulk of the projects.  We did expect some risk to be addressed to.  And, I think it's fair to say that the majority is being addressed, 900 is being addressed, 900 over those three divisions.  I would not rule out that there are charges coming for the remainder of the fiscal year.  However, the vast majority of what we would expect and imagine at this point in time given what we have seen from the project review is being covered by <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>I think as far as SIS is concerned, that is I think more isolated matter with regards to the project we have just received, the cancellation by our customer, so those &#x20AC;100 million which one can expect <mark type="inaudible" /> certainly will, let's say, be the material charge in Q2.  We do not expect any further charges for the remainder of the fiscal year in SIS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the breakdown was concerned, the 900 million, about 600 in power, about 200 in mobility and about 100 million in SIS.  That's all what we expect for this fiscal <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Andreas Willi of JPMorgan.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Two questions please.  The first one, you said earlier that in power generation, you target a split of one-third service, one-third turnkey, one-third product.  Could you just give us an indication where you are today in terms of what you have basically already in your backlog which obviously will determine the split over the next few years?  And the second question on your turnkey ability, particularly in power generation where you blame part of it on the market, but obviously there are competitors, quite a few out there, that continue to execute well in the same difficult market, maybe there are differences in the supply chain and differences in the in-house value added.  But, overall, are you not worried that Siemens in power chain just doesn't have project execution capabilities that are not just related to changing a few top management members?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Coming to the first part, the backlog, I want to give you an indication.  So, the current backlog is roundabout 40% service business and the remaining is &#x2013; the remainder is product and turnkey business.  I don't blame it on the market.  I think we need to face that we have not executed well.  And it's my commitment that we will implement actions and measures to do better as of today.  And, the third one, the capability, I strongly believe that we have capability in turnkey business and we will also continue to selectively look into those kind of business, but under the condition that we earn money with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andreas, if I may add to that, I think what we have seen in the very thorough project review was, as far as group costs are concerned, that project researchers have been fundamentally over-sledged by the number of projects which have been taken in as orders, as well as which are just about to be executed at the projects.  Having said that, what that in essence means is that first of all we have delays in the projects.  Those delays lead in essence to the fact that our finding price offered to our suppliers are expiring and therefore the company has to face much more unfavorable procurement condition as it was originally agreed upon.  So, that is innovative root cause of the sequence of events what we are seeing.  So now, going forward, with the announcement, and I think Peter L&#xF6;scher has already mentioned that in November, that we take on much less of the turnkey project, we stretch out of the projects research that's been eased out over time and therefore there is comfort that in 2009 those executions will be done as far as they relate to the over-stretching of project management field and research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Should we therefore expect order intake to fall from now as the mix changes, but also you become more cautious in general?  I mean -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think after the third, it will be natural that, let's say, the growth sequence might ease down a little bit, but the quality of earnings certainly is going to be positively affected by that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of your supply agreements, you said obviously they were running out, but that's something you should have known about, I mean you knew that they would run out.  So, why is this such a surprise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the surprise &#x2013; I think the result has more been the fact that the delays had not been expected to be as lasting.  So, the crippling events come from the fact that the project resource is going to execute on time and then will be running into uncertainties about how long the suppliers will stick to their agreed-upon promises.</p>

          <p>Okay.  Operator, can we have the next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Peter Reilly with Deutsche Bank.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Peter Reilly from Deutsche Bank. Two questions please.  Firstly, in the press release, you say that the 900 million represents the largest piece of any additional financial burden in 2008.  Does that also cover the potential cost of the SG&amp;A reduction plan or is that an additional amount of charges, which is on top of the comments today?  And then, secondly, are there any longer term strategic implications of the review conducted?  I am thinking primarily of the IT outsourcing business where it's often seen to outsiders to be a rather strange business to have inside Siemens.  Are you considering anything more fundamental and strategic like maybe exiting that area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, let me first maybe clarify on the 900 million.  As we announced earlier during the course of the fiscal year, we said that we have vast project, all these resources in our project to figure out what the risks are.  So, we have gotten, let's say, a first report on that and that report makes us believe that we will see charges in the area of about 900 million in fiscal Q2 2008.  Those 900 again are about 600 in power, 200 in mobility and about 100 million in SIS.  So, we did not rule out that there might be further charges coming along the way in fiscal Q3 and Q4.  However, we are also quite certain that we will have covered the vast majority of the charges already with the 900 million.  Any other charges, such as restructuring charges on, let's say, on SG&amp;A or maybe potentially other related charges, are not part of the 900 million.</p>
          <p>On the SIS, I think the company made it very clear that high risk, low margin, capital intensive outsourcing business has not been the focus of the strategic orientation.  SIS is poised to come up and develop industry solutions along the three sectors and that's what their charter is, everything else I think would be premature, and we'll report on the progress as soon as we have news to that.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Okay.  Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Operator, could we take the next question please?</p>

      </speaker>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Scott Babka with Morgan Stanley.  Please proceed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Good morning.  I was wondering if you could please clarify if the charges taken in PG include losses on the OL3 [Olkiluoto 3] nuclear contract in Finland or if that is one of the reviews that's still continuing?  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning sir.  One simple question, why are your debts <mark type="inaudible" /> you don't see any pressures from suppliers either in your industrial automation or in the other industry unit and only in this tri-named unit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think the reason that we do not have those supplier-ready topics in other areas is that, first of all, those product businesses are turning very, very well.  The resources are much aligned with capacities and commitments to the customers.  So therefore it is, I think, a very well run operation there.  So Siemens as a company is able to manage that, there are a few spots though where we do have root causes and it's important, Roland, there is to have root causes which eventually cause delays and those delays cause let's say, renegotiations or running out of timelines with the suppliers.  The root cause clearly is on project management, the root cause clearly is that revisions or part revisions had been over his head in terms of capacity planning.  I think that's just a clear statement, and we needed to thoroughly investigate and audit into the topics we have seen already in the last recent quarters and our visibility has got to the bottom of that and that's why we announced to the market that we expect those charges in Q2 and that we will complete the review any time soon.  But again I think it's important to know that we do expect the vast majority of the charges is being with the 900 million we expect to book in fiscal Q2 2008.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I am just trying to understand, particularly in the Power division; I guess there are three issues here; one is the actual prices and terms that the contracts were struck at, historical turnkey contracts; two is the supply problems that are being highlighted; and three is absolute execution.  Can you give us a bit more sense of what is the main problem out of those three: is it all three or is it concentrated in one area?  And going forward, the second question, any drivers of any potential future charges &#x2013; is that just going to be related to suppliers or could there be, do you think you can iron out the execution problems? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well let me repeat again.  I think also what Joe Kaeser said, it's an issue primarily with execution of the project with project management, with an underestimation of the binding period of supply and furthermore an issue of underestimating capacity in terms of resources in engineering.  So going forward, we, as I said, implemented actions, we will not accept an offer anymore before we have secured critical components and supplies and before we have identified the necessary resources in terms of capacity in engineering and also in capacities in our plan.  So that's the process which has been implemented and is followed thoroughly by the CEO of the divisions and also by myself and my CFO.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So, you're basically saying you need to get everything in place before you take on a contract?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will not be an issue going forward.  It was part of the problem in the past, but as I said, that belongs also to the securitization of key component supply, which I have mentioned.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, guys.  Couple of questions.  I joined late, so if you've covered some of this, I apologize.  First of all, can you talk about how these charges actually pan out on a cash basis, because I'm guessing it's not all cash?  And then secondly, on a recent conference you put up a slide looking at the breakdown of recent orders within power generation and what percentage of those orders have been started and even from 2004, 2005, about 20% of the orders won had not yet been started, is what I think the slide was saying, and I'm just curious whether that is in some way related to some of the problems we're discussing this morning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi Timm.  I'm not sure I should congratulate on the owner but I think that's a different topic to address elsewhere in the conference.  Let me come back to the topic we have at hand here, and that's right on the cash topic.  You are absolutely right, it's not all cash related.  There will be little impact in the current fiscal quarter on cash, I would expect that to be let's say about 100 million out of 900. About 400 million of that will be during the course of fiscal 2008.  In total, we do expect the 900 million to be cash relevant going forward at the rate of about, I would guess about 700 million and about 200 million will be write-offs for assets and related topics, we have already accounted for good cash in the past.</p>
          <p>So, that's about &#x2013; at this point in time, I won't give some guidance on cash. Then the second topic has been on the recent order backlog.  It is indeed true and very much related to that chart, we have been showing recently and that's also a way we go about the issue.  And as Peter L&#xF6;scher has mentioned in his introductory remarks, that we clearly do have to address this topic as a legacy topic and so many of those orders which have been investigated and those are at the end here relate back to 2004 and 2005. So</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, in essence, what this audit has been all about and the investigation has been all about that you really make sure that we have addressed all the potential issues, which are related to what Wolfgang Dehen has been relating to in his remarks.  So it is indeed 2004, 2005, and 2006 and that's what I think the charges in the majority are all about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe one quick follow-up. I mean, you guys are committed to improving disclosure. I just wanted to follow-up one of Andreas' questions, I wasn't sure if I understood the response correctly.  You almost you &#x2013; you described the target breakdown for the Power business, third product, third service, third turnkey. I think when you talked about today, you said that about 40% of the backlog was service and the remaining 60 was split between product and turnkey. Are those numbers correct and then in the interest of some improved transparency, can you breakdown that 60% a little further and let us know how much is product and how much is turnkey?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Timm, at some point in time this is certainly something which needs to be addressed a bit more closely and I would say probably expect that this is something to be discussed in the Investors' Day for energy which we have set as a date for June 30th, 2008 where we then should go into the depth of the divisions and the characteristics of the business as we have done at the Healthcare Day together with the division to make sure that the business is well understood.</p>
          <p>At this point in time, I think what we wanted to do is to inform our investors as timely as about possible about the progress of the ongoing audit.  You might have noticed that we have been initiating that audit after our disappointing quarter of &#x2013; actually already fiscal 2007, then we had another one-off charge in power generation in fiscal Q1, 2008 which had prompted us to actually accelerate that audit and put more resources to it to make sure that we get to the bottom of that as quickly as we can.  Now today we give you first update which unfortunately is material, as material as it needed to be communicated to the market and a further update will come during our fiscal Q2 conference call, end of April.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Operator, could we have the next question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of William Mackie with MainFirst Bank, please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, very good morning, thank you. A couple of questions please.  Firstly, on the grounds of quantifying the issue, could you just specify the level of what total volume of turnkey projects in the order backlog that we are discussing and also whether the 62 contracts under discussion encompasses all of the turnkey projects that are outstanding within fossil.  And then within fossil, I don't think we've yet had a disclosure regarding the level of sales that were expected to trade through in this division when you provide that data?</p>
          <p>And then lastly, in the Transportation or Mobility segments, you've identified 90 million of the 200 million.  Could you throw a little more light on the 110 million of additional charges within the rest of the order backlog in transportation?  Is it just broadly based or are there other specific programs or projects that we should be aware of similar to Combino?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, William, for the first part of your question, the order backlog as of end of last fiscal year in the turnkey projects have been round about &#x20AC;6 billion and as I said more than 50% of it will be worked through in '08 and round about 35% in '09.  So the investigation is including all turnkey projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as Mobility is concerned, the 110 million now described in detail are distributed amongst other projects, most of them in the magnitude of roundabout 10 million.  For example, one project is a delivery in India to Bombay and other one in Puerto Rico.  So, these are distributed projects not exceeding 10 million per project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One follow-up if I may, you mentioned that I think about 80% of the revenues are linked to the 23 projects where you completed reviews or that &#x2013; I beg your pardon, the 35 projects where you have completed reviews.  Should we also assume that approximately 80% of the risk in the turnkey projects has been assessed with the 35 reviews that are complete?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the 39 projects which have been analyzed as of today include the most critical projects like turnkey project as I said critical consortia situation and also countries where they have not used to do business in the recent years and consortia and high impact from supply base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Then perhaps a follow-up, looking at the projects under review, the main point has been with regard to '04, '05, and '06 contracts and yet your change in risk acceptance and risk management for future project is only quite recent.  So, what confidence can you give us about the orders you accepted with regard to 2007?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's true that we have implemented the risk management process in early 2007 and also looked into selective bidding in 2007.  I think what I would like to confirm is what I said in the opening remarks, that the fossil business in 2009 &#x2013; 2010, excuse me, will be in the range of 7% to 9%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as far as the backlog is concerned for order intake for 2007, I think it is fair to say that the order intake calculations and subsequent reviews show a much higher risk contingency as we used to have in 2004 or 2005.  However, it is important that we have our project resources available to execute on what already has been, so and in quality higher &#x2013; much higher contingency.  However, again it is important that our project resources executing the project.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Operator, next question please?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Jochen Klusmann with BHF-BANK. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I am just trying to come back to what total damage could be in a worst case scenario, I mean you said in your press release the 900 million is the vast majority, but is there any chance that you can provide us with the number 1.5 billion or whatever it could be if we took a worst case scenario?  And on that can you rule out as of today that there will be additional charges coming in '09 because you can't account for those charges in '08?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is, I am kind of surprised when I listen to Peter L&#xF6;scher's remarks, I mean, in January he said that &#x2013; in the conference call he does never want to hear the name Combino again and now two months later the topic picks up or pops up again.  I am just surprised how much patience you guys have, I mean to me it appears that they don't have a lot more chances going forward.  And maybe just to confirm that, I mean do I understand you guys right saying that you think those problems that occurred now just reflects the past and you don't see any need to chance anything about the structure of the company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may start on the &#x2013; I think worst case scenario you are hinting to, I think it is premature to conclude an audit with any worst case scenario which is ongoing.  So, what we wanted to achieved today is to give the market update on where we stand in the audit.  We have looked at the vast majority of the projects not only quantitatively but also, let's say the qualitatively challenged projects.  We do believe that with the 900 million we have covered the vast majority and I think that already should give investors confidence that if we talk about vast majority this is not going to be a direct matter again on what we have been releasing to the markets.  So we do expect to have the big rocks identified and account for it and however we also want to remain cautious about whether or not we will see any additional charges in Q3 and Q4 because we have now just concluded the audit.  So I think that's all we can say at this point in time and we really do want to stick to facts here rather than speculate on what could come or should not have come.</p>
          <p>On 2009 additional charges, I think theoretically of course you are right, there could be project-related topics, which cannot be accrued for since the project is positive. But I think there is already a significant improvement to what we have to deal with at this point in time.  But I think we better stick to what our CEO for power has said on what he commits or he and his management team commit to in 2009, 7 to 9%.  I think that's something we ought to measure the division against and we will give quarterly updates on where we stand on that topic.  On the Combino, Heinrich?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as far as the Combino is concerned I think we have been very open and transparent to you this day, because what we want to highlight when the team briefed Peter L&#xF6;scher for the Q1 and mentioned that probably they have full transparent about the project, they just did not have the basis.  If you can clearly draw out of the explanation I have given that we have to change overall 475 cars and today we have completed 241.It's impossible to make a full risk assessment; there are 45% of the let's say repairs still need to be made.  So, clearly we have made our today's increase of provisions by 40 million so the best assessment.  The final assessment of the risk can only be done if the specific cars of a customer's orders are open.  And this is not the case for all our customers' orders.  And that's the reason &#x2013; we should have done this kind of messaging to you already from the very beginning, but as Peter said we learned, and now transparency is for us a clear guidance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just one follow-up on the Combino then.  When do you think that the rebuilding of all the 475 cars will be completed?</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="a">

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, gentlemen, a couple of questions.  First of all, just as a follow up to Scott's question on Areva Framatome.  I take on board the fact that the provision does not include your 34% stake or any further provision against the OL3 contract, perhaps Joe or Mr. Dehen, you could just give us an update of that contract in Finland and if you expect Areva as and when to update the market this year whether you believe that you may be accountable for some further provisions against the OL3?  The second issue is just on raw materials.  I missed the first part of the conference call; could you just give me a very rough idea, a very qualitative idea of how much of these write-downs or how much of the problem is actually relating to hedging of raw material contracts?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would start with the second part of the question.  So, as I said we are not fully through with our analysis of the project, so we have a deep and thorough overview on 39, so I would like to ask you to be patient a little bit.  I would deliver the answer to the question as soon as the remaining 23 project's done.  I think if I would guess now, I think that would be not the right answer.  So, in Areva, you know that we are responsible for the conventional island and we have a good understanding of the situation as of today.  So, I cannot comment on Areva because we don't know &#x2013; we know about the progress in that project, but we can't see what the next steps will be in terms of 2009.  We have a good and solid understanding of 2008 and the beginning of 2009.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you.  Operator, I would like to take the last question now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes sir.  Your final question comes from the line of Johannas Reefe with CommonWest. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello.  Good morning, maybe two follow on questions.  First, the tax impact of all the charges, can you give us any indications on this?  And secondly, maybe I missed this, but what is the background of the cancellation of the project in UK?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  How are you Johannas?  Let me try on those two.  Tax impact certainly &#x2013; pre-tax, so the 900 million charges or the up to 900 million charges which we assumed for the current fiscal quarter is pre-tax.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And it will all be accepted by the tax authority here, you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's probably a question to ask the tax authorities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it will be hung up early, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But at this point in time there is no reason to believe that this would not be accepted, since it's ordinary course of business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, cost related to building products and systems, so therefore there is no reason not to believe that this would not be tax deductible.  I think on the cancellation topic on SIS, we obviously view this as very unfortunate if a customer is not satisfied with us.  But we have to let's say accept the customer's notice.  We are in direct negotiations with the customer of how we, let's say, remedy the situation, but at the same token though I think it is decent that we are conservative on what that potential outcome could be in terms of resources and other commitments to other suppliers related to the project and that's what we are taking care of.  I think that's all that what we can say at this point in time; everything else will be, let's say, communicated once we have a settlement with the customer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Is it right to assume that SIS was not a very profitable contract?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean certainly, now it is not a very profitable contract, and I think we need to deal with the reality. It doesn't do us a lot of good to let's say assess a situation which does not exist anymore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>With this, I would like today to end today's session.  Thank you very much.</p>
