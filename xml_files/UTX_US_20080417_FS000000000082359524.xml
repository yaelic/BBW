          <p>Good day everyone and welcome to the United Technologies' First Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.  On our call today will be Greg Hayes, the Vice President of Accounting and Finance; Jim Geisler, Vice President of Finance; and Ken Parks, Director of Investor Relations.  Today's call is being carried live on the Internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC's homepage at www.utc.com.</p>
          <p>The company reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>And now at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Hayes. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Dana and good morning, everyone. As you saw in the press release this morning, UTC had a solid start to the year driven by strong performance across the businesses. Revenue was up 12%, which is 7 points of organic growth. Earnings per share were $1.03 and that's about 26% over last year.</p>
          <p>Ex of the impact of the last year's Otis EU charge and gains in restructuring in both periods, EPS was up 18%, a really great start to the year. FX generated a small benefit in the quarter with a positive impact from the euro partially offset by foreign exchange headwinds out of Pratt &amp; Whitney's Canadian operations. We invested this benefit along with some of the good news from the businesses into restructuring, about $0.02 of EPS.</p>
          <p>Adjusted for restructuring and one-time items, four of the six units reported double-digit revenue growth and five of our six businesses reported double-digit profit growth. All three of our commercial businesses saw margin expansion in the quarter, with Otis and Fire &amp; Security up 50 basis points and Carrier up 40 basis points.</p>
          <p>This is a result of continuing tight cost control and good execution across the businesses. Both Pratt &amp; Whitney and Hamilton Sundstrand saw strong top line growth as they continued to ramp up production in the face of a record backlog. And Sikorsky, despite shipping only 30 helicopters in the quarter, grew profits 17% and margins 100 basis points. A good quarter all around, and the kind of performance you've come to expect from UTC.</p>
          <p>I'll let Ken take you through the business unit details in just a few minutes. But let me spend a couple of minutes addressing the question we've been hearing from all of you for the last couple of months. And that question of course is, have you see many signs of a slowdown in your business as a result of the slowdown in the U.S. economy? As we all would have expected, there are some signs of moderation in order rates in a few of our shorter cycle businesses. But for the vast majority of UTC, the economic environment still looks very favorable.</p>
          <p>Looking now at page three in our webcast, we tried to lay this out by major market segments. First on the commercial aero side, we continue to see good growth on the OEM side of the business and backlogs remain very robust. Commercial aftermarket growth did slow a bit to about 6% in the quarter, and high fuel prices are of course impacting the airlines.</p>
          <p>However, we still expect RPMs to grow 3 to 4% this year on strength in business travel and emerging markets. We're watching the RPM trends closely, since they are typically impacted relatively quickly by consumer spending and economic downturns.</p>
          <p>Emerging markets, they remain buoyant in spite of the slowdown in the U.S. economy. Foreign exchange also looks to be a tailwind for the year, although as we saw this quarter, a weak dollar is not universally advantageous to all of our businesses.</p>
          <p>Commercial construction order growth, while lower than last year, remains solid even in the U.S., where Otis saw order growth of nearly 20% in this quarter and Carrier's commercial HVAC business saw order growth of 5%. Even Hamilton Sundstrand's industrial businesses, some of our most economically sensitive businesses, continued to see solid order growth in the quarter.</p>
          <p>So where do we see the weaknesses? Well, the U.S. residential business continues to be a challenge with housing starts now expected to be down nearly 35% from the already depressed levels of 2007. No surprise there. We're also beginning to see weakness in orders in our refrigeration business, both in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
          <p>Fire &amp; Security's U.S. residential business, which sells through the major retail chains, has also been negatively impacted and we're also seeing a bit of a slowdown in F&amp;S's European electronic security business, primarily in the U.K.</p>
          <p>Let's keep this in perspective. We should note that these markets combined represent only a little more than 10% of UTC's total revenues. So no surprises here. As you expect, as we see the U.S. and a few of these European economies slowing, we are preparing by taking costs out of the business.</p>
          <p>We invested over 30 million this quarter in restructuring and we anticipate additional restructuring actions throughout the remainder of the year. Total restructuring could approach 200 million for the full year, funded by good news on foreign exchange, continued strength in the businesses, and a few one-time gains in the back half of the year.</p>
          <p>I'll also point out that investment in new products like Pratt &amp; Whitney's geared turbofan and Hamilton's platforms on the 787 will continue to be a priority for us. These investments will fuel continued growth for years to come.</p>
          <p>Overall E&amp;D was $29 million higher year-over-year in the first quarter. But we continue to expect 200 million of growth for the full year, so there is some headwind in the next three quarters from E&amp;D.</p>
          <p>Although these trends will make the back half of the year more challenging, we remain comfortable with the guidance for both the individual business units as well as our overall UTC earnings and cash flow guidance for the year.</p>
          <p>Just a word on Q1 cash, free cash flow as you saw came in at about 65% of net income, not unexpected given the normal seasonality at Carrier, as well as lower shipments from Sikorsky and the inventory build on the aero side.</p>
          <p>Let me also point out that these high inventory levels remain an irritant to you and to us and fixing this problem is a priority for all of us here at UTC. Bottom line on cash flow for the year though, it is unchanged. We still expect to meet our usual standard of free cash flow equaling or exceeding net income.</p>
          <p>Finally, we repurchased $801 million of UTC shares during the first quarter and we continue to expect repurchases to total about 2 billion for the year.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to Ken to take you through the business unit detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, Greg. Before I begin on page 4, let me remind you I will talk to the segment results with restructuring added back and excluding one-time items just as we usually do.</p>
          <p>Otis delivered another strong quarter, with profit growth of 19% on revenue growth of 16%.  Foreign exchange contributed approximately half of the growth. Revenues increased in all geographic regions, led by double-digit growth in North America, China, and Russia, reflecting the robust new equipment backlog entering the year.</p>
          <p>Margins expanded 50 basis points despite a continued shift in sales mix towards new equipment as the Otis team continues to execute their strategic initiatives on product and other cost reductions, key logistics acceleration, and field performance on new equipment installations.  New equipment orders were up 20% in the quarter, reflecting double-digit increases in all geographic regions.</p>
          <p>At Carrier, operating profit increased 15% year-over-year on 9% higher revenues. Operating margins expanded 40 basis points in the quarter. Foreign exchange contributed about six points of the revenue growth and nine points of the profit growth.</p>
          <p>The commercial HVAC business with double-digit revenue and earnings growth in all regions more than offset continued housing-related weakness in North America. Carrier has recently seen moderating growth in commercial HVAC orders and slowing order rates in our refrigeration units particularly in the U.S. The overall moderation in order trends is consistent with our expectations as we enter the year. At UTC Fire &amp; Security, performance was solid as revenue was up 28% and profits were up 38% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Favorable foreign exchange contributed about eight points of the revenue and profit growth. Acquisitions contributed the remainder of the revenue growth. Revenue declines of approximately 30% in the U.S. residential business and low single digits in the electronic security business in the U.K., entirely offset growth in the other regions and segments.</p>
          <p>Operating margin expanded 50 basis points year-over-year to 7.6%. Benefits of prior restructuring actions primarily from the Kidde factory rationalizations and cost containment initiatives were partially offset by the impact of lower U.S. residential volume and recent acquisition and integration costs.</p>
          <p>Pratt &amp; Whitney revenues increased nearly $0.5 billion or 18% in the quarter led by 30% growth at Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada and Power Systems revenues that more than doubled. Military revenues were up approximately 15% on favorable mix, as well as, higher engine deliveries year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Operating profit improved 15% in the quarter, reflecting the higher revenues, partially offset by the unfavorable FX impact of the Canadian dollar and higher year-over-year E&amp;D investments supporting new program wins. The combined impact of these headwinds on operating margin was more than 100 basis points in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Hamilton Sundstrand revenues were up 11% in the quarter with aerospace OEM, aftermarket and industrial all growing at double-digit rates. Operating profit grew 3% and margins contracted in the quarter as lower margin commercial volume accounted for substantially all of the aero OEM growth.</p>
          <p>In addition, Hamilton reported incremental costs on fixed-price development programs in the quarter. Hamilton is currently assessing the risk due to the recent rescheduling of the 787 program however these changes clearly will put pressure on Hamilton's full year operating profit growth guidance of $100 million.</p>
          <p>At Sikorsky, operating profit were 17% on revenues that were essentially unchanged year-over-year. As a result, operating margin expanded 100 basis points in the quarter and reached 8%.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 30 large helicopters, 14 military and 16 commercial. Since the end of the first quarter, eight additional aircraft have been delivered and we continued to expect more than 200 larger aircraft deliveries for the year.</p>
          <p>Now, I will turn it over to Greg to wrap up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, Ken. So another solid quarter, 7% organic revenue growth, 18% earnings growth, continued backlog expansion in all of our businesses. In fact, we ended the quarter with $60 billion in backlog, a record for UTC.</p>
          <p>While there are always opportunities for better performance in our business, we know that the balance of UTC works to deliver superior results in good times and bad. In the face of uncertain economic conditions, we are also well-positioned to reduce cost through restructuring and continued ACE implementation, factories, the supply chain, and the back offices. All of this is why we remain confident in our full-year guidance of earnings per share in the range of 4.65 to 4.85 with revenues of $59 billion and free cash flow equal or exceeding net income.</p>
          <p>As you all know, UTC's Board last week elected Louis Ch&#xEA;nevert, as Chief Executive Officer of UTC. This is a significant milestone for the company, but all know it is not a change in direction. Creating shareholder value continues to be our number one priority under Louis. We'll do it by focusing on strong top-line growth from innovative products and global market leading franchises, cost reduction, and margin improvement and disciplined cash flow redeployment; all of that executed by an experienced leadership team. We're confident we will deliver on our guidance for '08 with top line in excess of worldwide GDP growth and make investments in the company for its solid 2009.</p>
          <p>Let me stop there. Let's just open up the call to questions. Dana?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Greg. Can you maybe just touch on, I guess, Hamilton's performance? I think you touched on some of the fixed-price issues maybe call out what the programs were. And you talked about, I mean, it just looked like disappointing incremental margin performance. I'm just wondering, is there a downside plan now given the change in R&amp;D in the first quarter performance? And then also touch on Sikorsky's performance with all the issues that kind of held back deliveries this quarter and what the year looks like for Sikorsky.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Let me start with Hamilton. As you saw, margins were down 140 basis points, not really unexpected. And I think Dave mentioned that he expected that in the conference back in February. The fact is OEM orders were up strong. We saw, I think, a 12% increase in OEM deliveries and most of those of course went out with very low margin as they typically do on the OEM side. So, no surprise.</p>
          <p>Aftermarket was strong, as we had expected, and I think maybe the surprise a little bit was on some of these fixed-price development contracts. We are working on the A400M on a fixed-price development contract. We've got some work at one of our subsidiaries in the U.K. doing some helicopter work that was also a bit of an overrun.</p>
          <p>These aren't big numbers. We're talking less than 5 or $10 million on each of these programs. But again, with only 3% growth in the quarter they kind of shine through as a little bit of a bump. Overall though, I still think Dave is confident in his guidance. We are confident in Dave's guidance for the quarter or for the year rather. And we'll have to wait and see as Boeing finalizes the reschedule of the 787, how that impacts us, but clearly it's going to have some challenge with that but nothing to derail us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if you look at, you said order growth, was it order growth you touched on for commercial aircraft...market of 6% or was that sales growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sales growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What was the order growth for Hamilton and Pratt in the quarter for aftermarket in particular, catalog spares?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Overall commercial aftermarket growth was about 6% across UTC. It was flattish at Pratt and it was up kind of high single digits at Hamilton. So, if you think about the Pratt, just to maybe digress for a second, it was flattish, but that's coming off of 20% growth in last year's first quarter. We also saw a lot of inductions into the engine center, just that the average repair cost is a little bit lower than we had seen last year. So, I don't see any big trend here. I think the engines are still coming off wing, as we would expect, and the orders will be there by the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Steve, book-to-bill at Pratt was about 1, so the order growth was similar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Last question is you touched on inventories already and receivable performance clearly wasn't great in the quarter, but if you look at the line of business within UTC in the family, what were the pluses from a cash flow standpoint and the minuses? Who were the generators and who were the users?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the biggest generator was obviously Otis. As they typically do, they have a very strong first quarter, but they had really strong performance across their businesses. Fire &amp; Security had a good quarter from a cash standpoint. The aero businesses, not so good as you would expect when you see inventories grow like this and as well as Sikorsky, because they only shipped 30 helicopters. They missed some shipments at the end of the quarter which also would have had some cash associated with them. So, commercial side is pretty good. Carrier, really just normal seasonality; I'm not concerned. It's the inventory growth that obviously we have our eye on.</p>
          <p>I think Steve, just to touch just for a second on Sikorsky because we have talked about the 30 helicopters, the backlog is obviously robust. We've got $12 billion of backlog at Sikorsky and as you look at the commitment for the year, which is 200-plus large helicopters, shipping 30 helicopters in the quarter is light. But a couple of things to keep in mind: We were out at the factory just the other day, Jim and I walked the floor. The pipeline is full. Parts are there. They are building these helicopters.</p>
          <p>And what we're seeing really is a big mix shift. Last year we shipped eight of the L models. The L models have about 4,000 hours of assembly. This year we're shipping Ms, and in the quarter, I think we shipped 10 Ms versus two last year. They have got about 12,000 hours. We also shipped some R models, Romeo models; they're about 24,000 hours of assembly. So, what we really have is this big mix shift where we've got to get productivity on the floor. We've got to get these helicopters moving down the line at the right pace.</p>
          <p>I think we've shipped about eight helicopters so far this month. I'm not concerned at all about the quarter. We've told you we're going to make those 200 helicopters but there's a little bit of a slow start and we feel pretty good about it.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Joe Campbell with Lehman Brothers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I wondered if you could say a few words, and I don't want to know about the tactics of it, but about the strategy and why it is that you would like to acquire Diebold?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Joe. Diebold to us is a very attractive property for a couple reasons. It's number two in the world in ATMs. It has a great global footprint with good presence in China and India and it offers margin expansion opportunity. Margins right now or at least the last time they reported were down in the mid single-digits and that's where UTC's businesses were back in the mid 90s.</p>
          <p>One of the keys to that business also, Joe, is in growing margins and providing good service is to have a exceptionally good local service network, and you know we have that in Otis. We're building it in some of the other businesses and we think we could bring some of that management and expertise to the business. So, I think in a lot of ways, it looks very much like a UTC commercial business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Deane Dray of Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning Deane.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning Deane.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was hoping you could address the raw material headwinds on Carrier vis-&#xE0;-vis the copper versus earlier in the year and where that stands in terms of &#x2013; might that eat into any of your contingency?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, as we look at the first quarter results, really not much headwind from commodities at Carrier net of the pricing recovery. I think our average price for copper was around 321 or 322. I'll compare that to today's 396 or 397 spot. So, first quarter it's a light shipments quarter. I think where we're going to see commodity headwind will be in second and third quarter. I think Geraud could quantify that; it will be about $50 million of potential headwind.</p>
          <p>And the reason it's not more is we do have a certain percentage of our suppliers on long-term agreements so we've locked in some of the copper. It's about 40%. And we have also locked in most of the steel. So, as steel has run up since the beginning of the year, we have really been protected by the LTA. So, we don't expect it to be a huge headwind, but $50 million is still, it's a third of the operating profit growth at Carrier this year. So, they've got some work to do to take some costs out and to contain that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the same $50 million that you talked about at the beginning of the year, so that hasn't changed, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It has not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good, and then just at Otis for a moment, 20% order growth looks stellar in this environment. How about on the negative side? In December, you talked a bit about seeing a few push outs, a few cancellations. I felt maybe that was related to some financing on smaller projects. How has that changed at the margin over the course of the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It really hasn't changed, Deane, at the margin. I would tell you we still see a few of the smaller projects being deferred or delayed. The big stuff though is still going out at record levels. I mean, 20% growth in North America, 20% order growth rate worldwide, strong orders in China. It's hard to find a soft spot outside of maybe a Southern Europe for Otis right now. But again, I think, we're very confident those guys are going to deliver for the year and no bumps in the road there.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Just a couple of things. One, Greg, is a lot of these working capital issues that you addressed, they've sort of been nagging for a while. What is the management team doing to sort of change the fact that we've kind of heard this for maybe three quarters or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've actually heard it for about two and a half years, I think, just to be fair, Howard. Inventory has been growing. It's been the result of two things primarily, strong organic revenue growth, as well as disruptions in the supply chain. And organic growth is still strong, although it's abating somewhat. It's still good growth. And the supply chain issues are coming I'll say under control.</p>
          <p>Let me just point out, I think, it is the number one issue that we have in terms of working capital is how do we get inventory under control this year. And I touched on this a little bit back in February. It's those 32,000 suppliers. It's the 75% of our cost of sales that we don't directly control and we need to do more work in our supply chain and the supply base to get the ACE operating systems embedded in their thinking. We're down on the line of Sikorsky and we talked about an 80% fill rate to MRP from suppliers and 80% sounds like it's pretty good but the fact is that means you are missing 20% of what you need to assemble a helicopter at the station.</p>
          <p>So, there is still a lot of work to do in the supply base and that will be I think the focus. It's not going to happen today or tomorrow. We are working on it. It's going to take some time. We think we've got our factories where we want them to be from a productivity standpoint but it's got to be in the supply chain next.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, you are up almost $1 billion in inventory. Now some of that I grant you is currency, but it's almost $1 billion in a quarter. I mean, could you just articulate what you think you could do in terms of some turns for the year from where we are? And do you think you could be below year-end inventories?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's just dissect it. I think inventory's up $975 million roughly; you back out FX, that's about 800 million net of inventory growth. 350 million of that is just normal Carrier seasonality and that of course will turn into receivables here in Q2 and it will get back into cash in the third and fourth quarter. On the aero side, you got a little bit of R&amp;D that's capitalized on the balance sheet. That's some of the Sikorsky programs as well as Hamilton.</p>
          <p>Having said all that, you still have 300 million, 400 million of growth at the aero units that we need to address. I will tell you inventory turns in total were down about a tenth this quarter versus year-end. Our focus obviously is to improve inventory turns. I'm not going to give you a forecast today because quite frankly anything I tell you I'm not positive we could actually meet it. But it is a priority for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that's pretty fair. Just two other things. One, we all are aware of the difference between the JT8D and newer version engines. How are you going about managing the wind down of that business? I know it's largely spares today and it's probably, what, maybe 5% of your aftermarket business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and in fact I think that number is closer to about 10%, Howard, so I tell you we have been managing that down, the impact of the JT8s going out of inventory pretty well for the last 10 years. And it is not a surprise, it's continuing to happen. But we are still shipping 400 large commercial engines out of Pratt last year, probably a similar number this year. The V2500 fleet is growing. We're also of course taking share on the aftermarket through aftermarket services. So the growth strategy at Pratt and the aftermarket is pretty clear. It is to capture more of our own work. It is also to capture more of everybody else's work. So I don't see this as a huge issue. It has been in front of us for a long time and I think they're managing it pretty well at Pratt &amp; Whitney.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I agree. I just wanted to make sure I, you had bounded it. I mean then last, on the geared fan, there will be some opportunities to sell some participation interest in that. How will we see that offset R&amp;D later in the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, we've assumed a certain level of partnership. As we gave guidance for the year, that $200 million of R&amp;D, about 125 million of that was at Pratt &amp; Whitney. That assumes some level of partner participation, maybe 3 or 35% and I think we are pretty comfortable with that level for the year. We signed up MTU so far. I think Hamilton has now signed up for a piece of the engine as well. So I think we are well on track and making good progress on the GTF from a technology standpoint and I think we feel pretty good about all the programs that the GTF has won.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from George Shapiro of Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning Greg. Just to pursue the inventories a little bit, you said 400 million in aero. How much of that would just be due to missed shipments at Sikorsky and how much is due to some of the tougher issues to get at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think maybe up to half of it, not quite half of that, would be the missed shipments at Sikorsky. If you just think about Sikorsky, had they been linear, delivering 50 helicopters a quarter, that's obviously not going to happen in the first quarter, but that's about half of it. And the rest of it, maybe it's just harder to get at supply chain inventory.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And also at Hamilton Sundstrand, how much of the inventory build maybe is reflecting not getting paid by Boeing on the 787 at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not a huge number. We continue to obviously bring hardware in. We have been working with our suppliers to try and push or hold some of that at the supply base. We've been trying to be very aggressive in terms of not bringing any more than we think we're actually going to ship. They did see inventory growth at Hamilton in the quarter. I would not attribute it all to 787. I think a bigger piece of it is really related to just a big ramp up in OEM volume across all of their product lines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, if we go back to Pratt for a minute, the Joint Strike Fighter engine problems that you had, was that a, shown as R&amp;D to Pratt this quarter? How do you handle that? Or was it a small number anyway?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is a cost-plus contract and I would tell you typically under cost-plus, the cost of the analysis, the cost of the fixed, most of that is covered by the contract. There really wasn't any incremental R&amp;D at Pratt &amp; Whitney that would have flowed through to the bottom line as a result of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then one last thing. At Pratt Canada, what did you see as book-to-bill, I mean clearly the deliveries were very robust.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, deliveries were up 30%, I believe. The revenues were up 30%. We shipped over 800 engines, but book-to-bill still remains about 1. So we have got a good backlog and it's remaining pretty strong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Nicole.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Nicole.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just the big picture as you step back and think about it, Greg, in your initial comments you talked a little bit about slight pockets of weakness as you look at Europe. Could you talk a little bit about as you see the tight credit markets impacting general commercial construction trends and then what's your outlook? Have you guys seen any slowdown in Asia and specifically China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with China, Nicole, and I say there really has not been any slowdown. I still see a very, very strong growth out of China. It's interesting and it is a great question because we keep I guess expecting to see some fallout of the credit crisis in commercial construction. As I said, Otis, it's up 20% and that is really around the world with the exception of Southern Europe where we saw, really, I think it was Spain primarily, where we saw a little bit of the weakness for the year. Other than that, we really have not seen much of an impact. Let me clear up on China. As we look at it year-over-year, fixed asset investments up about 24%, real estate investments up about 33%, large construction projects up about 22%. We don't make those numbers up; they actually come from the National Statistics Bureau of China. That is pretty good solid growth that's continuing in China, so, no spillover impact that we can see in our markets from the credit crisis, especially in the emerging markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I guess with respect to Sikorsky, can we just go back and think about, I mean, just given kind of the light revenue and shifts in the number &#x2013; in the quarter and you talked about how you've already shipped, I think you said eight, so far this month. I mean, as we sit here and look at that, you cited the next shift and kind of between L &amp; M and the hours that it takes to get it through. I mean presumably we knew that. Could you just give us some sense as you look back over the metrics that you've really shored up within Sikorsky in terms of past views and everything else? Where we are and how we should get comfortable that this isn't going to continue through the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the only thing I could tell you is that &#x2013; let me just tell you a couple of things. Obviously, it's got our attention. Louis has been focused on this for the last, I guess, almost two years since we had the initial &#x2013; the labor action down at Sikorsky back in 2006. I think Louis was down, he saw the new LOI, we've opened that down in West Palm Beach. I think he felt very good about what was going on down there, as I said. We look at the lines, the lines are full and I think it's just a question of coming down the learning curve more quickly than we are and so we got a little bit of a difficulty on the hours on the &#x2013; some of these newer models, as you would expect. But I think &#x2013; I don't really have a concern of hitting the 200 for the year. And just at the ACE operating system there, we're working this. There's going to get the goal here in the next year or so. I guess the &#x2013; I've got confidence in the team down there, we're going to perform.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And I guess justly lastly on M&amp;A, Jim, as you kind of step back and think about what's going on in the market, have you seen a willingness of potential sellers to come down on price? And based on the competitive landscape, would you guys expect to be getting more aggressive, absent Diebold?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say right now, Nicole, there are a lot of assets to consider, but it takes a while for sellers' expectations to reset sometimes. They might remember their stock price or some valuation that they could have gotten last year or recently. And so it takes them a while to reset, as well as a lot of industrial companies and folks that we might bid against or cover the same assets, have pretty strong balance sheets. So, we look at lots of different things, but like any other deal, Diebold included, we'll stay disciplined.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think it's interesting you mentioned about the steel, the long-term agreements, I mean, steel is notoriously hard to hedge. I mean, how long are these agreements in place for and when do you get exposed to the spot steel price again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>These are only the annual agreements, Nigel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So 2009, if we don't see the fuel price moderating, then that's when we'll start to see that come through. Okay. Secondly, you mentioned 787. You need to assess the impact on Hamilton. Is that a comment on E&amp;D spend, or is it supply chain, or is it both?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's all that. I think we've got a &#x2013; it'll have an impact on our own factory loads as we try to move some of these ships as that will have an impact on supply base. It's going to have an impact on E&amp;D. I just can't give you a great answer today on what the overall impact is. We love the program, we're going to continue to support them wholeheartedly, but it's kind of a &#x2013; we're in a little bit of the state of flux here, having just heard the announcement a week or so ago in terms of the rescheduling. We actually haven't had a formal modification, I think of the purchase order yet, so we'll get through that, and Dave is committed to his guidance for the year and we're going to figure out how to get the 787 within the guidance for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And then on refrigeration, you mentioned some weakness in the U.S. Is that a comment on just the stationary refrigeration or was that including the transportation as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it includes truck/trailer in North America, which has been slow really for the last year and a half or so, I guess, but it's really both pieces.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We also saw a little bit of slowness on container on the order rates and very, very strong shipment order, but order rates were down a little bit there. So, it's really a broader comment on the refrigeration business in total.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just finally then on residential, it looks like Trane's trying to put through 40% price increase, I think it's coming in June. Is Carrier planning that as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. In fact, we have not yet had a residential price increase, I think they were obviously looking at the market. But right now, we're just trying to get our costs in line to be very competitive in what has shaped up to be the most competitive market we've ever seen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, just a quick one on restructuring. Are you going to be flat and the gains could &#x2013; gains looking at restructuring, or do you expect to be net restructuring for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think right now as we would look at it, we would put &#x2013; we have $200 million of restructuring for the year. I would expect that gains will not equal restructuring. We'll probably have a little bit more restructuring. I can't give you an exact number. I don't know what the exact amount of the gains are, but clearly, as we go throughout the year, we've got good news on foreign exchange as we see at least ahead of us here in the second quarter, and some strong performance from our businesses. So we're going to take that good news and we're going to invest it in the restructuring.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen and Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. So you mentioned the FX good news. I mean, in your February meeting, you were talking about $1.44 on the euro. It's now $1.58. The renminbi is up; the Yen is up; the Canadian Looney is starting to behave. Could you quantify what you're now assuming in terms of FX and why you didn't raise your revenue estimates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we didn't raise our revenue estimates because FX, as we all know, it does move around quite a bit. Obviously, as we saw this quarter where we had 4% of the revenue growth came out of FX, there probably is more good news to come on the top line from FX if the euro stays where it is.</p>
          <p>I think one of the things that we need to keep in mind, and maybe the little bit of news this quarter on FX is, Pratt Canada has become a much bigger piece of the puzzle here. Their cost structure, obviously, is in Canadian dollars and in fact the Canadian dollar content has been going up as they are assembling a lot more engines. And their sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. So they have really felt the pinch over the last year or so, because really the last two years as the Looney has appreciated versus the dollar.</p>
          <p>Now, as we look forward to the back half of the year, if you were to keep the euro where it is today, the Looney, we still see good news from FX and probably more than what we saw in the first quarter. About half of that we had planned and the other half is probably opportunity. As we talked about opportunity, that's what we're talking about for potential restructuring funding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned that if FX moves around, which it does, so you were assuming $1.44 on the euro in your plan. Based on your current guidance, what's the number? What are you assuming?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yeah. If you play out the number today at 1.58 I believe, which is where the euro is, and you keep the Looney, you could see maybe &#x2013; again, versus last year, you might see another $0.10 or so of additional FX good news for the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cai, maybe just one other comment on that, because clearly, FX could be good news for the corporations and move throughout the year, particularly versus our plan, and we've seen a little bit of it in the first quarter. But I think we also have to keep in mind that the environment is toughening. There's probably going to be some offset to FX or it's certainly possible in the second half of the year. And I &#x2013; we don't think now is a good time for overreaching or over-promising. I don't think you want us to be in that position and we don't want to be in that position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right. If you look at the quarter, R&amp;D was only up, as you pointed, 29 million. So, that was kind of a surprise that it wasn't much. But SG&amp;A was up 50 bps, really a huge gain, about 240 million. Can you explain kind of why was the SG&amp;A up? Anything abnormal in there, and kind of how should we think about the build in both R&amp;D and SG&amp;A over the remainder of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let's do SG&amp;A first, Cai. Up about $240 million, as you said, year-over-year in the quarter. About half of that is related to acquisitions and FX combined. So you can kind of put that into one bucket. Then the other thing I'll point out to you is, you remember last year we set up the distribution for California Carrier business; that had some impact in the quarter. And then the rest of the growth is really just the growth related to the volume.</p>
          <p>Now, let's talk about R&amp;D for just a minute. As you pointed out, at $29 million year-over-year in the quarter, about a third of that is at Pratt, I would say. But as we told you all the way along, as we started in third quarter call last year going through our February meetings, you can anticipate the R&amp;D to be more timed to the second half of the year because of the programs that we're talking about at Pratt, the GTF-related programs. So, I guess I would attribute some of that to timing and we're still saying that &#x2013; and confident that R&amp;D will be an increase of around $200 million for the year. So it's clearly calendarized more to the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But SG&amp;A was 11.9% of sales. Is that what we're assuming for the year because it was 11.2 last year or &#x2013; what's SG&amp;A likely to run as a percent of sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we would not tell you to expect SG&amp;A as a percentage of sale to creep up.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So therefore, it's going to be a plus going forward year-over-year in terms of percentage of sales?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Right</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll give you one data point which is European operations, right? So for Carrier, you've got European operations, but their big selling season is really the second quarter. But you've got a cost infrastructure in place in the first quarter that's converting at a higher euro. So you've got more euro dollars on the front end on the cost side and you'll have the selling season after that. So, that's one reason of a long list.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Heidi Wood of Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit about whether you are seeing in aerospace &#x2013; in airlines actually with the five bankruptcies, talk about the Northwest/Delta merger. Can you give us a sense of bandwidth and maybe a high/low range of what you think this means for commercial aftermarket for Pratt, if we get some retirements particularly on the Northwest Airlines fleet? And also talk about what happens to the long-term service engine maintenance contract you have with Northwest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me try and dissect that if I can, Heidi. First of all, we have the bankrupt airlines &#x2013; I think we've all read about that. We've all seen that. Not really an impact to Pratt and Whitney or to UTC specifically; the small airlines, they didn't have any real exposure per se in terms of receivables or anything.</p>
          <p>The Northwest/Delta merger, of course those are two very important customers to Pratt and Whitney, they are Pratt &amp; Whitney powered fleets. I think the good news is, we look at this potential merger &#x2013; and I'll say, potential, because it is not done yet, is the fact that they don't have a lot of overlap on their route structure. As a result, we don't see this as really a plan to take a lot of capacity out of the two combined airlines. Obviously, there are synergies with cost, G&amp;A, and perhaps maintenance; but again, these are both very good customers. They fly Pratt powered aircraft and we value both of them. I think long-term it makes for a stronger industry by the consolidation. And with oil at $110 or $115 a barrel, whatever the heck it is today, I think there's going to be lots and lots of pressure on the combined airlines to push for a new more fuel efficient fleet. And I think that's why we are very confident with the GTF that it is going to give us a leg up in this competition going forward. We've got the C Series, we've got the MRJ, and we've got potential for other opportunities there. I think &#x2013; again, this is long-term good news for Pratt and Whitney and UTC and for the airline industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does the maintenance contract though spell potential opportunity? Or have you &#x2013; if they park that contract and they move on though, does that have implications &#x2013; does that move the needle in terms of earnings for Pratt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know that I could speculate in terms of what that impact is. We've got contracts in place. We do service for both of the fleets. It is hard to be specific. All I can tell you is what balance works at UTC and it works at Pratt and Whitney, and they're going to &#x2013; it's not really a bump in the road for them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, a couple more questions if you don't mind. Going back to the inventory question that has been asked a couple of times, can you give us a little more color, maybe flush out what you expect on quarterly progression, or maybe talk about what you think is reasonable to expect by year-end? What would you define as satisfactory progress on inventory?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Heidi, it's Jim. We've talked a lot about inventory today, and inventory is important. But &#x2013; and we must do better. Full stop. Period.  We've always focused on the big picture, and inventory is one element of cash flow. And this quarter, free cash flow was short of net income because of Carrier's seasonality. The proof in that is you can go back over the last four quarters and see that free cash flow has been in excess of net income when you take out Carrier's seasonality. So we'll have more for you in the future on inventory. Obviously, we have to do better, but we also have to remember free cash flow in total.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I know that. I just wondered if you wanted to put a stake in the sand as to where you start to find yourself feeling better about it. This is for context, that's all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think when we have better turns, lower inventories, we'll start to feel better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, on 787, Boeing finally came out with full rate production of 10 a month by 2012. Can you talk about what kind of investment might be required to take the rates there on your side? Are you capacitized now for seven?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. In fact, Heidi, we are capacitized for what we believe is the long-term production rate. We were actually thinking it could be up to 12 a month. So, I don't see there's any incremental investment. I think &#x2013; and keep in mind, 75 or 80% of this content comes out of our own supply base, so it's not a huge incremental piece to Hamilton. But there is really no big news there in terms of additional investment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Great. And just a couple quick ones. Hamilton Sundstrand, did I hear correctly that the industrial orders were solid? Was the book to bill north of one there?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the stock buyback, I think, I missed it. How much did you guys spend and how many shares did you buy back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>$801 million, I think an average price of about $71. So, do the math, about 11 million shares, Jim tells me.</p>

          <p>Hi, Joe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On cash flow and not on inventories &#x2013; on receivables actually, you had an upward tick there that was much more than the usual. I'm wondering, if you could give any color on that. Perhaps, Greg, like you did on inventories, if you could break it down into maybe the bigger chunks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me tell you that we've got a growth in the quarter that's &#x2013; a big chunk of it is due to the Otis service billings, which is typical for the first quarter, and an even higher number year-over-year because of the growth of that business. And that's probably a couple hundred million dollars or so. The next big chunk would be at Carrier, which is kind of the seasonality as we build into the selling season for the residential business in the US. And then the rest of it is fairly spread evenly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just organic growth related.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, because it was up more than the usual sort of last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of the up, more is due to the progress and sales at Otis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then if you look at cash flow, just free cash flow by month over the first quarter, I don't know if you have these numbers, but was March weaker than you might have expected or was it sort of typical pattern?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not going to get into I guess, monthly forecasts or reviews of cash. I would say there were no surprises in March. The business remained strong. There wasn't any deterioration in receivables or collections or anything like that. It was really just the usual normal, we look at cash flow everyday here obviously. No surprises, no weakness in the businesses, no underlying trend that I would be concerned about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. And then on the share repurchase, you bought back a very, very even $500 million a quarter last year, and obviously this was a big tick up. You're keeping your guidance for the year. I'm just wondering, if you look at your pattern, it hasn't really been opportunistic. In the past, it's been pretty steady. Your stock was down in the first quarter. You bought back more. Was this a change in your behavior, or how do we interpret the higher number in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know if I would say a change in behavior. Obviously, when the stock was in the 60s it was just a hell of investment. And so we just piled in. And the fact is, we'd like the stock as an investment. The $2 billion placeholder is still in place for the year, but we're going to continue to go out &#x2013; when the stock is priced at levels that we think it shouldn't be, we're going to go out and buy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think perhaps there's some possible upside to that $2 billion number? You're just not ready to move that up yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>These numbers are all placeholders, Joe. We'll see how the year progresses. Right now we're still sticking by the 2 billion and we'll come back to you at the end of the second quarter and update on all of this.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On Fire &amp; Security, you've talked about getting margins above 10%, or at least to 10% this year. The first quarter was well below that. Can you talk about how you expect this to progress over the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you've got a couple of things happening in the first quarter that held it down. And before I tell you that I will also remind you that in February when Bill was in front of you, he said exactly that. He said the margin expansion will be greater, and that &#x2013; as we progress through the year. But in the first quarter remember that we still do have the manned guarding business in our numbers, and the Australia piece will go away in the near-term and the UK stays. But that does hold the margins down a bit. Plus, as we said, we do have the acquisition &#x2013; investment related to the acquisitions on the integration side for the initial Marioff, the other acquisitions we did last year. So for all those reasons, while we would like to see a very non-seasonal margin progression ultimately at Fire &amp; Security, we've said that'll take a few years to do, and this year it would still be more backend loaded &#x2013; and those couple of reasons are some of the primary factors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you still expect &#x2013; if you expect the 10% for the year, then you're looking at really getting to a more sustainable run rate above that if you're going to compensate for the shortfall at the beginning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we are still &#x2013; we are not coming off of our 10% for the year and we're confident we can get there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then more broadly, when you talked about conservatism in terms of how you're looking at the back half of the year, are there any specific areas that you are more concerned about than others?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know that there's any one particular business. Obviously, we talked about a lot of different things in the environment. The aerospace aftermarket, and again RPM growth, we're keeping an eye on that. We're also obviously in the shorter cycle businesses, at both Carrier and Fire &amp; Security, we've already seen a downturn or a softening there. Those are the businesses that will move us around in the short term in the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So no real single thing that &#x2013; it's more of a general sense that you need to be conservative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we read the same papers that everybody else does. And I think we do believe that there is a softening of the US economy, whether or not we're in a recession, we can leave it to the economists to tell us that in about two years; but right now we know there is softening in the US economy and we're going to prepare for it by taking costs out of our businesses.</p>

          <p>Yeah. Good morning guys. A couple of questions. You spoke about the commercial construction in Asia. Can we just talk about some of the other regions of the world? What are you seeing in Europe and Eastern Europe, Western Europe, and if we can take &#x2013; maybe take just a little trip around the world in terms of construction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, commercial construction in Europe, I would say it was very strong, but it is regionally strong in Eastern Europe, Russia, Ukraine, Poland. I think all of those markets remain very, very robust. Southern Europe, not so good. A little bit of overbuilding as we had expected in Spain, and also I think the UK has been softening on us. So, there is new Europe and old Europe, and I guess old Europe is not moving quite as quickly as new Europe.</p>
          <p>If you go around Asia, it looks pretty good there with the exception of Japan. Japan has been slow to declining here in the quarter. Korea looks to be coming back a little bit, not double-digits, but still fairly good order growth in Korea. India, I think everything is on track there. It's maybe a little lumpy, but it's &#x2013; I don't think we have any concerns. And South America, although not a big piece of our business, continues to be very, very good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Also, if we just kind of change gears here to Pratt. You guys mentioned this in one of your charts; you had 18% organic growth in Pratt. You said aftermarket spares were flat. Is that right? Is that what you told Steve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, what was driving that 18% growth? That's huge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Pratt Canada, primarily. Well, I should say it's Pratt Canada which was up about 30%. You also had good growth on the military side. You had higher, about nine higher military engines delivered in the quarter...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the power system.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the power systems business was also up very strongly. So, really kind of a broad based strengthening in Pratt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now in power systems, as you said it was up I guess two times. You said that in your prepared remarks. What was driving that? I mean is that &#x2013; aero derivatives or what is that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and we've seen it for the last I think 18 months or so. That has been a very strong part of &#x2013; that's been in a good place in the market, I should say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's lots of demand out there as you know for power and I think this is &#x2013; we're in a great spot with Pratt Power Systems to deliver on that right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Okay. And then just one last question if I may. The Geared Turbofan, you just brought that up a little bit. What's the next milestone we should be looking for on the geared fan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We just &#x2013; I think we've completed about 40,000 take off and landings or equivalent take off and landings on it. We're loading in the new engine into the new nacelle; we're going to fly it. I think that the most public milestone you're going to hear about is flight tests in the middle of the year. And that I think we're pretty confident is going to happen in I don't know, June, July, August timeframe. It will fly when it's ready, but we're certainly expecting that by midyear.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Ron. Okay, Diana, can we take our last caller, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely sir, we'll take our final question today from Myles Walton of Oppenheimer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Myles.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, you've taken the conservative stance of not raising the full year guidance, but I guess maybe the important question is where do the contingency stands with respect to the full year guidance? I think you started the year at about 150 million at the top end of the range, but with FX here, it looks like maybe that's plus 50 to 100 million offset a little by Hamilton. So, I guess the question, bottom line, where is the contingency today with respect to the top end of the guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You've done the math pretty well, Myles. I don't know if I can add much to it. The fact is we started the year with a 150 million contingency. We still feel very, very good about the year, because of that contingency, because of good news on FX. And again, it's a solid contingency. Right now as you mentioned, Hamilton's got a little bit of potential risk and we always wonder with the commodities at Carrier, whether that is going to continue to flow through. But overall, I tell you, we just feel very good about the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Myles, again, maybe just to pile into that earlier comment I made, we do feel very good about the year and you're right, the math is all &#x2013; all higher. But it's an environment that can change and there's just no benefit with three quarters of the year left to overreach or go higher. And again, I don't think we want to be in the position or being stressed like that in a possibly declining environment. I don't think you want us to be releasing earnings and doing calls under that scenario either.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think it's good commentary, though. I mean it's essentially that your contingency is flat to up and you're booking away some of the uncertainty for the back half of the year and I think that's the important takeaway.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Myles.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Myles.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me just maybe wrap up with just two last thoughts if I can. First of all, you've heard everybody today we had a very, very good quarter, strong backlog, and of course there's a little bit of economic uncertainty on the horizon. But we are very confident in our guidance and we're going to work to continue to be transparent with you guys as we always have. This is a culture of no surprises and we're going to endeavor to make sure there are no surprises as we go forward.</p>
          <p>We may be conservative, but we think it's appropriate in this environment. We've got a great operating system here with ACE. We're really focused on hitting the guidance for the year, so again, a good quarter and I think it's going to be a very good year. Lastly, I just want to say thanks to Ken Parks. Ken Parks is leaving soon, maybe right after this call in fact to become the CFO at UTC Fire &amp; Security. Ken has been doing a great job here for the last three years, so we thank him very much. I know you guys can all reach out and say your own him words of thanks, but he's really done just a tremendous job.</p>
          <p>At the same time, I would also want to welcome Akhil Johri back to corporate office as Head of our Investor Relations function. He's leaving Fire &amp; Security after almost five years, five long years. He was in IR; some of you may have known for a short time back in 2003. But we welcome back Akhil and I think he's uniquely positioned with his operating experience at Fire &amp; Security to take us through these next few years. So thank you to Ken and welcome to Akhil. Akhil will be at the calls this afternoon with Ken, so please take a moment and welcome Akhil back in, as we all do. So with that, I thank everyone and it was good talking to you. Goodbye.</p>
