          <p>Welcome everybody to the Third Quarter Conference Call and Conference that we have here in Stockholm for Atlas Copco, I'm very pleased to be here together with our CEO, Ronnie Leten. We will follow a very common and now known format, where Ronnie gives his comments on the third quarter performance, and then after that we have a question-and-answer session. So, I think we don't need any more preludes, so please, Ronnie, take it from there.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you Hans Ola, and good afternoon to all of you here present and listening in. As usual I will go quickly through the presentation, give my view points and then we can immediately shoot the questions.</p>
          <p>Highlights, a good quarter, very solid profitability despite the softer market. I'll just elaborate a bit on the market. We see definitely for equipment a softer market in Q2 already, as you're seeing in the figures and also when you look to &#x2013; oh, Q3, sorry &#x2013; and when you look to our outlook. You see also that we expecting somewhat softer demand for the period to come.</p>
          <p>Solid profit, orders up, price volume 1%, weaker in equipment, but our service and parts keep up, and we see a good development in that part of the business. Strong cash flow, yes, held by a sell-off of financials, which boosted the cash flow a bit more. Hans Ola will elaborate a bit further on that. But even if we take away that part it's still a good cash flow. And when you calculate the value creation, this company still creates value.</p>
          <p>And here you see, and we put this slide then just to show you why we make me saying it is solid quarter. You see, orders &#x2013; received orders invoiced, if you look over the last four quarters, it's rather the same level. We had and you all remember the quarter one that myself I was positively surprised. It's always better to be positively surprised than the opposite, where we saw a very strong mining at that time, but if we take away that part, you see a still good continuation of orders. How come? I think hard work from all the collaborators, being with the customers, working hard on service, and yeah, being a little bit better than some others in the market.</p>
          <p>Also profitability, also we keep on the, say, continuous plus 20% EBIT level. Figures, I don't think I should take more, maybe the earnings per share to SEK2.87, and the cash flow, I'll let it up to Hans Ola later on.</p>
          <p>If we take then slide number five, the regions, here is Europe. There's a lot talks, we're living also here in Europe. So a lot of talks about weakening demand, weakening outlook, also we get that part. You see a -2 compared to last year. All the others are slightly positive, not as we are used to be, so as I already said a couple of times, we should get used to lower figures and hopefully not too many back figures.</p>
          <p>The Americans, plus seven, healthy demand in North America, and if we would take away the comparison &#x2013; and you remember Mexico last year was very strong, if we would take away that part, because, by the way Mexico was very strong last year due to a big order from the mining. But if we take away, we still see a very solid U.S. and Canada. So a good industrial part, mainly also coming from compressors. A softer mining mainly coming from a softer gold business, so that is a bit bumpy. But I must say, I still see a good development in North America.</p>
          <p>Smaller order growth in South America, mainly a softer mining part. So you see the Chilean Peruvian market a bit softer because it is really mining driven, and yeah, flat development in Brazil. Europe, yeah, negative, very &#x2013; yeah, a bit depressing. We see that that part is going down in most countries. Germany keeps up, but also we see there, as I also said in the quarter two call that we also see there a slightly softening. But there is still a good demand for compressors so that also kept the business at the good level; construction soft.</p>
          <p>Africa, Middle East, very solid. If we take away South Africa, which you'll have read also has an impact on our figures and also slow down the business there. But if we exclude South Africa, you really have a &#x2013; we really have a good development in West Africa, North Africa and the Middle East. Middle East mainly coming from oil and gas, which then also helps the compressor business to develop well.</p>
          <p>Asia, and I have already mentioned a couple of times in when I was meeting some of you, so this is a bit of mixed view where you see Southeast Asia, South Korea, strong, good development going on in that area. Where China we call it here at a good level. But I would say it is flat, and we don't talk it as we were used to talk it up. And then also got good development here I see, yeah, sequentially flat to slightly lower development. India is soft. So if you take these four blocks together, you come still with a slightly positive one. And Australia keeps &#x2013; continues to develop well. Of course this is the whole mining part and of course also the good work what we do there. So as you see, yeah, last time we had a minus. Now we have a small plus. Let's see what that will bring us in the next quarter.</p>
          <p>But let's go immediately to the sales bridge where you see currency -3%. You know all the movements going on with the Swedish krone, and then the dollar and the real and all that, so it makes it a rather complex comparison. But it came out as a -3% for us. Price, volume, +1%. So we still see that our pricing keeps up. I think the work, the hard work in design and development, driving always for innovation, it still keeps up, and I think it will keep up because we create sustainable productivity for our customers, and they see the real value proposition when they go with Atlas Copco. So that's goes on. But the currency, plus, minus; the volume, we come up to a plus one in orders received.</p>
          <p>And revenue, yeah, we know we still have the pipeline to come. So a book to bill, a bit less than one now. Let me go through the different business area and to start with compressors, the largest one. So we had a healthy level for of order take for compressors. A bit different mix, but good gas and process demand. So that is energy driven. So that part of the world is still investing a lot. And of course we go together in that slip stream.</p>
          <p>And good development on Parts and Service. So what it also says here on the aftermarket. So we continue to see good development all over in the world. You see even in markets like Italy, we succeed to increase for compressor or aftermarket. So that's definitely the hard work what we do. Operating margin, 24, yeah, okay, held by the currency, you remember. If the euro gets a bit softer, that is a good sign for compressors because we produce still a lot in our largest plant in Belgium. So that has helped a bit. But I think, on the other hand, the hard work of the guys on adapting their cost structure and at the same time keeping investing in the right part of the market has yielded a good profitability. And of course, we continue to extend our product offer with the acquisition of a Danish, small Danish company, a nitrogen and oxygen generator. So which allows us to really have our own product portfolio and to develop further from that platform.</p>
          <p>We'll go to Industrial Technique: a bit weaker than the recent quarters, but still at a good level. Of course, we all know that MBI, with all the models, it cannot go on all the time. So we get a bit of cycles there. So also we will see that. I think especially with some of the European manufacturers which will not have the same boom of new models as they have before so, because we are model driven. But of course, we are working hard with &#x2013; again also here extending our offer and going for general industry demand.</p>
          <p>Aftermarket still developed very well in that area. And the operating margin, 21%. Yeah, this is just the opposite, what I just told about CT. Here we have much more exposure compared to the Swedish krone because we are manufacturing our core tools in Sweden. Of course, when Swedish krone strengthen, yeah, you cannot eat a cake twice. So then we got a bit negative affected by this currency.</p>
          <p>Now I'll go to Mining and Rock Excavation. Lower demand for equipment and I assume that is not the surprise for many of you here present. All over, we see that that is a bit of -- waiting to come to say, larger orders. But on the other hand, if you compare and you saw -- in my second slide, I showed you on the graph. You see also of course we comparing very a strong two or three quarters of equipment. So it's not falling fully down, but it is lower. So we see -- and we all know that when the mining is moving, it's not moving with one up and one down. It's really going with a couple of 5% and 10%, so this is the way it works in this. But we see a strong, still a strong demand for service and parts, so that continues to be at a good level, and also our structure and our dedication, that part is yielding results. On the other hand, what we see consumables is a bit softer, which we also had expect; when a mine engineer or a mine owner needs to look to his cash flow, yeah, what does he first? Okay, make sure he uses inventory and that we also have seen as a symptom in 2008, 2009 that the consumables first dropped and then to come again. And that is also -- at least a drop we see; the increase we will see. I will tell you hopefully next time. Margin, very solid 24.5% and, yeah, even negative affected by the currency, so a very strong profitability from the mining guys.</p>
          <p>Construction Technique, weak demand in Europe, and you know also that is one of our biggest market we have. So it does not help the development, but a good development in North America, and that we still see a good demand from the rental companies, specifically in the North America, which helps us of course to make a bit of growth.</p>
          <p>Healthy after the market, so that is working fine and the operating margin is a bit softer than the previous quarters. Of course we also have a bit lower revenue, so that is also one of the reason why it is a bit lower on that part. And here also we have, unfortunately, we have to, yeah, to do a more reorganization and one which we announced a couple of weeks ago is the reorganization in Karlskrona.</p>
          <p>Then the figures, I think you all know them, and I would suggest that to hand over now to Hans Ola.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Ronnie. Well, I think that you have covered reasonably well the operating profit performance and the various businesses. So I will just make a few comments further down the income statement, if I use that expression. We have a financial net that increased compared to last year, but it was fully due to the fact that we had a positive capital gain included last year from some sale of rental service shares, as you recall. When it comes to the bottom line, you can see that we had a little bit of a higher tax rate, a tax charge this quarter compared to the same quarter last year. This is mainly due to a little bit lower than normal last year, I would say. The 26% tax rate this quarter is slightly higher than what we perceive to be the run rate of around 25%. But these variations will happen and it's not something that we can analyze in detail every quarter or we shouldn't analyze in detail in quarter.</p>
          <p>What is coming further down the road is, of course, that we have already had announced that the Swedish corporate income tax will be lower going forward, and that will have an impact, of course, and we don't earn all our money in Sweden, as you know, but it will certainly have a positive impact. To give a better guidance on the run rate when that is I'd like to come back to perhaps in the next meeting we have when see a little bit how the mix of profit develops in the year, in the next couple of quarters.</p>
          <p>If I move on to the profit bridge, as we normally call it, here you can see that the extra growth or the organic growth since last year has produced about the same profit generation as we have the margin. So there is no major difference between that flow-through and where we came from last year. The things to note perhaps here is that we have added a column here that explains that we have quite significant, at least for a single quarter it can be rather significant, revaluation of long-term incentive program provisions, and that is entirely moving up and down, not entirely, but to a large extent, with the valuation of the Atlas Copco share price.</p>
          <p>So it's not a cash item, but it does affect the operating margin, and hence we show it, as it was very positive in Q3 last year, and then it was not big, but it was still negative this quarter. So if we then move -- but otherwise a relatively undramatic picture. You can appreciate that we have a negative currency comparison with last year. When we look at the different business areas, you also see a more even distribution of flow-through than in the previous quarter. We have, of course, the impacts that I've talked about on one-time items and acquisitions and dividends. That refers to the acquisitions, of course, but also here that we had some restructuring costs last year that helps in the comparison period. But otherwise, I think that most of these numbers speak for themselves.</p>
          <p>If we move on to the balance sheet, the capital that we use has increased somewhat since the beginning of the year. And you have heard us talk before that it has been a certain build-up due to the revenue increase of inventory, but it has slowed down considerably, and there was hardly any increase at all between the second quarter and the third quarter if you strip out the effects of different currency rates. But we are, of course, accumulating cash. So that is basically then explaining the increase of the total assets.</p>
          <p>The balance sheet and the income statement together produces the cash flow. And here we had a very strong total operating cash flow. And when we say operating cash flow, the only thing that is not included is acquisitions and divestments and dividends. And since we don't pay any dividends this quarter, it was only the acquisitions. However, we should also point out, like we did in the report, that we did sell a portion of our customer finance portfolio, roughly a value of MSEK1.4 billion in the quarter, and that has, of course, helped to show this very strong quarter cash flow. But even without that, I think that the MSEK3.2 million, billion, sorry, cash flow in a quarter remembering that we have not had any help yet from reducing working capital. So I think our assessment is that it was a very strong cash flow for the quarter. So with that, I think I hand the word back to you, Ronnie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and we come to our long outlook. We tried to make it shorter. But we didn't succeed this time. As I already said in the beginning of my presentation, we expect compared to quarter three, we expect that demand will decrease somewhat so that it will soften somewhat.</p>
          <p>So with this, I would say that we are ready for the questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We're ready for the Q&amp;A session, and I'd like just to, before we start, to ask everyone that has question that if you have multiple, I would like you to restrain to have two questions at a time maximum, because otherwise we will not let so many people ask questions as we would have liked to. So I ask the moderator on the telephone conference, please repeat the procedures for the questions, please.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator instructions" /> Your first question comes from Andreas Willi [JPMorgan]. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Two questions please. The first one on your investments in terms of R&amp;D, feet on the street, I think you slowed that a little bit earlier this year, and we've seen some positive impact on the margins. Where do you see investments going in the next few quarters giving the uncertain environment? Are you going to slow down investments a bit further until we have more confidence, or are we &#x2013; should we use current levels as the normal rate? And the second question in compressors you had good growth in the process sides. Should we expect a negative mix now in the next few quarters in terms of the margin impact, and what's your outlook there in terms of how long these very high levels of investments in some of the end markets? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The part of where to invest, for sure, like I mentioned also during my presentation here when I was talking about price, of course Atlas Copco will keep investing in design and development, so in research and in innovation because that is the core, the core of Atlas Copco, and if you remember also during the tough 2008, 2009, we also kept investing in our product range and trying even to speed up that part, and that is what we keep doing. When it comes to feet on the street that is a bit of a different part. That is where we have to see where we can harvest, where we &#x2013; where is the market. If you say I will intensify my network today in Europe, yeah, I don't &#x2013; not too sure that will be the best moment to invest there, but maybe as you say I do more feet on the street in U.S. because there in certain areas we can do; that we will definitely do.</p>
          <p>So to summarize R&amp;D, it gets a triple plus on investment, and feet on the street we will definitely be selective and be looking for efficiency. Yeah, on compressors, maybe I will take your last part is how long will the investment last? Who knows? I would like to have a crystal ball, and in the morning when it come to Atlas to look into that and say, okay, when to push and when to break. If you see on the gas and process part, that part of course, it's a lot of energy driven, so there is still a lot in the pipeline from that part, so that is where we keep investing, and also we try to extend our product offer in that area because there we still see some growth potential. The negative mix, yeah, I will see because if time will go on, and you have heard me saying that equipment sales is slightly dropping where aftermarket still grow. We will get another type of mix coming up. So it will only &#x2013; not only the gas and process mix, it will also be the aftermarket mix. So I see it more, if I generalize, I see more little bit soft equipment, higher aftermarket mix going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Alexander Virgo [Joh. Berenberg, Gossler &amp; Co.]. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, good morning. Two questions, please. One, just wondered if you can perhaps expand a little bit more on that point you made in the mining and rock business about customers' willingness to replenish consumable inventories, and how long you think that might continue to affect the demand outlook. And then the second one on the inventory levels, I wondered if you could perhaps comment on inventory levels across the divisions. Some of your peers and competitors have been pointing out that there is quite a lot of inventory in the channels, particularly in the construction business, so perhaps, you could give us some color on that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think on the consumables, that is what we see, and like I said it's a bit of a normal reaction that you look to cash flow and you have to reduce your inventory that you keep your safety stock a bit lower. That is what we see. How long will it last? I don't think if I take my experience from previous crisis it lasted that time two to three quarters, and then we saw already a development, positive development. How long will it be now? I don't know. So it's also a bit of a mixed view. It's not geographically equally spread.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the inventory across the divisions, we have &#x2013; our model is primarily a direct model, and even if we go indirect, we don't want that our distributors, our indirect channel, keeps stock or keep inventory. We don't want that. Because we want them to be, yeah, also cash -inventory light. That's the way we spread the gospel. Does it work all the time? No. Can we do better? Yes, especially when you look on construction and the mining side, we have more inventory than we have in compressor and in industrial technique.</p>
          <p>There is &#x2013; there is a bit &#x2013; yeah, or should I say it different. There is opportunities for improvement, for sure, on the construction side and on the mining side, where we do, but it's not in the channel; it's in our pipeline as such. So, yeah, that I think &#x2013; so what &#x2013; yeah, I hope that gives you enough on that part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Ben Maslen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I think we cut in with two questions from Stockholm before. Sorry to keep you waiting, Ben, but you will get your chance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Guillermo Peigneux from UBS. Couple of questions. First, regarding compressor technique, the incrementals are better. Can we assume that now you are normalizing the pace of the normalization? And yet to be discussed, are we normalizing to 25% which is the long term rate?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on mining, quite the opposite question, if I read you well, mining equipment probably at the moment getting their full utilized on your plants, therefore the degree of fall in equipment demand plus consumables demand, so deteriorating to some extent. Could that mean that your incrementals in mining could be a bit weaker going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first one, on the 25%, are you taking that? I think, first like I mentioned many times that I am not hunting for margin records, and we are hunting for value, to create value, and that's also in CT. I want them, even there is headwind, to grow, to find that part. We have seen an improvement. We take that. And you also remember my explanation partly for last time, when I said, hey, we're investing in vacuum and low-pressure, we have a couple acquisitions even there. We are not getting the same return. That is we keep doing, and we keep doing that in CT. Of course, they have worked hard also to &#x2013; certain investments to make sure they give a return.</p>
          <p>I will not say the new is 25%.  I think you should position it, you are where we are in that area, if you take a bit away, say currency here and there, because we also were helped by the currency part on that. So that this &#x2013; for me it's, CT is, hey, guys, become bigger.</p>
          <p>Then, on MR, yeah, of course, when you have less equipment you get a little bit less absorption, but you also know we have our agile model. We have a lot of leverage with our suppliers, outsourcing, insourcing. This is a process that is working now, that is clicking in. Luckily, we have the orders on hand to allow us to slide, to do that shift. It's not that we don't have any orders on hand, so we are allowed to move around, and that is happening. So we are one hand reducing; you've seen that also on the balance sheet, may be on that. If you look deeper, you see our purchasing value; it's going down, so that is a first sign of that part. On the other hand, you get a better mix. You get less equipment, more aftermarket, so that part should normally compensate that part.</p>
          <p>Another question here in Stockholm?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Peder Fr&#xF6;l&#xE9;n, Handelsbanken Capital Markets. Two more fort of margin related questions outside of the sort of organic leverage. You mentioned dilution on acquisitions; was that mainly an effect of them reporting lower profitability or do we have any short-term issues like PPAs and others that will go away? That's the first question. And the second on the CT margin and the FX. Will the euro production's heaviness sort of create enough positive also in the fourth quarter given what you see today, or is that way too optimistic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Now on the acquisition, if you acquire companies in our business, it's very seldom we are &#x2013; we can buy companies with the same profitability level. Then you say, yeah, synergies should give you -- of course, but this is integration. These moves they take time. And when you do ten, I like to talk about two or three every time. Six or seven are okay, and one or two, yeah, we need to use a bit more push to get there. So if you take that, that is still to say our performance on that. But in the mix point of view, they bring the, yeah, they bring the margin a bit down just when they're taken in the quarter.</p>

          <p>As you referred to yourself, the Compressor Technique business area has, out of the four, the strongest base in Euro costs. So the recent development, as you could see also from the profit bridge, is helping on the margin, even though translating into Swedish krona means that there are lower values. But from a cost versus income point of view, they are getting help. If we look ahead, I think it will be the same, if you look quarter four to quarter four. But as the deterioration, temporarily or not, have sort of stalled now for a few weeks or a few months at least. Of course, what happens happens and we don't know that. But if you take on a sequential, in the sequential, meaning, from Q3 to Q4. But yes, it is still at levels that are better than last year. That is right.</p>
          <p>So if I move over to, I think it &#x2013; was it Ben Maslen that was in line for a question on the conference call? Operator?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hello it's Klas Bergelind from Nomura. I have two questions, please. First, on the aftermarket again, being a bit weaker in mining and rock. What do you think of the margin impact from this? Is this likely to hit next quarter or was that already impacting your margins this quarter, given that aftermarket is typically higher margin than equipment? So that is my first question. The second question is really on your incremental margin in CT, relative to return on capital employed. Incremental margin has improved there to 14%. But return on capital employed is still down some 10% year-on-year, and that's the same development as we saw in the first-quarter. So could you please explain that disconnect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I can start from the bottom there, I don't think that you can do perfect mathematical model to understand that because I think that the return on capital employed year-on-year is actually spending over averages of the balance sheet and the income statement over a period of 24 months, since we use an average calculation of the capital. And we have seen the balance sheet increase as we have commented over the last couple of quarters, not in this particular quarter, and that has brought the returns a little bit down. But the incremental margin is, you say it's better. Yeah, compared to the previous quarter, that's true, but obviously, with a 24% profit margin business in a normal stable situation, we would expect that the incremental profit would be higher than the 14%, of course. I don't know if I got your question 100% correct, but I don't see that it's a total mismatch between the two observations you made. Then I think that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if you would like to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Clarify a little bit. What I mean here is that you're obviously still investing in the business, but my question is, given that the incrementals are now improving, is that your assets that you have invested, are your same people, your engineers, are they getting more efficient? I'm just trying to sort of understand what is the delta here on the incremental margin sequentially. I mean, if your investments getting more efficient? That's the question really?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think what one should normally aim for that the incremental margin of contribution at the end, when you do all this investment, is at least at the same level as the average of the businesses, especially when it comes to incremental organic part. That is no doubt. But some of these comparisons are difficult to read for you, and some of them, like I mentioned, if you take the vacuum, the low pressure, this takes a little bit longer than, say, one quarter, and this can go on for if you take on the low pressure, like I elaborate also last time, I think this could be a journey for a couple of years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you can expect, you should expect, let's say, this way, at the end, you should expect the same level as the business area does.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm happy to continue to discuss it with you, because I think that you are still a little bit puzzled, so we can perhaps, we can perhaps elaborate more after the call on that one. But I notice you refer to the return on capital employed going from 72% to 62%, quite nice returns, by the way, but I understand that your question that it's still 10% lower. But I don't see the exact mathematical connections between the two, as you do. So perhaps we can do that later. Is that okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's absolutely fine.</p>

        <plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I will try to comment to.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no. I think on the aftermarket in MR, I'm still expecting that that will develop in a positive way. What you see, of course, the consumable part is a bit softer, but that part, like I said, within a couple of quarters we will see again there a positive development that is or there must be something else happening at a different magnitude that people stop drilling and all that part. But giving our product portfolio, our presence, I believe that that part will come back to where it was before. So again, it's a mix part, if equipment over a certain period will be, yeah, be softer and then eventually it will also hit revenue, I believe that the mix will be go positive for aftermarket. So I think, when it comes to the profitability, the theoretical profitability giving that there is not more under absorption that that will be a positive mix effect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to underline, Ronnie, I think you've said it twice already, that it's not the full non-equipment part of MR that we refer to. It's primarily the consumable side that had this effect of replenishment of stocks, et cetera, that we referred to. So we don't see it as a general negative trend on aftermarket. I just have -- want to underline that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand that. And consumables is obviously sort of a little bit lower margin than the total service business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Ben Maslen [Bank of America Merrill Lynch]. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon, Ronnie. Hi, Hans Ola. Two questions, please. First, is there any way you can give a little bit more color on your sequential demand outlook for Q4, a sense maybe of the magnitude of the drop and which divisions do you think will weaken the most?  I guess there is a lot of focus on what you expect sequentially in mining. And then maybe on China, just a little bit more color on what you're seeing there looking into next year. We hear a lot of companies expecting improvement based on a new regime coming in to govern. What's your view and what are you planning for? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think when it comes to the sequential demand, I think if we start with the areas where I think we will have the most significant drop, if we can use that word, I think it's on construction. That is where our biggest exposure is in Europe. It's also more seasonal. It is softer. That is where I believe we will see, in relative terms, on equipment, the biggest drop. On mining, giving say, all the signals we read and we hear and all that, so I'm a bit more careful there, where we are saying, yeah, likelihood that equipment will go down is significant, is there. So also that is my second, yeah, business area which I believe will go down with a substantial amount in equipment.</p>
          <p>Then industrial technique, especially due to the MVI part, the models, we see that, yeah, we come in another cycle now, and that is also what we had expected. Of course we try to extend or hopefully remember we are going &#x2013; with Schucker we are already in another business and so maybe we can have more part there. We fight back. But if you take it purely from a demand point of view, Ben, then I should say the MVI, and on CT, compressor side, I see there, my yellow canaries being, yeah, slightly negative. If I make that part, and then you have of course the turbo compressors, which is mainly on &#x2013; is a Chinese, because the biggest market is China. And you remember also there, we compared with last year which was a very high level. There also, I expect that it will hang in, so to say. I don't expect it much more going down, but who knows. So there I'm a bit more alert in that.</p>
          <p>So and that gives me the entry to China. Yeah, who knows what the new regime will bring. I also like to read positive news and stimulus package and opening up. So that gives people more confidence, and confidence gives more decisions. What I see today is that it is not dropping. But it's hanging in. Even when I look to our construction business, we, although we are small there, we creeping up. It's not standing still anymore, so there is activity and the same is on the mining side where we see a lot more mechanization going on and activities where people want to do further development in their mines. So these activities are going on, but it's not a plus market; it's still a flat market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks so much, that's very clear. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we have two questions here in Stockholm again. Over here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. That's Anders Idborg, ABG. When you look at the compressor business in China, the aftermarket proportion has historically been lower there, and the idea, of course, has been that once the new equipments sales starts to decelerate and the installed base is there, that will catch up. So I was just wondering if you could give an update; what is the proportion now; what are you doing to catch the opportunities from the large installed base that you put in place in '07, '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, one thing for it's today already our single largest service organization in the world. Just to calibrate everybody there, for CT. So we have already a lot feet on the street. What we do more is definitely to work hard on our logistics. Sales people who are upselling our service, getting overhauls, getting contracts. It is a bit what we have been doing for many, many, many years in Europe, and which is general accepted also to do in China, and it works. You can sell service in China. People 10 years ago thought it was not possible. Atlas Copco started that, to do that and, yeah, this is also the result. Of course, if you look to the ratio, we have not the same installed base, say, the older installed base as we have in Europe. So we don't have the historical legacy of our machines, if you compare China with Europe, so that will take time. So the ratio over time will definitely improve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think it will reach the level of Europe and North America? When would?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is no -- I think there is -- I think I cannot find any intellectual reason to not believe it can be. But it is a matter of time, you know, you see some of the machines in Europe they are there for 15 years. I have many of that. I think that we don't have many in China. So a machine of 15 years gives more aftermarket than a machine of two years. You can -- one can say why you're not replacing it. Yeah, I agree, that's what we try to do in Europe is a replacement market.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Markus Almerud here from Morgan Stanley. Two question: first of all on compressors, just the good demand that we're seeing, could you just elaborate a little bit on exactly where we see it? Is just the process and the aftermarket or is it very broad based that you're seeing demand holding up? That's my first question. Secondly on China, it sounds like &#x2013; it sounds like on your comments that you think that it's been loss-making. Is that a fair interpretation or not at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on China, of course, you and I we can think what it is, so I am only commenting what I see today, and of course I need to be in my position -- I need to be ready when it's go up and also when ready when it's go down. So that is the way you should read me.</p>
          <p>On China, I am only commenting what I see, so sorry for that. When it comes to CT, of course aftermarket is, in CT, is still developing at a good level. That is one thing what gives this positive effect. If you look to a bit more countries, U.S. is doing a good development that I elaborate a bit on that one, and I contradictionally what we said in other business area, I have seen in quarter three a reasonable good level on Europe. Now I'm not talking it up here, but I didn't see a big drop in that area. This was rather &#x2013; rather on the flat development. So and other areas are a bit here and there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you still have in Europe you have one big country called Germany, which has had in quarter three a reasonable development. I think also when you make a comparison, we are already &#x2013; three quarters, four quarters in Europe low. So we start to compare with low quarters. We should no, if we take really the one who has really done the reconciliation per continent and per business area, and you can see that Europe is still not on the level where it was pre-crisis. That's the only continent, which was not there. So we are &#x2013; and even now the last four quarters, it is even going down, if you take Spain, if you take Italy, take France, if you take Benelux, which was I think this year and at the end of the year soft. So I think we are comparing with, also with softer periods.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon everyone. I wondered if I could follow up on the orders questions in CT and MR. In compressor, it looks like you've done double-digit order growth in North America. And most other industrial and construction exposed companies just aren't seeing that. And I hear the answer about the aftermarket. But can you help us a little bit by end market? Is there any particular or bunch of end markets that are causing that extra growth?</p>
          <p>And in mining, can you help us a bit by commodity and compare coal and iron ore versus copper and gold because you're pretty resilient compared to what we're hearing from some other companies in the mining space? And secondly I wondered if I could ask about surplus cash. I think you've got about MSEK10 billion. You said you're not a bank. I suppose the question's timing of returning that. Should we think about you recommending to the board sooner rather than later?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, these were more than two questions it seems. Just reading my notes here. Yeah, when it comes to the order and specific U.S., I think we see if I take which type of compressor is going on, I think it is in oil and gas. It is an industry where we see a good further continuation, good development. So that is on the U.S. side. Is it demand driven? Is it offer driven? Who knows? I suggest you ask that some other people. When it comes to MR, yeah, copper and gold are commodities who are still are in the &#x2013; when it comes to investment still on the high level of the list of investments for mining, so that goes to our, yeah, more our natural <mark type="ph" /> vehicle (54:34), and I think also there is where I trust we will get some more activities in the period to come.</p>
          <p>When it comes to coal I have already mentioned that is softer. That is where we see the majority of the drop. And of course when it comes to iron ore, for the time being we have not seen much, but I think that will soften when the period is, yeah, when the year is to come. Then I think on the cash, I suggest Hans to discuss the bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, now I probably take it just because I have an even longer history on these questions then you, but you're right, we are accumulating some cash. I like the way you try to change the perennial question of that you always ask before, when can we expect an further extra distribution of cash, and now the question when can we expect you to propose to the board an extra distribution of cash. And I think the answer will be the same that we cannot comment on that timing. We make the observation, of course, that we are a cash generative company. We have an asset light business model, and we are very profitable when it comes to the operating profitability. So obviously, over a business cycle, at least, we should generate nice cash returns. When those are distributed to shareholders, I leave without commenting. I just want to repeat what we have said before that looking back at history is probably the best answer you can get. And we have made extra cash distributions three times in the last six or seven years, and hopefully that will continue. But on the timing I will leave that question unanswered for the time being.</p>

          <p>I think this is &#x2013; that is when you come out with a month of a period. So I think you should not read anything from a trend point view because that was also immediately my reaction when I saw the figures as they were: what's going on? But there was no significant reason that says, okay, now we suddenly stopped all this investment. It's just a matter that this happened in the period. But of course, if you compare to try to read the figures of the quarter, you need to know about that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Two questions, the one, sorry to come back on that, on the marketing and R&amp;D, from another aspect. If we take marketing and R&amp;D as a percentage of sales, it declined by 50 beeps, Q3 versus Q2 at the margin the third quarter. I would like to know if you are happy about the count and you don't expect a further decline in these expenses going forward into the next quarter? Or is there anything extraordinary in Q3 we should know about? And my second question is about have you seen, like other industrial companies, a significant deterioration in demand in September versus August or July which drive your process outlook for Q4? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Maybe I can take first the September because one will know that September was a short month when you compare a year-on-year. So it was two working days less. So that is an explanation of a softer September, as you have seen in many businesses. I think for us, I think September, October &#x2013; September, August were, I think, more or less &#x2013; I'm going to say I didn't say significant differences in that if I take it as a total company. And also it's always difficult to interpret also, August, September in Europe. As you know, the southern countries have longer holiday and decisions taken. And especially when business climate is difficult, you have to interpret that a bit. But it's not a significant difference on that for September.</p>
          <p>When it comes to marketing and R&amp;D, I think of course because there are two differences. When it comes to marketing &#x2013; and that is also the message I've been spreading in the organization is, hey guys, let's harvesting, because we have been growing since 2009, increasing in our investment in the market. Let's now, as the demand is flat or even somewhat lower, it's time for efficiency or more efficiency. It's time for harvesting. So we are a bit more careful on further expansion on this marketing part of it. Where in R&amp;D, we go on. I think if you take one quarter to another it could be capitalization; it could be other thing. But I have &#x2013; I'm not aware that, I have given instruction to limit R&amp;D investments. And I deliberately use the word investments, because it's not expense, but of course it's expense but it is an investment.</p>

          <p>And then, I think we have time for one final question on the telephone conference then.</p>

          <p>Your final question comes from Aaron Ibbotson [Goldman Sachs International]. Please ask your question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, good afternoon, and I've got a couple of questions, both sort of on the mining. And some of them have been answered. But first of all, is there any chance you can give us an idea of your backlog in mining and sort of the timeframe. I guess it's sort of a rough total backlog around MSEK26 billion for you guys, of which I assume more than half is on the mining side.</p>
          <p>And then, secondly, just, because I got somewhat confused by some of the previous questions, so if we look over year-over-year basis in aftermarket versus equipment, did you undergo, and, if so, how did you manage to get your margin so high, ex the FX. And maybe related to that, I would assume that you are expecting aftermarket to outgrow equipment over there following few quarters. Should that drive margin potentially even higher. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask you to repeat the final question a little bit, because I didn't catch you the first part of that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The final question was basically, if aftermarkets outgrows equipment, if that's why, for instance, because equipment is flattish, as you mentioned, should we expect margins to increase or is there &#x2013; are we're approaching a level where they won't go up any further, because I think ex-currency you reported record margins in the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on that, I mean, you are -- it's obviously mathematically correct when we say that many times when equipment slows down the aftermarket slows down much less or not at all. And that helps the margin, everything else equal. But, of course, the under absorption that the slowdown of equipment gives at the same time is working in the other direction. So hence, it's very difficult to make projections without having a perfect scenario on how much equipment will be affected and so on a so forth. But the mathematical relationship is, of course, true that it supports the margin when that happens. There was also a little bit...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the backlog, on equipment, what I can say on that part is that construction, mining and CT more or less have the same type of backlog. When it comes in, say the orders in hand situation, but IT has a smaller portion of backlog. If you take it in total and you exclude aftermarket, where orders received is equal to orders invoiced, you can calculate yourself, you would see that we have more or less have two quarters orders on hand for equipment. So that is &#x2013; but that you can calculate easily, mathematically. So you can say aftermarket is equal to orders received, orders invoiced; equipment is two quarters.</p>

          <p>So with that, I might have a few more questions on the telephone conference, but I hope that you can find answers directed to our Investor Relations department or myself after the call. Since, we don't have time to take more in this, I thank everybody here present and on the telephone conference of course for participating, and I hope that we have you back at least next time we report on the fourth quarter, the 31 of January. If not before...</p>
