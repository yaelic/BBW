      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everybody, and thanks to be with us this morning. We have on stage today Pierre Pringuet, CEO of Pernod Ricard; Alexandre Ricard, newly appointed Deputy CEO and COO; and Gilles Bogaert, our CFO. They will take one hour also to walk you through the presentation, and then there will be time for your questions. Question in English, please, as we will do everything in English today. Thank you very much. Pierre, I hand over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jean. So, that's start of the presentation. But of course, with just a word on Patrick, and I would like to underline the &#x2013; what he said, we are all passionate creators, and that exactly what we intend to do for the future.</p>
          <p>So, the overall analysis, we exceeded our guidance, both on the profit and the indebtedness, plus 9% versus plus 8% &#x2013; close to 8%. And net debt to EBITDA, 3.8 versus 3.9.</p>
          <p>May I just underline that these are the best growth rate since the crisis. And this is the case for our sales, and this is the case also for the profit from recurring operations. Here are the numbers, &#x20AC;8.2 billion for the sales; &#x20AC;2.1 million for the profit from recurring operations. The group share of net profit is &#x20AC;1.2 million plus 10%. We improved our operating margin by 75 basis points, which is a very good achievement. And I won't repeat what I said regarding the indebtedness.</p>
          <p>Now, entering into more details for the sales, you can see the split between the organic growth, which is basically the bulk of our growth. The group structure and the ForEx impact just balance each other. But may I underline that for the first time, yes, we start to have a positive ForEx impact, which is good news. And this is basically due to the U.S. dollars, but also to the Chinese renminbi.</p>
          <p>If I focus on the Q4, there, you can see that the ForEx impact is very significant, I mean, plus 6%. The organic growth seems to be lower, plus 4%. But in fact, if you restate it from the French destocking, it's in the range of plus 7%, and I will show that to you immediately. So, the first line give you the organic growth for the first half, the Q3, Q4 and, of course, the second half.</p>
          <p>But then if you &#x2013; and the second line, if you restate it from the two technical effects, which were the French destocking, but also the Chinese New Year, you can see that we have achieved 8% organic growth for the first half, and you remember that we presented that to you when we presented the half year result; the Q3 at plus 8%; the Q4 at plus 7% and the full year at plus 8%. That's a running impact.</p>
          <p>So, we can see that the growth profile is very evenly spread over the year. I mean, there's not sort of any deceleration at the end of the year as maybe some people could think, so a very evenly spread growth profile over the year.</p>
          <p>Then, by region, so for each region, you have the share of the sales for each regions, then the organic growth for the previous year, 2010-2011, and then the organic growth rate for the past year, 2011-2012. So, starting with Asia/Rest of the World, it's the first region of Pernod Ricard now, 39% of our sales, very similar growth, I mean, plus 15%, plus 15%, so we saw continued growth momentum. And I should say driven by premium, super premium, ultra premium and prestige brand, because that's very much where we sell those brands.</p>
          <p>The Americas, 26% of our sales. And that is the confirmation of what we told you and then the improvements, plus 6%. And it's even better in the U.S. and this is really the region where we sell our premium and super premium brands.</p>
          <p>Europe, excluding France, 26% of our sales. It's an improvement, too. We were flat the previous year, plus 2% last year. And this is very much the acceleration in Eastern Europe, which is offsetting the decline in the West, but it was not very different from the previous year.</p>
          <p>France, yes, it's a deterioration. We were positive the previous year, in 2010-2011. We're at minus 1% now. Definitely, this is the impact of the duty hike which we had in January this year. And all in all, you can see that we improved our growth profile from 7% to 8%.</p>
          <p>Entering into details now region by region, so Asia/Rest of the World, &#x20AC;3.2 billion of sales, plus 17% year-on-year, organically, plus 15%. Martell is definitely one of the main growth driver, plus 29%. I should probably underline that it's above what is the medium-term growth profile for which we want for Martell, just because of availability, but managing scarcity is always good when you have to sell the sort of brands, so, certainly in term of price. We had the milestone of 1 million cases, which we exceed in China. Just a note of sadness, it was the last event &#x2013; the celebration of the 1 millionth case was the last event Patrick participated to in the end of July.</p>
          <p>The top 14 Scotch whisky, plus 13%. Well, that's volume and premiumizations. Indian whisky, plus 26%, very buoyant. And we had also premiumizations for this local brands with the launch of the Barrel Select for Royal Stag and the Reserve Collection for Blender's Pride. We have the good development of Absolut, champagne and wine. We will show that with more detail. I mean, the champagne is, for instance, buoyant in China and, by the way, we believe that we are the leader. On the other hand, we suffered with local brand, if I can describe it. So, Imperial in Korea minus 6%, 100 Pipers in Thailand and that reflect the difficulty of the market.</p>
          <p>Continuing with Asia, so now by country, China, plus 24%. So, I mean, that's an impressive growth above, I would say &#x2013; what we would say that &#x2013; the medium-term trends, and , of course, it's Martell, Scotch whiskey, champagne, Jacob's Creek. India, the local whisky, already mentioned that, but I should also stress that the Top 14 posted an impressive plus 33%, and this is Chivas, Absolut and The Glenlivet.</p>
          <p>Other emerging markets, obviously, Vietnam, I think we're too shy to show the growth rate, but I think it's absolutely impressive in this market, and also Africa and Middle East, plus 12%. And you know that Africa is a sort of new frontier for Pernod Ricard, because we are in the process of creating five new affiliates in different countries of Africa, because we really believe that potential is there and we need to capture that.</p>
          <p>And the Pernod Ricard strategy is, we want to sell our brand with our own people. We need our own people in this continent as well. Taiwan, plus 17%, and this is, of course, driven by the Scotch whisky, Martell and Beefeater.</p>
          <p>Travel retail, and the travel retail is the showcase for our luxury brands, plus 23%. I mean, it's &#x2013; I think premiumization is an understatement for what we achieve in that sort of market. South Korea, minus 2%, but it's on the one hand, another decline which we had with Imperial, minus 6%. And you can see that on the contrary, the Top 14 brands at plus 6% are doing pretty well. And this is reflecting the evolution of the market in Korea. The traditional on-trade is declining, and I think it's structural. On the contrary, the modern on-trade is absolutely buoyant, and that's what we enter with our top 14.</p>
          <p>Thailand's minus 4%. Again, that's the decline of 100 Pipers. On the other hand, the top 14 is just thriving, plus 14% <mark type="indiscernible" /> (10:12) by chance.</p>
          <p>Japan. We're very, very pleased with Japan, plus 8%. It's driven by many of our brands. We mentioned two, the Caf&#xE9; de Paris, and this is innovation. There's a continuous pipeline of new flavors and &#x2013; regarding with Caf&#xE9; de Paris and that's a very good achievement and well managed by our French affiliate, Pernod, who is the producer or the brand owner of Caf&#xE9; de Paris and Pernod Ricard Japan. And Perrier-Jou&#xEB;t. Perrier-Jou&#xEB;t, when we took over the brand from the huge Suntory, we did better. And today, Japan is in value &#x2013; the very &#x2013; the top market for the brand.</p>
          <p>And Australia, that's a very good performance as well at plus 7%, and Mumm particularly was very good. And the premium wines, they are doing well, plus 8%. So it's definitely a turnaround compared to the year before.</p>
          <p>The Americas, so plus 6% organically. The top 14 is, in fact, at plus 5%, but if you exclude Mexico, and I will come back to that later on, plus 7%. So this is definitely Jameson, Malibu, The Glenlivet, Perrier-Jou&#xEB;t, Absolut, Ballantine's, so that's really the &#x2013; what's the driving force for our growth in this continent.</p>
          <p>The Priority Premium Wines, at plus 12%, and it's a very good performance including internal profit. The key local brands, plus 8%, and I would particularly mention Passport which we launched in, for instance, in Brazil, in Mexico. And this is, clearly, we &#x2013; the intention to have a standard Scotch whisky offering to conquer the middle class because that's this middle class, what is emerging and developing fast. And I think we have the right tool with Passport to conquer it.</p>
          <p>Now, looking at the United States, in particular. So you remember that when I presented the first half, we said that it was the very good news of the year and it continued to be the very good news of the year. The U.S. are firmly established in the recovery. And what is entrusting is that the on-trade is definitely reflecting the turnaround in this market.</p>
          <p>So Absolut improved the performance in the second half. The first half was slightly negative. The second half is definitely positive and you can see that, on the full year basis, we are positive and we are very confident that the momentum, with all the new initiatives which we've taken, will continue to strengthen the growth profile of Absolut.</p>
          <p>Jameson, plus 29%. I'm sorry to repeat that sort of number year-on-year. Despite the crisis, we have been constantly between 25% and 30%. The brand is just flying.</p>
          <p>Malibu, plus 10%. And this is very much the innovation pipeline which we developed for the brand with the cocktails, with the Malibu Black which is almost a rum with a 35% alcohol, the Malibu Red, all very well received by the market. Glenlivet, plus 9%, and I should also mention that the higher grade, I mean the 18-year-old of Glenlivet, which retail for $80 a bottle, plus 26%. I mean, that's an extraordinary performance. I remind you that Glenlivet is the leading scotch in this market, then you can see that, yes, it is growing and &#x2013; with premiumization.</p>
          <p>Perrier-Jou&#xEB;t, plus 9%, that's a very good achievement. I mean, it's a &#x2013; value churn is also &#x2013; I mean the U.S. is the top market in value for the brand and we have a favorable mix and price impact. Kahl&#xFA;a, I mean, too early to say that we have achieved a turnaround, but the brand is stabilizing, and we have a pipeline of innovation.</p>
          <p>Brazil, strong growth and globally, plus 13%, and an impressive number for the Top 14, plus 26%, and this is driven by Absolut and the Scotch whiskies. But I mentioned to you that we introduced Passport, plus 24%. We have also this local vodka, plus 9%, and this is very much brands targeting the middle class.</p>
          <p>Canada, plus 7%, and this is due to mainly Jameson and Malibu and a good performance of the wine. And the wine are very profitable in this market. That's the &#x2013; due to the monopoly situation, since we have good margin with the wine.</p>
          <p>Mexico, yes, that's the country where we suffer. But you know that this is, in fact, mainly driven by us. We are setting up a new business model for Mexico with a clear intention that the focus shall be from now onward the premium brand, the top 14, and not any more the local brands. So, Mexico, this is the sort of cleaning-up of the market and the implementation of this new business model.</p>
          <p>And strong performance in other markets and I was &#x2013; from my holidays in Colombia and in Peru, I met the team and I can tell you they're enthusiastic and it's &#x2013; particularly for Peru. The team was set up just a year ago. You can't imagine more Pernod Ricard-minded people than those guys. I mean, it's a good reflection of the way we manage our business.</p>
          <p>Europe, excluding France, so clearly, bipolarizations. So the &#x2013; which one, the East and the West, the top 14 is the main growth driver and this is Jameson, Chivas, Beefeater, I would mention that, I mean, Beefeater in Spain performed very well, but also The Glenlivet and Absolut. We suffered with Ballantine's in Spain. I mean, that's clearly the case, and this was also for Havana Club in Spain and in Italy.</p>
          <p>The Priority Premium Wines, those had the slight decline, minus 2%, but this is at the benefit of the value and the profit. We will see the numbers; Alexandre will show it to you soon. The key local brands, plus 6%, and this is particularly mainly due to Russia, Seagram's Gin and Becherovka.</p>
          <p>Looking at geography, so the bipolarization, Eastern Europe acceleration, I mean, plus 16%. We're plus 9% the previous year. Russia, main growth driver, plus 28%, the Top 14 at plus 31%, Jameson, Chivas, Ballantine's and, of course, local brand, ArArAt and Olmeca.</p>
          <p>The launch of Passport. So, again, introducing this brand targeting the middle class and we're very confident that Passport will be a fantastic brand, I mean, fantastic tool for capturing this middle class. Ukraine, plus 25%, Poland, minus 6%, but this is the local Polish vodka. On the contrary, Ballantine's double-digit growth. And I remind you that we are the leader in the premium &#x2013; standard premium Scotch with Ballantine's.</p>
          <p>Western Europe, modest decline, minus 1%. Of course, it reflects difficult situation. Spain, minus 4%, Italy, minus 13%, the same for Greece, UK, slightly negative, minus 4%. On the contrary, Germany, plus 5%, The Netherlands, plus 7% and Belgium, plus 2%. So, at the end of the day, we can say that, yes, the Southern Europe remained the black spot and probably will remain so for the coming year, because we didn't see any sign that the economy should recover soon.</p>
          <p>And France, well, in average, our brands suffer a 14% duty hike. We told &#x2013; I went visiting the ministers and say, "This is a far too high duty increase. You won't get the money you expect because that will impact the volumes." And unfortunately, I was right. But they make the decision.</p>
          <p>So, we had a very high first half, and of course, the contraction in the second half, but what is reflecting the market is definitely the Nielsen. Since January, so since the duty increase is reflected on the shelf, so, overall the spirit market is in the range of minus 2%. The Nielsen for the anis, what is more impacted by the duty hike, is in the range of minus 6%. With our brand, we saw it behaving &#x2013; I mean, absolutely in line with the markets, and so it's more at the expense, by the way, of the private label.</p>
          <p>So, the consumption decline is just reflecting, of course, the overall economic climate, but definitely this duty hike. And so, nonetheless, we had good performance with Absolut at plus 13% and Havana Club at plus 13% as well. So, there are still some pocket of growth which we can capture and reflect them in the motivations and the enthusiasm of our sales people. I think that's very much what about I wanted to tell you about in the development of our sales.</p>
          <p>And now, Alexandre will enter into the brands, that means our beautiful brands. So, Alexandre?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Pierre. So, from a brand point of view, one key message, our overall net sales, organic growth has clearly been driven by our 14 spirit and champagne brands, growing at double digit in line with last year at 10%. And they now represent 60% of our total net sales. Second, our premium lines are now growing by 4% versus 0% last year. And this is clearly the result and the benefit of our high-value strategy, which I'll slightly touch upon later. And our 18 key local brands have accelerated their growth pace, and we'll see it's been driven by local Indian whiskies, Passport, ArArAt, Olmeca. I'll touch upon this later. While the key message here, volume, 3%; sales up 10%. Two-thirds of the growth is driven by the price mix impact, a perfect value creation lever.</p>
          <p>If we dwell into our Top 14 brands, I'd say, number one, the key message here is we have reached an all-time record volume for our Top 14 brands, reaching a first milestone of many obviously, I hope, of 50 million cases, exactly it's 47.2 million. This is actually &#x2013; we have 8 out of the 14 brands which have posted historical high volume. We also have six brands in double-digit growth. And finally, overall comment, the dynamism of our portfolio here is clearly driven, number one, by Martell; and number two, by our portfolio of whiskies.</p>
          <p>Now, brand by brand, to start with Absolut, volume and net sales growth in line at 3%, growing across all regions. Specific focus on the U.S., Pierre mentioned it earlier, an improved trend in the second half. And actually, NABCA, for the last three months, is up between 5% and 6%. The on-trade depletions are now in positive growth and, as well, the latest Nielsen panels that you've probably seen, are in growth as well.</p>
          <p>Strong growth as well in Brazil. Actually, Brazil is up 26%. In Africa and Middle East, double digit as well. Germany, South Korea, Russia, France, as Pierre mentioned, up 13% despite the depressed environment, India and Thailand. Just to mention the short-term negative impact due to number one, a change in distributor in Israel and number two, as Pierre mentioned it, the change &#x2013; the voluntary change of our business model and the reengineering of our business in Mexico. And let's just mention that if we had to extract these two countries, Absolut would post a 5% growth.</p>
          <p>Moving now into Chivas, well, it's a record year for Chivas as well in terms of volume. Net sales are up 11%, growth driven a little bit by all key regions: Asia/Rest of the World, up 16%; Eastern Europe, up a staggering 22%; and South America, mainly Brazil, up 10%. The depletions have turned positive now in the U.S., up 2%, with a positive mix effect. Very strong growth in travel retail, up 19%, and premiumization clearly underway, where you see the higher qualities, be it Chivas 18, up 28% or Chivas 25, up 28% as well.</p>
          <p>Ballantine's, stable. Stable because as Pierre mentioned it, a sharp decline in Spain. And the entire Scotch category is very depressed in Spain, but the growth on the higher qualities and Duty Free mainly and in Asia. Strong development of Ballantine's as a brand in Eastern Europe, with 51% growth of net sales in Russia, 11% growth in a very promising market for the scotch category, which is Poland; 42% growth in Ukraine; and in Latin America, Brazil posted a 19% growth for Ballantine's.</p>
          <p>Ricard, no need to dwell upon it. Pierre mentioned it, the duty hike in January 1 and as well, an unfavorable weather impact. Jameson net sales, global net sales up 18%. Outstanding performance in line with that of previous years, driven by, again, the U.S., its number one market, up 29%, and Russia, which &#x2013; where net sales grew 45% and which is now the number two market for Jameson, just ahead of South Africa, where the brand grew as well.</p>
          <p>I just want to mention as well, because it's going to be posted today, Jameson has been nominated as the number two IWSR Elite Brand of the year. So, which one was number one IWSR Elite Brand of the year, well, Havana Club.</p>
          <p>So, Havana Club in its core historical markets has suffered, that being Spain, Italy and Cuba. In Spain in Q3, in May, June of the last fiscal, we launched Ritual, Ritual by Havana Club, to basically go at the conquest of the dark rum segment in Spain. There's ongoing very strong momentum in Germany for the brand, net sales up 13%, in line with Nielsen panels, and it remains the brand's main market in value terms. And, as well as mentioned earlier, very strong development in France despite the environment, up 13%; Nielsen panels actually up 20. The brand is very active in the on-trade segment in France as well. Very good growth in Russia, up 20%.</p>
          <p>Well, Malibu, I would only stress the fact that Malibu is the perfect example of how innovation can completely reinvigorate a brand. Malibu net sales are up 4%. A lot of new initiatives over the last year, the Malibu Cocktails, Malibu Black and the most latest launch, which was Malibu Red in collaboration with Ne-Yo, one of the famous pop star in the U.S. in Q3. I would qualify this as a stretched innovation, crossing two different categories, which is rum on one side and tequila on the other. And therefore as a result, the performance of Malibu in the U.S. is just excellent, up 10%. The brand is also posting solid growth in Germany, up 9%, in Canada, in Russia as well, and sustained growth, albeit from a small base, but growing very high double-digit numbers across all Asia. And Malibu as well has reached its record high.</p>
          <p>Likewise for Beefeater in terms of record level of volumes, Beefeater net sales are up 7%. Outstanding growth in Europe, up 8%, with an excellent performance in Spain, up 6%. It is the direct result of a very extremely powerful campaign, the Forever London campaign. Improvement of the performance as well in the U.S., another key market for the brand, and rapid development in Russia and Africa and Middle East. I'd like to stress that there is a feeling amongst our teams that there is a rejuvenation of the gin category as a whole, and Beefeater will play a significant part in that.</p>
          <p>Kahl&#xFA;a. Well, Kahl&#xFA;a on a global level is stable. We do have very encouraging results of the new brand positioning, which is Rum &amp; Coffee Liqueur. There are numerous upcoming innovations for Kahl&#xFA;a. There is a repack under way, which will soon be on the shelf. And I would like to underline the strong performance of Kahl&#xFA;a in Canada and strong development as well of Kahl&#xFA;a in Russia, up 41%.</p>
          <p>Well, regarding our prestige brands, up 25%, 19%, 6%, 14%, 23%. Basically8 an extremely good year to start with, with Martell, a remarkable year driven by Chinese Asia and across all Asia. The strongest favorable price mix impact for the entire portfolio of Pernod Ricard, up16% from a price mix point of view, with as well a good quality mix: XO up 39% in terms of net sales and Noblige up 29%; very successful launch of Chanteloup Perspective. Strong development as well outside of Asia, in Russia, up 10%; and in Africa and Middle East, which is a promising continent which we are conquering as of recently, up 23%.</p>
          <p>The Glenlivet, the malt that started it all, very strong performance in its key historical and mature markets: up 9% in the U.S.; 33% in Taiwan; 11% in the UK; and 52% growth in travel retail. And very strong performance as well in other key markets in Asia, including, by the way, India, as we mentioned it earlier.</p>
          <p>Mumm and champagne, we've had a very good year from a champagne point of view. If we look at Mumm, up 1% in France; up 11% in Spain despite the environment; up 1% in Italy; increased momentum in China, up 51%, which has now become our number two market for Mumm, behind France; and continued growth in the U.S., up 26%.</p>
          <p>Well, outstanding performance as well for Perrier-Jou&#xEB;t, globally up 14%; coming from its three key markets, the U.S. of 9%, especially on the high qualities such as Belle Epoque; Japan, up 15%, Pierre mentioned it, and France, up 16%. Sales have doubled in China which is now the number three export market for the brand. So, basically, the message here is for our champagne portfolio, China is now becoming a very important market. While our most prestigious scotch whisky, Royal Salute, up 23% with its unique brand positioning, a Scotch whisky which starts where everybody else ends and double-digit growth basically across <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:59) and in Travel Retail.</p>
          <p>For Priority Premium Wines, well, the three numbers you see here, 2%, 4% and 10%, are a direct result of our high-value strategy, driven both by price, price increases or promotional activities driven by cost optimization. And, therefore, if you look at brand by brand, Jacob's Creek volume is down 1%, sales up 2%. The brand suffered in the UK as a result of the strategy, where Jacob's Creek's net sales are down 10%. Brancott Estate, volumes up 5%, sales up 2%. Campo Viejo, volume, 9%, net sales, 11%. In the UK, by the way, net sales for Campo Viejo up 6%. And Graffigna, basically in America, volume is up 3% and sales up 28%.</p>
          <p>Regarding our 18 key local brands, key message here is accelerated growth, number one, driven by our Indian local whiskies, Royal Stag, Blender's Pride, and Imperial Blue. We're reaching the 0.25 billion liters of sales in India, driven as well by the conquest of the emerging middle class elsewhere. Passport up 22%, Brazil, Mexico, but as well, other markets including Africa, recently launched as well in Russia. Driven as well by ArArAt, very strong growth driven by Russia, but as well, all of Eastern Europe, Ukraine, et cetera, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:36) up 26%, Olmeca up 20% and Something Special up 15%. And again, as Pierre mentioned, difficult year for Imperial due to the shift from traditional to modern, which is benefiting on our Top 14 brands in Korea and 100 Pipers, which posted a 4% decline in Thailand.</p>
          <p>I'll just very briefly drift through some initiatives. We do invest close to &#x20AC;1.6 billion very wisely behind our brands. Regarding Absolut, it's all about connecting with the artistic community. I will underline the &#x2013; I think most of you saw it, the Greyhound advertising campaign which started in the U.S. and became viral on a global basis, more than 20 million online viewers for the Drinks 2.0 initiatives.</p>
          <p>Beefeater, well, it's all about capturing the energy and the contemporary and vibrant London, with Beefeater 24, by the way, growing close to 50% still from a very small base, but Beefeater is really being reinvigorated. Havana Club, it's all about capturing the values and the culture of Havana, so a very strong year in terms of activation about authentic rum and mojitos.</p>
          <p>While Jameson, it's all about word of mouth, which is working &#x2013; which is connecting with passionate people about the brand and advocates. A partnership as well signed with Kevin Spacey, more than 5.5 million views on YouTube.</p>
          <p>Regarding wines, well, it's all about, again, differentiation and premiumization of our wines, connecting with the emotional side of our consumers. And I would strongly suggest you go on the Internet and see what Andre Agassi has to say about Jacob's Creek. But likewise, pretty differentiation campaigns about Campo Viejo across the world, especially in the UK and Graffigna in America.</p>
          <p>Well, we're clearly now targeting the high-net-worth individuals across the world, more than 12 million of them and growing, and aspirational consumers by creating a world of luxury, essentially around our high-end cognac Martell brands, our high-end Royal Salute brands and around our high-end champagnes, creating unique experiences that go beyond just price as a differentiation factor.</p>
          <p>Finally, innovation, which is a key pillar of our strategy alongside premiumization and geo expansion. Well, Pierre mentioned earlier about Caf&#xE9; de Paris in terms of flavors, new flavors, and in terms of tapping into new aperitif trends with, for instance, the Bitter Orange Spritz. New flavors as well and SKUs for Soho, for instance, or Suze, which is back on growth in France, its core market.</p>
          <p>And last but not the least, tapping into, as well, or going at the conquest of new consumer &#x2013; consumption occasions. For instance, the on-the-go coffee occasion with the Kahl&#xFA;a Cans, party-time occasions with Ritual for the time being in Spain and girls' night together with &#x2013; on the picture, you see Naomi Watts, with Jacob's Creek Cool Harvest.

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Pierre. Thank you, Alexandre. I propose now to share with you a bit more figures, starting with the overview of the P&amp;L. As Pierre said, our best financial performance since the last 2008 crisis, with sales up organically 8%. It was 7% last year. So, this is an acceleration, with an increase in the operating margin rates by 75 basis points, largely driven by premiumization and some control over resources, A&amp;P and structure cost; and an operating profit from recurring operations growing by 9%. It was 8% last year. It was above the 8% guidance, so very solid growth.</p>
          <p>It was largely driven by the organic growth. As you can see, the operating profit from recurring operations was up 11%, 9% coming from organic growth. We also had some positive impact from the ForEx, which turned positive in Q4, thanks to a stronger U.S. dollar and RMB. We plan, obviously, this positive ForEx to go on in fiscal year 2012-2013.</p>
          <p>Gross margin, after logistic costs, a strong improvement in the rates, 111 basis points up, driven by the portfolio mix. As you saw before, the growth in top 14 sales, 10%, was higher than the group growth, 8%. And within that portfolio, brand by brand, we had a particular favorable quality mix for Martell, for Jameson, among other brands. We have managed to increase our prices. On average, the top 14 prices were up 3%. At the same time, we've been able to control the inflation of the input costs. They were up 2%, excluding the different mix effects. And we also benefited from a favorable ForEx impact.</p>
          <p>A&amp;P, as we can see, they were up organically 7%. The ratio was slightly up. Obviously, as I said before, Top 14 growth was higher than the average of the group. As you know, they receive more A&amp;P than the other brands. The ratio, A&amp;P to net sales is a bit above 24%, three-fourth of the total A&amp;P expenditure. We have allocated this A&amp;P to other priority markets. In emerging markets, A&amp;P were up 11%. On the other hand, in Western Europe, we have optimized our investments. A&amp;P was down 2%.</p>
          <p>Structure cost, the ratio was almost stable. We had an 8% increase, which is in line with the organic sales growth. As for the A&amp;P, we put our resources where it makes sense. So, we have increased our resources in emerging markets. They represent 63% of the gross. I mean, structural costs in emerging markets grew by 16%. In particular, that's the case in the BRIC. In China, it was up 31%. In India, it was up 27%, in Russia, 22%. This is clearly more people in our sales force, more people to strengthen our route to market. And at the same time, also to the companies, the development of the group in new areas of growth, we have created subsidiaries in Vietnam and Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
          <p>In Western Europe, as for the A&amp;P, we have also optimized our structures and the increase in structure costs was lower than inflation. And those additional resources were also in line with our strategic priorities. And we have put more money behind innovation. In particular, we launched recently a Breakthrough Innovation Group, and more money also behind our people in talent management. And we also launched during the year the Pernod Ricard University.</p>
          <p>As a consequence of all that, profit from recurring operations was up organically 9%. This is a significant increase in the operating margin, up 75 basis points, thanks to premiumization, which has improved the gross margin.</p>
          <p>Control over resources, as you saw, the A&amp;P expenditures ratio was slightly up and they are focused on our most profitable brands. And we have also targeted the reinforcement of the sales force of the most buoyant countries, in particular, the BRIC. We also benefited from a favorable ForEx.</p>
          <p>So, if we have a look at this profit performance by region, as you can see, except for France, for the reason you know, the excise duty hike, all regions contributed to organic growth in profit, in particular, Asia, which confirmed its continued very strong momentum, and with some acceleration in the United States, which obviously have to improve the performance in the Americas and in Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>Starting with Asia/Rest of the World, so I would not comment on the activity that you saw previously with Pierre. What we can say that, well, sales up 15%; profit up 21%, very strong growth, strong increase in gross margin, which continues to benefit a lot from our improved mix and improved price. And some targeted investment to support brands. We benefit obviously from the scale of large <mark type="ph" /> men in the region (43:07) region like Martell. And we have the ability to invest more behind new growth drivers which are sources obviously of diversification of our growth in the region. And also as I said before, more money behind the sales force to put more people on the road to sell our brands in China, Africa, India, in particular. And as a consequence, we had a substantial improvement in the operating margin rate from 25.2% to 27.8%.</p>
          <p>Americas, we have put more money in that region. In A&amp;P, it was up 5%; in structure costs, largely driven by the sales force evolution, up 9%. As you know, this is a priority region for the group. We want to grow. We want to put more resources to be able to increase our market share.</p>
          <p>The growth was driven by the U.S. and Brazil, which are the two priority markets in the region. And the third one, Mexico, as you know, we commented that last year, was penalized by the fact &#x2013; from a financial standpoint, by the fact that we implemented the new strategic model, which obviously hope will deliver growth starting now. And as the operating margin rate was stable in that region, it makes sense, it's origin where we want to increase our investments.</p>
          <p>Europe excluding France, it was a good year when you take into account the tough context in Western Europe. Sales was up 2%, and the operating profit was up 4%, twice as much as last year, thanks to the acceleration in Eastern Europe, which helped to offset the decline in Western Europe. We have clearly put the money also where the potential of growth is, the budgeted growth for the A&amp;P in Eastern Europe and, at the same time, some 2% decrease in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>France, you see, market is tough. We saw that with consumption negatively impacted by the excise duty hike. Market is down 2%. We have decided to protect our investment behind our key brands and A&amp;P is slightly up, 2%, so that explains as a decrease by 3% of the operating profit.</p>
          <p>You have here the split of the sales and profit by region. Asia/Rest of the World strengthened its leadership in the group, and I think it shows very well how global we are with a consistent contribution of each region to sales and profits.</p>
          <p>Emerging markets increasing their share of the group net sales, up to 40%, and those emerging markets, as you can see, are in Asia, but also in Europe and in the Americas.</p>
          <p>So, let's have a look at what is below the operating profit, starting with the financial reserves from recurring operations. I think that first, what I would like to highlight is the fact that we have delivered all the objectives of our financing strategy, particularly on debt refinancing, which has resulted in a controlled increase in the cost of debt. It was up from 4.7% to 5.1%, that said, below the target we had communicated to you, which was 5.3%.</p>
          <p>So, if we have a look at the different elements of that strategy, first of all, we have increased the share of the bond debt to more than 80%. We believe that today, we have a healthy balance of bank and bond debt, which makes sense in the current environment. Obviously, the spreads were a bit higher than the previous bank debt, and so, it created an increase in the cost of debt.</p>
          <p>We have also increased the fixed-rate part to a bit more than 90% to be able to secure very attractive long-term rates, and it gives us, obviously, a very good protection against the potential of increasing rates in the future. We have increased the maturity to more than seven years. And those maturities are extended, and they are better spreads. We have a better profile of our debt. We have &#x20AC;1.5 billion of undrawn facility, obviously, giving us additional financial flexibility. And in terms of hedging, we have not changed our policy. We still have our debt structured by currency to try to match our cash flow by currency, so what we call the natural hedge, so we have 57% of the debt which is in dollars.</p>
          <p>Cash flow statement, we delivered, I think, again a solid free cash flow from recurring operations, more than &#x20AC;1.1 billion, marginally lower than last year while, at the same time, substantially increasing strategic investments.</p>
          <p>We had a significant increase in the self-financing capacity, as you saw on the previous slide. It was up &#x20AC;194 million, largely driven by the growth in the profit, operating profit. And it was reinvested behind our strategic assets to support the future growth. So, I would like to highlight, on the one hand, the acceleration of growth of strategic inventories. They were up &#x20AC;157 million as compared to &#x20AC;85 million last year, in particular in cognac, whiskies and champagne.</p>
          <p>And we have also increased our capital expenditure, in particular, the industrial one by &#x20AC;77 million. It now reaches &#x20AC;260 million in total. We have increased the distillation and storage capacities in Ireland. We have a big project to increase the decision capacity for Jameson Scotland, France and Sweden. So, this is clearly investment to be able to fuel the very high growth we have and we plan for our strategic activities. The cash flow from non-recurring items was more or less stable versus last year.</p>
          <p>So, what we have here is the change in net debt. Net debt was down &#x20AC;385 million, excluding the translation impact. If you adjust for acquisition and disposals of last year and the year before, it's very comparable to the definition we had the year before.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the face value of the debt was up, because of an unfavorable ForEx impact of &#x20AC;710 million, obviously, and I think these are things we have very &#x2013; constantly commented in the last two years with the strings of currencies. This year, the price of euro-dollar at the end of June was far &#x2013; the euro was far lower than at the beginning of the year. It was $1.26 as compared to $1.45. And so, you had the direct impact on the debt.</p>
          <p>Obviously, the positive counterpart for us is the positive ForEx impact on EBIT. We had part of it last year. We have the largest portion of this positive ForEx impact in 2012/2013.</p>
          <p>Deleveraging. Another strong year for deleveraging. As a ratio net-debt-to-EBITDA, the average rate was down from 4.4 to 3.8, down 0.6. We are now below 4. By the way, it will improve the spread of the syndicated credit by 15 basis points in 2012/2013.</p>
          <p>On the right hand side, we have summarized the evolution of this ratio in the last four years. As you can see, just after the Vin &amp; Sprit acquisition, the pro forma leverage was 6.2 and we had an impressive reduction in the last four years, it's now 3.8, not so different from the ratio of 3.6 that we had just before the Vin &amp; Sprit acquisition.</p>
          <p>Income tax from recurring operations, the rate is 23.5%. It is exactly in the middle of the bracket we had communicated to you earlier this year. We had announced a bracket of 23%, 24%. This is 23.5%. So, as a consequence, our group share of net profit from recurring operations is in very strong growth, double-digit growth, 10%. That's also the case for the EPS from recurring operations.</p>
          <p>Very quickly, non-recurring items, we had some negative other operating income expenses of &#x20AC;145 million, including restructuring cost, some asset impairment, in particular, in the wine business and some cost for disputes and risks.</p>
          <p>The non-recurring financial items were, this year, negative because of some foreign exchange losses. The corporate income tax on non-recurring items was positive by &#x20AC;130 million, largely driven by more favorable rates for the deferred taxes, in particular, the change in the UK tax rate.</p>
          <p>So, the group share of net profit after recurring and non-recurring items is up 10% as for the group share of net profit from recurring operations.</p>
          <p>The proposed dividend is &#x20AC;1.58 per share, increase by 10%. It is in line with our customary policy of cash distribution of approximately one-third of net profit from recurring operations. The distribution rate is near from 35%.</p>
          <p>So, I will now hand over to Pierre for the conclusion and the outlook.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gilles. Well, first of all, to summarize the last year &#x2013; last fiscal year, I mean, it was an exceptionally good year. And this is reflected, first, in the growth rate. And again, that's the best growth rate which we achieved since the economic crisis. This is also reflected in our profitability and in the operating margin, in the improvement of the operating margin by 75 basis points. And this is also reflected in the indebtedness. And as Gilles said, we're basically back to the pre-Vin &amp; Sprit acquisition level. And by the way, full-year refinance with an average maturity which is in the range of seven years.</p>
          <p>So, the outlook now. Well, I don't intend to tell you about the overall environment. And I think we all share the same view. Yes, there will be a slowdown of the global economic growth. And that will be the case in both mature and emerging market. That mainly will be the case in Western and, I would say, Southern West Europe, which is the direct impact of the measures, the necessary measures to curb down the debt and the public deficit. But we do anticipate the continued good growth in the U.S. and still a strong growth in emerging market. That's very much the picture which we can see today. In this environment, and I'm not going to make a long speech, we're very confident in our capacity to generate growth in this current fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is yours for your questions. Well, we have the next announcement. And obviously, we will give qualified objectives guidance with the first quarter sales and that will be on the 25th of October. So, the floor is yours for your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Thank you very much. Jos&#xE9;phine Chevallier from Natixis. I had a couple of questions about the trading. Well, one is, obviously, about what you just said about your being very confident. We know you don't really give a guidance before October, but could you give us a color about what's going on now, the trends, and especially, we know that the acceleration in the U.S. and in certain eastern country in Europe? So, that would one question.</p>
          <p>The second question would be about the status of the inventories on the trade and particularly in the U.S., if you had some color in Asia, China, if you could give us some color there? And also, I believe you talked about bolt-on acquisitions this morning. You already have made acquisitions that, such as Avi&#xF3;n and could you give us some color on where you want to go, in which categories you would like to reinforce your portfolio in the U.S. and in Asia, possibly? Thank you very much.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of regional trends, this year, as you know, emerging markets that represent 40% overall of our net sales, have grown by 17% organically and mature markets represent the other 60%, have grown by 2%. What we can say is, as mentioned earlier, we do expect the U.S. to continue in a virtuous cycle, where the on-trade is picking up, where the higher end of the market premiumization is continuing. So, we do expect good growth in the U.S.</p>
          <p>In terms of Asia, for instance as well, again, as Pierre mentioned, we expect a strong momentum as well over there. There might be maybe &#x2013; in India, we do see some slight deceleration in terms of growth rates due to the macro outlook regarding the Indian economy, but overall, we do expect Asia to keep on a very good growth rate.</p>
          <p>Eastern Europe as well is still doing extremely well. So, we don't foresee any issue for the time being in Eastern Europe as well. And Africa, well, at the end of the day, Africa is a conquest region for us. We are investing heavily behind Africa. And frankly, Africa is doing pretty well.</p>
          <p>Now, as Pierre mentioned it earlier, South Western Europe, namely Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, which represent roughly 6% of our net sales cumulatively. Well, I mean, it's no news. It's still going to be a struggling region, but bear in mind that other parts of Western Europe, such as Germany, for instance, or some of the Nordics country or the Netherlands are performing pretty well.</p>

          <p>Inventory?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Inventories, in terms of the trade inventories, well, basically versus last year, is in line. There is no hike or it's basically normal status for inventories.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And regarding France, in particular, because we, obviously, had the significant inventory ahead of the duty increase, we can say that at the end of June, it's absorbed at 95%. So, we're talking in the 100,000 liters compared to pre-buying in the range of &#x20AC;15 million or &#x20AC;16 million. So, it's really something which now is behind us.</p>
          <p>Acquisitions, Gilles, do you want to spend some money?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that clearly, our priority is still organic growth. I think we have now a very strong portfolio, a very good geographical exposure. And we have what we need to be able to keep growing in that level of rate. That said, I think we are open to yes, what you &#x2013; we can call bolt-on acquisition, if they can help to seize new occasional consumption, if they help to improve our growth profile in emerging markets or in the U.S., we are prepared to move.</p>
          <p>Well, we have no strong brands in all key categories. So, it's not just &#x2013; it's not so much about categories. It's about complementarities to the portfolio, tapping new consumers, new occasion of consumption. It's not so much about, I would say, categories.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Xavier Croquez, Cheuvreux. I have two questions. The first one is trying to reconcile the price and mix effect that you have in sales and the growth margin, which was up 30 bps. But I'm trying to understand, looking ahead, if what are the underlying trends? With the price and mix effect you gave us on top brands, the key brands and champagne, you can probably guess that, that group leverage, at group level, the split of growth was 3% volume and 5% price mix, that's my rough guess. If you have 5% price mix, why don't you have more growth margin expansion on an underlying basis? I calculated 30 bps. It's fine, but can I hope for more or what is driving only 30 bps when I have 5% price mix, is my first question?</p>
          <p>And the second question, there has been hikes on CapEx and working cap that have diluted underlying free cash flow growth this year. How should we understand the future? Is this a relative one-off or help us a little bit on this, if you can? It would be very helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gilles will answer both questions and-</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on your first point, I think gross margin rate evolution was very positive. It was more than 100 basis points. It's safe to say that the ForEx has been helpful. On the price and mix, we communicate on the top 14, which makes sense. We made a calculation for the full group, give the price and mix, which was around 4%. But it includes so many different things and sometimes some sales which can be a bulk and so on, which I think it doesn't make a lot of sense, right? So I would say that premiumization, which is the backbone of the strategy, is driving the gross margin up and it has been the case for the last years. And we have a positive &#x2013; decade &#x2013; and positive price mix each year. So, I think all this appears to me very consistent.</p>
          <p>On your question on CapEx and strategic inventories, I think that we are confident in the gross of our Scotch portfolio, of Jameson, of cognac and I think we had the opportunity to discuss about that in previous meetings and Capital Market Days. And clearly, to fuel that future growth, we want to have already today the right inventory. We want also to increase the CapEx. The CapEx has remained steady since the crisis, more or less in the last three years. And clearly between 2011 and 2012 and between &#x2013; and in the year 2012/2013, in those two years, this is clearly a period for us to increase our CapEx. And as you know, CapEx don't increase on a gradual basis. It's step-by-step, and we are at the moment, because of our growth profile, when we have decided in that period of two years to step up the CapEx level.</p>
          <p>As far as the strategic inventories are concerned, we will keep increasing those strategic inventories year after year to be able to fuel the growth on Martell, on all the Scotch portfolio and on Jameson and the champagne also, in particular.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Two questions, please. The first one, looking at China, I know we shouldn't get too excited about quarterly growth rates. But am I right in thinking that if I strip out the Q3 and Q1 and H1 results, that growth slipped a little bit under 20% in Q4, and if that's right, maybe just give a little bit of color on that?</p>
          <p>And the second thing concerning debt capacity, in the past, the group felt comfortable going up to 6 times net debt to EBITDA for the right acquisition. Clearly now, with bond financing, that limit is much lower. So, just wondering would you feel comfortable saying what would be the maximum limit of net debt to EBITDA you'd feel comfortable going to for the right acquisition, given the current debt structure?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Regarding China for the time being, there is no red or orange lights that are spiking up. Q4 was slightly, yes, under 20%. Just bear in mind as well from a cognac point of view that we do segment our liquid by quarters. So we'll see what Q1 of this fiscal year will look like, bearing in mind as well that there is a delay in the mid-autumn festival, which is a few weeks later than it was last year.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your second question, Trevor, I think that, yes, we &#x2013; in the past, in the last decade, we had at some point the reversal period of time some net debt to EBITDA ratio which could be above 6. I think that, clearly, we are not prepared to go to those levels in the current environment. I think we said very clearly that we want to remain a sustainable investment-grade company. So I think that it gives you the elements to assess what kind of leverage we could accept to have in the future.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, all. Three questions, if I can. Firstly, just going back to one of the earlier questions around gross margin. Gilles, I appreciate gross margins in reported terms was strong in the year. However, if I look at just the Asia region specifically, I note that the organic gross margin expansion in the second half was only around about 10 basis points compared to about 140 basis points in the first half. And could you just help us understand really what's happened there in the second half, given that from all your comments around the growth in prestige brands, the price mix, obviously, remained very strong through the year? So I'm trying to get some clarity on how we should think about that organic leverage as we look into 2013.</p>
          <p>Secondly, just going back to China, obviously, you took some very firm pricing on Martell in China in the period, I think, probably, a little bit over 20% on aggregate across the portfolio. How should we think about pricing in China looking forward, given the comments you made around, obviously, ongoing scarcity issues of supply of cognac?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, just around FX, again, Gilles, looking for some perhaps firmer guidance as to the benefit we may see at the EBIT line from the positive FX tailwinds you've got for 2013? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Starting with the gross margin in China, Gilles, can you make any comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing. The gross margin in China remain at a very, very high levels. We have not seen any change in the underlying trend.</p>
          <p>What I can just say between the first half and second half is that the mix of growth was a bit different between the two halves. And as you know, in the first half, we had very high sales, partly driven by the technical impacts. We mentioned before the duty increase in France with the market stocking, and the Chinese New Year, which was earlier this year.</p>
          <p>So, mechanically, it means that we absorbed more fixed costs, more production fixed costs in the first half than the second half, and so naturally, it has an impact when you have a look at the version of the gross margin between first half and second half. But, fundamentally, apart from this phasing impact, we have not seen any deterioration of the gross margins in China or overall in the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which, by the way, reflects our policy to be very firm on our pricing policy. And, Alexandre, what would you say about China pricing policy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, regarding Martell in China, Martell overall grew 25% in net sales, of which 16% was the price and mix, principally driven indeed by China with the most recent price increases that took place around May of this year, which means that the benefit of some of the price increases taken towards the end of the fiscal year, we'll have them in this current fiscal year.</p>
          <p>As to future price increases, well, our affiliate in Pernod Ricard China will drive price upwards as they deem feasible and in terms of timing as well, as they always have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Sophie Dargnies, HSBC. I have two follow-up questions, one in China. You say that Q4 organic sales growth was under 20%. Did you see an evolution month after month? And can you also give us the trends specifically in July and August?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe September.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe September &#x2013; it could be perfect. France, you say that inventory is 95% absorbed. What do you expect for 2012/2013? Do you expect the organic sales growth to come back to a positive trend and did you have some positive news in the last two months? Can you give us some color for France? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, unfortunately, I won't go into the detail on even the weekly basis of our sales because that's &#x2013; we will come on that on the &#x2013; when we present the Q1 sales number. The only thing which I would like to underline regarding China, I did mention that when we posted 24% overall organic growth in China, and more particularly, 29% in Martell, that's probably above what we intend to achieve in this market.</p>
          <p>And we, clearly, said that, for instance, for Martell, due to the inventory, due to our strategy, we are probably targeting it more in the mid-teen sort of growth rate. I think that's &#x2013; and that's very much what we guided you, if you remember, a year ago, when we presented the results. And I think that gives you a sort of &#x2013; and at the end of the day, it's much more what we intend to achieve rather than what the market will be. So that's, I think, a proper guideline.</p>
          <p>And regarding France and the inventory, well, I said it's &#x2013; the inventory level is something which, of course, we have a good view, but not a perfect view. But as I said, compared to what was trade loading in the range of 15 million liters, 16 million liters altogether at the end of December, we're talking of something which is in the range of less than 1 million liters. So I think it's behind us.</p>
          <p>But what is not behind us, obviously, is the negative impact on the duty increase. And we know from, I'm going to say, past examples when we had a similar &#x2013; that it takes between 12 to 18 months for the consumer to get used to the new price, which is &#x2013; it's &#x20AC;2 for a bottle of Ricard or Pastis 51 and &#x20AC;1-something for a bottle of vodka, scotch whisky and so on. So that's &#x2013; that will be absorbed by the consumer, but it will take some time.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. We're seeing structural costs rise quite a bit in the year and, of course, you're flagging further investment particularly in Africa going forward. I just wanted to think about the next couple of years, where we should see that structural cost increase starting to reduce any operating leverage impact at the profit line?</p>
          <p>And the second question was specifically around Mexico, it appears that that revamping of the business model has been perhaps a bigger task than you thought. I know you did something similar in Brazil a while back and that worked well. Perhaps you can give us a little bit of color what happened in Mexico? And are there any of the markets that you're considering a similar change in the business model at the moment?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that looking mid-term &#x2013; mid, long term, it makes sense that, at some point, we get some operational leverage with structural costs growing at a lower pace than net sales. I think that last year, this year and probably in the current fiscal year, we are still in a moment of investment to reinforce our distribution network in the emerging markets and also attacking really significantly as a new continent which is Africa, where we are in the process of creating five new affiliates. So very clearly, this is an investment today for growth in the future. I think you're right to say that mid, long-term, our intention is to get some operational leverage from the increase in structural cost, which would be lower than the net sales increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding your question on Mexico, just two things. A reengineering of the entire business cannot happen overnight. That being said, now, the tough part of the entire reengineering which went through the reorganization, number one, of the sales force, the revamping of the route to market and as well a revamping of the trade terms has been done. The new trade terms, which are pretty clear, have already been accepted by more than two-thirds of our distributors in Mexico. So it's now a question of time to see the business gradually take up under its new form, but the local management feel pretty confident. Actually, I spoke to them yesterday.</p>

          <p>Good morning, everyone. Last week, your main competitor in Europe indicated that it would continue to invest in its brands in Western Europe. From the tone and the content of what you're saying on this presentation, it sounds like you're going to be shifting a lot of the A&amp;P spend to Eastern Europe. What can we consider the Western European brand investment strategy going forward from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would be very clear. We have been very firm on defending our positions in Western Europe, even in the most difficult markets like Spain or Italy and Greece. And I can tell you that on these markets, we are very confident that, indeed, we have gained market share. Just to remind you, for instance, of the performance of Beefeater in Spain which have been posting a net growth. So I think our strategy is certainly not to move away from what we consider are still very, very important markets, and Spain is definitely one of them.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there is no risk of underinvestment. As Pierre said, I think we've been very, very consistent since the crisis defending our profit pools in Western Europe. And I think that if we gain market share, it's also because we have protected our investments, while maybe some competitors have decreased it a lot. And I think that the positive consequence for us is today where we have better performances.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Two questions from me, please. With all the Board and management changes that you've been announced today, just wondered whether external shareholders were consulted over that or whether that was a straight Board decision? And then a second question for Gilles, 11% profit growth, 10% EPS growth, should we expect leverage to come through below the EBIT line for this year? I suppose that's my roundabout way of asking for some sort of guidance on the interest and tax lines in the P&amp;L. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the governance, this is mainly a Board decision, so that's at the Board level which have been made. And so, maybe to come back on the rationale behind those decisions is, first of all, the continued implication, and this is clearly stated since ever of the Ricard family behind Pernod Ricard. And I can tell you that I'm particularly pleased that Dani&#xE8;le Ricard accepted to become Chairman of the Board. I think it's the strength of Pernod Ricard to have this reference shareholder, which gives us stability, long-term view of our strategy and so this is reaffirmed today.</p>
          <p>On the second decision, which is to have Alexandre by my side as Deputy CEO, Directeur G&#xE9;n&#xE9;ral D&#xE9;l&#xE9;gu&#xE9; in French, and clearly established as my successor in 2015 when I will get the statutory age limit of Pernod Ricard, have made no secret since ever, that will be the limit for myself. There is some time for enjoying life, and so I think 65 is a good age for that. So I think, at the end of the day, it's very much the decision of continuity regarding the business model and the governance of Pernod Ricard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on your second question on interests, next year, we'll have the full-year impact on the refinancing that we did in 2011/2012. So this should give an additional 50 basis points to the cost of debt. But as I have already mentioned in past conferences, we plan as a cost of debt in the year after, in 2013/2014, to go back to a level which is similar to the one we had in 2011/2012 because we'll have some expensive past financing and hedgings which will come to maturity. And for the tax from &#x2013; on profit from recurring operations, I think based on the current tax environment, our estimation is that we could have a modest increase.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. I had a couple of questions, please. First, if you could talk a little bit about pricing in the U.S., have you taken pricing on any of your brands in recent months or have you announced any with your wholesalers and what's your view on the outlook there?</p>
          <p>The second question on France. I think you said that consumption declined, based on Nielsen, year-to-date, has been around 2%, and I think you are suggesting worse than that at the beginning of the year. So is it that the market has so far held up better than you were expecting? And what &#x2013; how do you think the second part of the year will be in terms of market in France?</p>
          <p>And then, if I may, just a little question on Korea. It seemed to rebound a bit in the fourth quarter. I know you had a technical negative which impacted you in Q3. So I was wondering whether it's just that or have you seen an underlying improvement in Korea, which would contrast with what your main competitor is saying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pricing in the US, Alexandre?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have taken pricing in the US over the last year and last fiscal which we're commenting now today, basically on our brand spirits, on our whiskies, including specifically Jameson. The outlook in terms of pricing in the US, again, is that Pernod Ricard U.S.A. will be increasing prices across the portfolio at different levels, obviously, depending on the competitive environment, but price increases will happen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On France, maybe &#x2013; I think we had said that our estimation for the impact of the duty increase on the consumption for the full calendar year would be minus &#x20AC;25 million. I think that this is still our estimation today. We had more or less a negative &#x20AC;10 million hit in the last fiscal year. In the first half of the current fiscal year, we, hence, expect more or less a &#x20AC;15 million hit. So no change in our estimation at this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the latest Nielsen panel are very much in line and probably even slightly better, but it's too early to talk about any improvement. And in Korea, I think really we should say that it's unchanged.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, it is still me. Just very briefly, on the pricing you're referring to in the U.S., the pricing that you've taken on the brand spirits, is that the pricing that you talk towards the end of last summer or has there been anything more recent after that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I take their key growth driver being Jameson, they took a certain number of price increases across the year. They started indeed in summer, but there were additional price increases in Q3 of the last fiscal year, between January and March. So there were several paces of price increases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Morning, everyone. Just wanted to come to the wine portfolio. Obviously, it's been a much better year for you there. I was just wanting to know sort of some of the underlying drivers behind that, whether you thought this was clearly a structurally challenged category and whether you thought that there was more opportunity going forward to drive similar kind of growth rates, both from a market perspective, but also from Pernod doing &#x2013; performing better within the market.</p>
          <p>And then just secondly, on the U.S., you spoke about an uptick in the on-trade. Could you maybe say whether that &#x2013; you've seen a better improvement in the on-trade versus the off in recent weeks or months? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding wine &#x2013; Alexandre will answer on the U.S. &#x2013; I think our strategy is extremely clear. If you look at the volume growth, the sales growth and the profit growth, this is very much what we had been delivering last fiscal year, but exactly the same on the previous year as well. We have a value strategy which means that we're not looking for volumes for the sake of the volume, but for value.</p>
          <p>This is supported by a clear innovations strategy, and I think some of them were mentioned in the presentation, as well as a good level of support in term of advertising and consumer promotions. And I think that this strategy is very firmly established that &#x2013; and we have a coordinated approach on wine because the premium wine brand division encompasses all our wine, so it's mean, of course, Australia and New Zealand, but as well the Spanish wine as well and not to forget about Graffigna, our Argentinean wine. So we have global strategy. And year-on-year, you should see the same pattern that value will go ahead of volume.</p>
          <p>Regarding the U.S., again?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The on-trade is back on a healthy pace and this &#x2013; we have seen the trend, whether it's 12 rolling months, six rolling months, three rolling months, the trend has consistently improved. The off-trade was already in a good shape. What I mean by good, it's versus the American economy. So, basically, yes, the on-trade is coming back, which should have a positive impact as well from a margin point of view versus the off-trade.</p>

          <p>And we have a last question on the phone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question is from Gerard Rijk, ING. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning. Three questions, if I may. First question is about the depreciation charge, amortization and other movements. That was, in fact, down by &#x20AC;11 million in an environment of higher currencies and of higher CapEx. Maybe you can elaborate on that? Second question is on Africa, you're talking about five new affiliates. Can you be more specific on the countries where you are expanding?</p>
          <p>And my last question, it's in &#x2013; well, maybe, it's necessary to clear that it's about China. You're talking about growth below 20% in the fourth quarter. But in the first nine months, you had 22%. In the full year, it was 24%. So, maybe you can elaborate how you come to that below 20%? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Depreciation, Gilles?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think that it's not just amortization, depreciation, provision movements, so there are different non-cash elements there. It was &#x20AC;174 million last year, it's &#x20AC;163 million this year. I think that the difference is very modest and so I wouldn't say there is a big change. This is probably &#x2013; in terms of amortization, the evolution was &#x2013; there was indeed a slight increase because of the high investment we did, but then you had a few technical impacts derived from variation of provisions. So, nothing particular to report there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, regarding Africa, we'll give you a recipe to remind easily the countries. So, it's the GNAK strategy. So, GNAK is Ghana, Namibia, Angola and Kenya. Unfortunately, Morocco is difficult to add into this acronym, but that's the list of the countries.</p>
          <p>China, again, so we're losing momentum in China or what can we say about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. At that stage, it would be a little bit wrong to say that there is a loss of momentum in China. Just want to reiterate what Pierre said earlier about our objectives from a scarcity and stock point of view, which is mid-teens objectives for Martell, as we always have mentioned it. But for the time being, the GDP rate which was used to be between 8 and 9 going down to between 7 and 8, for the time being, doesn't suggest that there is going to be a depressed consumption in China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's the last word on China and on this result presentation. So, maybe, Jean, you would like to make the last word?</p>
