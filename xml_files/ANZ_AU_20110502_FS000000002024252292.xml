          <p>Hi, good morning everybody and welcome to the ANZ Interim Results 2011. Joined here today by our CEO, Mike Smith; and CFO, Peter Marriott, they are going to speak to you for about 25 to 30 minutes and then we'll go to Q&amp;A. So, I'll bore you with the housekeeping details at that point. I'll hand it over to Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Many thanks, Jill. And good morning to everybody joining us here in Sydney on the web and over the phone. As well as Peter, I have most of the management Board with me here in Sydney or on the phone who'll help me answer any questions that you may have later.</p>
          <p>Let me start off by saying that our first half results has come in exactly in line with expectations, following our first quarter update. The bottom line is that you're seeing a continuation of both the good underlying momentum in our core business and good progress with our super-regional strategy.</p>
          <p>As I said to you before, banking is a long-term game and our goal at ANZ has been very consistent. To build a super-regional bank that delivers long-term growth and differentiated returns. We don't believe that these returns are available to us with a domestic-only strategy, and I think it's now clear to just about everyone that the main game for Australia and for New Zealand for the foreseeable future is our connectivity to Asia.</p>
          <p>This result demonstrates that we're delivering against what we have been promising you. In our key business, we are improving our position with market share gains and strong customer satisfaction. Underlying profit, compared to the last half, was up 3% to AUD2.8 billion, and is 23% higher than the first half of 2010. Statutory profit is up 3% to AUD2.7 billion on the first half and is 38% higher than the prior period. This is despite the strong domestic currency, which has reduced profit growth in Australian dollars terms by around 2%.</p>
          <p>Shareholders are seeing the benefits of our better performance with an interim dividend of AUD0.64. This is AUD0.12 per share or 23% higher than the first half of last year.</p>
          <p>The community is seeing the evidence of our commitment, particularly with the support we've provided following the natural disasters in the Christchurch, in Queensland and then the other Australian states and of course in Japan. And one thing I want to acknowledge publically is the contribution of all our staff to this result. And I want to make special mention of our people who've been at the heart of our response to the natural disasters in Australia and New Zealand. And what they have done for customers is really quite outstanding.</p>
          <p>Turning to our performance in our key geographies. We delivered a solid outcome in Australia, despite the impact of natural disasters. Australia regional profit increase 2% for the half, the result of continued revenue growth in retail, which is performing strongly, offset by higher expense growth in both institutional and commercial banking.</p>
          <p>Increased provision charges, largely related to the floods experienced in January, but were offset by continuing improvements in institutional asset quality. Our core franchise is performing well in a very competitive environment. Mortgage lending grew at 4% or 1.2 times system growth. Household deposits grew 7% or 1.6 times system's growth, and commercial deposits grew 10%, which was in line with system's growth.</p>
          <p>The result for commercial banking however was more uneven. This was impacted by increased flood related provisioning. But the Business Bank and SME had good results, which was offset by the more difficult conditions for regional and commercial and Esanda.</p>
          <p>Not surprisingly, flood general insurance payments, including ex-gratia payments affected wealth with revenue up just 1% half-on-half. However, we have made good progress with the integration of the old ING Australia business with a new brand OnePath and new leadership for the business. And there is still considerable potential in wealth, both through our Planner and Branch networks.</p>
          <p>Now, what were some encouraging early signs during this half, particularly in the insurance business, clearly the wealth management part of this business needs to the start firing on all cylinders by the end of this year. We believe there's upside in our business in Australia, and we're continuing to invest in opportunities, for example, in wealth and in commercial banking.</p>
          <p>We're also heavily investing in IT. In addition to ensuring the stability of key customer systems such as Internet banking, point-of-sale, ATMs, which are required as a natural course, we're investing in our channel and customer capabilities to improve the overall customer experience. I will talk more about technology later.</p>
          <p>New Zealand is also important to our Group strategy, and performance continues to improve, although admittedly of a low base. Regional profit grew 19% in New Zealand dollar terms with our core franchise performing well, costs being tightly managed in a weak economic environment. Revenue was up 4%, and expenses, down 5%.</p>
          <p>Underlying credit quality has continued to improve with provisions down 35%. The February earthquake in Christchurch is likely to have an impact on individual provisions over the short-to-medium term. And although it's still a little early to fully quantify the impact of the earthquake, we believe we already hold sufficient collective provisions to cover foreseeable losses.</p>
          <p>Asia-Pacific, Europe, and America, APEA continues to perform strongly with pro-forma US dollar profit up 12%. Costs were well managed with jaws of positive 3%, leading to profit before provisions growth of 22%. Institutional and partnerships continued to drive the majority of profit, however, retail is now showing improved profitability as the benefits emerge from the RBS acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Customer deposits grew 22%, and lending was up 19%. Retail deposits increased 53% on the prior corresponding period to almost AUD13 billion, driven by the businesses we acquired from RBS and continued client acquisition.</p>
          <p>APEA's performance is another milestone, which highlights the benefits to shareholders of our increasing exposure to Asia. And connectivity between the region and Australia and New Zealand is continuing to be a source of domestic customer revenue growth. APEA revenue was almost 15% of total revenue in the half. In addition, Australia and New Zealand revenue sourced from APEA contributed a further 3% to the group.</p>
          <p>Finally, our global institutional business. Institutional pro-forma profit after tax rose 12% with a 50% lower provision charge. Other revenues grew 24%, reflecting a strong contribution from global markets, particularly in APEA and a reduced reliance on interest income.</p>
          <p>Having spent two years turning around institutional's performance, we're now investing in diversifying its client base, its revenue streams and its geographic footprint as well as the division's underlying support systems. The result is that we're delivering more revenue for more customers and more products across more markets.</p>
          <p>Expenses were up 8%, this includes investments in our global markets capabilities and our cash management platform. And an example of that is in February ANZ became the first Australian bank to offer a Trans-Tasman cash management solution. Employee numbers were up 3% with the largest increase in Asia, which was up 7%.</p>
          <p>Turning to group credit quality. We're still seeing an improvement in credit quality, but at a slower pace. The total underlying provision charge of AUD660 million was down 40% on the same period last year and 9% down on this last half. Our Tier 1 capital at 31st of March was 10.5%, and basically the bottom line is that we're in a very strong position both financially and strategically.</p>
          <p>The ongoing improvements in our funding profile has continued during the half with customer deposits growth exceeding loan growth by AUD1.7 billion. Our reliance on short-term wholesale debt has continued to reduce, and this now represents just 11% of the funding base while customer deposits now account for 60%.</p>
          <p>We expect to see our annual term issuance at the lower end of the AUD20 billion to AUD25 billion range and we're well progressed against this target with AUD14 billion of term debt already issued to the end of March.</p>
          <p>While wholesale funding costs remain high, Australian banks retain actually still good access to global capital markets.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me comment briefly on the outlook. So, while this result is in line with our trading update, the environment is now a little more difficult. Parts of the Australian economy have clearly hit a flat spot with consumers and businesses becoming more conservative after the financial crisis, and being reluctant to spend in an uncertain economic climate. And as I've said before, this has being compounded by the impact of the floods in Australia, particularly in Queensland and in New Zealand by the earthquakes. The bigger picture is that we're starting to see the effects of a major structural change that's underway as the Australian economy continues to shift towards being much more based around hard and soft commodities.</p>
          <p>And I don't think the magnitude of this shift is still fully understood, nor its implications for industries like manufacturing, like tourism and retail, where business models are clearly going to have to adapt to a lower margin, lower growth environment.</p>
          <p>Just to help you think about this shift and what's really going on, we're re still seeing high levels of receiverships and consumer confidence is low. But unemployment is still falling, and that's because jobs are actually being picked up by the growth driven by the resources sector. The issue here is, over the longer term, this is likely to create resource shortages and wage pressures in all sectors of the economy.</p>
          <p>Now while there are some headwinds for us to manage, I think we're actually well positioned to be ahead of the curve. Our super-regional Strategy is giving us a greater exposure to Asia's growth and it's aligning us closely to the new and emerging growth segments of the Australian and the New Zealand economies as evidenced by the lift we are seeing in non-interest income and cross-border flows.</p>
          <p>We're investing aggressively in these opportunities, particularly in APEA and in institutional. I do however want to acknowledge that whilst this is a long-term game, we still need to perform in the near-term. Having put a number of building blocks in place, including through acquisition and the investments we have made in building capability, we believe that there is further upside in the business. This includes our performance in wealth, our performance in commercial banking and institutional in Australia and retail and wealth in Asia.</p>
          <p>There is also the opportunity and indeed the need across the bank to continue developing stronger customer propositions, driving productivity gains from our hubs and integrating the super-regional strategy into all our businesses. This gives us confidence that ANZ is not only well positioned over the next two to three years, but that we are well-positioned going into the second half.</p>
          <p>With that I'd like to hand over to Peter, who'll take you through the results in more detail. Many thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Mike and good morning. As Mike has said in his introductory comments, both our statutory profit and our underlying profit has increased by 3% half-on-half. And looking at some of the individual components, the profit before provisions is up 3% on my calculations that was bang on analyst consensus. Provisions might just go a little higher, and probably I think that's going to be a average about AUD15 million higher, and you can see there's been some adjustments made in there for the natural disasters, which we'll talk a little bit about in a moment.</p>
          <p>And the tax rate came in at 28.5%, which is I think about 0.4% higher than consensus. I think, you needed to remember that there was a AUD31 million one-off tax gain in the second half of last year that were carried forward in their models. So, as Mike said, at the outset, very much in line with consensus overall.</p>
          <p>The non-core items likewise are the ones which are signals. We had normal items that we've had there for the last few halves, plus the charge in relation to the New Zealand technology simplification. So, let's have a look at some of more details here.</p>
          <p>We manage the business more around the pro-forma numbers, so adjusted for the effects of exchange rates and for acquisitions, look what's happening with the underlying business. And the corresponding numbers are set out in the slide. And as you can see, revenue expenses and profit before provisions half-on-half were all up 4.1%. And so there was neutral jaws in there. See the jaws on a pro-forma basis PCP were negative 2%, and that was because of very strong cost growth and negative jaws in the second half of last year, and Mike will comment about that later.</p>
          <p>With that PBP and the reduction in provisions all up then a pro-forma of 5.5% growth in profit after tax. So, clearly a key adjustment in there is exchange rate, so not surprising with the strength of the Australian dollars is receiving a lot of attention. So, the impact for us in the first half was 1.9% half-on-half and that would have been 2.5% but for the effect of the hedges that we had in place. You can see we put it there out, estimated what the full year impact is on our result using current exchange rates again. And notably, there is a reasonable amount, I think, around 60% of our New Zealand dollar and US dollars which are hedged in the second half.</p>
          <p>The US dollars are hedged at around AUD0.90, and the Kiwi at around AUD1.20. And that's why you get a relatively modest 1.5% full year-on-year impact. And you can see the benefit of those hedges coming through compared to the 3.1%, which is if we had no hedges at all for this current year.</p>
          <p>Looking at the divisions, I think all of our divisions had a respectable growth in this period. But once again APEA has been the stand-out in terms of the revenue growth that it has achieved. When you look at it from a PBP point of view, the institutional lines, I think that Mike has already commented on, very strong PBP growth offshore, but within Australia, market income was down a little bit lower and transaction services as well. Less earnings coming from the balance sheet, for example in Australia, dragged down the market's earnings. And as I said, the institutional result offshore was particularly pleasing.</p>
          <p>New Zealand is really, as Mike said in his introductory comments, very little revenue growth, but great cost control. And so that 6% there comes from 1% revenue and a 5% reduction in costs. And clearly in that environment, and as we're continuing focus, as it will be. The PAT numbers are broadly a little better than the profit before provision numbers with a couple of exceptions. Overall provisions were down, but in the case of the Australia division, we've increased the collective provision both the floods and also some of the increases in arrears flow through the models into some high collective provision charges. And that's why the PAT number is down relative to the PBP number. And of course the APEA number doesn't reflect increases in provisions causing that lower profit growth &#x2013; about AUD31million of tax again coming through to mean that the half-on-half growth wasn't quite as high.</p>
          <p>So, looking at the income component of that growth, 4.1%. I think one of the things that might have immediately jumped out at you when you looked at the numbers was, the net interest income growth isn't very high, prima facie, looks about 2%. But once again, I draw your attention to the issues that we have in the accounting for the various components of market income. And whilst the markets income was up 8% half-on-half or 12% in pro-forma terms, the composition was very, very different. Interest income went down by AUD126 million, and other income was very, very strong.</p>
          <p>So, this then flows through to an impact on overall NII. And if you adjust it for that, you see NII, excluding markets, is actually up 4% with essentially modest growth in the margin and about 4% growth in interest earning assets, excluding markets. The market business itself as I said, 12% pro-forma growth half-on-half was very strong, a good component of that coming from sales revenue, which is closer to what we want to see. And we'll talk a little bit more about that as we go on, but it's the only part of the business that will continue to have a strong growth.</p>
          <p>Looking at the margin, as I mentioned in the introductory comments, the margin excluding markets is up modestly, up about 2.9 basis points. That market's composition impact meant that the overall margin is down 2.5, but as you know we primarily focus on the margin excluding markets and look at markets income in total. So, the factors which have driven that 2.9% growth in the margin excluding markets are very similar to the ones we've seen in previous halves. And notably a very intense deposit competition but the re-pricing effect on assets offsetting that. And notably in here, this includes the effect of a much greater proportion of the New Zealand book now being variable rate, and the ongoing re-pricing of that fixed rate portfolio at the same time.</p>
          <p>In terms of the divisional margins, you see that three out of four down here are actually up. And this I think is the theme which is going to continue, particularly for the mature businesses. As those margins are likely to remain reasonably stable, the margin on the institutional ex-markets you see is down. Half of that is a bit of a one-off, but the rest does reflect that there is increasing competition in the institutional loan market. But of course, the volume growth in the institutional part of the business was far higher than what it was in the domestic businesses, and we'll talk about that on the subsequent slide when looking at the outlook.</p>
          <p>Interest margin, some of the factors that I think actually you should consider when looking at our margins. Obviously, there's been quite a bit of attention at this and we've done a reasonable amount of internal modeling. And we think that the biggest component of the difference between our margin, certainly relative to CBI and Westpac is driven by this business mix. We got about 60% of the difference in the margin simply because of our lower mix of mortgages.</p>
          <p>A few other sort of accounting issues and business mix issues. We have by virtue of our larger institutional business and our larger international franchise, a much higher level of undrawn lines. The fees for those undrawn lines are taken through net interest income, but of course, there's no asset, because they are undrawn, they're off balance sheet. And so statistically that tends to cause a slightly higher net interest margin. We take all of our line fees through net interest income, and then it goes through other income. And then finally, there is a statistical impact simply because we have higher capital and therefore slightly higher NBI. So, this is some of the factors which we look at which suggests the differences, particularly said in relation to CBI and Westpac are more modest.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the cost side of the story, I think increasingly, you've got to look at our business into two parts. I think the same thing applies on margin, and then it also here applies in terms of revenue and cost relationships. But for the mature domestic businesses, you will see more modest revenue growth &#x2013; that revenue growth by the way is the dark bars and looking to maintain positive jaws. In relation to those businesses, you can see that's what's happened. We've had positive jaws, very positive in New Zealand as New Zealand recognizes it needs to lower its costs.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, in the growth businesses, there's far more investment going on. Perhaps some parts of that income you can't reliably predict when it's going to come through. So, from time-to-time, you can get like what happened with the institutional business, where the market's income whilst it was up, was well below what was planned. And it in fact achieved planned for their markets revenue growth for the first half, they would have had neutral jaws as well on the institutional business. But the Asia-Pacific business, very good revenue growth, because the markets business in Asia did extremely well, and that's what drove the positive jaws within in the Asia-Pacific, Europe and Americas business.</p>
          <p>Turning to the provisioning charge. The charge has continued that downward trend. Although, the natural disasters have meant that it hasn't gone down perhaps as much as what it would otherwise have done. And that's a key thing which we'll now explore. If you have a look at the individual provisions, you see that they're fairly flat in Australia. They're actually down in New Zealand, but it was still up in the commercial and rural parts of the business, and well down in institutional. If you look at the institutional book, the provisions have been coming through the institutional end. I think, indeed, around 60% of those provisions have been legacy property deals and not new deals coming through.</p>
          <p>Likewise, if you look at the impaired asset trends, you see that, say for the Oswal exposure, which is something which has been managed for a number of years now, but was restructured in the last six months. The institutional new impaired assets has slowed right down, and similar levels of new impaired assets emerging now in the Australia division and the New Zealand businesses.</p>
          <p>Arrears, you'll see some of the numbers published in the document. 90 day arrears are up about 26%, half-on-half and three quarters of that's from Australian mortgages. And yet the actual IP loss rate though hasn't &#x2013; in fact went down. There is only AUD5 million of individual provisions and mortgages in the first half. So, no effect flowing into actual losses.</p>
          <p>Now the big one though that has moved around and requires further explanation is the collective provision. And as I alluded in my earlier comments, they would have been further releases for collective provisions both within New Zealand and within Australia, but we needed to reflect the impact of the natural disasters in those two countries. So, in Australia, some collective provisions that would have otherwise been released were reallocated to the flood provision and a further AUD79 million was added to the provisions.</p>
          <p>In New Zealand, we had been expecting to release collective provision as the environment has been stabilizing, but we stopped at the time of the Canterbury earthquake and reviewed our existing provisions over there and reallocated some of the collective provisions to the earthquake to provide coverage for what we expect to be the loss emerging from that event. That then means in terms of that management overlay component, that component which is above the normal models that we use, is now around about 40% that is related to the natural disasters both in terms of the floods and cyclones here in Australia and the earthquake in New Zealand.</p>
          <p>Looking down to the outlook and some of the key drivers around that, once again, when we look at the margin, I think we have to start looking at the margin in two parts. Because I think there is going to be a different dynamic in terms of volume and different dynamic in terms of margin trend.</p>
          <p>For our domestic businesses, certainly looking to the second half, we'd see the margin being at similar levels, maybe slightly up, maybe flat, but similar levels to where they were in the first half, but of course, more modest volume growth. In our growth businesses, particularly the institutional side of the business, far more volume growth, but margins will likely trend down which is reflecting the more competitive environment and corporate credit spreads coming in. So, very much two different dynamics, modest volume growth, reasonably stable margins and higher volume growth but falling margins. And so if you look at the margin in total, it's really, in many ways, concealing those two different stories that are emerging in there.</p>
          <p>In terms of the markets income, this is part of the business that we would expect to continue to have significantly faster growth relative to the rest of the group. Obviously, it's difficult to predict from half-to-half, but the underlying trend is one that we would expect to be substantially faster than the rest of the group, and there's been significant investment in that and we'll continue to be investing in that part of the business recognizing that because it's such a good leverage point into our Asian franchise.</p>
          <p>Our lending volumes just flows through into my comments about the margin. You can see very much that the mature domestic businesses in Australia and New Zealand more modest, and these are annualized growth rates in FX adjusted for lending in the first half. The institutional business, annualized growth of 16%. Those are about 8% in Australia and the rest of that being turbocharged by the Asia-Pacific business. And Asia-Pacific, excluding institutional, was still running at double-digits. So, hence the faster growth in institutional likely to have some margin compression taking place, but there is much more growth than what there would be over in the Australia and New Zealand businesses where the margin outlook is likely to be less dynamic.</p>
          <p>Currency impacts. We've spoken about those before. Once again, the full-year impact estimate based on current business mix and the current exchange rates. We also give you the impact if the Australian dollar was to strengthen universally by further 5% across the US dollars and all the related currencies and the Kiwi. And you said hedging provides a considerable offset. If you move into 2012 and compare it to 2011, at current rate and current hedging we have in place for 2012, there is a further 1% year-on-year impact from exchange rates net of hedging.</p>
          <p>Cost growth. Expect us to continue to have high levels of investment going through our businesses. Indeed in the second half, there'll also be some central cost around programs like the Hubs Program. So, you'd expect us to continue to have reasonable levels of investment, but likewise, we try to manage the business to achieve positive-to-neutral jaws. And you saw we achieved neutral jaws in the first half. So, we're certainly planning to run to neutral-to-positive jaws in the second half. But statistically, because of that high growth in costs in the second half of last year, if you're neutral first half, neutral second half, you still end up being slightly negative jaws year-on-year, because of that rapid growth in the second half of last year, but neutral half-on-half.</p>
          <p>In terms of the provision charge, you heard Mike's comments about the multi-speed economy. We mentioned that arrears had increased, including the Australian dollar having differential effects on parts of the economy. So, we think it's prudent in terms of the second half to assume a similar level of the first half against the trends because it would have been downwards today. And so that would be the view that we would hold at the moment, the second half provisions would be at a similar level as the first half. So, with those comments, I'll hand back to Mike.</p>

          <p>Many thanks, Peter. And before we open for questions, let me say a few words about technology. As I said in December 2007, technology is one of the key enablers of our super-regional strategy. And at our recent strategy update, I mentioned that we now have an agreed technology roadmap, not only to take us through 2017, but to position us for the next 20 years.</p>
          <p>Unlike our major competitors in Australia and New Zealand, we are not a domestic bank. We're building a super-regional bank. This means we face very different issues through our domestic peers. And it needs a very different technology emphasis, one that's focused on group-wide customer facing systems and systems that deliver connectivity so that we can improve the customer experience and capture greater value from cross-border flows. This is going to mean a significant change in the way priorities are set and projects are delivered.</p>
          <p>Let me make a few points about three global capabilities that we have prioritized. The first is that we're building a single super-regional customer view. This is allowing us to better service customers and to leverage our customer relationships through improved opportunity assessment and conversion. Next, we're building a truly global payments and transaction capability. This will deliver simpler, faster, easier banking for our customers, while also providing cost, stability and risk management benefits for the whole group. By building these core global capabilities, we also open a suite of new revenue opportunities that don't rely on our balance sheet, and which will therefore improve our ROE.</p>
          <p>Finally, we're establishing what my colleagues in technology called a reference architecture, which employs a mix of global and local systems. Our roadmap also allows for the demands of each business unit. For example, in institutional, the approach is global as the nature of the business and the clients is global.</p>
          <p>In New Zealand our emphasis is on the simplification from two platforms to one. And in Australia, we'll deliver know-the-customer capabilities to enable the creation of superior customer experience. In Asia, technology will support the rapid growth by creating an agile technology platform that can be expanded as we grow our franchise in each country.</p>
          <p>I want to emphasize though that this isn't a big bang approach, it's a one-bank approach. We have a very clear vision and so every investment we make is focused on delivering our business strategy; it's not just a series of projects.</p>
          <p>I hope this gives you some insight into our technology roadmap and now let me open it will up for questions. I would say that we will be doing a further briefing to the market on technology in the next few weeks.</p>

          <p>It's James Freeman from Deutsche Bank. Mark, just actually on that technology, just an indication as to the cost of that, and more sort of holistic across the bank, I'm just wondering when do we actually get to a situation where the investors get to enjoy the benefits of the stronger growth in revenue and the slower cost growth, effectively the jaws really opening up and the super-regional strategy delivering a different profit before provision number in terms of the growth aspect than what the actual peers in Australia are delivering?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, to your first question, our total spend on IT at the moment is about AUD1.7 billion, which I think is about right in terms of &#x2013; as the percentage to total overhead. It's in line with global banks, or our global peer group. I think, as I probably said to you before, the issue was that we were spending very much on a silo basis, and I think we were spending a lot of money for dubious return and getting more a holistic approach I think will make a significant improvement.</p>
          <p>The second part is really, how do we really get the value from our hubs, from that back-office and center of excellence approach that we have embarked upon. And I think we're three years into this &#x2013; we're actually probably five years into it, but three years in terms of a major investment. And I think we still got a further three years before we'll really see the benefits come through, but in three years' time, I hope to be in a position to really see the difference.</p>

          <p>Jarrod Martin from Credit Suisse. So, a question for you Mike, maybe Phil Chronican as well just on the Australian division. Just regarding what looks like an apparent slowing in balance sheet momentum on the lending side, particularly in the latter part of the first half, if you go back 12 months ago, some of the processes were fixed in mortgages, and that resulted in consistent market share gains over the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>If you look at the last set of APRA sets, I think it's first month in the last 12 that has been a material sort of drop in market share versus peers. And then if you look at business lending as well, notwithstanding &#x2013; there's been AUD10 billion runoff in acceptances, there appears to be a slowing in balance sheet momentum within Australia. I wonder if this is technical, if it's to do with managing the margin, is it competition? And just what was going on there and what you're trying to actually achieve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've been fairly consistent on what we've been trying to achieve in terms of the quality, to maintain the quality of the book. I think that has been the most important thing. We have tried to establish or we've tried to maintain a system growth during this period. And in fact, for the half, we're actually above system, about 1.2 times system. But you're right. In the last couple of months, there has been a reduction in terms of the amount of new origination.</p>
          <p>And I think that was more down to competitive issues, particularly one of our former friends. And I think that we're actually now seeing that turn again. And the latest information is that that is now picking up again. Also so again, I'd like to see us maintain a system growth in this area, but system growth is going to be lower than it was prior to crisis. And I think we have to accept that as normal. But Phil, do you want to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just want to add, I guess, a couple of points to that. One is that it wasn't intentional, but obviously the impact of the competitive moves over February has started to impact. And obviously we'll need to deal with that. There is a kind of a minor issue behind it all too, which is the credit legislation that came in January. So, we were a bit slow at getting some service levels fixed up off of the back of that, but that would be only a small part of it. In terms of the business component, most of the business lending has been in pretty good shape, but there is a significant impact from the rural sector coming through.</p>
          <p>The rural sector has been quite perverse this year, as you'll appreciate with some of the severity. But even those sectors that have done well, have done so well that they're extraordinary cashed-up. And we've seen significant growth in deposits and you'll have seen in the commercial deposit growth, that's shown through as well. So, our business banking and small business have continued to grow pretty much in line with the market or slightly better, but we have seen the rural sector have a significant and quite measurable run down on outstanding balances.</p>

          <p>Jon Mott from UBS. A question on the capital position, and now the super-regional strategy coming along, but also with a bit more clarity coming through on Basel III...</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe not necessarily, but globally it's getting a bit more clear. So, close to harmonize, because I think that's where, hopefully, everyone's moving towards, so you can compare it on an apples-to-apples basis. If you at Asia, a lot of your Asian peers are now saying 10% as the base line. Europe is pretty similar, America is doing their own thing. Where do you see or would you like to see your position, especially versus your Australian peers, where the Australian peers might be a little bit below where you are at the moment? How would you differentiate yourself from the capital position and where would you like that to go to given the super-regional strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, Jon, I've been fairly consistent in my view that it's better to hold a little bit more capital than too little over the past couple of years, two, three years, because of the uncertainty, not only in the market, but of also the regulatory uncertainty. I still don't really believe that we have regulatory certainty. And I feel that last Basel III has now imposed capital, so called capital ratios, which everybody has supposed to have agreed. The definition of risk assets seems to be different in every country. So, you would say, where's the consistency?</p>
          <p>As you say, the US don't seem to be paying very much heed to Basel III, and seem to be doing their own thing anyway, and my conversations with the US recently have been to the effect that they may impose even stricter requirements than Basel III has. Basel III has been very much driven by the Europeans, because a lot of the European banks are seriously undercapitalized in terms of relativity to this part of the world. So, I think we've got some way to go. And do I know what the right number is? No, I don't. I guess that the good thing is that, if you look at the OECD banks, and if OECD banks have to raise capital, we'd almost be the last person or the last organization that would have to raise. But I think it's still too early to call, frankly.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just along a similar line, perhaps a question for Peter on this. Peter, if I have a look at slide 78, and we take into account the fact that every comment that APRA have made is basically bugger you guys, we're going with what we do. We're going with a very conservative approach. Then you can see your APRA core equity Tier 1 Basel III is probably sitting around 7%, which is the bare minimum before you start to impose any requirement for a systematically important bank, before you put anything in for a countercyclical capital buffer, before you put in any Pillar II deductions which no one ever talks about. Peter, at this stage, what do you reckon that 7% number should be for someone like ANZ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the level &#x2013; and I refer to Mike's comments, we don't know at this point. In terms of that 7%, Brian, one, remember that was 6.7% last time. So, the number is trending upwards. And I acknowledge all your comments about the APRA looking to be conservative, and like some of their conservative treatments, but I sincerely don't believe it will be the 7%. I don't think that's the way the measure will end up. But clearly the trend in our capital ratios is up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think it will be higher than 7% there, Peter, that's the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm Sorry. What will be higher than 7%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The APRA. If we take the APRA harmonized core equity Tier 1 sitting at 7%, a lot of people quote 7% as being the acceptable level, whereas more than likely that is the absolute bare minimum. Because it doesn't put anything away for systemically important tests which is increasing, anything for the countercyclical capital buffer, anything for your own Pillar II buffer and then any buffer that you guys put over and above it. So, what I'm interested in is where do you think the 7% number will really settle in a practical sense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Brian, I think that's going to depend upon where APRA settles, and how they're going to go measure the capital components. So, I think everyone talks about the ratio, but we don't have clarity around the definition on how they're going to measure the components. And I think it's a recognition that can't do all of those factors &#x2013; you can't just apply it bluntly, the 7% level would actually result in a level of capital for the Australian banks that was far too high.</p>
          <p>If you measured it at the 7% level, you'd then have to be having to top up. But until APRA come out with some clarity around this, we don't know. And in the meantime, our basic approach is to continue just to retain capital to drift this number up, and then we'll have to respond as it becomes clearer. It hasn't been any clearer since you last asked the question, frankly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter, what is clearer is that in the most recent quarter, the number is up from 6.7% to 7%, which we don't really understand why it's up in the quarter. But also once again, we're seeing 1.5% discount on the dividend reinvestment plan. And these vague assertions of capital adequacy, why you're raising capital at a discount through the dividend reinvestment plan if you're so well capitalized?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think the discount on the DRP &#x2013; the DRP is a very convenient and a very efficient way of raising additional capital. And do you think if capital requirements are going to get less rather than more from here? Obviously the balance is that it's likely the capital levels will be higher from here than lower. So, it's appropriate to, as I said, gently drifting this number up until we have credit clarity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think Brian, I would say that certainly the feeling is that capital levels are going to be higher rather than lower. I think we're going to be realistic to that. But let's also remember there will be a transition period. This will take several years, particularly for the European banks, because if you look at where they are in comparison, it's going to take them many many years to actually raise that amount of money. So, I feel that we're doing it the right way, and it's a sort of steady-as-you-go approach, and hope that APRA aren't going to be too macho here and hold out for something, which is going to make us globally uncompetitive.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Victor German from Nomura. Just maybe firstly a point of clarification in relation to technology standards that, Mike, you alluded to earlier. Is it fair to assume that from now on all of the expenses will be above the line, and you're now going to see more sort of restructuring below the line expense items?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll never say never, but at the moment, most of the cost of IT, as I've said is already covered &#x2013; sorry where are you? I can't see you &#x2013; is very much in the actual existing run rate. So, hopefully, we won't see anything below the line. But, as I say, there may be a need to do something.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. And secondly, just on the institutional margins. In the quarterly update, I think the comment was there modestly down, and here we see that it's actually down by 9 basis points. So, have the trend increased in terms of the reduction margins in the second quarter, and what's the outlook for the next half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, if you remember in the first quarter, we showed a margin increase overall at about 3 basis points, and if including markets, a reduction of 3 basis points. And it's exactly the same for the full quarter. So, that means the second quarter has actually stabilized. But I would actually say that we're seeing quite a bit of &#x2013; we're seeing a significant amount of market pressure now in the institutional book, we are seeing a tightening in margin from our competitors.</p>
          <p>Funnily enough, we're actually seeing an improvement in margin in Asia, which I wouldn't have expected, but we're seeing a slight improvement there basically as a result of liquidity squeeze, particularly in US dollars. So, that is almost counterintuitive. You wouldn't have thought that would have happened. But there is no doubt that margins for the whole market will come under &#x2013; will continue to come under pressure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because some of the comments in the outlook, not really expect to see margins trend down gently in the institutional book, because there is lot more competition out there. And also in Asian credits, if you lean to Asian credits, that tend to be a better than average risk profile, and so it tends to be a slightly lower margin as a consequence as well. So, you've got to not just look at the margin isolation, you've always got to look at it with the volume. And then remember, at the end of day, the strategy, particularly institutional is to keep the lending to the minimum, be doing the cross-sell. So, margins are only one part of the overall story.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but volume will be increasing there. And so actual NII will be increased.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Ben Koo from Goldman Sachs. Just a question here on the institutional business, I think for Shayne. I just wanted to get a feel for the jaws in that business negative over the half, including the markets business in Australia was one area of weakness. Just wanted to get a sense of, what was the reason for the weakness in the markets business. And with the margin outlook as it is right now, are you comfortable with just the general trajectory of revenue growth versus cost growth? And with the system spend that Michael has talked about, whether that can be absorbed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the investment that we've made in institutional, I think, has been early highlighted to you, and is continuing. We have spent a fair amount of money on improving the markets &#x2013; the global markets business and certainly the platforms enrolled. We have put a significant amount of money into the cash management and trade business, and that will continue.</p>
          <p>Where the weakness has been in the Australian markets business is been on the rates side, much like your own house. Domestic rates has been tough. The problem is there hasn't been much movement. You require volatility in the rates business. And of course, the large domestic banks have the biggest book in terms of the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>So, it has been that balance sheet management which has not been as profitable as it has been the previous two years. That's where the drag has been. The good thing is that the customer flow business has actually increased, which I think is encouraging. And particularly in APEA where we've had an extremely good half, but Shayne would you like to comment more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to correct something there, actually our markets in the half were very good. So, the markets' result was actually up 12% half-on-half. If you remember, the jaws is really a timing one, which says we were investing according to a plan to grow and we'd actually planned and hoped that markets would grow even faster than that, but we continued to invest on that basis. So, the spend, expenses were up, the 8% number there. But because the Australian markets position didn't perform &#x2013; it performed well, but not as well as we had planned because of the precise reasons that Mike talked about.</p>
          <p>We ended up with these negative jaws for the half. So, I look at that as a timing issue. And we'll be continuing to invest. The investments we're making are paying off in general. We're investing in around two areas: one is building our offshore businesses, so the APEA markets businesses, the primary investment area. And secondly in product terms; it's around building out our foreign exchange business, which has always been our strategy is to &#x2013; in the sense de-risk the business, de-focus the business from the strong Australian rates dependency that we've had in the past.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd like to comment to that as well, what Shane has said is that the areas where we had invested indeed have been performing well. And with lot of investment with excellent commodities and etcetera and they have actually performed well on the sales side and it was the traditional balance sheet management, interest rate risk here in Australia that just didn't perform as well.</p>

          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. My question was on New Zealand. You produced a pretty strong half-on-half underlying result with the costs coming down. I suspect that the revenue outlook is not too high growth. So, I'm just interested in your &#x2013; you Mike, on how much more you can take out of dollar cost in New Zealand, particularly with the significant consolidation project that you have upcoming?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think there's quite a substantial opportunity there. I think that the simplification is going to lead to considerable cost saving in terms of across the board. And I also actually think it will create revenue opportunity as well. I think there's been a fair amount of confusion as to what our strategy was in New Zealand. I think the overall economy in New Zealand is still pretty quite. It was getting back. It was beginning to improve. And I think that the Christchurch earthquake really did knock it about.</p>
          <p>They've had a few issues there. But I think if you can look through that and if you look towards the stimulus that will be created by the reconstruction of Christchurch hopefully and of course the World Cup, so long as they win it, I think we can look forward to a little bit of an improved situation in New Zealand.</p>

          <p>Thanks, and good morning. Just an alternative question on regulation. Slide 8 highlights that you've done pretty significant amount of work or heavy-lifting on improving the funding composition of the bank. Just in light of the regulatory environment, are you comfortable with where you now sit? Or do you still think there's more to be down on this front?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we will continue in our efforts to reduce our reliance on wholesale deposits. I think that is just sensible. I'm sure that the regulatory costs involved of the additional liquidity requirements are going to be onerous. And you've really got to put the balance sheet in as good a position as you can, so we will continue along that path.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We didn't need &#x2013; basically we had a problem with a commercial surplus, which we would then have to place. So, it was basically just expanding our balance sheet for no reason. But that's the sort of thing which we are able to turn on and off. So, that's part of the ALCO process. I think the issue there was that there was a surprising increase in domestic deposits really as a result of the deleveraging that's going on within the local market.</p>
          <p>And therefore we were actually getting cheaper funding here, and therefore didn't need to rely on those Asian deposits. That's not to say that the domestic deposits have gone down. In fact, they have increased during the period. It's the institutional deposits that we've been managing.</p>

          <p>The last question, I'm not sure what you're saying that deposits have not grown in Asia. In US dollar terms, they are up 23% half-on-half.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On page 61, what you might be &#x2013; again you might be mixed up with the exchange rates. If you're looking at Australian dollar figures, then obviously that will be impacted by the exchange rate movement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That can't be impacted that much. The term deposits were &#x2013; this is fair, APEA were AUD47 billion in second half '10 and AUD46 billion in first half '11, saving deposits...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But the mix changes around. So, if you look at the end-of-period number, as I said, on page 61, then there is a 23% growth in the Asian deposits.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Well, I think in terms of the trend, the average deposit trend would be similar in the average balance sheet as well. So, you must just be dealing with a mix question there between deposit sites that's causing a difference in the average, which I have to look at. But the Asian deposits have grown fairly consistently across the half. So, it wasn't the case of a mad spike at year-end, may be a little bit, but like there's been consistent growth in the deposits. So, I certainly would not say that the Asian deposit story has gone. As Mike said, you will nonetheless fine tune it from time to time during the half depending on the level of differentials in cost, but it still is a strategy that is very much alive and well.</p>

          <p>It's Scott Manning from JPMorgan. Just on the markets income products split on slide 74, just between the different types of products behind that, you've got reasonably consistent levels there for the last three halves. Just trying to get a sense of &#x2013; when the market looks at net interest income versus trading income, one is kind of perceivably higher P/E versus lower P/E given the certainty of it.</p>
          <p>So, can you just talk to us around the confidence that you have that the current level of markets revenues are indeed the minimum base going forward if you like, if you're trying to push towards a greater proportion of non-interest income through the P&amp;L, just to provide some degree of certainty that is at least of recurring nature, and what you are doing to sustain that in terms of the risk profile of the book?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's been very clear that what we've tried to do is move to more customer flow-based income, and away from pure-trading income. And I think we've made steady progress there, and we'll continue along that track. And I don't know if you want to add more to that Shayne.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, so on the broader question of increasing the non-interest income, I mean, it's not just about markets. Our transaction banking business is also heavily fee-reliant. So, that 38% of our revenue in cash management is actually just fee-based, we think is upside and net of the percentage and actually, our cash management business, which is our number one priority in terms of long-term investment. So, it's got a long way to grow. So, that's a big part of it; same for trade.</p>
          <p>Within the markets piece, you'll know that the fastest growing area has been foreign exchange and commodities, particularly for the reason, because we're trying to grow the customer flow business. And again, I think what bodes well for this business if you look &#x2013; you're quite right over the last three halves, it's pretty consistent. But if you look at global markets, the industry, competitors, both here in Australia and elsewhere have been suffering pretty heavily on this business and seeing an 10%, 20% falls in revenue. So, in a way, pretty comfortable that we've been able to maintain revenue at that level. So, I think it's a pretty good baseline for growth in the future.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from the line of Craig Williams of Citigroup. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. If I refer to page 62 of the release, although pretty similar story on 55 as well, it's the APEA disclosures, your Asia-Pacific net interest margin has lowered about 1.6% because of your markets business. You only have about AUD28 billion of lending against AUD54 billion of deposits. And you were in a pretty low yield on the residual securities. So, how much opportunity and how quickly can you convert these deposits into lending as opposed to holding the balances in securities? And can you talk about the outlook for spreads on the securities component in the event of rising rates in Asia over the medium term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a couple of components to that, you rightly point out there is not much for yield on liquid assets. So, as you're holding liquid assets in the trading securities within markets you get a relatively low yield, and then more looking to the mark-to-market rather than the carrying yield. So, that's what pulls the margin down. In terms of all the regulatory constraints, yes there are some countries where you're not able to repatriate all the deposits you have, and say, do end up lending it to the Central Bank or putting in some form of liquid assets.</p>
          <p>And that's drastically down within the markets business, because the markets business manages the balance sheet for the Asian region. So, you will always have some amount of your Asian deposits, which are tied up in that way. And that's certainly on the factors why there is a difference between what you get for the margin including markets and the margin excluding markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, what proportion of your deposits, I suppose, overtime can be funded towards lending. Currently, it's probably 50/50. Would you expect that component to steadily drift up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes. I'll turn around the other way actually because, the way we've always looked at this is the Asian deposits, we'll be able grow sufficiently to fund all of our Asian growth. And that will still be our expectation. And to the extent that there is a surplus and there's an opportunity, we'll repatriate some of that back into Australia and New Zealand, which is what we've done. I think it's best to look at it that way in terms of being able to fund the growth. We can fund the growth, we can fund the growth in Asia without having to rely upon Australia, and there will be some surpluses from time-to-time as we have at the moment. There's still surplus cash being provided to Australia. But the prime way we look at it is we can fund our Asian growth without having to rely upon the rest of the group.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Chris Williams from UBS. I just want to ask a follow up on the repatriation of deposits. Presumably most of those deposits are US dollar denominated in Asia. I'm wondering the effective currency when you repatriate those deposits to Australia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that just swapped out any way so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When you wholesale fund, you've obviously got a fixed term that you can swap easily against, whereas, obviously with deposits, you don't have any fixed duration on those deposits, and the cost is materially higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you factor in that cost. There is still a swap cost which is taken. But deposits are not only in the US dollars. There is also Aussie dollar and New Zealand dollar deposits as well in this mix. And, of course, the other thing is that we have to fund a US dollar balance sheet as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, can you just give us an idea of the actual quantum that's exported or repatriated at the moment in the mix of that between currencies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll have a go at that from a couple of angles. First of all, as Mike said, all the money which is repatriated to Australia is hedged. And at times people sort of think, look how low your cost of funds are in Asia, it must be an advantage. But no, the aim is to get swaps back into Australian dollars. And so that arbitrage benefit that might appear gets taken the way. So, we look at the nature of the deposit portfolios having regard for their stickiness, and different amounts &#x2013; well, some amounts will either be lent term and some amounts will be lent very short-term, depending on the underlying stickiness and nature of those deposits.</p>
          <p>And I can't give you the split off the top of my head as to how much is more termed out, as to how much is shorter term. And then of course the swap curve will then determine what the premium that is attached to that swapping, whether it's a short-term or a long term. But at the end of the day, all the transfers are done at market rates. So, in that sense &#x2013; and the funds which we were passed down to Australia cost the same as what it would be for us to go and borrow money for 90 days or for two years, because everything is done at market rates, because of what have to do for tax transfer pricing point of view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it's a dollar deposit advantage, but it's no funding cost advantage in terms of the repatriation of deposits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To the extent that you seem to be able to raise deposits in Asia at a lower margin, i.e. to get them sub-LIBOR or not much over LIBOR relative to term deposits in Australia where portfolios have to sort of pay 100 basis points over BBSW, there is an advantage. But remember, I keep repeating, don't overplay the idea of repatriating money down from Asia. Now, there's a benefit from that but it's not as if we'll be able to print money in Asia and keep on repatriating it down to Australia. It helps, but the prime thing is on funding, what we do in Asia without any demand back on the mother ship as well.</p>

          <p>One, that number does move around. The current number is AUD15 million, but when we made it at the trading update, it was a little bit less than 12. It just moves around depending on the very dynamics that Mike was saying before around relative cost of raising money in Asia versus other sources, what's happening with your supply within Australia.

          <p>This is my question. Mike, I'm going to ask you this one, because I suspect this is just Peter getting in with the spreadsheets, which is always a dangerous thing. If I have a look on page 24, Peter tells me that the expected loss as a percentage of gross lending assets is 46 basis points.</p>
          <p>Now, Pete said to us the quality of the stuff coming out of our peer is actually higher than Australia, but in his spreadsheet, I see that he is using a much higher expected loss rate, which I assume is the mortgage mix, but when I have a look at the loan loss charge in this result of 660, what is that of GLA, Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Mike, now you were supposed to say it's just him being too conservative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Remember the Asia standalone loss rate is influenced by the credit card port folios. So, you get very high loss rate on the Indonesian and Taiwanese credit card portfolios, so that distorts the average too. Over here, when you're over here, and you've got an average in the middle, that doesn't mean anything. In terms of the expected loss numbers, remember that in a credit cycle sense, you tend to have, what I would argue seven to eight years where you're below average and two to three years where you're above average.</p>
          <p>Most of the time, you actually spend below average. And you have these big spikes that drags the average up. So, you have 46 &#x2013; and I think frankly, this is a reasonably conservative estimate of the expected loss through the cycle and you expect at this point in time actually that your actual loss rate is less than average, but is probably more around what the median is, because the average gets skewed by those spikes you have every ten years or whatever.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When we look at the same slide, we see that the risk in Australia is actually going up, and yet you are calling it that the risk is going down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the risk in Australia is a trade-off between two factors: one, the institutional portfolio risk is going down, but the increase in arrears &#x2013; these models are very sensitive to arrears. So, with arrears increasing, it affects the credit cards, expect the loss rate, expect the other loss rates, and the other retail portfolios, and it also affects the loss rate on the mortgages portfolio. So, institutional, down; retail book, up. Because it's very dynamic. This is a spot measure. So, it picks up all the effects of the high arrears in your trading book.</p>
