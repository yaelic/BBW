          <p>Good day and welcome to Kraft Foods 2011 second quarter earnings conference call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Kraft management and the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Chris Jakubik, Vice President and Investor Relations for Kraft. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning and thanks for joining us particularly since this call is earlier than you were expecting today. With me are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO and Dave Brearton, our Chief Financial Officer. Earlier today we sent out two releases, our second quarter earnings report and an announcement of our intent to create two independent companies. These releases along with today's slides are available on our website, kraftfoodscompany.com.</p>
          <p>Before we get started please note that during this call we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures and you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. Let me now turn it over to Irene.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chris and good morning. And thanks to all of you for getting up so early for our news. As you've now seen, we made two very significant announcements today. First, we reported terrific second quarter earnings. Concurrently, we announced our intention to create two independent publicly traded companies by the end of 2012 as the next step in the transformation of Kraft Foods. We'll begin today with a review of our quarterly results. Then we'll spend the balance of our time on the strategic rationale and benefits of our plans.</p>
          <p>So let's get started. In the second quarter we delivered strong top and bottom line results, continuing our positive momentum through the first half of the year. This sets the stage for strong growth in the second half and positions us well for the next phase of our transformation.</p>
          <p>You know, we talked a lot in the first quarter about the challenges facing us due to high input costs. We said we would manage them, and we have. I'm pleased to say as we exited the first half with strong results and good momentum that we're over the hump and we're quite confident about the balance of the year. There are three reasons why. First, as input costs increase, we quickly priced to offset them. Across our categories, we've announced about 85% of the pricing that we currently expect to take. More than 80% of these increases are already reflected on store shelves. In most cases, we took action earlier than others, and in certain categories we priced quite a bit more aggressively than our key competitors. The fact that we responded quickly to these higher than anticipated costs has put us in a much more favorable position in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>The second reason I'm confident about the balance of the year is that we're winning with our consumers. We've been able to post solid market shares while pricing aggressively. This is due to our ongoing investments in innovation and marketing. Revenue gains for innovation are up in each region. We're continuing to improve the quality of our advertising. And we're supporting these efforts by increasing our investments in advertising and consumer marketing support which are up strongly year-to-date.</p>
          <p>Of course, as we raise prices, we have experienced some near-term dislocation in certain categories. But overall, we're seeing solid market share performance across our four categories in each of our three geographic regions. And it's important to note that private label's market share is essentially flat in our core categories.</p>
          <p>What also gives me confidence in our business momentum is that despite the substantial increases in input costs, we're growing profit dollars through a combination of pricing and end-to-end cost management. In fact, despite the loss of the Starbucks CPG business and tough comparisons against peak margins in the second quarter last year we grew profit dollars year-on-year. Cost savings are enabling us to continue to find significant increases in A&amp;C. That in turn is fueling our virtuous growth cycle.</p>
          <p>I'd especially like to highlight the progress we're making in our global snacks categories. Many of you have asked if the Cadbury acquisition is driving the growth we thought it would. The answer is an unqualified yes. Last fall at our Investor Day we laid out a long-term growth target of mid to high single digits for global snacks. As you can see, the 6% growth we've delivered year-to-date is right in line with that target. And we've only just begun to realize revenue synergies. Let's look at the key contributors to that growth.</p>
          <p>Global Biscuits is up 7% on a constant currency basis led by strong double-digit growth in developing markets. Let's look at some numbers. Oreo, a $1.5 brand, has grown 22%. Chips Ahoy!, a brand sold primarily in developed markets, is up 18%. And Club Social, our leading cracker brand in Latin America is up 35%.</p>
          <p>Our Global Chocolate category is growing even faster than biscuits; it's up about 9%, including gains of low to mid teens in developing markets. Our billion-dollar Cadbury dairy milk brand, first introduced in 1905 and now sold in 30 countries around the world, has grown 13%. Just for perspective, that's the best growth in many years. Lacta, a $700 million brand in Latin America, is up 18%. And Cadbury Flake, a leading brand in many hot-weather markets is up 13%.</p>
          <p>Even Gum and Candy, which has experienced significant challenges, has grown 2% year-to-date, including a high single-digit gain in developing markets. As we said before, the key challenge for Gum and Candy is in developed markets. Revenues are down double digits in North America and are flat in Europe. While we're certainly not satisfied with our Gum results we expected a slow first half due to two factors: First, sluggishness in the consumption channel as a result of the challenging macro economy; specifically, the decline of pocket money among teens, our biggest consumer segment. And second, our new products this year were simply not as robust as we had hoped or as strong as last year's innovations. We understand the issues and we're in the process of fixing them with additional innovations and smaller packs sizes to hit lower price points. We expect to see better results as the year progresses. That said, Gum and Candy remains an attractive category with excellent long-term growth prospects consistent with our global snacking goals. Let me now turn it over to Dave who will provide more detail on our second quarter results.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Irene. In a nutshell, we have seen terrific results on both the top and bottom lines through the first half of the year. We're seeing payoff from our focused investments behind our power brands, big bets on innovation, and improved marketing. As a result, we've built good volume mix, share, and revenue momentum in the face of aggressive price increases.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter organic revenues grew more than 7%, including power brand growth of about 9%. Of course the second quarter benefited from Easter, but looking at the first half, which normalizes for the Easter shift, organic revenue was still up nearly 6% with very solid contribution from vol/mix of 1.3 points. This was despite substantial pricing of 4.6 points.</p>
          <p>What can we expect going forward? For the full year, we now believe input costs will be up in the low teens versus last year. That's up from the high single-digit increase that we forecast on our call three months ago. As a result, we do anticipate additional pricing actions to offset these higher costs. But, as Irene mentioned, we have already announced or implemented about 85% of the pricing actions we expect to take for the year so we're confident in our outlook.</p>
          <p>Turning to profits, we continue to gain momentum. Pricing and productivity gains essentially offset higher raw material costs on a dollar basis. At the same time, continued improvements in overheads and other cost-savings funded a strong increase in A&amp;C. To put it another way, we protected operating profit dollars in the quarter even though our OI margin declined compared to peak levels a year ago. But this was essentially due to the impact of pricing on the denominator of the margin calculation.</p>
          <p>Despite this, our underlying operating income margin improved sequentially from the first quarter and for the second half we expect to see increases in year-over-year margins.</p>
          <p>Turning to EPS, as we outlined in our last earnings call, we expect second quarter operating EPS to be down versus a mate of $0.60 last year. We knew we were up against difficult comparisons with peak margins in Q2 2010 as well as the reversal of mark-to-market gains from Q1 this year. But clearly we did better than our initial expectations. Mark-to-market gains did reverse and at $0.05 they were a bit more than we expected. As for the upside, part was due from favorable currency and some was due to a lower than anticipated tax rate. The rest came from operating gains. On a year-to-date basis we're encouraged that we delivered $0.06 of operating gains year-over-year despite the fact that we were up against some very difficult margin comparisons to the prior year.</p>
          <p>All of our geographies contributed to the strong performance in the quarter. In North America, despite a very difficult operating environment, our virtuous cycle continues to build momentum. Organic revenues were up 4% in the quarter and 3.1% for the first half. As expected, pricing was the key driver. As we said, we priced to offset higher costs earlier than most of our competitors. As a result, vol/mix declined as we saw some near term dislocation in certain categories.</p>
          <p>Despite the significant pricing however, we were pleased overall with the limited volume elasticity. It was consistent with our expectations and further evidence of the improved strength of our brand equities. While our power brands grew at about the same rate as our broader portfolio, several of our innovations made significant contributions. Our new meal liquid beverage mixes continued to generate revenues well ahead of plan. Oscar Mayer Carving Board cold cuts, Newton Fruit Thins cookies and Philadelphia Cooking Cr&#xE8;me also performed well. As a result, through the first half of the year our market shares in North America remained solid. More than half the business is holding or gaining share on a dollar basis. And we're even more encouraged by the fact that to date we've announced roughly 85% of the pricing we believe we need to take this year. Almost all of that pricing is already reflected on store shelves.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at profitability. North America did a good job of pricing to offset higher raw material costs on a dollar basis. The region also continued to benefit from lower overheads. Nevertheless, operating income margins declined from peak levels a year ago due to changes in the U.S. premium coffee business and the denominator effect of higher pricing on the margin calculation. Looking ahead, we expect year-on-year margin improvements in the second half.</p>
          <p>On the other side of the Atlantic, our European team recorded a sixth consecutive quarter of top and bottom line growth. Organic revenues grew 6.4% in the quarter while in the first half they rose 5.4%. As expected, pricing drove the majority of this growth as we successfully implemented actions across all categories. As we look ahead, price increases for the third quarter have been announced in coffee. With that, we've now announced all the pricing we expect to take in Europe this year and about 80% of our pricing is now reflected at retail.</p>
          <p>Power brands rose 8% including 17% of Oreo fueled by launches in Germany and Austria leveraging our global playbook. Tassimo grew 19%, while Kenco coffee increased 24%. In addition Philadelphia continued to grow strongly, up 18%. And while retail sales are slowing across the region we're continuing to drive growth for our brands and for our categories. On a pan-European basis year-to-date we're increasing share in biscuits and cheese and shares are holding up well in chocolate, gum and coffee.</p>
          <p>There's also good news at the profit line. Despite a difficult environment, Europe delivered another strong quarter. On a dollar basis pricing and productivity offset the significant increase in raw material costs. While the denominator effects of pricing were a significant headwind to margin performance on a percentage basis, our continued focus on lowering overheads enabled us to post a modest increase in OI margin.</p>
          <p>Turning to developing markets, we generated double-digit growth and a good balance of vol/mix and pricing. Organic revenues grew 13.5% in the quarter and in the first half revenues were up 11.6%. Power brands rose 20% in the quarter led by 62% growth of Oreo. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (15:57) and Club Social crackers grew more than 40%, Lacta chocolate was up 23% and Halls rose 16%. Within this segment, Asia Pacific and Latin America continued to grow double digits, and CEEMA was up nearly 10% as economic conditions begin to recover in many parts of the region.</p>
          <p>Operating income margin in the quarter rose to 14.2% driven by overhead leverage and vol/mix gains. OI margins increased even as we continue to invest in our brands including a strong double-digit increase in A&amp;C.</p>
          <p>So what does this mean for the full year? Based on our solid results through the first half and our outlook for the balance of the year, we're raising our full-year 2011 guidance. On the top line, we've increased our organic net revenue guidance to at least 5% from at least 4% previously. This is mainly due to the impact of additional pricing. On the bottom line, we're raising our operating EPS guidance to at least $2.25 from at least $2.20 previously. Our guidance reflects cautious optimism for the balance of the year. Through the first half we've delivered strong operating gains and currency has been favorable. As a result, we're dropping the year-to-date currency benefit to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>We remain cautious with a number of uncertainties in the environment but our end-to-end cost management initiatives and strong revenue growth give us confidence that we will continue to deliver high-quality, sustainable growth for the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>As our performance over the past several quarters has demonstrated our virtuous cycle is working well around the world. A keen focus on power brands, categories, and markets is driving top-tier growth in each region. We're successfully managing unprecedented input costs through renewed pricing power and improving productivity. And our end-to-end cost management has generated the savings necessary to expand profits and reinvest in further brand-building and innovation.</p>
          <p>As a result, Kraft Foods is now positioned to deliver reliable top-tier growth on both the top and bottom lines. Now I'll turn the call back over to Irene.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave. As you can see, our year-to-date results are strong. Our operating momentum continues to improve and we're confident in our outlook for the balance of the year. Clearly, our strategy is working. And it would be easy to leave it at that. But we believe there's a significant next step that we can now take that will put our business on an even higher trajectory.</p>
          <p>Over the past four years we've reinvigorated our iconic brands around the world and we've successfully transformed our portfolio. We've built a global snack powerhouse and we've strengthened our presence in fast-growing developing markets through several strategic acquisitions, including Lu Biscuits and Cadbury. In addition, we divested certain slower growth, lower margin businesses. The combination of these actions has fundamentally changed the face and the footprint of our company.</p>
          <p>As we look to take our performance to the next level, we recognize that there are very different opportunities to enhance shareholder value between our global snacks business and the balance of the portfolio in North America. Outside of North America there's no question that our strong snacking portfolio is well positioned to grow. We see tremendous opportunities ahead as we continue to leverage our global product platforms, our scale in developing markets, and our route to market capabilities. We also have ample opportunity to grow in white space markets and in instant consumption channels.</p>
          <p>With the addition of the Cadbury business, the North American snacks portfolio now has the opportunity to pursue many of the same growth drivers and to become a truly ubiquitous snacking powerhouse. Specifically, it will leverage our global innovation platforms in biscuits, chocolate, gum and candy, and will also deliver significant growth from investments in direct-store delivery and in instant consumption channels.</p>
          <p>Now that we've rejuvenated the grocery brands within our North American portfolio it can fulfill its promise of becoming a lean, mean center of the store machine. It will leverage its category-leading market positions and continue to deploy its capabilities in innovation and marketing while focusing on warehouse sales and distribution efficiency. But it will require very different investments and resource allocation. Simply put, we've now reached a stage in our development where the global snacks and grocery businesses in North America would each benefit from standing on their own and focusing on their unique drivers of success.</p>
          <p>Today's announcement to create two independent companies will enable us to do just that. So how will it work? The Global Snacks business will consist of the current Kraft Foods Europe and Kraft Foods developing markets units as well as the North American snacks and confectionary brands. As an independent company it will have estimated revenues of approximately $32 billion and a strong growth profile in the top tier of its global peer group. Approximately three quarters of revenues will be from snacks and more than 40% will come from a diversified footprint in highly attractive developing markets. The business will also have a strong presence in fast-growing and high-margin instant consumption channels.</p>
          <p>The non-snacks portion of the portfolio will consistent primarily of powdered beverages and coffee which have strong growth and margin profiles in developing markets and Europe. Key brands will include Oreo and Lu biscuits, Cadbury and Milka chocolates, Trident gum, Jacobs coffee and Tang powdered beverages. Strategically, Global Snacks will focus on industry-leading growth by extending its global product platforms, leveraging the significant scale in developing markets, expanding in instant consumption channels and aggressively entering white space markets.</p>
          <p>Global Snacks will leverage its cost structure through volume growth and improved product mix with disciplined investments in sales, distribution and manufacturing.</p>
          <p>So what about the North America Grocery business? It will consist of the current U.S. beverages, cheese, convenient meals and grocery segments plus the non-snack categories in Canada and food service. With approximately $16 billion in revenue, this business will continue to be one of the largest and most admired food companies in North America. Its portfolio will include many of the most popular brands on the continent with the number one branded position in 12 of its top 15 categories. Just look at these key brands: Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, Oscar Mayer meats, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Maxwell House coffee, Capri Sun beverages, Jell-O desserts, and Miracle Whip salad dressing. And as an independent company the North America grocery business will continue to leverage great marketing, innovation, and leading market shares to deliver reliable revenue growth in line with its categories.</p>
          <p>This company will concentrate on capital efficiency by focusing on three things: low costs, enhancing margins, and delivering reliable cash flow. It will use a variety of tools including optimizing trade spending, Lean Six Sigma manufacturing and negative overhead growth. Its primary use of free cash flow will be to provide a highly competitive dividend payout.</p>
          <p>When managed in line with these objectives we believe each of these portfolios will provide unique investment opportunities and attractive returns. Creating two independent companies offers a number of benefits. Each business would focus on its distinct strategic priorities with financial targets that best fit its own markets and unique opportunities. Each would be able to allocate resources and deploy capital in a manner consistent with its strategic priorities in order to optimize total returns to shareholders. And investors would be able to value the two companies based on their respective operational and financial characteristics such as growth and yield and thus to invest accordingly.</p>
          <p>We've successfully built two strong portfolios. As a result, we're now in a position to seize the opportunity to create two great companies. Each will have the leadership, resources and mandate to realize its full potential. I believe this is the best way to stage our businesses for long-term success, the best way for shareholders to value each business, and the best way to ensure a bright future for our people around the world.</p>
          <p>So to summarize today's news, we reported terrific results for the second quarter, continuing our strong business momentum. We're raising our outlook for the year and remain confident that we will deliver top-tier performance for the full year. Our virtuous cycle is working well in every region around the globe. So we're in a strong position to take the next logical step in our evolution, the creation of two highly attractive independent public companies designed to increase shareholder value.</p>
          <p>I'm sure you have many questions, and as you can understand we won't have all the answers today. But, of course, we'll provide further updates as appropriate in the coming months.</p>
          <p>Operator, let's now open it up for questions.</p>
        </plist>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Andrew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess my first question would be, it's always interesting to get a sense of why now. You're still obviously in the somewhat the integration phase, obviously, of getting Cadbury to be where you want it to be, you've got a lot of the cost synergies flowing through. Was it more a matter of you think there's a way to just accelerate sort of whether it be, the growth on the growth of your side of the assets and get more aggressively after the cost side for margin gains on &#x2013; on the more cash generative North American grocery business or was there something you saw developing in the core business that made now the right time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, Andrew when you think about why now, this is going to take us about 12 months to implement so as we think about the Cadbury integration, it's well underway, our international businesses are relatively untouched by this announcement and so they will continue to focus on delivering their results and completing the integration.</p>
          <p>And as we made &#x2013; once we made this decision, every decision that we make going forward has some implications for the future state and so it just made the most sense to just make it public and to begin to implement some of those actions as we move forward here. So it will take some time actually separate the two businesses but, in the meantime, we can have our international businesses focused on completing the Cadbury integration. The bulk of the separation activity, of course, impacts our North American business and we can begin to make the decisions that are consistent with their future role and the future metrics that will be used to evaluate that business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, to help investors start to get a better sense of how to evaluate these two sort of companies on their own, I realize a lot more information is still yet to come but perhaps you can lay out even in an initial way the growth profile you see for each of these businesses both top line and bottom line just to get a sense of the type of targets you think about when you look at these individual assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's premature to talk about specific targets Andrew. Obviously, we see them having different growth profiles. We're not in a position today to begin to issue guidance for 2012. But our long growth rates and expectations have not changed. What we do expect is that as a consequence of the very different mandates and portfolios of these two businesses that we would see some different profile &#x2013; we would see some different profiles.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>OK. I'm going to leave it there and thanks again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Bryan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just two questions. One is, I guess, and it's a follow-up to Andrew's line of questioning in terms of why now. Just how much of, the changes in the industry &#x2013; there's been a profound set of changes affecting the food industry especially in North America over the last few years so how much is the change and the pressures on the industry and maybe affected the long-term outlook for Kraft and just your outlook for the industry and did that at all influence your decision to do the split now? And then second, the announcement this morning that Tim McLevish has decided to stay or you've asked him to stay and just what his role is going to be in the transition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So let me talk first about the long-term outlook. As I just mentioned, we see no change in the long-term outlook, our growth targets of 5% plus organic growth, 9% to 11% EPS; we feel confident of that given the updated guidance today we feel quite comfortable that we'll meet or exceed those targets in 2011. But the reality is that as we look at the economic developments around the world we would expect that there is likely to be some rebalancing in the profiles of the different regions. But as a consequence of being more targeted and more focused in defining the mandates of these two different businesses we would expect better bottom line performance so net-net the long-term growth targets in aggregate will not change. We would expect to see underneath that some rebalancing but, as I said to Andrew we're not in a position today to begin to give guidance for 2012 and beyond.</p>
          <p>In answer to the question about Tim, I'm quite thrilled that Tim has agreed to postpone his departure from Kraft. He will actually lead the steering team that will oversee the creation of these two world-class companies and we're delighted to have somebody with his background, his knowledge of Kraft and of the financial markets to really bring some objective and transformational thinking to the creation of these two companies. Tim will be in the role until both companies are launched.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I wanted to ask in relation to your full-year EPS guidance, you have pushed back the launch of Gevalia a little bit and I think that was at least incorporated in your thinking about the drag from the total Starbucks effect on your business. I just wanted to get a sense of where that stands today. And then also from just reading the press release it looks like you have FX built in from the first half of the year but I do forecast some strong FX contribution second half of the year. Is that embedded in your guidance as well? I guess what I am trying to understand Irene, is I know you want to continue to reinvest back in the business as well, so how are you &#x2013; are you increasing investments if you will along with the strong underlying earnings growth performance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will continue to reinvest as appropriate. We have set very aggressive targets for our A&amp;C and as you've seen year-to-date we're up quite strongly and we will be for the balance of the year so you will see us continue to invest in our franchises around the world.</p>
          <p>We feel terrific about the momentum behind our Gevalia launch, in fact it's been stronger than we've expected, and so we've chosen &#x2013; to avoid disappointing our consumers we chose to delay that launch until January 2012. But we are still quite excited about that opportunity and we believe it will be a very strong brand for us to &#x2013; as a complement within our North American coffee portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Was that an meaningful component of the 5 to 7% adjustment that you had called out for the total coffee business this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, it was not. We were expecting to invest behind it. So it was the &#x2013; it was the &#x2013; the dilution was primarily coming from the absence of the premium coffee of Starbucks in that equation, not from the &#x2013; so much from the launch of Gevalia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my final question is just in relation to what looks to be another round of pricing, I guess you have one in Europe and you were kind of done for the year, a little bit more in North America. Just question for you, you've alluded to it at least in part in your comments about the elasticity; I guess I'm just I'm trying to understand if you see another further pickup in elasticity if you will if in this next round of pricing given the sequential price increase we've seen this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Chris, this is Dave. About 80% of the pricing has actually hit the shelves, so not all of it's on there. Not all of it's been there for a while so there could still be a consumer reaction against the elasticity, and that's why we said at one point that we remain a bit cautious on the vol/mix. But we're pretty confident that we've got really good levers, whether that's in the end-to-end cost managements in our overhead program to manage through that and deliver the EPS on the year. I think the key metric that we're going to keep tracking is market shares. The elasticity has been in line with our expectation but importantly our market shares are holding up well and that's the key metric we're looking at on the top line. We'll obviously have to keep on top of it but it's pretty much so far so good, I would say.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask about how you are phasing the revenue synergies, I think last quarter you talked about how Oreo and Tang had been launched into India, you'd more than doubled the number of outlets for the Kraft-based products in Mexico and Brazil. Could you give us a little more color about how you're thinking about how this all rolls out, which brands, which countries, and how it's going to be phased over the next few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are still confident in the approximately $1 billion of revenue synergies estimate that we had laid out. If you recall we had built in about 50 basis points of growth in our 2011 guidance due to revenue synergies and as I mentioned in my earlier remarks most of that hasn't played through in our numbers which is why we feel particularly encouraged about our results to date. But we should see another 50 to 100 basis points as we look into next year and beyond as we begin to capitalize either on putting legacy products through the route to market or entering whitespace markets, it's about &#x2013; it's a combination of those two actions.</p>

          <p>Great. And just a quick follow-up. The cost inflation this quarter, I think last quarter it was around 7 to 8%, and that was your guidance for the year. Has it jumped up a little bit this quarter or how is that playing out?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's &#x2013; we said high single digits last quarter. We're saying low teens this quarter and the difference really is coffee and dairy prices so, yes, they've gone up in the last three months. We're putting pricing in place so we're feeling pretty good about it but the total impact on our input costs has gone up since the last time we talked.</p>

          <p>It's my understanding from another spin transaction &#x2013; <mark type="ph" /> Rowe Corp's (37:59) doing a spin itself &#x2013; that each part of the new co of the new Kraft, would be acquirable in stock even before the spin was consummated and then post-spin, again in your timetable presumably in 2013 the parts would be acquirable for cash as well.

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Irene, I just wanted to ask, first question was, was this the plan all along once you were able to acquire Cadbury was this kind of in the back of your mind from that day?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've been evaluating this for quite some time, David; obviously a transaction of this magnitude cannot be pulled off overnight. So as we acquired LU, as we acquired Cadbury and we began to put the businesses together and we continued to look at our strategic plans for this combined company it was clear that we had very different businesses in the portfolio and we believe that there could be great value created by unlocking those two businesses and allowing them to be free to pursue their own unique strategic priorities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you comment on wall-to-wall &#x2013; so &#x2013; and what I want to get at here is, I was always under the impression that the theory on wall-to-wall that Kraft in this combined form had a tremendous ability to create a sales force that had no peer in the United States with this wall-to-wall theory. When you disaggregate the entities, number one it sounds like wall-to-wall would have to be dismantled. And then number two, does it really say something about the effectiveness of wall-to-wall?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the reality is &#x2013; one of the benefits of wall-to-wall was the opportunity to leverage scale across the portfolio and there's no question that played out quite well for us. And as you remember, it was generating some revenue growth in excess of one point versus the control stores. But it did come with some complexity. And as we continued to revisit our sales structure, looking at the balance of effectiveness as well as efficiency, we came to believe that grocery &#x2013; there is still enormous benefit across the grocery portfolio to leverage the various parts of the portfolio in events like meal solutions or Huddle for Hunger, those kinds of programs but the focus of our grocery business needs to be on a low-cost warehouse selling system for center of the store products. It's very much focused on shelf management as distinct from a DSD system which is highly focused on front of the store, impulse merchandising and immediate consumption channels and so the differences of those two businesses we believe allows us to create two very effective selling capabilities that will optimize the performance of both parts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could sneak in one last question on the revenue synergies, you were commenting on revenue synergies for biscuits going into other countries. I also thought that after the Cadbury deal was done there was some idea that maybe powdered beverages could also be layered upon those international operations. Does the revenue synergy thesis fundamentally change with the disaggregation of the company and is now the revenue synergy some lower number &#x2013; well now you probably don't have the number but I would suspect it's lower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not at all. In fact, one of the reasons why we believe strongly that Tang is an important part of the global snacking business is because of its opportunity and its strong presence, its growth potential as well as its profit contribution in our developing markets so it remains a very important part of the equation. As you are aware we have launched Tang in India on top of the chocolate distribution system and you will see us continue to make those moves as we leverage our strong route to market capabilities around the world but particularly in developing markets.</p>

      </speaker>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Eric.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess maybe going back to the first question. I'm not exactly clear, Irene, why this is occurring. I mean, if the pieces aren't going to grow at a faster rate because they are more focused or because, I don't know, the tax rate efficiencies are greater with the global confection business, I mean, why do it? I mean, I've been questioning your &#x2013; the growth rates for a long time, when &#x2013; after you took over from Roger, you raised the growth targets, then we made the big Cadbury acquisition. So I guess I'm not exactly clear as to why we should view this positively unless you think it's going to increase the growth targets or increase the amount of cash that can be brought back to investors. And then I'll have a follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think for starters, Eric, we do expect that there will be the opportunity for grocery co to return more cash to investors and for snack co to better capitalize on its growth by having a much more focused to managing those businesses.</p>
          <p>The rationale for separating these two businesses really comes from two places. Primarily it's about operational benefits. Strategically as we think about the very significant difference in the strategic priority, the focus of the grocery business on low cost efficiency particularly within a warehouse distribution system versus the profile of the global snack business which is about high-growth and essentially the leverage that comes from volume and mix growth. If you think about resource allocation, rather than having these two entities competing for an incremental dollar of investment, we now have the opportunity to be able to use a dollar within each of those companies to better achieve their objectives.</p>
          <p>I think from our customers' standpoint they have very different go-to-market strategies as I described a few minutes ago. The difference between a much more stable off-the-shelf, shelf management type of approach to our grocery businesses as distinct from hot zones, end-aisle merchandising, impulse purchasing of our snacking businesses, I think for investors, I think better understanding the growth drivers and the priorities for the use of cash. I think we have never been able to get credit for the tremendous snacking portfolio that we have within the company. I think the opportunity, as we separate these two businesses, for that to be much more visible and for investors to see the incredible profile that our global snack business has in aggregate and certainly relative to peers I think will serve us well.</p>
          <p>So ultimately I believe the separation from an operational standpoint allows us to perform better. And then, of course there are clearly some financial benefits that we believe will come just as a consequence of the better clarity in the investment thesis between the two entities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>OK. Thanks for that. And then as a follow-up, you have $27 billion of net debt today; that really hasn't changed much. I think you've been kind of a bit below your targets although I suppose working capital because of all the inflation is a &#x2013; is something that's affecting everybody. But how will the debt be allocated between the two entities because obviously given how much leverage there is that could have a pretty big impact of the equity value of either piece.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's &#x2013; you're about right on the data and it has not come down from prior years and that's basically because we always have a back half loaded cash flow. Our cash flow this year is actually pretty much in line with where it was last year if you adjust for the pension contribution we did in the first quarter. So we'll see that debt come down in line with our deleveraging commitments in the back half.</p>
          <p>As it relates to the two companies, it's too early to speculate on exactly how much debt goes into each business but I can confirm that both businesses will be investment grade and both businesses will have access to CP markets so we're going to make sure that the debt is balanced to the cash capability each of those companies brings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Irene, could I just sneak in one more. Does this mean that the Kraft brand is going to be split in terms of like cheese or &#x2013; and Tassimo, is that being contemplated or would &#x2013; is there some possibility that the North American grocery business would own like cheese in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, for the most part the Kraft brand will go with the North American grocery business but there will be a couple of trademarks like Tassimo, like Philadelphia, for example, that will be shared and obviously we'll work out the details of that as we move forward but for the most part we detailed the brands within each portfolio, it's a pretty clean separation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>OK. And then just &#x2013; sorry, last thing &#x2013; just the timeline as &#x2013; are we going to get -- how do you see these updates in terms of when we'll know about the allocation of debt, when we'll hear from the IRS as to whether this is a tax-free spin approved transaction, can you just kind of give us a better timeline as to how we should think about this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think you'll see more sort of I'd say &#x2013; we'll continue to update you as we go through the end of this year but I think the IRS ruling probably won't be in until sometime early next year. I think we'll probably close out of the books on the current structure, and we'll probably give guidance on the current structure next year but we'll start to give you much better visibility into what these two companies will look like as we go through the year next year.</p>
          <p>As we get more clarity, whether it's on the financial splits or the capital structures, et cetera, we will clearly share that with you, I know there will be a lot of interest in that but I think you should be anything in those broad timeframes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Irene, just one follow-up. You just mentioned on Eric's question that you didn't think you were getting credit as far as &#x2013; for some of the growth and, I guess, one of the aspects of the market right now seems to be that some of the faster growing assets are trading sort of multiple-wise right on top of some of the slower growing assets. So if you could maybe give me some sense what you or your advisors think the comparable group for the snack company, the presumably faster growth business that includes Cadbury, would be as contrasted with what the comparable group for the grocery company would be. Because by my math, they're all within about 1 1/2 or two turns of EV EBITDA and that really doesn't get you too far as far as realizing value. So any help you could give me around that I'd appreciate it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the facts. It is a fact that the group trades in a fairly narrow range so your observation is correct. But I do think that the facts are if you look at the specific companies, what you do see is that the global higher growth companies are trading in the upper teens and many of the North American peers tend to be trading in the lower teens and so you do see a differentiation. But as we said, that is not the major motivation here. The big idea for us is to recognize that these are two very different portfolios that we believe can benefit with a focused mandate and that will then drive resource allocation, capital allocation and ultimately the metrics by which we would encourage investors to evaluate these two companies.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Jeffries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I &#x2013; not to beat a dead horse but Irene you said, obviously pretty much understand the business rationale here and I think it makes sense; that's my two cents. But it seems to me when you go to the board and you do something like this you also have to say hey, what's in it for shareholders maybe even immediately, that the valuations aren't where you are. So when you go to the board and get approval which I don't think you have yet, are you going to give them any sense on what you think the assets are discounted because there may be some valuation gaps that you think exist in the business or is that not part of this process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me say first of all, of course, we do have board approval or we would not have announced this today. We have had a very significant review of this strategy over the course of many years with our board. And the factors by which the board made the decision are pretty much the factors that we're sharing with you today. The reality that as we have taken a number of steps over the last couple of years to restore the health of our brands around the world, to transform the portfolio in our developing markets and immediate consumption channels we are now ready to take this next step and it's on that basis that we made the decision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, sorry go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was going to say we clearly had board approval for our announcement for the intent to create the two companies. We will need to have straight approval once we get the IRS ruling and we've worked out all the details again. So it's kind of a &#x2013; think of the approval as two steps.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that we certainly believe that the results we have delivered to date and the significant opportunities that we believe can be created by separating these two businesses should create &#x2013; should merit a premium multiple from where we stand today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what it seems to me as I do the quick math; I mean it seems like you separate these guys apart that there was an inherent discount involved in the current valuation. But it seems like maybe that wasn't a massive or a big part of your thought process and I was actually I guess I was a little surprised by that. I mean, I completely understand the business aspect but there also seems to be a financial aspect that's pretty compelling as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We agree.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the second thing is, and thanks for the clarification on the board stuff. I guess I must have misread it a little bit but I think I get it now. The second thing would be I know last quarter you gave us, I think it was last quarter maybe it was the quarter before initial things that were going on in India and how Oreo I think was doing there. I was wondering if you could give us a detailed update on something like that and I'd love to have a follow-up on India and how some of these revenue synergies in particular are working and where we are maybe on the revenue synergies that you promised kind of where we are there, that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, our Indian business continues to be on fire, in fact, it was up 46% in the quarter so we feel terrific about that and actually the key driver underneath that is Cadbury Dairy Milk which grew over 60% I think in the first half. So we feel terrific about the progress within India. It's a critical growth market. It was one of the most &#x2013; is one of the important aspects of the revenue synergies as we described when we made the Cadbury acquisition.</p>
          <p>But we feel terrific about the overall performance of all of our developing markets. As I talked about each of our global categories, within each of those we feel very good about the aggregate performance but within each of those categories the performance within developing markets is just standout and most of it is really about investment in our core franchises and that's really what's driving the growth and gives us great confidence that going forward we will continue to see benefit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I just wanted one clarification to the last question I asked. Did the &#x2013; when you went to the board to get the approval, which you got, did you have to give them financial thoughts, too, as well, what the discount was, was that part of the process, just so I'm clear on that, I didn't really --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think you can understand it was a very thorough review predicated on what &#x2013; how we believe these two businesses could operate differently under this separation scenario. And as we said, we believe that we can create great value for our shareholders as a consequence of having a much more focused mandate and the ability to allocate our resources and our capital much more effectively.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You want to give us the discount you thought the assets were trading at?</p>
          <p>[LAUGHTER]</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you can actually look at the market multiples and might be able to estimate that yourself.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're going to do that. I just thought I'd give it a shot. Okay. Thank you, and congratulations on what I think is a good decision.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Ed Aaron of RBC Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Ed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see you're laid out certainly a lot of benefits from the spinoff but something you can maybe address any dissynergies that you might end up seeing in terms of purchasing and corporate overhead and so forth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we've obviously been through that and looked at it. We don't see huge dissynergies, both of these companies are enormous, $32 billion and $16 billion each and they've still got a fair bit of procurement scale, they didn't share a lot of back room and that's why we were able to make this decision. There wasn't a huge amount of back room sharing beyond sort of finance systems type things. But they had a different route to market which is the biggest piece of the cost.</p>
          <p>So yes, there will be dissynergies;  we also think there will be operational benefits coming out of separating these two and having them focus on their specific routes to market and their specific business fundamentals. We think those benefits will actually offset the dissynergies. On balance we're looking at this as a net positive. But yes, there clearly will be some dissynergies in some areas of the P&amp;L.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would it be fair to kind of allocate the depreciation and corporate overhead roughly proportionately to the size of these two businesses from a revenue perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a bit early to get into it, but I would say Snacks is growing at a higher pace, so you can assume it will have a higher capital requirement in terms of CapEx expenditures, and grocery at a lower pace so it will have lower capital expenditures but we can't really get into details at this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just one more follow-up on the North America snacks businesses, they've kind of been a relative laggard in your portfolio recently and I guess there's a bit of an issue around gum there but can you just maybe address that at a high-level and talk about how much the recent performance of that business might be kind of factoring into some structural changes that you see where you might pickup some new benefits with this new structure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the U.S. snacks business this quarter was actually mostly a gum story. I think Biscuits had a terrific quarter, was up about 3%, its top five brands were up about 6%, we sort of got A&amp;C investment back on track and we've got some good innovation. So biscuits did well, nuts was up 6% with the nutrition platform, candy up about 9% so the U.S. snacks business this quarter is really a gum story and as Irene mentioned earlier gum in the U.S. is down about double digits. We have some plans in place to get that back on track and we expect a significant rebound in the back half; but that's really about the story of this quarter.</p>
          <p>Ongoing, clearly, the idea that we can focus the U.S. snacks business on a DFD route to market the impulse channel, the hot zone and leave the grocery business to be the center of the store machine that is something that we would expect to have operational benefits going forward but that's not in and of itself a reason to drive this big a transaction. That is one of the benefits we would expect, though.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Operator, we can take maybe one more question.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your final question comes from Diane Geissler of CLSA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Diane.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you just talk about &#x2013; it's a very long period of time between the announcement and when you expect to complete the transactions; what you'll be doing in the interim to sort of maintain talent, keep people at the organization who you want to keep at the organization who might be feeling like they're being spun off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I start with the fact that we think this is an exciting opportunity for employees around the world and a lot of what we're going to be doing in the coming weeks is helping our employees to understand the opportunity that is available to them as a consequence of creating these two great companies.</p>
          <p>But we have a lot of work to do in the coming months but our most important focus is to ensure that we will remain one company until we spin and so it is critically important that we keep our employees focused on delivering our results in 2011 and then into 2012. But obviously ensuring that they understand the rationale and they see the opportunities that are available to them as a consequence of this separation will be a key part of our communication strategy to them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What should we be thinking about in terms of you communicating who will be running the new company, the spun company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously we have a number of decisions to make in the coming months, but we've got an incredibly talented management team around the world and they've &#x2013; they're the ones who got us to where we are today. And so we have a very rich bench from which to populate these two companies and we will keep you posted as we move forward here.</p>
