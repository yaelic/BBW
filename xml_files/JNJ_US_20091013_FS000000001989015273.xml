      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and welcome. I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson &amp; Johnson, and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the third quarter of 2009. Joining me on the podium today are Alex Gorsky, Worldwide Chairman of our Medical Devices &amp; Diagnostics Group; and Dominic Caruso, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>A few logistics before we get into the details, the audio and visuals from this presentation are being made available to a broader audience via a webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson &amp; Johnson website.</p>
          <p>I will begin by briefly reviewing highlights of the third quarter for the corporation and highlights for our three business segments. Following my remarks, Dominic will provide additional commentary on the third quarter financial results and guidance for the full year of 2009. Alex will then provide an update on our Medical Devices &amp; Diagnostics business, and we will open up the floor to your questions. We will conclude our formal presentation at approximately 9:30; and following Q&amp;A with some final remarks by Dominic, we will conclude the meeting around 10:00 AM.</p>
          <p>Distributed with the copy of the press release that you just received is a schedule with actual revenues for major products and/or business franchises. For the listening audience, these are available on the Johnson &amp; Johnson website as is a copy of the press release.</p>
          <p>Before I get into the results, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this presentation may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2008 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made this morning. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement as a result of new information or future events or developments. The 10-K is available through the company or online.</p>
          <p>Last item, during the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These measures are reconciled to the GAAP measures and are available in the press release or on the Johnson &amp; Johnson website.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to review our results for the third quarter of 2009. If you would refer to your copy of the press release, let's begin with the schedule titled Supplementary Sales Data by Geographic Area. Worldwide sales to customers were $15.1 billion for the third quarter of 2009, down 5.3% as compared to the third quarter of 2008. On an operational basis, sales were down 2.8%, and currency had a negative impact of 2.5%. In the U.S., sales declined 8.1%. Outside the U.S., our operational growth was 2.4% while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 4.9 points. The Asia-Pacific-Africa region grew by 3.5% operationally, while Europe grew 2.1% operationally. The Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S. grew 1.5% on an operational basis.</p>
          <p>If you'll now turn to the consolidated statement of earnings, net earnings on a reported basis were $3.3 billion and earnings per share were $1.20. This compares to $3.3 billion and $1.17 in the same period in 2008.</p>
          <p>I would now like to make some additional comments relative to the components leading to earnings before we move on to the segment highlights. Cost of goods sold at 29.4% of sales was 60 basis points less than the same period in 2008, with lower costs offsetting the impact of the change in the mix of the business. Selling, marketing, and administrative expenses at 31.6% of sales were down 100 basis points versus last year, driven by cost management across the businesses.</p>
          <p>Our investment in research and development as a percent to sales was 10.7%, 100 basis points less than the third quarter of 2008, due to a change in the mix of the businesses and reductions in spending levels due in part to increased efficiencies.</p>
          <p>Interest expense net of interest income of $114 million compares to $25 million in the third quarter of 2008. The increase in net expense was due primarily to a lower interest rate on our cash balances.</p>
          <p>Other income net of other expense was $96 million in the third quarter of 2009 compared to $224 million in the same period last year. As discussed last year, in 2008 we received a settlement payment from Amgen for $200 million. In the third quarter this year, we received a settlement payment from Medtronic related to spinal screws, of which $115 million is reflected in this account.</p>
          <p>Our effective tax rate was 21.2% in the third quarter of 2009, versus 22.8% in the third quarter of 2008. Dominic will provide more commentary on taxes in his remarks.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the consolidated statement of earnings for the first nine months of 2009, consolidated sales to customers for the nine months of 2009 were $45.3 billion, a decrease of 6.6% as compared to the same period a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, sales declined by 1.8% and currency had a negative impact of 4.8 points. On the consolidated statement of year-to-date earnings, I'd first like to draw your attention to the boxed section. Net earnings of $10.1 billion in 2009 compares to adjusted net earnings of 10.3 billion in 2008. In 2008, a charge for in-process research and development has been excluded. With that adjustment, for the nine months of 2009 net earnings were down 2.1%. Adjusted earnings per share, at $3.61, was equal to the 2008 results.</p>
          <p>Turning now to business segment highlights, please refer to the supplementary sales schedule highlighting major products or business franchises. I'll begin with the Consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales for the third quarter of 2009 of $4 billion decreased 2.7% as compared to the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales increased 1.1% while the impact of currency was negative 3.8 points. U.S sales were down 4.4% while international sales grew 5.2% on an operational basis. For the third quarter of 2009, sales for the over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and nutritionals increased 0.5% on operational basis compared to the same period in 2008, with U.S. sales down 5.9% and sales outside the U.S. up 8% on an operational basis.</p>
          <p>Inventory builds of product in anticipation of the flu season have been partially offset by lower seasonal trade inventory builds in allergy. Intensified competitive pressures, including private label, have impacted growth in this category.</p>
          <p>Our Skin Care business achieved operational sales growth of 1.3% in the third quarter of 2009, with sales in the U.S. up 3.4% and sales outside of the U.S. down 0.1% on an operational basis. Growth in the U.S. was driven by AVEENO with the launch of the Nourish Plus hair care line. Outside the U.S., pressure from the economy impacted many of the brands, offset by sales from Dabao products acquired in the third quarter last year and strong growth in Le Petit Marseillais products.</p>
          <p>Baby Care products were down 2.6% on an operational basis when compared to the third quarter of 2008. Sales in the US were down 10.5%, primarily due to lower sales for BabyCenter.com, compounded by pressure on the overall category growth. At the end of 2008, BabyCenter exited the online retail business while continuing to focus on online content. Sales outside of the U.S. were down 0.7% operationally, with growth in hair care and baby oil offset by softness in other categories.</p>
          <p>Women's Health achieved operational sales growth of 3.6%. Sales in the U.S. were down 13.4%, primarily due to lower sales of K-Y products. The year-on-year comparisons were impacted by the 2008 launches of new products. Sales outside the U.S. were up on an operational basis by 11.7%, primarily due to the acquisition of the Vania products.</p>
          <p>Sales in the Oral Care franchise were down 1.4% on an operational basis. In the U.S., sales were down 8.3% due to softness in the category. Sales outside the U.S. increased 4.8% operationally, driven by strong growth for LISTERINE.</p>
          <p>Sales in the Wound Care/Other category were up 10.5% on an operational basis, due to the recent acquisitions of two businesses in our Wellness and Prevention platform and the Vania, Poliv&#xE9; acquisitions.</p>
          <p>That completes our review of the Consumer segment, and I'll now review highlights for the Pharmaceuticals segment. Worldwide net sales for third quarter of $5.3 billion were down 14.1% versus the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales were down 11.9% with a currency impact of negative 2.2 points. Sales in the U.S. decreased 19.2% while sales outside the US decreased on an operational basis by 1.9%.</p>
          <p>Our results continue to be impacted by generic competition on some of our products, namely RISPERDAL Oral, TOPAMAX, and RAZADYNE. The marketing exclusivity for RISPERDAL expired in the U.S. at the end of June 2008, and there are generic competitors for RISPERDAL in most markets. The marketing exclusivity in the US for TOPAMAX expired this past March, and multiple generics have entered the market. Generic competitors for RAZADYNE entered the US market in the latter half of 2008.</p>
          <p>Also early in the quarter, a generic version of ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN LO was introduced, impacting the third quarter results. A subsequent settlement was reached whereby the competitor ceased further shipments of the product.</p>
          <p>The combined impact from these products has reduced the third quarter worldwide Pharmaceutical operational growth rate by approximately 13 points, with the U.S. impact estimated at 21 points and the impact outside the US estimated at two points.</p>
          <p>Additionally, as we highlighted last year, the third quarter 2008 results outside the U.S. were favorably impacted by a reduction to the reserve for sales rebates of approximately $135 million related to CONCERTA. Excluding the negative impact of generics and the impact of the 2008 reduction, the underlying operational growth was approximately 4%.</p>
          <p>Now reviewing the major products, sales of REMICADE, a biologic approved for treatment of a number of immune mediated inflammatory diseases, were up 5.9% when compared to the third quarter of 2008, with sales growth in the US at 5.7%. In the U.S., double-digit market growth was partially offset by lower market share due to new competitive entrants and additional indications for competitive products. Export sales to our customers for markets outside the U.S. were up 5.1%. And adjusting for the fluctuation in inventory levels, growth was estimated at 13%.</p>
          <p>PROCRIT/EPREX declined operationally by 10% during the quarter as compared to the same period last year, with PROCRIT down 10.5% and EPREX down 9.6% operationally. PROCRIT results have been impacted by a volume decline in the market versus the third quarter of 2008 estimated at 9%. PROCRIT aggregate share across all markets was approximately 49% in the third quarter of 2009, up approximately one point versus the same period last year. Increased competition impacted the sales for EPREX.</p>
          <p>Sales of LEVAQUIN, our anti-infective, were down 5.7% on an operational basis when compared to the same period a year ago. Total prescriptions in the U.S. anti-infective market are estimated to be up slightly in the quarter. LEVAQUIN script share was down versus the same period a year ago due to increased competition from generic products.</p>
          <p>RISPERDAL CONSTA, our long-acting injectable formulation of risperidone, achieved third quarter sales growth of 9.9% on an operational basis. U.S. sales growth was 9.3% while sales outside the US were up 10.2% operationally, driven by increased share. Additionally, the launch earlier this year of RISPERDAL CONSTA in Japan contributed to growth outside the US.</p>
          <p>CONCERTA, a product for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, declined 27.2% operationally in the third quarter as compared to the same period last year. Sales outside the U.S. were down 59.2% operationally due to the 2008 reserve reversal mentioned earlier. Excluding this item, sales outside the U.S. were up approximately 16% on an operational basis, with strong growth seen across the major regions. Sales in the U.S. were up 7.9% due to strong market growth, partially offset by lower market share.</p>
          <p>ACIPHEX, as it's known in the US market and PARIET outside the U.S., is a proton pump inhibitor or PPI that we co-market with Eisai. On an operational basis, sales were down 4.4% with U.S. sales up 0.8% and sales outside the U.S. down 9% operationally. In the U.S., dollar share in the third quarter was the same in both periods while script share has declined by just under a point. Sales outside the U.S. have been impacted by pressure on the PPI category.</p>
          <p>VELCADE, a treatment for multiple myeloma co-developed with Millennium Pharmaceuticals, continued to improve its market leadership position. Operational sales growth was strong at 30.5%, driven by additional approval last year for front-line therapy.</p>
          <p>PREZISTA, a protease inhibitor for the treatment of HIV, grew operationally 99.5%, with the U.S. growth over 125% and sales outside the U.S. growing 77% on an operational basis. Expanded labeling to include treatment naive patients contributed to the continued positive momentum in share.</p>
          <p>INVEGA, an atypical antipsychotic, grew 12.3%. Sales in the U.S. were down 16.4% due to reductions in inventory levels and a modest decline in share. Sales outside the U.S. grew over 140%, driven by steady progress in market share growth.</p>
          <p>Wrapping up the review of the Pharmaceuticals segment is update on the status of the rivaroxaban complete response. We have met with the FDA and come to an agreement on a plan to address the points raised in complete response letter. As a reminder, no new clinical or non-clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy or safety were requested. Based on these discussions, we are working towards submitting our response before the end of the year.</p>
          <p>I will now review the Medical Devices &amp; Diagnostics segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices &amp; Diagnostics segment sales of 5.8 billion grew 4.1% operationally as compared to the same period in 2008. Currency had a negative impact of 1.8 points, resulting in total sales growth of 2.3%. Sales in the U.S. were up 4.5% while sales outside the U.S. increased on an operational basis by 3.8%. Results have been impacted by lower sales of drug-eluting stents due to increased competition. Sales excluding the impact of lower sales of drug-eluting stents grew nearly 6% operationally.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the franchises and starting with Cordis; Cordis sales were down 6.6% operationally, with U.S. sales down 10% and sales outside the U.S. down 4.6% operationally. Cordis results were impacted by lower sales of CYPHER, our sirolimus-eluting stent, partially offset by solid growth in balloons and our Biosense Webster business. CYPHER sales were approximately $210 million, down 28% on an operational basis versus the prior year. Sales in the U.S. of approximately $55 million were down 45%.</p>
          <p>In comparison to the third quarter of 2008, the U.S. drug-eluting stent market is estimated to be down 7%. PCI procedures were down 6% while penetration rates were estimated at 75%, up from 71% a year ago. The estimated price for CYPHER in the U.S. is down approximately 2% versus the third quarter of 2008. Estimated share in the U.S. of 12% was down two points sequentially and down 11 points from the third quarter of 2008 due to increased competition.</p>
          <p>Sales outside the U.S. of approximately $155 million declined 19% operationally. The estimated market share in the quarter of 24% was down one point on a sequential basis and down six points from the third quarter of 2008. Increased competition has impacted the share outside the U.S.</p>
          <p>CYPHER estimated worldwide share for the third quarter was 19%, down two points sequentially and down nine points from the third quarter of 2008. In September, the 2.25 millimeter CYPHER stent was approved by the FDA, providing an important new option for treating small vessel disease.</p>
          <p>Biosense Webster, our electrophysiology business, achieved 9% operational growth in the quarter due to the strong performance of both specialty diagnostic and therapeutic catheters.</p>
          <p>Our DePuy franchise had operational sales growth of 6.7% when compared to the same period in 2008, with the U.S. growing 6% and the business outside the U.S. growing by 7.6% operationally. Pressure on pricing continued as a result of the economic trends. However, positive mix due to continuing product innovation has mitigated much of that impact.</p>
          <p>Hip growth on a worldwide basis was approximately 6% operational, with the U.S. growth at approximately 8% and the growth outside the U.S. at 5% on an operational basis. On an operational basis, worldwide knee growth was approximately 4%, with the U.S. up 5% and outside the U.S. up 3% operationally. Spine achieved strong operational growth of approximately 11% due to the successful launch of a number of products, with the U.S. up 9% and sales outside the U.S. up 15% operationally.</p>
          <p>Mitek, our sports medicine business, grew approximately 13% operationally with similar results both in and outside the U.S.</p>
          <p>The Diabetes franchise was down 2.7% operationally in the third quarter of 2009, with the U.S. business down 4.9%. While volume was up modestly versus the same period last year, pressure on pricing continued. Outside of the U.S., sales decreased 0.4% operationally. Animas, our insulin pump business grew 30% on an operational basis due to new product launches and continued development of the international market.</p>
          <p>Ethicon worldwide sales grew operationally by 9.4%, with the U.S. up 18% and sales outside the U.S. up 3.8% operationally. The acquisitions of Mentor and Omrix, partially offset by the divestiture of the Professional Wound Care business, added approximately 3.5 points to the worldwide operational growth. Sales for our newly-acquired aesthetics products from Mentor were in line with 2008. On a worldwide basis, double-digit operational growth was achieved in biosurgicals and meshes.</p>
          <p>Ethicon Endo-Surgery achieved operational growth of 8.4% in the third quarter of 2009, with the U.S. sales growing 5.5% and sales outside the U.S. growing on an operational basis by 10.9%. Double-digit operational growth for both the endo-mechanical and HARMONIC products was driven by strong performance in markets outside the U.S. Additionally, in the U.S., the recently acquired EnSeal products from our acquisition of SurgRx contributed to the results. Advanced sterilization products achieved strong growth in the quarter, driven primarily by the continued growth in markets outside the U.S.</p>
          <p>Ortho Clinical Diagnostics achieved operational growth of 8.2% in the third quarter. Sales growth in the U.S. was 9.2% while sales outside U.S. were up 7% on an operational basis. The recently launched VITROS 5600 and 3600 made strong contributions to the results of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Rounding out the review of the Medical Devices &amp; Diagnostics segment, our Vision Care franchise achieved operational sales growth of 0.2% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Sales in the U.S. increased 0.8%. Sales outside the U.S. were flat on an operational basis. The worldwide lens mark is estimated to be flat to down slightly compared to the same period last year, with the modest growth in U.S. offset by a modest decline outside the U.S. Estimated worldwide market share was in line on a sequential basis.</p>
          <p>Despite the softness in the market, ACUVUE OASYS and ACUVUE OASYS for Astigmatism achieved strong double-digit growth. Additionally, the introduction of 1-Day ACUVUE TruEye in major markets in Europe made strong contributions to the sales outside the U.S.</p>
          <p>That completes highlights for the Medical Devices &amp; Diagnostics segment and concludes the segment highlights for Johnson &amp; Johnson's third quarter of 2009. I'll now turn the podium over to Dominic.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Louise. I'd like to add my own welcome to members of the investment community who have joined us here today and to those who are listening via the webcast and conference call. I will keep my remarks relatively brief since we would like to allow time for the update on our Medical Devices &amp; Diagnostics business and to answer your questions.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, we continued to make progress in advancing our pipeline of new products to the market, with several regulatory approvals and launches. We also completed several transactions that will add external new sources of growth. I'd like to review these accomplishments with you today and also provide some overall comments on our financial results this past quarter as well as an update to our guidance for full-year 2009, but first some general comments on the business.</p>
          <p>This year continues to present challenges to certain parts of our business due to the ongoing impact of the economy as well as difficult year-over-year comparisons caused by the loss of U.S. market exclusivity for RISPERDAL and TOPAMAX. We continued to deliver solid operational results and are pleased with the underlying strength across our broad base of healthcare businesses. Overall, excluding the impact of generics and the launch of new drug-eluting stent competitors, the underlying business is growing at approximately 3 to 4% operationally, despite the general economic slowdown.</p>
          <p>These are challenging times, but the people of Johnson &amp; Johnson continue to manage the business very well, focusing on the factors we can control in terms of execution and cost management and ensuring that we remain focused on the long-term opportunities that will benefit our patients and customers and drive sustainable growth.</p>
          <p>We see promising signs in several franchises and products, signs that give me confidence in our ability to maintain and grow our market leadership positions as economic conditions improve.</p>
          <p>In the Consumer business, we have seen the continued impact of the recession on consumer buying patterns in the U.S. as well as reductions in inventory levels by our distributors. Our continued focus on scientific innovations that differentiate our products as well as our focus on developing strong consumer brands remain core strategies for continuing to grow our Consumer business. Our newer brands outside the US have helped to stem some of the challenges we are seeing in the US market.</p>
          <p>In the Pharmaceutical business, we continue to make good progress in advancing our pipeline. During the third quarter, the FDA approved STELARA for the treatment of adult patients 18 years or older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The FDA also approved INVEGA SUSTENNA for the acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adults. This is the first once-monthly, long-acting injectible atypical antipsychotic approved in the U.S. for this use. And just last week, the European Commission approved SIMPONI as a once-monthly subcutaneous therapy for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis, active and progressive psoriatic arthritis, and severe active ankylosing spondylitis.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we have launched four significant new molecular entities in the U.S. and two were also launched in Europe, and I am pleased to tell you they are all off to a good start.</p>
          <p>We continue to supplement our internal development with acquisitions and collaborations that will broaden our research platforms and provide new areas of growth for Johnson &amp; Johnson. This past quarter, we closed our agreement with Elan Corporation, where we have acquired substantially all of the assets and rights to its Alzheimers Immunotherapy Program as well as an equity interest in Elan Corporation. We will continue development activities for bapineuzumab, a potential first in class treatment that is in Phase III clinical trials.</p>
          <p>Also this past quarter, we closed on our acquisition of Cougar Biotechnology, which strengthens our presence in oncology with a late-stage first-in-class prostate cancer treatment.</p>
          <p>We also entered into a licensing and collaboration agreement with Gilead Sciences for the development and commercialization of a new once-daily fixed-dose antiretroviral product, which will include our investigational compound TMC278 and Gilead's TRUVADA.</p>
          <p>And early in the fourth quarter, we entered into a collaboration agreement and purchased an equity interest in Crucell. This agreement focuses on discovery, development, and commercialization of monoclonal antibodies and vaccines for the treatment and prevention of influenza and other infectious as well as non-infectious diseases. We are very excited about the potential for these agreements; and as always, we continue to look at ways to invest in the long-term growth of our business both internally and externally.</p>
          <p>We're also seeing important developments in our Medical Devices &amp; Diagnostics portfolio, which Alex Gorsky will discuss with you later this morning.</p>
          <p>Now some comments on our recent quarterly results; we continue to manage our cost structure in a disciplined way to improve operating margins and deliver solid earnings growth. And we are developing plans to deal with business and macroeconomic pressures, but never losing focus on investing for growth.</p>
          <p>Our third quarter results continue to reflect an improvement in our pre-tax operating margin, which we expected for the year when we provided our annual guidance in January. The year-to-date effective tax rate of 23.5% when compared to our guidance of between 24 and 25% had a positive effect on earnings in the third quarter, contributing approximately $0.05 per share. This reduction in the effective tax rate results primarily from additional foreign tax credits.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to currency, which continues to have an impact on our financial results. The negative impact of currency translation on sales was approximately 2.5%, and the negative impact on earnings per share was approximately $0.03 per share as compared to the prior year. Therefore, our third quarter 2009 EPS of $1.20 reflects approximately $0.06 of operational EPS growth offset by the approximately $0.03 per share of negative currency translation impact versus the third quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>I mentioned a moment ago what the tax rate improvement was in the third quarter as compared to our previous guidance. When comparing the tax rate improvement to the prior year, the lower effective tax rate contributed $0.02 per share to our operational growth of $0.06 per share over the third quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2009. Let's start with a discussion of cash and interest income and expense. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $2.7 billion of net cash. This consists of approximately $14.3 billion of cash and investments and $11.6 billion of debt. This represents a $1.6 billion improvement in our net cash position during the third quarter. And we used approximately $1.9 billion of cash during the third quarter to close the Elan and Cougar transactions.</p>
          <p>As we said previously, we have slowed the pace of our share repurchases due to the deployment of cash for transactions like the Cougar acquisition and the Elan and Crucell agreements. And as we stated when we initiated the share repurchase program, we would always remain flexible should opportunities arise to deploy our cash to build the business. To date, we've purchased approximately $8.9 billion of our stock. We still expect to complete the remaining $1.1 billion under this repurchase program but at a slower pace than previously anticipated.</p>
          <p>Our financial position remains strong. We continue to generate strong cash flows and maintain a AAA credit rating, allowing us to continue to have good access to the credit markets for our financing needs at reasonable rates. As always, we will examine the best uses of our financial strength to invest in the long-term growth of our business and to return value to our shareowners.</p>
          <p>For purposes of your models, assuming no major additional acquisitions and the slower pace of completion of the share repurchase program, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between 300 million and $400 million, a slightly higher level of net interest expense than our previous guidance, reflecting lower interest income on our cash balances.</p>
          <p>Turning now to other income and expense; as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as one-time gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments, by our development corporation, and asset sales or write-offs. This account is difficult to forecast, but assuming no major one-time gains or losses, I would recommend that you consider modeling other income and expense for 2009 as a net gain ranging from approximately 200 million to $300 million, consistent with our previous guidance.</p>
          <p>And now a word on taxes; through the end of the third quarter of 2009, the company's effective tax rate was 23.5%. We suggest that you model our effective tax rate for 2009 in the range of 23 to 23.5%, a lower effective tax rate than our previous guidance. As always, we continue to assess opportunities to improve upon this rate throughout the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>Now turning to sales and earnings, it remains very difficult to predict movements in currency exchange rates and their impact on sales and earnings, especially given the ongoing economic volatility and the resulting monetary policy changes that governments around the world are employing to address the situation. As we have said throughout the year, our guidance for 2009 will be based first on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations, assuming that average currency rates for 2009 would be the same as they were for 2008. This is the way we manage the business, and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying operational performance of the business.</p>
          <p>We will also continue to provide an estimate of our reported sales and EPS results for the year with the impact that current exchange rates could have, using the euro as an example.</p>
          <p>So turning to sales and taking into consideration the loss of U.S. market exclusivity of both RISPERDAL and TOPAMAX, which have about a 4 to 5% negative impact on our overall sales growth rate, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales change on a constant currency basis of between negative 1% and positive 1%, consistent with our previous guidance. This would result in sales for 2009 from operations on a constant currency basis of between 63 and $64 billion.</p>
          <p>While we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, to give you an idea of the potential impact, if average currency exchange rate for the remainder of 2009 were to remain where they were as of last week and using the euro as an example, this would imply an average rate for the euro of $1.39 for the year, which means our sales growth rate would be negatively impacted by approximately 3% or approximately $2 billion. Thus under this scenario, we would expect reported sales to decline to a range between negative 2% and negative 4%, for a total expected level of reported sales of between 61 and $62 billion, slightly above our previous guidance range, but due solely to the impact of currency movements.</p>
          <p>Now turning to earnings, when I last checked, the recent First Call mean estimate for our EPS for full-year 2009 was $4.52 per share. As a reminder, our three recent transactions with Cougar Biotechnology, Elan, and Crucell, were expected to have an aggregate dilutive impact between $0.06 and $0.10 per share on 2009 earnings, as we indicated when we announced each of these transactions. We incurred $0.01 of this dilution in third quarter, and we expect that $0.06 to $0.07 of this dilutive effect will be reflected in our fourth quarter results. The lower effective tax rate that we are now estimating versus our previous guidance will add approximately $0.07 per share to our 2009 earnings per share excluding special items, offsetting the dilutive impact of the transactions I noted earlier of approximately $0.07 to $0.08 per share.</p>
          <p>With that in mind and considering the strength of our operational performance thus far this year, as well as the fact that we are now into our fourth quarter, we are now narrowing our full-year 2009 operational EPS guidance excluding special items to between $4.65 and $4.70 per share on an operational basis; that is assuming the same average exchange rates for 2009 as in 2008.</p>
          <p>And while we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, to give you idea of the potential impact on EPS of currency exchange rates for the remainder of 2009 were to remain where they were as of last week, with the average euro for the year at a rate of $1.39, then our EPS growth rate would be negatively impacted by approximately 2% or approximately $0.11 per share. This is approximately $0.04 better than our original estimate we provided in January of approximately $0.15 per share. Therefore, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting full-year EPS excluding special items of between $4.54 and $4.59 per share. Given the uncertainties that remain with respect to the pace of any potential economic recovery, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range.</p>
          <p>And finally just a reminder, we recently reached an agreement with Boston Scientific to settle certain stent litigation cases for approximately $716 million, a significant portion of which will be included in our fourth quarter results. This gain is not included in our earnings guidance as we will treat this gain as a special item.</p>
          <p>That concludes my update on our operating performance this quarter and guidance for 2009. Let's move on now to the next portion of our program today. As you know, we regularly communicate with the investment community about our long-term strategies and prospects for growth. Many of you joined us last year in New Brunswick for a full review of our Medical Devices &amp; Diagnostics business. And today we are going to bring you up to date on our progress in the MD&amp;D business and some of the major developments we described for you then.</p>
          <p>Recently, we consolidated our Comprehensive Care and Surgical Care organizations and reintegrated them into one Medical Devices &amp; Diagnostics management structure. Alex Gorsky, who most of you know from his recent tenure running our Surgical Care business, is now</p>
          <p>Worldwide Chairman of MD&amp;D, and will walk you through an update. And at the end of Alex's presentation, we look forward to taking your questions. It is now my pleasure to present my friend and colleague on the Executive Committee of Johnson &amp; Johnson, Alex Gorsky. Alex?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody. It's my real pleasure to be here with you to discuss Johnson &amp; Johnson's Medical Diagnostics &amp; Devices businesses. Let me start, as Dominic said, by taking you back to June of last year, when we met with many of you in New Brunswick to conduct a day-long MD&amp;D review. At that meeting, we shared with you why we're so excited about the growth opportunities in the global MD&amp;D market and why we believe that Johnson &amp; Johnson is uniquely positioned to take advantage of these opportunities.</p>
          <p>So despite some obvious headwinds since then which we have all experienced, we'll share with you why we're still bullish on the long-term potential of this market and in our ability to drive above market growth over the long term.</p>
          <p>Last June at that same meeting, we shared with you plans to grow our core MD&amp;D businesses through innovative line extensions. Today, I'm going to update you on our most promising new line extensions in five of our core businesses: sutures, joint reconstruction, diabetes care, contact lenses, and clinical labs.</p>
          <p>At that same meeting, we also shared with you our plans to invest in breakthrough innovation, new products and technologies with the potential to advance the standard of care for patients and drive significant growth for Johnson &amp; Johnson and shareholder value. We spoke about products like SEDASYS, the first computer assisted personalized sedation system. We spoke about the NEVO drug-eluting stent, which has the potential to transform coronary stenting. And we spoke about the Fibrin Pad, a unique example of convergence within Johnson &amp; Johnson that addresses the persistent problems associated with bleeding in surgical settings. Today, we're going to share some exciting progress on how we're making on all three of these innovations along with others.</p>
          <p>At that meeting, we also shared with you our plans to accelerate growth in emerging markets. Today, we're going to share some specific examples of how we're executing our plans in countries like Brazil, Russia, India, and China.</p>
          <p>So with that as a backdrop, let's go ahead and dive in. Globally, the Medical Devices &amp; Diagnostics market continues to be very attractive, estimated at about $335 billion and projected to grow at approximately 6.5% over the next several years. As you can see on the right, we currently participate in a large majority of the total MD&amp;D market, those noted by blue print. Geographically, the market is split almost evenly between the United States and outside of the United States, with outside the United States markets expected to grow about two percentage points faster than the U.S.</p>
          <p>The medical technology market offers tremendous growth opportunities given favorable trends like rapidly aging populations, significant unmet medical needs, scientific and technological advances, and geographic development opportunities. At the same time, we know that there are considerable market challenges that lie ahead, including things like increasing cost pressures, the need for better access and affordability, requirements for new standards of evidence, and the evolving demands of patients and customers.</p>
          <p>Now at Johnson &amp; Johnson, we're proud of the fact that we're the world's largest Medical Devices &amp; Diagnostics business with more than $23 billion in sales in 2008. Over the past five years, we have grown sales at a compounded annual growth rate of 7% operationally, growing in line with the market. Johnson &amp; Johnson's MD&amp;D segment is well positioned for growth. We are number one or number two in the majority of markets in which we compete, and these markets are either large or fast growing or in many cases both.</p>
          <p>We have significant competitive advantages, including global capabilities and scale, deep patient and medical insights, and strong scientific and technological expertise. Very importantly, we've got the depth and breadth of Johnson &amp; Johnson, which gives our company's access to resources, capabilities and expertise, our Consumer, Pharmaceutical, and MD&amp;D businesses. Few if any competitors can claim similar advantages.</p>
          <p>This slide I'm particularly proud of because I believe our MD&amp;D segment is comprised of seven extraordinary franchises. DePuy is a leader in orthopedics, sports medicine, and neurosurgical devices. Ethicon is a leader in sutures, tissue repair products, and aesthetics. Ethicon Endo-Surgery is a leader in minimally invasive surgery. Cordis and Biosense Webster are leaders in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, the world's leading cause of death. Ortho Clinical Diagnostics [OCD] is a leader in diagnostics products, which impact more than 60% of healthcare decisions. And LifeScan and Animas are leaders in the diabetes area, which affects almost 250 million people worldwide today and will affect almost 400 million people by the year 2025. And our Vision Care franchise is leader in global contact lens market.</p>
          <p>Earlier, Louise shared with you the third quarter sales and growth rates for each of our seven MD&amp;D franchises. On this slide, you'll see the same information through the first nine months of the year. DePuy, Ethicon, Ethicon Endo, and OCD all generated operational growth in the high single digits, a testimony to the leadership positions they hold, in the markets in which they compete, and to the relative stability of these particular markets. Our Vision Care and Diabetes Care franchises have been impacted the most within MD&amp;D by the weak global economy, and you can see that in their results with operational sales in Vision Care up 1% and sales in Diabetes Care down 4%.</p>
          <p>Finally, sales were down 11% in our Cordis franchise. Excluding drug-eluting stents, however, sales in Cordis actually grew at approximately 10%, a good indication of the strength of our other cardiovascular businesses that are sometimes overshadowed by the challenges we're facing with the drug-eluting stent market. All told, nine-month sales in MD&amp;D topped $17 billion with a 3.3% operational growth rate. Excluding drug-eluting stents, nine-month sales grew at approximately 6% operationally.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, we see tremendous growth opportunities for growth in the MD&amp;D segment, and we are pursuing four key growth strategies to take full advantage of these opportunities. First, we've got to grow our core businesses, in large part due to exciting new line extensions. Second, we're launching breakthrough new products and technologies in some of the largest and/or fastest growing segments in which we compete. Third, we're accelerating our growth in emerging markets. Fourth and finally and as always, we're going to drive operational effectiveness and efficiency.</p>
          <p>Let's take a quick look at the progress we're making with each of these strategies. As I mentioned earlier, we compete in a number of very large and well established markets. I have highlighted five of these markets here and they provide us with a very large and relatively stable and predictable foundation upon which to build our business. Still, we don't take our success for granted in these markets. We are committed to growing share and we've become very proficient in the type of continuous new product innovation that will allow us to do so. What follows are a few specific examples.</p>
          <p>In recent years, our Ethicon portfolio has evolved from a line of products that perform a mechanical function like closing a wound to a line of products that can actually impact the physiology of a surgical site by helping to inhibit bacterial growth in and around the suture. Infection reduction will continue to be a primary driver of growth in the suture market. Out of the more than 30 million surgical procedures performed each year in the United States, close to half a million result in surgical site infections. When these infections occur, they can be extremely problematic for the patient and expensive to treat for the hospital.</p>
          <p>Addressing this unmet need drives the growth of the antibacterial synthetic suture platform, a platform we invented. Our VICRYL Plus antibacterial suture, introduced in late 2003, took the science of sutures to the next level. This suture was the first of its kind to the market and is one of a kind worldwide. It's coated with the purest forms of triclosan to inhibit colonization of the most common bacteria that cause surgical site infections. We've doubled VICRYL Plus sales and recently expanded our Plus portfolio with the launch of MONOCRYL Plus and PDS Plus in the U.S., offering added protection for multiple layers of closure. We intend to increase the penetration rate of our Plus portfolio through multiple country launches later this year.</p>
          <p>Now let's talk about our DuPuy franchise. In this franchise, the Pinnacle CoMplete Acetabular Cup System is the first ceramic-on-metal bearing being considered by approval by the FDA. It's intended for use as a primary hip replacement in adult patients suffering severe pain and disability due to structural damage in the hip joint from non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease including osteoarthritis or post-traumatic arthritis. Clinical and laboratory data show that the ceramic-on-metal bearing in the Pinnacle CoMplete system combines the durability and stability of metal-on-metal bearing and the enhanced wear characteristics of ceramic-on-ceramic bearing. More than 95% of the patients in the CoMplete clinical study reported a decrease in hip pain and need for pain medication, increased function, and overall satisfaction with the surgery.</p>
          <p>A DePuy ceramic-on-metal bearing has been marketed in 40 countries around the world outside the U.S. since 2007. If approved by the FDA, health professionals will have a new option for their patients based on specific patient anatomy, lifestyle, medical condition, and surgeon preference. The Pinnacle CoMplete system was presented to an FDA advisory committee in August, and I'm very pleased to report that the committee unanimously recommended FDA approval.</p>
          <p>The number one patient need regarding blood glucose strips and meters is confidence in the accuracy of the test results. LifeScan is launching a new blue OneTouch Ultra test strip with DoubleSure technology for accuracy. DoubleSure technology performs two separate glucose tests with every strip and a self-test to confirm accuracy. OneTouch Ultra test strips are glucose specific and they will eliminate the risk of falsely elevated results from other sugars. They also have nearly seven years of proven accuracy that patients and healthcare practitioners can rely on.</p>
          <p>This innovation, launched in the U.S. last month, leverages LifeScan's competitive advantage of a one-strip platform used by multiple meters. It works in all current and future OneTouch Ultra meters. It protects and serves our existing customer base while providing a platform for growth. It doesn't require costly trade-out programs to upgrade patients to new meters in order to receive new benefits.</p>
          <p>I should also add another important point. Like all LifeScan products, this does not contain the GDH-PQQ enzyme that the FDA warned about in August.</p>
          <p>Since 1987 when we introduced the world's first disposable contact lens under the ACUVUE brand name, Johnson &amp; Johnson Vision Care has continued to maintain its leadership position with the launch of numerous innovative eye care products. Today, ACUVUE remains the world's most widely prescribed contact lens. 1-DAY ACUVUE TruEye is the world's first daily disposable silicone hydrogel and the most exciting breakthrough in contact lens technology in years. It is the world's first lens to deliver on all four dimensions of eye health, shown on this slide, to particularly suit today's patients with busy, demanding, and active lifestyles.</p>
          <p>1-DAY ACUVUE TruEye was launched in the U.K. in August 2008 followed by numerous other outside the U.S. markets in the second quarter of this year. A U.S. launch is planned for the second and third quarter of next year, which will enable us to maximize the global learnings of our outside United States launches.</p>
          <p>Our Ortho Clinical Diagnostics franchise competes in the clinical laboratory, blood typing, and blood screening segments. Within the clinical laboratory segment, the largest of these three segments, OCD offers a very competitive menu of tests on our VITROS systems. These tests range from routine cholesterol level testing to more sophisticated oncology and infectious disease tests.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter of 2008, the FDA approved two new VITROS systems, the 5600 and the 3600. With these approvals, the size of the markets served by OCD has doubled from 4.6 billion to 9.8 billion. With the 5600, we have entered the fast growing integrated market segment. The 3600 gives us access to the medium and high volume immunoassay standalone segment. The systems are designed to deliver high quality results with optimized turnaround time and workflow efficiency for OCD's primary customers, hospitals and reference labs. These systems are also key to running new medical content, which we define as assays that are just beginning to emerge and assays that have yet to be validated. Some examples include vitamin D and cystatin C, a marker for kidney and heart disease.</p>
          <p>The key strategic opportunity in healthcare is reducing chronic illness and enabling wellness worldwide to reduce costs, and the VITROS systems enable OCD to address these unmet medical needs.</p>
          <p>While line extensions are critical to achieving steady growth, we're also working on a number of breakthrough new products and technologies that we believe will drive significant growth for us in the years ahead. Some of these products and technologies are in categories where we already compete, drug-eluting stents for example. Others are in new or adjacent categories, computer assisted personalized sedation and biosurgicals for example, so let's take a closer look at a few of these.</p>
          <p>Within our Cordis franchise, we believe that our new NEVO stent has the potential to return us to a leadership position in the $5 billion global drug-eluting stent market. NEVO is the first and only drug-eluting stent utilizing RES technology, which incorporates hundreds of small reservoirs, each acting as a depot into which drug polymer compositions are loaded. This unique design allows drug delivery from a stent with a surface that is 75% bare metal upon insertion and which becomes purely bare metal in approximately three months, based on in-vivo data.</p>
          <p>NEVO also contains Sirolimus, the same drug as our CYPHER stent. Data supporting the safety and efficacy of Sirolimus in coronary applications is now available out to six years. And this body of clinical evidence is completely unmatched by any other DES.</p>
          <p>NEVO will also be highly deliverable. It is made of cobalt chromium, which makes the stent flexible and conformable, with thin struts to maximize vessel coverage.</p>
          <p>Our confidence in NEVO is reflected in a robust and extensive clinical trial program and strategy that will provide comparative data for NEVO against TAXUS Liberte, against XIENCE, the current market leader, and against our own CYPHER, the gold standard for safety and efficacy.</p>
          <p>In May, we presented data from the NEVO RES 1 trial, showing that NEVO demonstrated superiority to the TAXUS Liberte stent with respect to in-stent late loss, the trial's primary endpoint, and did so across all major subgroups such as patients with diabetes. We expect the NEVO 2 trial versus XIENCE to start sometime in the first part of 2010, and the NEVO 3 trial to begin after that. In August, we started a CYPHER trial in the US that will serve as the control arm for NEVO 3.</p>
          <p>In terms of regulatory filings, we plan to file NEVO for CE Mark approval in Europe in the first quarter of 2010, with a PMA submission in the US to follow in 2012.</p>
          <p>Within our cardiovascular franchise, Biosense Webster is the world leader in advanced diagnostic, therapeutic, and mapping tools used in the treatment of arrhythmias through ablation. Biosense Webster is increasingly focused on atrial fibrillation or AFib. An estimated 22 million people worldwide suffer from AFib, making it the most common heart rhythm disorder and a leading cause of stroke among people over the age of 65. Despite the high prevalence of AFib, only about 88,000 people are treated with ablation each year. Earlier this year, Biosense received FDA approval for the NAVISTAR THERMOCOOL catheter for the treatment of AFib when used with compatible 3D mapping systems. It's first and only catheter approved in the US for this indication.</p>
          <p>We've also begun the outside the United States launch of CARTO 3, a new catheter based navigational mapping system. CARTO 3 provides incredibly detailed full-color, three-dimensional images of the heart, enabling electrophysiologists performing catheter oblation to pinpoint exactly where the abnormal heart rhythm originates. We're awaiting FDA approval for CARTO 3.</p>
          <p>The 2008 acquisition of SurgRx has allowed our Ethicon Endo-Surgery franchise to expand its leadership in energy based surgical instruments. These instruments are used to cut, coagulate, and seal tissue during minimally invasive and open surgical procedures. By combining ENSEAL products from SurgRx with Ethicon Endo's HARMONIC line of instruments, we can now offer surgeons an expanded portfolio of surgical instruments for use in wide variety of surgical procedures.</p>
          <p>Johnson &amp; Johnson leads the industry in developing a next generation of advanced hemostats to address the persistent clinical problems associated with bleeding in surgical settings. In a truly unique example of convergence, three Johnson &amp; Johnson companies: Ethicon, Centocor, and the recently acquired Omrix Biopharmaceuticals have been working together to develop one such hemostat that we call the Fibrin Pad. With our human plasma-based biologics embedded directly into a proprietary matrix, the Fibrin Pad has the potential to uniquely and effectively address bleeding challenges that are currently unmet by traditional hemostats. It's designed to combine the functions of mechanical sealing and biological hemostasis. Upon contact with blood, the biodegradable device causes a clot to form rapidly and stop bleeding without any other action. A BLA for the Fibrin Pad is targeted for submission by the end of 2009.</p>
          <p>Our MD&amp;D companies have a rich history of transforming the art of surgery with unprecedented innovations. SEDASYS, the first computer-assisted personalized sedation system, makes it possible for physician/nurse teams to deliver the sedative propofol during routine medical screenings. SEDASYS integrates drug delivery and state-of-the-art monitoring, making it possible for physician/nurse teams to provide personalized sedation based upon a patient's unique physiology.</p>
          <p>The system is designed to achieve minimal to moderate propofol sedation levels, continuously monitoring patient vital signs, and reduce the risk of patients slipping into deeper sedation levels than intended. SEDASYS will be used initially during colonoscopies and screenings of the upper GI tract. In the U.S. alone, there are some 16 million patients undergoing these routine procedures every year. Beyond the GI market, we plan to study the application of the SEDASYS system in other procedures as we continue to advance the standard and science of sedation.</p>
          <p>SEDASYS was presented to an FDA Advisory Committee in May of this year and received a favorable recommendation. We are in ongoing discussions with FDA regarding final approval.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, slightly more than half of our MD&amp;D sales come from outside the United States. Despite the impact of the global recession, we continue to see especially attractive growth rates in Brazil, Russia, India, and China. In fact, the growth rate for the MD&amp;D industry in the BRIC markets over the next five years is expected to be more than double than that of the total global market.</p>
          <p>To win in emerging markets, we're focused developing market-appropriate products that not only address unmet medical needs, but also address the issue of market access and affordability. A good example of this is our <mark type="inaudible" /> synthetic absorbable suture in China.</p>
          <p>We also recognize the importance of working with governments that are eager to bring quality healthcare to an increasing number of citizens. And we understand the need to be on the ground in the emerging markets in order to gain meaningful local insights, and so, we are expanding our footprint throughout BRIC. For example, we've established R&amp;D centers in China and India, manufacturing facilities throughout BRIC including a new campus in Suzhou, China, where DuPuy products are now being made, and surgical training institutes to address the shortage of skilled surgeons in these markets, and a branch of the Johnson &amp; Johnson Diabetes Institute in China.</p>
          <p>Our final growth strategy is to drive operational effectiveness and efficiency. As you can see, we've made significant improvement to our operating profit over the last five years. The improvement is primarily attributed to gross profit improvements and leveraging of SG&amp;A. You can also see that our operating profit increased as percent of sales from 22.6% in 2003 to over 30% in 2008. In addition, MD&amp;D contributed approximately 40% of Johnson &amp; Johnson's total segment operating profit in 2008.</p>
          <p>I trust that I've given you a better sense of our strategies to enhance patient care, create shareholder value, and drive continued growth within MD&amp;D. We believe that our long track record of success at MD&amp;D will continue for a number of reasons. We have a strong history of delivering clinically relevant solutions. We see favorable demographics and significant unmet needs globally. We have market-leading franchises with established growth platforms and robust pipelines. And we possess broad technology, scientific and regulatory expertise, and we can take advantage of our global infrastructure capabilities and networks. We also have an exceptional financial profile that is enabling continued investments in new markets, companies, and technologies.</p>
          <p>And in closing, let me add that I'm very privileged and humbled to work with a group of great leaders and associates who are doing their best to improve patient care and drive value for our shareholders each and every day.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll thank you and let me turn it back over to Louise.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody, a couple of questions. Alex, if I could just ask a broader question, I mean clearly the Device group had a terrific quarter, a very solid performance quarter. But when you look at some of the pieces, let's say Biosense Webster, my impression is that it's a little slower growth than the stronger double digits we've seen. The broad question is this: Are you seeing any change, any rebound in procedures more broadly? Or conversely, are you seeing any signs of procedure slowdown, anything getting worse? I'm asking just to post this thing to preannouncement talking about inventories or procedures? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the question. What I would say is there are a couple important points to consider. First of all, what we're using today is second-quarter data. We don't have the third-quarter data yet, so it is important. One of the things I found in my transition from Pharma to Devices is the challenge of trying to read the data very accurately, so most of our comments, really all of our comments are predicated upon second-quarter data.</p>
          <p>And what we saw is obviously in any areas where there were discretionary procedures and elective procedures, we've seen the impact of the global economy. So, specifically, in things like aesthetic procedures, we're seeing those down about 20%.</p>
          <p>We also felt it in areas that were associated with any capital spending, obviously. That was an issue for us in our ASP [Advanced Sterilization Products] business, some of our Biosense Webster. And, we also have a pretty good indicator we believe of the general surgery market, bio-sutures. We think they're a good analog, and usually that market grows at about 1 or 2% in volume over time at a pretty steady pace. And, what we saw earlier this year was that market was actually down about 1 or 2%. So, we think that's a good baseline of where the overall market is. But, clearly, we think it's affecting the discretionary, optional surgery areas more than the baseline.</p>
          <p>Regarding Biosense, it's difficult to say. We saw the softness in the stent market, so that we think that there may be people that have been avoiding surgery for a number of reasons, and we're obviously watching it closely to see how it compares later. Finally what I'll say, whenever we're looking at year-to-year comparisons, it's important to remember what happened the previous year that may have impacted the results, and that's certainly the case, I think, on the cardiovascular side of things.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just two quick follow-ups for Dominic. Dominic, maybe you can just catch us up on your latest thoughts about healthcare reform broadly and the Baucus tax proposal, just how concerned and what you think the outcome is there. And last, just on the operating leverage, you showed some very solid P&amp;L given &#x2013; despite the lower sales that I looked for anyway. Can we expect to see the economy to rebound, more dramatic operating leverage as we get into the next couple of years? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sure, Rick, just let me deal with the first question on healthcare reform, just a couple overall comments on healthcare reform. And just to put it in perspective, we obviously are supportive of quality affordable healthcare for all citizens of the United States. But one thing to keep in mind is that the healthcare industry in the U.S. is one of the foremost industries of the United States and leads innovation around the world. So, we're very mindful that some of the changes proposed by the legislation should not have unintended consequences of creating an industry that is less competitive globally.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we are supportive of contributing to the overall cost of healthcare reform. We do favor the Senate Finance Committee version of the proposed change in healthcare reform as compared to the House version. We do think that there is a good mix of appropriate measures in the Senate Finance Committee version of healthcare reform. That includes bipartisan discussions and appropriate industry cooperation, such as the agreement with the pharmaceutical industry, which is included in Senator Baucus's proposal.</p>
          <p>We are concerned, however, you referred to tax. I think you were referring to the medical device fee, which is sometimes referred to in the legislation. We do feel that that's a little unfair today in the way it's crafted. It is a bit excessive, we believe, when you compare it to the industry at large and compare it to other proposals. And we're hopeful that that will moderate a little bit as we move forward with the legislation.</p>
          <p>And then on operating margin improvement, we're very pleased with the way we improved our operating margin throughout the year. As I said many times when we've spoken in the past, we typically don't just cut cost. We actually implement structural changes to the business so that cost containment can be sustained over future periods. So, obviously, as sales improve and as the economy improves, we would expect our ability to maintain our cost in check and continue to enjoy operating leverage as our top line grows, therefore improving, obviously, our bottom line as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Matt Dodds, Citigroup. First, Alex, for you; you showed the slide about the operating margin improvements in MD&amp;D. A lot of your peers &#x2013; when we talk about your <mark type="inaudible" /> your peers haven't seen that kind of leverage. Can you just say broadly, is it coming from SG&amp;A? Is it coming from manufacturing? Where are you showing that difference?</p>
          <p>And then, Dominic, for you, when you look at the fourth quarter impact of Elan, Crucell, and Cougar, $0.06 &#x2013; $0.07, how much of that is one-time versus what should we be thinking about those acquisitions in 2010? Are they still going to be dilutive in 2010 broadly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Matt, I'll handle the first part of that. We believe that's one of the real benefits of J&amp;J scale, is our ability to leverage some of those what we call non-customer facing aspects of our business. So in the G&amp;A area, when you combine all of MD&amp;D, when you look at some of the other leverage that we have in J&amp;J regarding procurement, manufacturing, and other operational be it IT and support functions, we do think that that really gives us a competitive advantage versus many of the competitors we face every day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple comments on the dilutive effect of those three transactions, keep in mind that these were closed later in the year, and so the $0.07 or $0.08 that I'm talking about is actually just a very small component of dilution. Some of that is restructuring charges and those types of costs that are only done upon the initiation of the transaction. But all three of these transactions include significant investment by our company to further the technology that we acquired. We expect that they will also be dilutive in 2010 and until the products are eventually launched.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Matt Miksic from Piper Jaffray; one question for Alex and then a follow-up for Dominic. Following up on Rick's question on volumes, the hip and knee procedures we saw in the quarter, spine, Ethicon, Ethicon Endo, all up sequentially in what normally we think of as a seasonally slow quarter. I'm just wondering; underlying that as you mentioned with sutures, are you seeing volume trends up, or are there other factors driving that business like I'm thinking of mix or price or anything else? Or is it just an underlying volume improvement rather than I think what we've heard from your peers is something more like stability?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matt, what I would say &#x2013; and again let me categorize that we're still working off of second quarter data as we don't have the third quarter data in quite yet. What we've seen in hip and knees is about a halving of the growth rates. That market was growing at around 7 or 8%. We're seeing it growing at around 3 or 4% right now. We've seen some slight softness in price offset by some mix, so overall we're seeing it about flat. I think the way I'd characterize it is we have not seen any additional deterioration in those markets that you mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then a follow-up for Dominic. Thinking about opportunities for investment as you evaluate the benefits and risks across the three businesses that you can plan, and maybe U.S. or OUS, if you could talk a little bit about how you're looking at the benefits and the risks of business development, strategic action in those areas, and maybe if you're seeing any preferences given the environment, given maybe where your availability of cash is if that is a consideration? That would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Matt. I think in terms of preferences, as you know, we're broadly based across the spectrum of healthcare, so we actually don't have a favorite spot necessarily. We're investing, as you have seen us invest over time, in all three segments of the business. We do favor the types of deals that you've seen us do quite frankly, deals where we can acquire new technologies where our expertise and the people of Johnson &amp; Johnson can take the products and the technologies that have developed at some other very fine companies further than perhaps the company alone can take it; so those types of transactions we do favor, and it doesn't matter to us quite frankly whether it's in Pharm, MD&amp;D, or Consumer. Bringing in new technologies that we can exploit is what we try to do.</p>
          <p>In terms of where or how much cash perhaps we would use or how we would invest in the future, our strategy really hasn't changed, even in this particular economic climate. Our strategy is always looking for transactions that will provide significant shareholder value over time, and our definition has remained the same. It's internal rates of return that are sufficiently in excess of our cost of capital to compensate our shareholders for the use of their capital and the amount of sufficient premium over our cost of capital has to do with the risk involved in the transaction. So that is really a disciplined approach to acquisitions and deals quite frankly of Johnson &amp; Johnson, and it hasn't changed for many years, and I think it serves us well as we look at any transaction going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Catherine Arnold with Credit Suisse, a question for you on healthcare reform. In terms of the device tax, could you speak to what your understanding is in regards to the dimension of that in terms of the size of the business? Is there any differentiation as you look across your MD&amp;D business? I think everybody is trying to figure out what exactly this tax is and how it's defined and how it will affect you.</p>
          <p>And then I was hoping you could talk a little bit about with healthcare reform impacting the government as a purchaser for both med devices and pharma, how you guys are thinking about that in terms of commercial cost reduction in those divisions. I would think beyond G&amp;A, there may be opportunities based on the decision making power with government as such as big customer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me say just a few comments on device tax or fee. I have to make sure I get my terminology right on this. If you think about the market to which the device fee pertains to in the U.S., I think it's roughly somewhere in the neighborhood of a $125 billion market in the U.S.; and currently a $4 billion tax or fee is a pretty significant piece of overall revenues in the industry, right? It's about 3 to 4% of the revenues in the industry. If you think about it as a tax, that would be, if you just assume that in the US we pay 35% tax on our earnings, so that translates into almost about an 11-point increase in the US effective tax rate. That's what I meant by I thought our view of this is that it's a bit onerous for the industry no matter which way you look at it. We represent I guess about 7% of the industry, so you can size up the impact it could have on us based on that.</p>
          <p>I think it's a little too early though to model anything like that. I think we want to see it proceed through legislation. We're comfortable that there is enough dialogue with the Senate Finance Committee around this proposal and we're hopeful that actually the fee or the tax will be moderated going forward. Alex, I don't know if you have anything to add.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think Dominic's response is dead on. I think there are still a lot of things in motion. We have to see exactly what classes of devices does this cover, are there going to be any other thresholds involved. We're working closely with trade group partners in this circumstance as well as directly with the White House and people on Capitol Hill. So again, we're hopeful that we can get legislation through that is fair, but it also leaves an environment that's open to innovation and promoting continuous innovation because we still think there is a lot of unmet medical need out there. Some of these could get onerous if taken to the extreme.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you just repeat the second part of your question? I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm trying to evaluate where the cost trends are going really in pharmaceuticals and med devices. I think we have been much talked about in pharma, that the physician has a lower influence on decision-making power. As we &#x2013; assuming healthcare reform goes through and the government is a full-stop larger payor of both medical devices and pharmaceuticals, I would think that in terms of contracts and formularies and the like, there may be a lower influence that a sales representative or marketing program can make. So, are we talking about opportunity that is noteworthy in your mind of the pharma cost and your med device costs on the commercial side? I'm not going to try to put words in your mouth, but I'm just trying to get a directional sense of &#x2013; is there an opportunity for a reasonably material percentage decline in commercial costs as you look out over the next three to five years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand that, and maybe you can take it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For devices... Okay, I'll start with on the device side. I think clearly we're feeling increasing pricing pressure on the MD&amp;D side, and I think that's part of what's going on in the economy. That's a part of consolidation of payors, of all the dynamics that you just mentioned.</p>
          <p>Regarding the shift in decision making from surgeon to payor to hospital, we're seeing some of that in some cases. We're seeing where the hospital is taking on an increasing role in determining what products may or may not be available. However, what we see in most cases is that in working with them, again, taking the breadth of Johnson &amp; Johnson, working together across our entire portfolio of products, it's important to maintain access, but also to ensure that physicians do have some choice because we think there is a lot of patient variation. We think it's important for them to have a say-so in that overall decision. And that's what we see happening, basically, is decisions being made by teams of doctors, hospital administrators, and other payors overall on the decision. So, where that ultimately ends up I think is difficult to predict. I think it's going to be important for us and for the industry to respond in a way that accounts for that with our commercial model.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to close the loop then, why would it not be more reasonable than not to expect that commercial costs come down? What would be the counter argument why given the change in the model in the United States?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it depends how things evolve. I think things like continuing medical education, training programs for physicians, particularly on new instrumentation, and it's where I see the device industry being different than pharma, where there is clearly a need for ongoing training because of the hands-on nature of the use of some of the products that we have. So, I think you may see shifts in some of the investments from one area to another. But, I still think that you're going to need to have an appropriate level of investment to be able to introduce and educate on the new technologies, but clearly, there will be a shift from some areas to others.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Catherine, just to keep in mind, we're obviously always looking at the appropriate mix of our cost structure, and we're going through that right now with our business planning cycle, and so it would be a little premature for us to comment to what extent, et cetera. But obviously we see what could happen in the future given healthcare reform. We're taking that into consideration as we plan our future business plans. And honestly, when we talk to you about guidance going into 2010, the early part of 2010, we can give you some more insight into that as we finalize our decisions. Okay?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question. I think in most of our strategic models, we've been fairly conservative on our pricing assumptions. We realize that we're likely to face increasing pressures going forward, and that's why we think it's more and more important to provide this continuous stream of new product innovations. I was talking today about whether it's line extensions or brand-new technologies. And so I think that's where our greatest emphasis is. Obviously, we're going to have to adapt our commercial model, as we talked about earlier, as well. But we're projecting fairly conservative view of repricing in the markets.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Yes, of course we don't give fourth quarter guidance, but it's pretty hard not to give that when you have three quarters in and we gave you guidance for the year. We feel pretty comfortable at the midpoint of that 4.54 to 4.59 for the year.</p>

          <p>Okay. Let me ask while I'm up a couple pharma tips or products; one, COMFYDE, if you could just update us on what your expectation is there; and then ZEFTERA or ceftobiprole, was there any FDA resubmission there? What's the timeline?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, Dominic, let me ask you the big picture question. In 2009 in Washington, your discussion was all around healthcare reform, and you're being asked to pony up across your healthcare businesses and your pharmaceutical and device businesses to pay for that. How concerned are you that that's the 2009 discussion, and the 2010 discussion is tax reform. And then as multinational U.S. company, you're going to be asked to pony up in 2011 in terms of a higher corporate tax rate for being a multinational U.S. company? Do you take a hit? Do you basically end up having to give in 2010 because you're a healthcare company and then give in 2011 because multinational company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is obviously a concern, Mike. It's a great question. I can tell you that you probably saw the headline in front of The Wall Street Journal today that apparently the administration is backing off on the elimination of deferral for multinational corporations. I would say that we've seen this be a bit of a see-saw situation. It was originally proposed by the President in his budget proposal earlier in the year. Many of us were in Washington describing what a significant impact it would have to the global competitiveness of U.S. multinationals. And then obviously that would end up having a negative impact on U.S. employment. The administration seemed to back away from that in terms of a pay-for for healthcare reform. It looks like that is not direct pay-for in healthcare reform.</p>
          <p>I do think there is still concern amongst the industry at large that once broader tax reform discussions take place after healthcare reform is a bit behind us that this may again become an area of discussion with the administration. We're hopeful that we'll still have the open dialogue that we had with them earlier in the year because we do think it would obviously impact negatively the global competitiveness of U.S. corporations should the U.S. tax burden increase for our businesses simply because we happen to be doing business outside the U.S., where we are a global competitor. So it's still a very valid concern amongst industry.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David Lewis, Morgan Stanley, just a few quick ones here. Dominic, I felt today you made more specific comments on capital deployment, and maybe it signifies a change. But clearly you pulled back on share buybacks and you're increasing your investment in external investments through strategics, so some may infer from that J&amp;J sees more opportunities outside the company than inside the company. Can you talk about why that would not be the case, and are there certain triggers that could cause you to reverse that process by deploying capital internally versus externally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it's a particular sign either way. I think we have been very consistent over time, David, that we prefer organic growth first and we invest heavily in organic growth. We're pleased with the pipeline we have developed in Pharmaceuticals; and as Alex described today, the pipeline that's developing in medical devices as well. We supplement that always with external collaborations where we believe there is something that another entity has that we could take further than that entity has in its own hands. And finally, we overlay that with strategic acquisitions. I think the timing of that depends on what's available in the marketplace and what our view of the technology is. I don't want to give you any signal we changed our overall strategy on priority investing in organic growth first, supplemented with licensing and partnerships, and then add on strategic acquisitions where they make sense.</p>

          <p>And Dominic, now that we have stabilization in the core business, specifically with generic headwinds beginning to ease, what have you seen so far for the first three quarters of 2009 that gives you the confidence that you can hold or fix the cost infrastructure so that we do see top line acceleration in '10? Are you going to see material leverage? Are there two or three things you could point to in terms of dynamics on fixing that cost infrastructure this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. The one thing I would say is that the business overall and our business leaders like Alex and the folks that run the businesses actually are very in tune with creating cost structures that are sustainable over the long term. We don't typically cut cost. We typically restructure, rearrange our business, reconfigure the business to have sustainable cost structures. We have much more improvements now in technology infrastructure, which is becoming to be important leverage point for us going forward. You've heard me talk about all of our standardization efforts. They are actually gearing up, and we've employed the various shared service centers around the globe to allow us to then when we have more volume, to administer that volume at much less cost. I think all of those things combined give me confidence that we'll be able to maintain robust margins going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Alex, maybe just one last quick question for you. As you think about the AF franchise, in the last 18 months it appears that Biosense has been maybe a net share loser as opposed to a gainer. Do you agree with that statement? Do you see increased economic pressure within Biosense, and what are implications for CARTO 3? Could that start becoming an accelerant for this business or the ability to gain share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think that the share actually has been pretty steady based upon all of our reports. And I think that any of the challenges that they have been experiencing have been more macroeconomic versus competitive. And we're actually quite excited about the CARTO 3 launch and the change and the improvement that it will offer both patients and physicians. We feel very confident and optimistic about that business.</p>
          <p>There is one comment I would make really to pick up on one of Dominic's. I think that as he said, obviously we are all focused on being as cost conscious as we can be. But at the same time, I think it's important to note that we think it's really important to be able to invest in growth opportunities, as I discussed today. If you take a look at the for example clinical development program for NEVO, it's quite extensive. We're excited about the early data that we have on that product. When you combine it with the other additional studies that we plan to have at launch, when you look at the development program behind the Fibrin Pad, we think that that's truly one of a kind for a hemostat in the way it can change things; SEDASYS, the investment. So there are a lot of examples why we're managing in certain areas. We want to make sure that we can invest in other areas to produce the kind of long-term growth that we were describing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo, two questions. First for Dominic, the full-year organic sales guidance implies an acceleration in the fourth quarter, if my math is correct, to about 4% on the low end, constant currency growth. First, is my math right and what's driving that? Are you expecting the Pharma and Consumer businesses to accelerate? That's my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're absolutely right. If you do the math, we should see a positive fourth quarter in terms of &#x2013; even on a constant currency basis. There are two factors. There are some launches that we've talked about that are now going to obviously see much more acceleration in the fourth quarter than we're currently seeing because they have just been recently launched. We talked earlier last year; we have a 53-week year. So this fourth quarter will actually have actually more days of sales than we had in the third quarter, so that will add to the operational growth. And that has been included in the guidance we've been giving all year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the med tech fee or tax, is there any chance you see that being pushed out to 2013 when you can get the volume offset? And second, if it's reduced, let's say, in half to 2 billion a year, what is your ability to offset that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll ask Alex also to comment. I think, obviously, we're hopeful it will be reduced. I think that the unusual part of the legislation is that the costs that are being asked of the industry to contribute are not offset by increased patient volumes until much later, right? So, we've obviously had lots of dialogue about that with the administration. I think both are valid points that we've raised. It's not our expectation, though, that it will be delayed. Our expectation is that it will be at whatever appropriate level is eventually enacted, it will be enacted in the near term. Alex, do you agree with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I completely agree with Dominic's comments. I think we're working hard right now with <mark type="inaudible" /> and others to make sure that we really explain what could potentially be unintended consequences from some aspects of the pending legislation. In just the areas that you mentioned, as far as the timing, as far as what's included, what's not included, I still think there are some moving pieces, and we'll see how it all comes together. But, we're hopeful that we can make some additional headway there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of offsetting that, I think similar to the comment that Catherine raised and I'll have to answer it the same way, which is we're going through the process now. It would be premature for us to comment. We want to focus our attention on getting it right with the administration first. And then we'll take the appropriate steps and we'll obviously advise you of that when we're ready to do it so.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. With respect for everyone's time, we'll take two more questions. Bruce?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, it's Erik Schneider for Bruce Nudell from UBS. First on ASPs in ortho, you described your view going forward as conservative with respect to pure price. I Do you still expect that the mix benefits in the U.S. and/or outside the U.S. will offset those price pressures? Do you expect it to stay even? Do you expect it to be a benefit just forward-looking, and also your expectations for sustainable worldwide unit growth in major <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Erik, what I would say is that in terms of mix, we do think that there will be an opportunity for a positive impact of mix, but we do think that the technology and the innovation required to demonstrate that positive mix is going to be increasingly challenging. So we see a net positive from mix. Whether it will offset the entire price is yet to be determined. We'll have to see how pricing evolves. But from what we're seeing now, if we continue to offer improvements in whether it's knees, hips, spine, other areas, there can be an offset in mix that we're seeing in at least the recent quarters and we would project that going forward.</p>
          <p>Regarding overall unit volume, it's difficult to say, but if we look at this past year, we do think that the macroeconomic issues have had an impact and that can range from people not wanting to step out of their job or workplace and be out of work for an extended period of time. It can be over concern over insurance coverage. And outside the United States, it can actually be the result of increasing queues as governments try to tighten their budgets and rein in some of their healthcare spending.</p>
          <p>We don't think fundamentally that the unmet medical need, the need for knees and hips has changed. And so, we do think that it will return to somewhat of a more normal state once we get through this current economic period, but that's a projection on our part. But, we don't see any other factors that would suggest that the underlying rate of replacement for those types of procedures would change.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then Louise or Dominic, with respect to XARELTO, which I think you expect to file in the fourth quarter, are you waiting for the Einstein-Extension data for that or are you comfortable before seeing that with the bleeding profile of the product?</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, it's Tao Levy from Deutsche Bank. I just want to be clear on the inventory stocking and impact from healthcare reform. Do you see any changes in the quarter on hospital behavior specifically in the third quarter?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't seen noticeable changes at that level.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great, and also PCI volumes were very challenged this quarter. Is there anything that happened here in the third quarter in the overall markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was down 2% in second quarter. Louise talked about down 6 or 7% this quarter. That's compared to about a 4% rate I believe, growth rate in prior quarters. Again, we believe it's due to the more macroeconomic conditions. There could be some anomalies compared to year to year comparisons because of data releases in previous years. That is our best thinking at this point.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Louise, and thank you, Alex, for a terrific review of MD&amp;D portfolio. Let me just offer these final thoughts. We continue to invest in our broad base of healthcare businesses with a long-term view, and we focus on innovation and continue to make progress in bringing our pipeline of products to the market.</p>
          <p>We recognize these are challenging factors today and the environment remains challenging, but we remain financially strong, disciplined, and focused when developing and executing plans that will keep us well positioned for long-term growth. I'm confident in our ability to innovate and execute on the growth opportunities we see thanks to the dedication and focus of the talented people across the Johnson &amp; Johnson family of companies. I look forward to updating you on our full-year 2009 results when we meet with you in January. Thanks very much and have a great day.</p>
