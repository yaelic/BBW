        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of BASF, I would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2008 conference call. BASF started with a record first quarter into the year. With me on the call today are Dr. Kurt Bock our Chief Financial Officer; and Manfredo R&#xFC;bens President of BASF Finance Division.</p>
          <p>First, Dr. Bock will discuss the BASF performance in the first quarter of this year and afterwards both gentlemen will be available to take your questions.</p>
          <p>Just the usual reminder today's conference call is limited to one hour since our Annual General Meeting is starting right after the call. So therefore I would please ask you to limit your questions to only one at a time. We have posted all the numbers in the charts which will be discussed this morning as well as the press document on our website at basf.com/share.</p>
          <p>With this I would like to hand the presentation over to Dr. Bock.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks Maggie and welcome to everybody. BASF has made a powerful start to the year with new first quarter records for sales and earnings. Sales rose 9% to &#x20AC;15.9 billion. EBIT before special items amounted to &#x20AC;2.4 billion, 11% above the level of previous year's first quarter. We increased earnings per share by 19% to &#x20AC;2.48. Cash provided by operating activities amounted to almost &#x20AC;1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>In the first three months of this year we spent &#x20AC;743 million on share repurchases and have thus completed almost 90% of our &#x20AC;3 billion share buyback program announced for 2007 and 2008.</p>
          <p>These are excellent results especially in the light of the current turmoil in the financial markets. Even more importantly, our confident outlook for the full year remains unchanged.</p>
          <p>Let me now take you through BASF performance in the first quarter of 2008 in more detail. We were able to raise volumes and prices in all our business segments overall by 8 and 7% respectively. While Oil &amp; Gas and Agricultural Solutions demonstrated the highest volume growth, it is important to note that there was no softening in markets for other chemical activities with two exceptions automotive and construction in the US. BASF's strong organic growth of 15% was partially offset by the weak US dollar and related currencies, which continue to impact sales negatively by more than 6%. Overall, portfolio changes had no effect on first quarter sales.</p>
          <p>The first quarter EBIT before special items were also &#x20AC;2.4 billion, an increase of 11% compared with the same period of last year. Net special charges amounted to &#x20AC;51 million and were mainly related to restructuring measures which are temporarily accounted for in "Other" until they are allocated to the relevant business segments in the course of the year.</p>
          <p>The financial result declined to minus &#x20AC;122 million for minus &#x20AC;94 million in the first quarter of 2007 due to lower market valuation of derivatives. Income before taxes and minority interest amounted to nearly &#x20AC;2.2 billion, up 14%.</p>
          <p>The tax rate was 41% compared with 40% in the first quarter of 2007. As stated before, for the full year, we expect our underlying tax rate after deduction of non-compensable taxes on oil production to be slightly above last year's figure of 23%.</p>
          <p>Non-compensable foreign income taxes for oil production rose by 200 million to &#x20AC;458 million. The major reason was the much higher oil price in 2008. An increase of &#x20AC;57 billion was due to the German Corporate Tax Reform that now implies a nominal corporate income tax of 15%. Therefore, the proportion of non-compensable foreign taxes rose.</p>
          <p>Monitory interests amounted to &#x20AC;113 million and were primarily related to our partners in the Oil &amp; Gas and the chemical segment.</p>
          <p>Net income rose by 13% to almost &#x20AC;1.2 billion, earnings per share climbed 19% to &#x20AC;2.48 as said before, supported by our strong and continued share buyback program.</p>
          <p>I am now turning to the segment performance. Our Q1 interim report provides detailed information on our newly structured segments, so I will only focus on the most important highlights and changes compared with the first quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>In Chemicals, strong sales growth was supported by all divisions. Earnings decreased slightly due to lower cracker margins as a result of higher raw material costs, which we could not pass on immediately.</p>
          <p>Inorganics posted significantly higher earnings, thanks to higher margins. In the second quarter, planned turnarounds will affect earnings in this segment by a low double-digit number.</p>
          <p>Together with our partner SINOPEC, we have completed the feasibility study for a $900 million investment in our joint Verbund site in Nanjing. This expansion marks a significant step forward in meeting increased domestic market demand in China. The new activities are expected to come on stream stepwise starting already this year.</p>
          <p>Earnings in the Plastics segment rose significantly due to the strong performance of polyurethanes. Earnings in this division increased as a result of persistently robust demand and higher production volumes of TDI. Planned turnarounds will affect earnings in the Polyurethanes division in the second quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>In Performance Polymers, earnings did not reach last year's level. In the first quarter of 2007 the foams business which was part of the Styrenics division until the end of last year, benefited from strong demand for thermal insulation products on the construction sector, thanks to the mild winter.</p>
          <p>As part of our approach to focus on the core business of the polyamide value chain in the Performance Polymers division we have announced plans to sell the Seal Sands site to INEOS, that's based in the UK. The site produces chemical intermediates used in the production for acrylic and polyimide fiber as well as for ABS and polyamide plastics.</p>
          <p>Performance product posted slightly lower sales in the first quarter mainly due to the divesture of the lysine and premix businesses. Earnings growth was driven by Care Chemicals, which increased prices for vitamins and reduced fixed cost as a result of our restructuring efforts. Persistently high raw material costs and overcapacities continued to put pressure on margins for acrylic monomers.</p>
          <p>In Functional Solution our new segment that bundles mainly products and systems solutions for the automotive and construction industries, sales rose 5% despite negative currency effects of 8%. Catalysts showed strong sales and earnings growth. Sales and earnings in Construction Chemicals and Coatings were impacted by weaker demand, mainly in North America.</p>
          <p>In Agricultural Solutions a good start into the season in the northern hemisphere triggered strong volume growth of 10%. Disregarding negative currency effect of minus 6%, sales increased by 11%. In a positive market environment with high commodity prices, earnings in the first quarter rose to an even greater extent despite negative currency effects.</p>
          <p>In Europe and South America our business developed excellently especially due to strong demand for fungicides. Growth in the Americas and Asia was offset by negative currency effects.</p>
          <p>In the oil and gas segment sales increased as a result of higher prices and higher volumes in Exploration and Production to which the Siberian Yuzhno Russkoye gas field is already contributing significantly.</p>
          <p>Volumes in Natural Gas Trading were also up compared with the first quarter of 2007, the average price of Brent crude increased by 67% to about $97 per barrel. In euro terms this corresponds to an increase of 47% to approximately &#x20AC;65 per barrel.</p>
          <p>Income from operations increased due to a higher contribution from E&amp;P, whereas the gas trading business was negatively impacted by time lag effects for the fourth consecutive quarter. Last year first quarter earnings in gas trading also profited from additional spot market opportunities.</p>
          <p>Starting with the first quarter 2008, we will also provide you with an income statement for Oil and Gas segment in order to increase transparency on that business especially following the assets swap with Gazprom.</p>
          <p>Despite an improved EBIT, net income remained below last year's first quarter. The reason is our lower gas trading profit combined with a much higher income tax on oil production.</p>
          <p>Income before first special items of "Other" improved by &#x20AC;63 million to minus &#x20AC;135 million. This was due mainly to higher contributions from the commodities styrenics and fertilizer businesses. In addition, earnings of "Other" contained positive foreign currency results from hedging not allocated to the segments as well as lower costs for BASF's option program due to the lower value of the options, following the decline of our share price in 2008.</p>
          <p>And now turning to the regional results. In the first quarter of this year all regions increased EBIT before special items. In Europe we increased sales by 14% and EBIT before special items by 12% mainly due to Chemicals and Oil &amp; Gas which benefited from the production start in the Yuzhno Russkoye gas field. Sales in Europe excluding Oil &amp; Gas increased by 7%.</p>
          <p>In North America sales decreased in euro terms but increased by 9% in dollar terms. The slight increase in EBIT before special items was primarily driven by Plastics. Sales in Asia Pacific rose by 7% in euro terms and by 17% in local currency terms. Earnings increased by 8% mainly as a result of higher earnings contributions from Plastics and Performance Products.</p>
          <p>In South America, Africa and Middle East sales rose by 10% in euro terms and by 18% in local currency terms. Earnings increased by 43%. In this region, Agricultural Solutions especially posted strongly improved earnings. Business also developed positively in the Construction Chemicals and Coatings division.</p>
          <p>I will now briefly discuss our cash flow statement. Cash provided by operating activities increased to almost &#x20AC;1.1 billion. In particular this increase resulted from freeing up funds used in net working capital compared with the first quarter of 2007. Strict working capital management continues to pay off. Days of inventory invested were 37 in the first quarter compared with 39 in the same period of 2007. Days of sales outstanding, the ratio that gives an indication of how long it takes us to us collect our accounts receivable, were 53 days compared with 54 days last year.</p>
          <p>Cash used in investing activities amounted to &#x20AC;415 million, compared with &#x20AC;486 million in the first quarter of last year. BASF spend &#x20AC;463 million on additions on tangible and intangible assts. Which again was significantly below the corresponding depreciation and amortization.</p>
          <p>In the first three quarters of the year, we've repurchased more than 8.4 million shares for &#x20AC;743 million. This corresponds to an average price of about &#x20AC;88 per share. As of today, we have spent almost &#x20AC;2.7 billion on share buybacks since we announced our &#x20AC;3 billion share buyback program in early 2007, and we plan to continue to repurchase further shares after completing the current program. Net debt amounted to &#x20AC;9.5 billion at the end of the first quarter. The equity ratio was 42%.</p>
          <p>I'm now finishing with our outlook for 2008. Our outlook for 2008 is based on the following adjusted economic assumptions. We continue to expect global economic growth and chemical production growth of 2.8% in 2008. We have raised our assumption for the average price of Brent crude to $90 per barrel up from $78 per barrel previously. We have also adjusted our forecast for the average dollar/euro exchange rate to $1.50 per euro.</p>
          <p>Based on our good start in the first quarter, we confirm our outlook for the full year. Assuming there are no changes to our portfolio or the basic assumptions I just mentioned, we aim to increase sales and improve EBIT before special items slightly in 2008.</p>
          <p>Thanks for your attention and we are now pleased to answer your questions.</p>

          <p>Excuse me. This is the Chorus Call conference operator. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah and the first question comes from Michael Eastwood, followed by Rhian Tucker. Good morning, Michael.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for taking the question. It's a question about prices generally. Can you talk about ACT prices up 1% obviously that's good in the context of history, but perhaps at a time when you've got better demand than ever. Are you seeing pre-buying, do you think that price increase of 1% is sustainable? And similarly across other areas, vitamin pricing, do you think that's sustainable? And finally on acrylic acid pricing, you talked about, I think halfway through last year that you felt that feasibly the market had settled down, clearly that's not the case. Could you give perhaps an outlook on acrylic acid prices for the year, if you any? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks Mike, I think these were four questions not one, but I'll answer every one of them. Let's start with ACT we had a positive first quarter, that's how we see it. We had very strong amount in fungicides we could raise prices slightly -- could you here me? I am just listening to some music here on the line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very nice.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's okay? So, we have a very strong fungicide business, we could raise prices slightly. The price effect also includes partly a currency effect which we cannot completely separate. So, overall when you look at the respective markets, I think we were up even higher than the 1% mentioned before.</p>
          <p>Vitamin prices, yes vitamin prices have gone up very nicely. This is going to continue, that depends very much on supply and demand and that particular business what we see right now there is no reason for us to be concerned. It looks like for our Chinese competitors have second thoughts about their production, quality and the way they run their plants. And there is simply less supply today than there used to be one or two years ago. So, we think this is sustainable for quite some time. But more importantly, you know that we have changed and shifted our portfolio in that area, quite dramatically. Basically, we are now focusing on the citral value chain, which is highly attractive for BASF.</p>
          <p>Acrylic monomers, your observation is correct, we have talked about this now for at least four quarters, always talking about the bottom. I think we are still -- simply stated, we are still at the bottom. We don't see the situation improving and Asia is really our headache, United States or North America and Europe is more or less balanced in terms of supply and demand, but we can not see any indication that the situation of Asia should turn around positively in the near future. Does that answer your questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very well, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question from Rhian Tucker.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask a question on Polyurethanes, I was surprised by your comments on strong demand for these products. As far as I understand, Polyurethanes feed mainly into furniture with a little bit into automotive and construction as well. Could you take us through a little bit where that Polyurethane growth is coming from by region, and if possible which areas you are seeing that strong demand from? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's one -- that's very specific obviously, what we've just seen so far in Polyurethanes is across the board, quite a healthy demand and I think, again your observation is quite correct. We are delivering into certain areas like furniture, which are softening right now, in the United States for instance. But overall, we could improve these volumes. We don't know about our market share that's simply too early to tell. But we had a healthy business across the globe, for instance, MDI in China developed very nicely as well, our Caojing plant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry and so this strong demand is coming from all areas...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Not just furniture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We cannot separate any particular region, which hedge, let's say, much stronger than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The third question is coming from Neil Tyler.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, morning. Thanks for taking the question. Firstly with regards to your working capital, you mentioned a couple of ratios on the asset side, but you also mentioned that liabilities had increased substantially. I wondered if you could give us perhaps an outlook for how you see that developing over the remainder of the year? And also to what extent that relates to the crop protection business? And whether there is any risk you perceive attached to those liabilities?</p>
          <p>And the other part of the question is with regard to turnarounds, you mentioned two things. Firstly that there was an impact from the Port Arthur turnaround in Q1. And secondly that there will be a polyurethane turnaround in Q2. And I wonder if you could perhaps give us some sort of qualitative or quantitative comment on what the impact of the EBIT number was on each of those or might be of each of those? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's start with working capital you know that we have pretty strict working capital management in place. If your question is, do we see any indication of a looming risk on our customer side that is actually not the case. We are very carefully monitoring all our data available, whether our customers are being on time, although there are late payers. We haven't seen really any change here which is for us to note. Liabilities, there is one special effect in 2006.</p>
          <p>We had higher or less accounts payable in the first quarter in 2008 simply because we had to pay in the first quarter of 2007 Oil &amp; Gas related invoices. So it's kind of a technical effect you might say, but overall we are quite happy with our work in capital management.</p>
          <p>Crop protection, you asked more specifically any looming risk there? You know that we are very, very careful how we approach our market, we have -- especially in South America, we have very strict guidelines with regards to payment terms and we have not changed that. Actually we walked away from potential sales late last year, but also early this quarter because we felt uncomfortable with certain customers and we really tried to focus on what we call high-quality customers and that might explain the volume increase which we have shown. So we see no particular risk in crop protection.</p>
          <p>Turnaround, it was a small, double-digit effect in Q1 and we see a similar effect in Q2. It's simply too early to become more specific, because we know turnarounds there are scheduled and unscheduled turnarounds and we put special emphasis this year on reducing the number of unscheduled turnarounds, that's a major corporate initiative right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very helpful. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Robert Bart.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, <mark type="inaudible" /> speaking. Perhaps two questions one is still regarding the "Other" line where we always have a little bit of problems to see for the full year -- the figure. So, can you perhaps give a little bit of guidance for that? And second is on the disposal of Styrenics business. Can you assure the old plan to dispose that during the year? And perhaps can you confirm that you are speaking still exclusively with one potential buyer or do you have already talks with different buyers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I would start with the Styrenics question and then my colleague Manfredo will talk about "Other". In Styrenics, I think we provide now all the information because it's part of "Other" as you have seen. We are clearly determined to sell that business unit, we are still negotiating and as you know, it's pretty difficult to comment any negotiations, which is still going on. So I simply have to ask you for a little patience but we are quite optimistic. And Manfredo will answer the "Other" question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the "Other", we will basically maintain our guidance that we also gave earlier that "Other" will be probably on a per quarter basis be around 140 to 150 million negative. "Other" is very difficult to predict because we have a couple of valuation topics on there, so there is a quite bit of a volatility, so you shouldn't look too closely to the quarter development, but on average we believe we are going to be at about 140 to 150 million. And that does include about 60 million of the corporate cost that we start not to allocate any more to the "Other" segments or -- but we have readjusted those numbers backwards.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I only could add is that quarter guidance you gave is that also considering that you were after mid of the year changing the stock option plan expenses or gains then to this segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's why I said, don't look too closely to the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because we had one procedure that we followed last year, we tried to be more up to date also with the allocation to the segments this year. Now, it's very difficult to predict especially this piece on the BASF option program, because it has to do with the development of the share price. So, that's basically all I can tell you there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. Two questions please. One, Dr. Bock you mentioned that the growth in North America in EBIT was primarily due to plastics. I was wondering what happened to the agri chemicals business EBIT in North America year-on-year. Second question, <mark type="inaudible" /> you mentioned a decline there, is that do you think future market share loss or is that the market is weak?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Themis, EBIT North America for agro was up if I remember correctly, we have pretty good business especially in fungicides. We are not really that well positioned in North America in herbicides. But that is I think well known. Our heavy duty catalysts, these are quarterly <mark type="inaudible" /> so to say, about business development. It really depends what kind of contracts and models you win and we are very optimistic right now because I think we have a pretty good products engine, new innovations in the pipeline. Talk about market share, I wouldn't really base it on a quarterly observation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would the same comment apply for the sales because I think if I do the calculation, if it's correct, if you strip out the metal trading business, sales actually didn't grow much &#x2013; seemed to be more nearly flat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you have to consider that Catalysts is heavily, heavily influenced by the dollar exchange rate effect. It's still primarily a US-based production base &#x2013; with production obviously in other countries in which are <mark type="inaudible" /> South Africa and Asia and relatively small share in Europe and that affects immediately the nominal sales number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Sophie Jourdier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Morning. Just first of all, you've obviously had a very solid first quarter across your -- most of your industrial activities across the world really. Just wondering whether you could comment specifically in Europe how you are seeing your main end markets, so automotive construction and electronics, going into the second quarter just in terms of demand levels?</p>
          <p>And then secondly just on share buybacks you bought back 743 million in the first quarter, a very higher number clearly quite close to the end of your 3 billion and you are committing to continuing that. But just in terms of -- is the 700 odd million a sort of level that, excluding any acquisitions, you would look to continue? Just a sort of idea on the share buybacks to continue? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In Europe we have seen strong amount across all businesses. The only thing I can say I mean we have been looking at, I think, our customers very intensively how business going and the feedback we get so far is still very positive and that's the reason why we stick with our outlook. And you remember that when we published our fourth quarter numbers, we got a little bit beaten up because we were perceived to be too optimistic. But at that point in time we were basically seeing that same development which we are seeing today, though, so there hasn't been any change since February, early March timeframe. And we believe that Europe is well positioned to grow in 2008.</p>
          <p>The dollar exchange rate might have an effect at some point in time. We don't see it yet, orders books of our customers seem to be full. We don't see any pre-buying, if that is your question, I mean who wants to pre-buy at the current price levels? If somebody would expect a cooling off of the economy, so there is no rational reason to buy early. And yet those are all reasons why we are quite optimistic for Europe in 2008.</p>
          <p>Your second question about the share buyback program, now having bought back approximately 700 million in one quarter is this a, let's say, a yardstick for the coming quarter that's too early say. I mean we will continue to buy back stock. We will complete this three billion program obviously much faster than and as we said it will take two years, probably it will take less than 1.5 years and then we will continue. And if I remember correctly since 1990 when we started the buyback program we have always been buying back our own stock and that will also be the case in the future. And we are -- as you know we are financially flexible to adapt us to the needs externally and internally.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Christian Faitz.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Christian Faitz from Oppenheim. Just quickly coming back to North America, your construction chemicals and coatings activities I believe car coatings are weak as you mentioned. How do you see this business currently and how do you see 2008 and maybe even 2009 faring for those activities in North America if you have a view on that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the million dollar question. How do we see US economy? We see a slowdown and there is no doubt and I don't really want to go into the question whether it's a recession or not. I think it's something to see -- we have clear signs of recessionary trends. Automotive and Construction definitely -- there is a big debate going on whether this is a V-shaped or U-shaped development, too early to tell. In construction at least we see I think a pretty weak development for the entire year 2008; that might be a conservative statement, maybe we get a surprise on the positive side. But what we see to date there is definitely no strengthening of the market. Q1 had been soft -- was soft. April so far is pretty much in line with what we have expected to happen, so no further surprises. But again those two areas, automotive and construction in United States will remain sluggish throughout 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I remember correctly, the construction business the old SKW and Degussa Construction business was geared towards infrastructure rather than home building. Would you see a relief on that side out of Asia still? I mean does Construction Chemicals' Asian growth over compensate a weak North American business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good question. We have a pretty good Asian business actually we are marketing in some areas there and Asia including Middle East is still going very, very strongly. It's also correct, we have a substantial infrastructure business. However, the share of the infrastructure business is smaller than the combined share of residential and commercial construction. And in residential construction in North America we definitely see no turnaround at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Oliver Sha.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. It concerns the outlook. You've changed your scenario but maintain your outlook for the full year. If I have to take the sensitivities that were published in last year's fact-book, I would say that given the change in inputs from the US dollar and crude oil prices, you would benefit by roughly 300 million on your EBIT line, but still you maintain your outlook. Does this indicate that you are, let's say, more reluctant in regards to margin development of your other businesses, which is chemicals, plastics and so on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the one question we had expected when we talked about our outlook internally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's okay. I think your observation is correct at least mathematically. But again when you prepare an outlook, this is not a purely mathematical exercise; you really look at your markets, your customers, the overall development. And as you know, by definition, we are conservative and cautious people. We don't want to disappoint anybody. So, we don't make this a mathematical exercise. We really try to understand what could happen. We increased the oil price from 78 to 90, that is a positive for oil and gas obviously. The dollar exchange rate is a slight negative. And you might come to the conclusion that now we have become a little bit more conservative. Given the overall situation, first economy which we are facing, I don't think so. We are still working extremely hard the entire team to achieve not just higher sales, but slightly improved EBIT in 2008 which given the record numbers of 2007, is a I think very, very challenging, but also achievable target for BASF.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question from Ronald K&#xF6;hler.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello. I have a question regarding oil and gas, you now nicely provide this oil and gas income statement and with the obviously EBIT up, net income down. And we just discussed, you revised upwards your assumptions. Before you were guiding for oil and gas for flat, EBIT with the $78 per barrel. Now, you have not updated that guidance actually. The question is everyone now would expect an increase in EBIT, do you think it's possible to have a flat net income during the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In oil and gas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oil and gas, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, I mean that is purely a question of our initial gas business, how it will develop and we have now, as I said in my little speech, we have now four consecutive weak quarters because we have these damn timing effects. We do pricing of our natural gas to our customers in Western Europe because the oil price continues to go up and up and up. We see this slightly easening into the second quarter. And second quarter has lower volumes as we all know than the first quarter because it has milder temperatures, but we believe that this timing effect should disappear during the course of 2008 that should have a positive impact on our natural gas numbers. And frankly, in EMP the next version of production is simply a function of the oil price, but you also know that we have in some areas of the world, that we have production sharing agreements, which basically cap our profits, net income wise above a certain oil price. We still make a small margin, but the margins decline when the oil price goes up, quite dramatically in some areas like North Africa, we have achieved that point meaning that a higher oil price normally, increases EBIT, but really doesn't really drive down too much money to our bottom line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But with the new oil price assumption then you're going for at least flatter net income, if I understand that rightly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what we are certainly trying to achieve. What I didn't mention, Mr.  K&#xF6;hler, is that we have higher minority interests now in our business as well because we have increased as a share of Gazprom in our Vilnius operations and Gazprom also now has participation in the proceeds of our North African &#x2013; or parts of our North African oil and gas operations. So that increase is basically, their minority interest and also their earnings participation.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Jenny Barker.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just following on from that point you said that in certain areas of the world, you've got these production sharing agreements that cap profits above a certain oil price. Is that effectively true in Yuzhno Russkoye as well? I mean obviously, a very different set of specific arrangements with your partner there, but economically, is that also the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jenny, it's important to note here, if I said it's capped, it's not completely capped do we still have the margin with the margin declines if the oil price goes above certain levels. And Yuzhno Russkoye, I'm not aware of any cap with regard to our economic benefit in that project as I said before, Yuzhno Russkoye has already contributed significantly and positively in the first quarter, which I think is a good message taking into account that that field has only recently started up.</p>

          <p>Last question from Themis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a question on strategy. I think, Dr. Bock, you repeatedly said you will be looking for acquisitions and opportunities at least that chemical companies share prices have come down significantly. Do you see the environment for M&amp;A becoming more conducive, and do you think the weakening dollar presents an additional opportunity to look at US assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First answer it is yes. It becomes more conducive because simply valuations have come down but as you know in this field we play our cards very close to our chest. We have been and you know as well Themis, we have been looking at acquisition targets again and again and again, and we walked away in most case because even if we had strategic fits good strategic fits we were -- most times simply not willing to offer the expected prices and that now becomes at least theoretically more attractive in 2008. I'm also eager to see what's happening in the let's say sector, which is denominated by financials sponsors. There are a couple of assets held by those companies and it would be really interesting to see how they will fare in 2008.</p>
          <p>The dollar, that is really not a primary concern and when we acquire a company we basically finance the acquisition with the respective currency so Engelhard was financed with US dollars. So, we see, let's say, a balance sheet effect if you have a lower dollar exchange rate you consolidate those activities at a lower exchange rate. That's kind of a advantage but that's not really an economic factor we take into account making up our mind whether we should go after a target. Meaning at the end, the dollar doesn't make the US a particular field for acquisition simply because the dollar became weak.</p>
