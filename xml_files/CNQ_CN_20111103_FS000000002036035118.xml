          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Canadian Natural Resources 2011 Third Quarter Results Conference Call. Slides for this conference call are available to view with the webcast and in PDF format at www.cnrl.com.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. John Langille, Vice Chairman of Canadian Natural Resources. Please go ahead, Mr. Langille.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for attending this conference call where we will discuss our third quarter 2011 results and review our planned budget for 2012, which was included in our quarterly press release issued earlier today. Participating with me today are Allan Markin, our Chairman; Steve Laut, our President; and Doug Proll, our Chief Financial Officer. In discussing our 2012 budget, Steve will be referring to certain information contained on slides, which as the operator indicated can be accessed through our website at www.cnrl.com.</p>
          <p>Before we start, I would refer you to the comments regarding forward-looking information contained in our press release and also note that all dollar amounts are in Canadian dollars and production reserves are both expressed as before royalties, unless otherwise stated. I'll make some initial comments before I turn the call over to the other participants.</p>
          <p>The third quarter has again shown that our overall strategies and principles and the business plan that CNQ follows is sound, tested, and successful just as it has been for the past 20 plus years. Our production continues to grow in an orderly fashion but only if allocation of capital to particular areas makes economic sense. And as Steve will show, this will continue in 2012 and the years thereafter. Our 2011 third quarter cash flow amounted to almost $1.8 billion, which is 15% higher than that achieved in the second quarter of this year and then third quarter of 2010. This cash flow exceeded the total CapEx expended in the third quarter, and, again, Steve will show that this trend continues into 2012. We are one of the few independent oil and natural gas exploration companies in the world that can achieve that on an ongoing basis and also have production increases.</p>
          <p>Commodity prices continue to be volatile, but our balanced production base mitigates the volatility to some extent, as we have exposure to some several different pricing platforms, such as West Texas or Brent, Canadian heavy or SCO. With pipeline and refinery constraints in the third quarter, the discount applied to Canadian un-upgraded heavy oil increased to 20% off West Texas, but so far in the fourth quarter, this discount has reduced to closer to 10% to 12% off West Texas pricing as these pipeline constraints were fixed. This, of course, is positive for the price we receive for all of our un-upgraded heavy oil.</p>
          <p>Before we turn the call over to Steve for an in-depth review of our operations and our 2012 plans, I would ask Allan to make some comments. Allan?</p>

          <p>Good morning.</p>
          <p>As John said, Q3 '11 was a quarter of strong cash flow generation and operational performance across the entire asset base. We are back on track. At Horizon, we safely resumed full production in the quarter. We leveraged the lessons learned from this event and are moving forward more disciplined and more effective as an operator. We remain committed to creating value for our shareholders by doing it right, together.</p>
          <p>Turning to the North American E&amp;P side of the business, our primary heavy oil operations achieved record production for the third consecutive quarter. We achieved these results through effectively executing a significant drilling program. Our thermal in situ operations also achieved record production for the quarter, reaching 110,000 barrels a day. Development on Kirby South Phase 1 continues to move forward on budget and on schedule as we unlock value in our top-quality thermal in situ assets.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to 2012, we target production growth of 17% and including 24% crude oil and NGL growth. This reflects our strong primary heavy and light-oil drilling programs. Expansion of our liquid-rich Septimus/Montney shale gas play, additional pad developments at Primrose, and solid performance from Horizon. The 2012 budget reflects our continued commitment to disciplined capital allocation and our defined plan to transition the company towards a longer-life, sustainable reserve asset base.</p>
          <p>Steve?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Al, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll focus most of my comments on the 2012 budget.</p>
          <p>If you're looking at the slides on our website I'll start off briefly talking about how we have and continue to build sustainable value on Slide 2. Canadian Natural executes our strategy by effectively driving our capital allocation model, which maximizes our return on capital, generates significant free cash flow, maintains our strong balance sheet through the price cycles, and continues to transition our asset base through a more sustainable long-term asset base, providing us the ability to increase dividends on a consistent basis.</p>
          <p>To effectively execute this model and deliver sustainable value, Slide 3, we maintain a strong, balanced asset base that has significant upside in each component of our business. It is essential to have a well-balanced, diverse asset base to ensure critical &#x2013; or effective capital allocation that maximizes return on capital over the long run and through the commodity price cycles. Today, with strong oil prices and low gas prices, Canadian Natural continues to allocate capital disproportionally to oil projects. In our light oil portfolio, we are growing light oil and NGL in Canada significantly, 17% in 2012, as well as progressing the development programs in offshore Africa.</p>
          <p>We're unlocking huge value in our heavy oil portfolio. Our plan will see thermal or in situ heavy oil production capacity grow from just under 100,000 barrels a day in 2011 to 480,000 barrels a day of low-cost, high-value heavy oil production. In addition, we'll grow primary heavy oil production by 16% in 2012. Primary heavy oil provides us the highest return on capital in our portfolio.</p>
          <p>At Horizon, our expansion plans to increase synthetic light oil production to 250,000 barrels a day are under way and we're on initial planning stages to expand to 500,000 barrels a day or 0.5 million barrels a day or light sweet, 34-degree API crude. We also have vast natural gas assets, which, when gas prices strengthen, will provide the opportunity to unlock significant value for shareholders.</p>
          <p>Having a well-balanced asset base with significant upside is critical. It is just as important that these assets be focused in core areas where Canadian Natural dominates the land base and infrastructure, ensuring we are the most effective and efficient operator, a key factor in Canadian Natural's ability to generate significant free cash flow.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural has a strong team with the depth and breadth of experience, as shown on Slide 4, to effectively execute in each of our areas to deliver value growth.</p>
          <p>As a result, as shown on Slide 5, Canadian Natural generates significant free cash flow, between $1.1 billion and $1.5 billion in 2012, delivers production growth of 10% Q4 '12 over Q4 '11, and importantly, oil production growth of 17% Q4 over Q4. Strong growth, considering 53% of the 2012 capital program is allocated to future value growth as we transition to a more sustainable and longer-life asset mix. This enhances our ability to increase dividends, dividends that have increased for the last 11 consecutive years. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we are poised for additional acquisition opportunities should they be available, fit, and add value.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural's ability to generate free cash flow on a per-share basis sets us apart from our peer group, Slide 6. It is comparable to the supermajors. This gives Canadian Natural the opportunity to utilize our free cash flow to maximize value for shareholders.</p>
          <p>Slide 7 shows our target 10-year organic production growth profile, which targets delivering significant production growth, growth that is entirely oil. In 2012, this growth comes from Horizon recovery, heavy oil, both primary and thermal in situ, and Canadian light oil. In the midterm this growth again comes from heavy oil, Pelican, Kirby, and to a lesser extent Horizon.</p>
          <p>In the longer term, Horizon and our well-defined thermal in situ development plans deliver significant production growth. In addition, we have the ability to grow our gas volumes significantly, if gas prices strengthen in the future. At current pricing, free cash flow over and above the capital required to deliver this growth profile will be in excess of $13 billion, reflecting the strength of our assets and the soundness of our strategy.</p>
          <p>Also during this period, Slide 8, we are transforming our asset base to a longer-life, more sustainable asset mix as we grow from 35% long-life oil assets in 2012 to 55% by 2018, as well as increase our relative light oil production weighting.</p>
          <p>In 2012, Slide 9, we are delivering significant oil production growth. Total oil production growth is 24%, driven by a full year of Horizon production, Canadian light oil growth of 17%, primary heavy oil growth of 16% and thermal heavy oil growth of 10%. Gas growth is 2.5% year over year but will decline, entry to exit, as we continue to allocate additional capital to oil projects. Overall, we are targeting to deliver 10% BOE growth, Q4 2011 over Q4 2012.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures for 2012, Slide 10, will be $7.2 billion, up 18% from 2011. Roughly 90% of our capital program, $6.4 billion, is allocated to oil. The increase in capital spending is driven by the Horizon expansion capital at $1.95 billion, up $1.4 billion from 2011, and thermal in situ expansion capital at $1.4 billion, up $170 million from 2011. Primary heavy oil capital is just under $1 billion. Light oil with Canada and international combined is just over $1 billion, with Pelican at $470 million and gas at $850 million.</p>
          <p>Our target cash flow for 2012, Slide 11, is $8.2 billion to $8.6 billion at the strip, and will generate free cash flow of between $1.1 billion and $1.5 billion. Our production growth, as I said earlier, Q4 over Q4 is 10%, a significant growth when you consider that $3.8 billion or 53% of our capital program does not deliver production in 2012. We also have tremendous capital flexibility in 2012, with the ability to curtail 42% or $3 billion of our spending if we choose. In these volatile economic times, it is important to have this high level of capital flexibility.</p>
          <p>Our already strong balance sheet will strengthen in 2012. Debt is reduced by $1.2 billion, and our debt-to-book is strengthened by 22% at the midpoint of guidance. These are very solid numbers reflecting the strength of our assets, the robustness of our strategy, and our ability to execute. Very few if any companies in our peer group can deliver 10% production growth, all oil growth, by spending only 47% of the capital program on current year production, generate significant free cash flow, pay down debt, increase dividends as we have for the last 11 years, and at the same time, transfer on the asset base to a more sustainable, longer-life production mix allowing Canadian Natural to generate higher returns on capital and enhance our capacity to increase dividends on a sustainable basis.</p>
          <p>I'll now walk through each of the assets, starting with gas on Slide 13. Our outlook for gas pricing has been bearish, and that has not changed. We now expect gas prices to be low for the next five to 10 years. Therefore, it is fortunate we are able to leverage our dominant land base and infrastructure to maintain our position as the most effective and efficient producer, which allows Canadian Natural to generate free cash flow at $3.50 AECO.</p>
          <p>During a period of low prices, Canadian Natural will continue to strengthen our unconventional and tight gas asset base and delineate new and emerging plays with the application of new technology. Our focus will be on liquids-rich developments. We'll also make opportunistic acquisitions if they're available and add value.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural has one of the largest land bases in Western Canada at 11.1 million acres, Slide 14. Within that land base, we have very strong positions in emerging shale plays. Canadian Natural has 385,000 acres on the Duvernay play and 766,000 acres of Montney lands. All acquired over time and at relatively low cost compared to land prices seen in the last two to three years.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural's Montney land position is one of largest positions in Canada. As you can see on Slide 15, we have the second-largest land base in the Montney.</p>
          <p>Our gas plan for 2012, Slide 16, targets production to increase by 3% in 2012, even though we're drilling nine pure wells. And it's driven mostly by gas acquisitions made in 2011.</p>
          <p>Capital is up roughly $100 million as we proceed with expectations of our liquids-rich Septimus/Montney gas development, where we've drilled 17 wells and expanded the plant from 60 million to 120 million cubic feet a day. Startup of the Septimus plant is expected November 2012, that's the increase. Even with low gas prices, our liquids-rich Septimus development competes for capital with oil. Later this month, we'll connect Septimus to a deep cut facility, which will take liquids recovery to 45 barrels a million of condensate mix, plus an additional 45 barrels a million of ethane. Although lower gas prices are challenging for our gas assets, they make our returns on our thermal heavy oil assets even greater.</p>
          <p>As you can see on Slide 17, Canadian Natural has a dominant land position in the high-quality fairway for thermal in situ development. These lands have 78 billion barrels in place, Slide 18. And we expect to recover 8.5 billion barrels from our vast thermal heavy oil resources.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural is executing a disciplined, stepwise plan, Slide 19, to unlock the huge value of this asset base by bringing on 40,000 to 60,000 barrels a day every two to three years, taking production facility capacity to 480,000 barrels a day, which we own 100% and operate.</p>
          <p>Our 2012 plan, Slide 20, targets production growth of 10%, or 107,000 barrels a day at the midpoint as additional Primrose development comes onstream. Capital spending is targeted at $1.42 billion, up from 2011, and reflects the expected increase in spending as the Kirby development unfolds and increased strat well drilling to progress future developments.</p>
          <p>Our strategy at Primrose, Slide 21, is to continue developing pad adds in the Primrose area, optimizing our steaming techniques to enhance oil recovery and lower cost. There is potential to expand at Primrose Wolf Lake facilities to accommodate future development at the McMurray and Grand Rapids zones that are not in current development plan. In addition, we'll continue to undertake the development of follow-up processes and leverage technology to increase recovery and lower costs.</p>
          <p>In 2012, the Primrose plan, Slide 22, is to progress the development of five pads at Primrose East. That will add 20,000 barrels a day in 2012 and ramp up to 30,000 barrels a day in 2013 at a cost of just under $13,000 a flowing barrel. At Primrose South, we'll progress the development of three pads that will add 15,000 barrels a day in 2012 and ramp up to 20,000 barrels a day in 2013, for a cost of $13,000 a flowing barrel. Primrose pads are some of the lowest-cost production capacity additions in the industry, as are Canadian Natural's operating costs, which are targeted coming in under $9 a barrel in 2012, even lower than our benchmark operating cost in 2011, making Canadian Natural's thermal in situ heavy oil production very profitable, if not the most profitable in Canada.</p>
          <p>At Kirby, Slide 23, the Kirby South development is on schedule and on budget. In 2012 we'll progress the construction of the facilities and drill 24 well pairs for steam-in November 2013. Kirby South is targeted at 40,000 barrels a day of SAGD production, with facility room to grow this to 45,000 barrels a day at a cost of $32,000 a flowing barrel.</p>
          <p>In summary, Slide 24, we'll continue to progress the full development of Primrose with further pad adds, and we will have roughly 50 more pad adds in inventory. Develop Kirby South Phases 1 and 2, as well as Kirby North Phase 1 and 2, which will bring Kirby productive capacity to 140,000 barrels a day of high-quality, low-cost production. At Grouse, the regulatory application for 40,000 barrels a day of capacity will be submitted in Q1 2012. And at Birch Mountain, we submit the application in Q3 2012 for 60,000 barrels a day. In addition, we'll progress the technical work at Gregoire and Germain for future development.</p>
          <p>Turning to primary heavy oil, Slide 25, Canadian Natural has a dominant land and infrastructure position, with over 8,000 drillings locations in inventory. As a result, our operations are very effective and efficient, and we are the low-cost producer. With current pricing, heavy oil generates the highest returns on capital in our portfolio.</p>
          <p>In 2012, Slide 26, heavy oil production will grow by 16% year over year, with the drilling of 808 wells and a capital program of $990 million. In 2011, we will grow heavy oil production 10% with our large inventory of wells. That's 10% in '11, 16% in 2012, and we expect to continue to grow production in the 8% range for the next three to four years.</p>
          <p>At our world-class Pelican Lake oil pool, Slide 27, Canadian Natural's leading-edge polymer flood has been very successful and has significantly increased oil recoveries. We believe that Pelican Lake polymer flood will ultimately recover 536 million barrels of oil.</p>
          <p>As you've heard me discuss in previous conference calls, Slide 28, we have been seeing slower response in the south part of the pool. These slower response times are attributable to a number of factors &#x2013; <mark type="ph" /> oil fat, (20:12) oil viscosity, varying water and gas saturations in the reservoir and where the reservoir was previously water-flooded before the polymer flood was initiated, and a number of other factors. The combination of these various factors have caused the response time to be slower in the south part of the pool and has affected our production profile. It has also provided us with significant learnings on how we can further optimize the polymer flood to maximize oil recoveries. It is our belief that this slower response, although dampening the ramp-up of overall pool production <mark type="ph" /> &#x2013; it does, however, (20:41) ultimately oil recovery will be higher.</p>
          <p>In 2011, we had deferred our drilling program for the start-up in September until at the earliest after break up 2012 to confirm the learnings we have achieved in 2011 and ensure we have the right drilling configuration and an optimized execution of polymer flood conversions and maximize capital efficiency going forward. As a result in 2012, Slide 29, we'll drill 63 injectors and 13 producers with only modest 4% midpoint production growth. Capital spending is $470 million as we complete this program and battery expansions to handle the increased productions we expect as portions of the pool converted to polymer flood in the last two years begin to ramp up &#x2013; a ramp-up that we're already seeing in some wells in the south. If this ramp-up is stronger than expected, we have the option to increase our drilling program in 2012 and polymer conversion with an optimized polymer flood conversion practice.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural's light oil and NGL growth in Canada, Slide 30, has become significant as we begin to reap the benefits of leveraging technology through water flooding, EOR, and horizontal multi-frac over our large light-oil assets in Canada. In 2012, we'll also progress small pool developments on nine new pools.</p>
          <p>Production growth in light oil, Slide 30 (sic) [Slide 31] (22:02) is targeted to be 10% in 2011 and 17% in 2012, significant growth. In 2012, capital program will be $550 million to continue the development of our large light-oil assets. We are targeting roughly this amount of capital over the next five years, and deliver production growth in the 4% to 9% range post-2012.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 32 and our international operations. Our strategy is to maintain our existing operations and convert our undeveloped resources as slots become available on our platforms. Progress at "Big E" exploration in South Africa, monitor acquisition opportunities, and generate free cash flow. As well in 2012, we will prepare for the abandonment of the Murchison platform.</p>
          <p>In 2012, Slide 33, our plan in the North Sea is continuing with required workovers and maintenance, as well as some subsea work at Lyell, injection wells at Ninian, and a production well at Tiffany. As a result of the tax changes in the UK, we have curtailed much of the volume-adding investment that was in our long-range plans. As expected, production declined in the North Sea.</p>
          <p>In offshore West Africa, as expected, production is also declining as we maximum the usage of our existing slot before we begin our infill drilling programs at Baobab and Espoir. The Espoir infill drilling program will begin in late 2012 when a tender- assisted drilling rig becomes available, with production increases ramping up in 2013 and expected production increases of 6,500 BOEs a day, at the completion of the drilling program with a total cost of $143 million, $75 million which will be spent in 2012 for an overall cost of $24,000 a flowing BOE.</p>
          <p>We're also making good progress in tying up all the regulatory requirements before drilling our South Africa exploration well, Slide 34. This series of very large prospects is at the ready-to-drill stage and has potential for billion-barrel structures, with our best estimate in place of 3 billion barrels &#x2013; in place. We own this block 100%, which is in deep water with challenging sea conditions. We will in 2012 begin the process of selecting a partner to drill a first exploration well in South Africa, likely in 2013 at the earliest.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 35 and the world-class Horizon oil sands operations, where we have over 14 billion barrels in our lease and 6 billion barrels recoverable. Our capacity today is 110,000 barrels a day, and we are well under way in our staged, cost-disciplined expansion to 250,000 barrels a day and then ultimately to 500,000 barrels a day or half a million barrels day of light, sweet, 34-degree API crude with no declines for 40 years and virtually no reserve replacement costs. Horizon is a world-class asset that will continue to be earing sustainable and significant free cash flow for decades to come.</p>
          <p>In Q3, Slide 36, we completed the rebuilt on cost, $390 million to $400 million, and except for time taken out because of the forest fires in the area, on schedule. Insurance will cover the cost of the rebuild, and business interruption insurance covers operating costs up to $30 a barrel. During the rebuild we completed significant opportune maintenance. As a result, the previously planned turnaround for 2012 has been rescheduled to 2013.</p>
          <p>We have also taken this time to ensure the operations discipline at Horizon is at the same high levels of excellence we have across the rest of our operations. We are confident our operation discipline is in place and also believe we could still continue to improve, not only at Horizon, but across our entire operations. The fire at Horizon has increased, company-wide, our focus on already-strong operations discipline.</p>
          <p>As a result, our start-up in Q3 was very solid, with first production coming online August 16 and delivering 44,600 barrel a day average for August, or a steam day rate of 86,400 barrels a day, September was steady at 108,200 barrels a day, and October is coming in at 105,650 barrels a day, even though rates were reduced to complete coker furnace pigging. Our third oil preparation plant, OPP3, will be commissioned and turned over to operations for startup by the end of November. As a result of these improvements, we expect a solid, reliable run in 2012.</p>
          <p>Our plan in 2012, Slide 37, is to deliver midpoint production guidance of 110,000 barrels a day with operating costs, all in, in the range of $30 to $36 a barrel at sustaining capital of 230 million barrels, which is roughly $5.70 a barrel. The project capital spend for expansion in 2011 is forecast at $540 million, down from $880 million we originally forecast. This reduction in spending is due to two main factors. Firstly, we slowed down some activities at the site to ensure we had optimal focus on the rebuild and collateral damage repair. Secondly, and probably most importantly, we took extra time to optimize the definition and breakdown the projects under way and work awarded. As a result, we've been able to break the work scope into smaller, more focused pieces, allowing a wider range of bidders and bidders who are much more confident in their ability to deliver. In some cases, we have rebid work and reconfigured work packages. And this takes additional time, but it's well worth it as we have achieved improved costs and project execution.</p>
          <p>In Q3, we have recently awarded lump sum contracts for two major plants in our expansion, the gas/oil hydrotreater and the froth treatment plant. We believe these lump sum contracts are fair and will enhance our cost certainty and project execution going forward. In Phase 1, the plants that were constructed under lump sum bids had the best performance from a cost and execution perspective. Both these strategies align with our cost-focused execution strategy, and although it's early, we are seeing good results. The projects under construction today are on track and running at or below cost.</p>
          <p>In 2012, we're targeting a capital expense of $1.95 billion to progress expansion of Horizon to 250,000 barrels a day, with work under way in all phases of expansion. We will, as we have in 2011, continued to execute &#x2013; the execution of our strategies going forward to ensure we deliver high levels of capital cost-effectiveness.</p>
          <p>Highlighting our current activity, Slide 38. Reliability's on track and running below cost with OPP3 turned over to operations for startup at the end of November. Directive 74 is on track, and our pilot studies have been positive. Our use of CO2 with <mark type="ph" /> polymer addition to ensure bond sealings (28:45) has been successful. And though it's early, we may have the potential to reduce the capital required to meet Directive 74, as the sizing of physical equipment may not be as large as originally anticipated. Phase 2's schedule has slipped a bit, roughly six months, due to the fires I mentioned earlier. And Phase 2B, we have awarded major lump-sum contracts. And work on Phase 3 <mark type="ph" /> executing (29:06) Trains 3 and 4 is on track.</p>
          <p>In summary, our production operations at Horizon are on track and have a very solid &#x2013; after a very solid startup, and we're looking to forward to a consistent and reliable 2012. Our expansion strategy at Horizon is proving effective, and we believe we can deliver the expansions even more effectively then we delivered Phase 1.</p>
          <p>Even through industry activity is projected to be very high in 2013 and '14 in particular, most of this increase is coming from the in situ side, with a multitude of players, many of them building for the first time, compared to the mining side, which has seen consolidation. This time around, there's a smaller number more disciplined and experienced group of operators who have lived through the past period of hyperinflation. As a result, we believe we can deliver a cost-effective expansion.</p>
          <p>At a high level, our overall 2012 budget, Slide 39, delivers cash flow of $8.2 billion to $8.6 billion at the strip. With a capital program of $7.2 billion, we generate significant free cash flow of between $1.1 billion and $1.5 billion. Our production growth is very solid at 10% Q4 over Q4, very impressive when you consider this growth is organic and 53% of our capital program does not deliver production in 2012. Considering the volatility in the global economy today, it is important to point out that we have significant flexibility to reduce our capital program by up to $3 billion or 42% if a significant event were to occur, ensuring we preserve our strong balance sheet, which in 2012 will become even stronger, with debt reduction over $1 billion and debt-to-book shrinking to 22% at the midpoint of guidance.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural is in a very strong position. With our effective capital allocation strategy of balanced asset which contain significant upside, we are delivering strong oil-weighted production growth, investing significantly in future production growth, yet retaining capital flexibility, paying down debt and driving significant free cash flow of between $1.1 billion and $1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural will allocate the free cash flow in 2012, Slide 40, to opportunistic acquisitions if they're available, add value, and are able to compete for capital. We have increased dividends consecutively for the last 11 years, and we anticipate this going forward. We will continue to pay down debt, and lastly buy back shares.</p>
          <p>And lastly on Slide 41, it is clear that Canadian Natural is in great shape. Our management, business philosophies, and practices work. We have a strong, well-balanced, and diverse asset base with vast opportunities. Our strategy is balanced, effective, and proven. We have control of our capital allocation and are nimble enough to capture opportunities. Our strong assets, combined with our great teams of people and our culture, which is focused on execution excellence, effective operations, and cost control, allows Canadian Natural to build an even stronger, more sustainable asset base, which will generate even more significant free cash flow in the future.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Doug to talk about our strong financial position.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve, and good morning.</p>
          <p>Steve has provided comprehensive overview of our current operations and our capital expenditure plans for 2012. I would like to briefly provide you with some of the financial highlights for the third quarter of 2011 and to provide a few indicatives of our financial targets for 2012 to assure you that we continue to hold firm, that the strength of our balance sheet is foremost on our minds as we continue to build value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>The largest financial highlights for the third quarter of 2011 was of course the return to production and delivery of synthetic crude oil to markets in August. This resulted in the return to positive cash flow from operations and positive free cash flow for the quarter for the Horizon operations. In the third quarter, Canadian Natural generated almost $1.8 billion of cash flow from operations and incurred $1.4 billion of capital expenditures. For the nine months ended September 30, we generated $4.4 billion of cash flow from operations and incurred $4.5 billion of capital expenditures, virtually a balanced budget encompassing an 8.5-month period where there was no production or sales from the Horizon operations. This is a testament to our operational and financial discipline and the adherence to balance sheet management.</p>
          <p>We exited the third quarter with $9.3 billion of long-term debt. An increase from the $8.6 billion at June 30, this increase resulted from the weakening of the Canadian dollar at September 30, as compared to June 30, with the marked-to-market unrealized foreign exchange loss applied to our U.S. debt. At September 30, our debt-to-EBITDA was 1.2 times, debt-to-book-capitalization was 30%, and our undrawn bank facilities amounted to almost $2.2 billion. Our financial strength and management discipline has been recognized by Standard &amp; Poor's, who upgraded our debt rating to BBB-plus with a stable outlook last week.</p>
          <p>Turning to the 2012 budget, the financial as well as the operational highlights were addressed by Steve. In summary, the budget targets the generation of positive free cash flow in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.5 billion after budget capital expenditures of $7.2 billion, an overall reduction of long-term debt and a corresponding improvement in our balance sheet metrics of debt-to-EBITDA and debt-to-book-capitalization. These targets are all summarized on Slides 11 and 39 of the conference call slide presentation.</p>
          <p>Now that the 2012 capital expenditure plans are clear, we'll review our commodity hedging strategy for 2012 and 2013. Currently no positions are in place for 2012, largely as a result of our balance sheet strength, our ample sources of liquid financial resources, and as we do not have any significant near-term maturities of long-term debt.</p>
          <p>Our financial goals for 2012 are easily identified. During these continuing uncertain economic times, we continue to focus on the development of our significant and very diverse asset base, prudent spending within our financial means, maintaining and expanding our sources of financial liquidity, and the continued focus on our balance sheet strength.</p>
          <p>Thank you. Now I'd like to turn you back to John for some closing comments.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Just a question, first, on Horizon, it wasn't clear what the 2012 OpEx guidance is for Horizon. I didn't see that, actually, in the guidance document. And then second, just looking for little color on the Redwater upgrader and what sort of CapEx we could see in 2012, presuming that is sanctioned? Maybe if you could give us an idea what kind actual spending would go on the project and then I guess how much would actually cross your books if it is just project financed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Andrew, Steve Laut here. Thanks for the question. I did mention in the conference call; we didn't put it in the guidance. Right now we believe operating costs for 2012 will be between $30 and $36. That's a fairly wide range. We're just working to get that range narrowed before we put it in the guidance documents. So it's $30 to $36 all-in per barrel.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At Redwater, we're progressing to get the sanction in 2012. There's enough funding in the partnership now that our capital spending, if we are sanctioned in 2012, will be negligible, if any, so we have enough money in there right now to progress it, and it'll be project financing upon sanction. So there will be no capital to Canadian Natural going forward.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from George Toriola of UBS. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, and good morning, guys. The question is around your heavy-oil growth. And this year we are seeing 10% growth. Next year you're looking at 16% growth. I wonder if you can speak to what it is in that business that is driving the growth. Is it a function of the commodity price environment? Is it recovery factors that you're seeing? Is it downspacing? What is it exactly &#x2013; or technology &#x2013; what is it exactly that's behind that growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks, George. That growth is mainly driven &#x2013; obviously, commodity prices make heavy oil the most profitable part of our portfolio, the primary heavy oil. And we have, as you know, a very large land base. We dominate the area. We dominate the infrastructure. So we can do it at very low cost, and we have 8,000 wells and locations. So essentially what we're doing is &#x2013; or in inventory.</p>
          <p>So really what we're doing is just drawing down our inventory and drilling primary heavy-oil wells, keeping our facilities full and expanding some of our facilities, which we will be doing here in late 2011 and into 2012 to give us more production growth. So really it's just effective cost execution, drawing down our inventory and a very large land base and a very dominant infrastructure that allows us to deliver this growth. We can do that probably for two to three more years at these kind of rates, and then I think you'll start to see, because the heavy oil declines fairly quickly, you'll get to sort of a peak and it'll be very tough to keep that growth up. You'll probably plateau after that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So just to follow up, if I assume that your 8,000 wells all generate two &#x2013; recycle ratios of at least two, would it be sufficient to then say that part of what the growth driver is here is that you're probably able to go after wells that would have F&amp;D costs in the mid-$20s, something like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> Yeah, I think there are. (39:56) Most of our F&amp;D costs average probably in that $15 to $16 range, and some would be up higher than that range. But as you know, we have a large inventory, so we're able to high-grade and only do the best that gives us the highest return on capital as we go forward. That's the advantage of having a very large inventory.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Steve, could you drill down a maybe a little bit on the plans for the Duvernay? Obviously that &#x2013; a number of companies now that'll be drilling pilot wells there here, but in addition to that, how are you thinking about gas growth at Septimus as you go into next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, thanks, Greg. I'll talk about Septimus first, and then Duvernay. So Septimus, our plan is to take the plant, which we're doing about 60 million a day right now through, up to 120 million a day. We're in the process of tying into a deep cut facility at a younger plant, which will take the crude coverage to 90 barrels a million. About 45 of that is ethane. And so we'll go to 120 million next year. That'll come on late next year, so we'll make sure we have the wells to fill it.</p>
          <p>As far as the Duvernay plans go, we'll likely drill one well to sort of prove up some of our lands, but we are, as you know, fairly bearish on gas. We have large inventories on our oil sites, so it's not like we have to drill up our gas prospects, our liquids-rich gas prospects, so we're probably going to be, I would say, someone who watches what's going on and take the advantage of being a second mover.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Mark Polak of Scotia Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. In the budget slide, you touched on $3 billion of flexibility to the downside. If prices are above the $88 used in your cash flow guidance, I'm just curious how much flexibility there would be to increase that, or is that tougher on shorter notice and that any incremental free cash flow's likely to go into acquisitions and debt reduction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say, Mark, you probably got it right. I think our first choice of incremental free cash flow would be to debt reduction, and we could increase capital spending probably in the order of $200 million to $500 million. But to go beyond that on short notice means you're going to lose capital efficiencies because you don't have your rigs lined up. We tend to have a steady fleet of rigs and service rigs and service providers that give us capital efficiencies over time, so to increase that, you're probably bringing in less capital-efficient equipment, so we wouldn't do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on Pelican Lake, I think you'd mentioned after Q2 that you were expecting some data to come in on September to assuage the concerns the regulators had on the <mark type="ph" /> cap rock issue (42:29). Is there any update on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark. I forgot that in the conference call. We did get the data to the regulators; the regulators came back. They're happy with the data. And all those issues that required to move forward have now been addressed, and we are moving forward. So there's no regulatory hurdles in front of us.</p>
          <p>So really what we're doing here at Pelican Lake, because we have a &#x2013; such a large portfolio and we're able to allocate capital to get high returns, we're not driven. Maybe other companies would want to drive forward and continue at a fast pace of polymer conversion. We have the luxury to sort of watch and optimize all the things so we can go forward and get even better capital efficiencies going forward, probably later in 2012 and for sure in 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. And the last one from me, just curious to get your perspective on the strength in synthetic pricing and your outlook for that going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the strength on synthetic pricing, we actually look at it and think it's probably about the right price. Because if you look at synthetic versus Brent pricing, it's about the same discount as it normally would be, same as Louisiana sweet or LLS crude. And so really where you've got the problem is in WTI and probably heavy oil that's trapped somewhat in Canada and the northern portion of U.S. until Keystone gets on. That being said, our heavy oil pricings are very, very strong, and we still generate highest returns on capital in heavy oil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from John Herrlin of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Just some quick ones from me. Regarding expansions on Horizon, what are you seeing on the cost inflation front and construction, things like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on Horizon, I mentioned to it or alluded to it in the conference call, the construction we have ongoing right now, we're actually seeing costs come in or actually under what we had budgeted for. So we're not seeing any inflation in 2011. 2012, we feel confident that we can hold the line.</p>
          <p>Our bigger concern is in 2013 and '14. If all these projects that people say they're going to do go ahead, we could see contractors and engineering firms stretched. And we're starting to see engineering firms already being very tight. So we anticipate that it'll be more difficult to keep costs in line in '13 and '14. And that's why, as you've seen, we're taking a very cost-effective approach breaking these packages down. And if we don't like the costs, we're not going to award the work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Steve. I was concerned about the long term. I was wondering if you were trying to lock in anything. But that's fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't locked anything in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding the UK, you're abandoning Murchison. You've got mature properties. Is it time to monetize them and redeploy more aggressively into your North American assets, your heavy oil assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it is, John. We get asked this question quite often. And the reality &#x2013; we believe that if we had to sell the assets, we would get more value just producing them out because we think we're a pretty effective operator there, so there's more value by producing them out.</p>
          <p>We also do not want to lose our technical and operational capacity to execute in offshore waters, and the North Sea does that for us. We have that capacity in the office there, and we believe there will be opportunities for us as we move forward. And as you know, we are generating significant free cash flow, so we would love to expand our offshore operations if that opportunity was there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Last one from me. On a flowing barrel basis, you seem to be undervalued versus your peers. Have you ever thought about that? Do you think there's a heavy oil bias by investors, or is it maybe a concern about Horizon's reliability? More of a rhetorical question, I guess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Are we concerned about it? I suppose we are concerned about it. We always think we're undervalued. But reality, I suspect, we have to live with the reality, is Horizon has been out for eight months. So I think it's going to take the Street some time to see us demonstrate that we can run Horizon at high levels of reliability and at low cost, which we think we're well on our way to doing. But that will take time.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Great presentation. I just wanted to ask you if I could about marketing strategy, basically, for access to North American oil markets. So if you could comment at all in terms of your positioning with respect to Keystone XL and what you think sort of the impact of pipeline capacity on the North American oil markets looks like going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Barb. So on Keystone, we obviously are a big supporter of a Keystone pipeline. We have 120,000 barrels a day of transportation locked up on Keystone for 20 years, and we have 100,000 barrels a day of market locked up with a major refinery in the Gulf Coast to <mark type="ph" /> announce (48:06) that off. We believe that Keystone will go ahead ultimately, although obviously it's running into some choppy waters here, but we believe it's &#x2013; will happen. So that is our plan for marketing.</p>
          <p>If it does not happen, I think you will see the industry in Canada, which as you know is very resilient and very innovative, move very quickly to find other outlets to get our heavy oil production and our synthetic oil production, likely off the West Coast and into Asian markets, because it's pretty clear if Keystone doesn't go ahead that U.S. markets are not in favor of having Canadian line.</p>
