          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to NIKE's Fiscal 2010 Second Quarter Conference Call. For those who need to reference today's press release, you'll find it at www.nikebiz.com. Leading today's call is Pamela Catlett, Vice President of Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>Before I turn the call over to Ms. Catlett, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including Forms 8-K, 10-K, and 10-Q.</p>
          <p>Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, and discounts which may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc's business, including equipment, most of NIKE Retail, NIKE Golf, Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley, and Umbro are not included in these future numbers.</p>
          <p>Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. The presentation of comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations are found at NIKE's website. This call might also include discussion of non-public financial and statistical information, which is also publicly available on that site, www.nikebiz.com.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Pamela Catlett, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, ma'am. You may begin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Happy holidays, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE's fiscal 2010 second quarter results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, and at our website, nikebiz.com.</p>
          <p>Joining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. CEO Mark Parker, followed by Charlie Denson, President of the NIKE Brand. And finally, you will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Don Blair, who will give you an in-depth review of our financial results.</p>
          <p>Following their prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. We'd like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time today. So we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event you have any additional questions that are not covered by others, please do feel free to requeue, and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to turn it over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO Mark Parker.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, Pam, and happy holidays, everybody.</p>
          <p>It was about a year ago I told you that NIKE would perform well in this challenging economy and expand our lead over our competitors by doing what we do best, and that's delivering superior innovative product, connecting with our consumers, creating compelling marketplace experiences, and operating with discipline and efficiency.</p>
          <p>As our performance over the last year clearly indicates, we're executing these strategies and winning in the marketplace. We continue to lead the industry in footwear and apparel product innovation, and we're doing that across multiple categories and geographies, and up and down the price spectrum. Our portfolio of global brands has deepened our personal connections with consumers, we continue to create compelling marketplace experiences with our retail partners in NIKE-owned retail stores and online, and we're managing our business to balance ongoing investments in long-term growth with current profitability and cash flow.</p>
          <p>Sticking with these principles allows NIKE, Inc. to expand competitive separation across multiple dimensions. We continue to gain share in key markets around the world and outperform the industry. Even as revenues dip a bit, our second quarter shows we're able to deliver an appropriate level of financial performance in a rapidly changing environment. By tightly managing the inventory on our books and in the marketplace, we've strengthened our brands, maintained profitability for NIKE and our retail partners, and positioned ourselves for accelerated growth as consumer confidence returns.</p>
          <p>As we move into the second half of fiscal 2010, I have to say I'm very excited about how we're executing against our key growth opportunities. I see a lot of momentum in our direct-to-consumer business, where we continue to deliver positive results, especially online. We're doing a good job of developing our retail capabilities, and as I've said many times, that makes us a better wholesale partner and a better company.</p>
          <p>This really came to life in Tokyo, where we opened a new NIKE flagship store in Harajuku. It's a great example of how innovative retail experiences really connect with consumers, even in a very tough economy like Japan. As we evolve, we're getting increasingly better at product design, assortment planning, product flow and merchandising, all because we're executing everything with that consumer experience in mind.</p>
          <p>We're also seeing the power of our category offense yield insights to drive excellence from product creation all the way through to the retail floor, and we continue to see opportunities to build on that category strength beyond the NIKE brand. Football is a great example, where we're leveraging the most powerful dimensions in sports, specifically the global passion for the game, the upcoming World Cup, and our position as the world's biggest football company. It's a perfect storm that allows us to deliver compelling experiences, innovative product from NIKE and Umbro, like the CTR360 football boot and the tailored England national team jersey, all the way through retail experiences like the Bootroom and NIKETOWNs, and the recent launch of "Lace Up. Save Lives." in London, which is just another example of how we're able to deepen our connection with consumers while working to make the world a better place.</p>
          <p>As you'll hear from Charlie in a minute, our focus and investment in football has completely changed the competitive landscape in that sport. Product innovation is what created this company and what continues to separate us from all others. We're in market with LunarGlide, the Trainer 1, Pro Combat, all concepts with tremendous potential for continued evolution and longevity. And as we've demonstrated with Flywire, for example, we're able to use innovation to drive profitable growth across our business portfolio, from NIKE Basketball, running and training footwear, to Hurley board shorts and Cole Haan footwear. And we have a lot more product innovation in the pipeline.</p>
          <p>Down in Laguna Beach, consumers are responding strongly to our action-sports store concept, where we have NIKE, Converse, and Hurley all under one roof. In fact, we just opened a second store in Irvine, and both are examples &#x2013; excellent examples &#x2013; of how we're being more surgical with our brands and bringing together unique and targeted opportunities that are consumer-driven.</p>
          <p>But you don't have to be in a store to see the reach of NIKE Inc. You can walk down the street and see Air Max 2009s, Hurley boardshorts, custom Chucks, Cole Haan bags, an Umbro tee, pair of Retro Air Jordan XIIs, all unique, iconic products, each with sustainable long-term relevance. And as you know, we've also taken a lot of aggressive and strategic actions internally over this past year, and we did it to get even more focused and surgical externally. We're able to move more quickly and decisively like a small company and yet still work the levers that only the industry leader can pull.</p>
          <p>At the end of the day, we're becoming a better NIKE Inc., more insightful in our product creation, more aligned and surgical in getting after opportunities, efficient in our go-to-market practices, and more innovative on the retail floor. We all still face some significant headwinds in the global economy. And while consumers are gaining confidence, they remain cautious and prudent. But given what we all know about the marketplace and about ourselves, we're well positioned to leverage the power of global sports and drive hard against those growth opportunities that have the most impact.</p>
          <p>Now, here's Charlie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark. And happy holidays to everybody.</p>
          <p>Well, I feel good about our Q2 performance. The strength of the NIKE Brand remains in a very enviable position. I feel good that we've been a very solid performer in what has been a very challenging environment, and I feel good about our future. That's why we spend so much time thinking about our brand strength: managing the business, controlling expenses, and driving heat into the marketplace by connecting with consumers. And we continued to deliver on our primary objective: to create authentic product innovation for athletes all over the world.</p>
          <p>Mark mentioned the importance of separation in the marketplace. Clearly the impact of the strategic changes we've made both internally and externally over the last year helped us focus on key opportunities. I continue to call out our move to our category offense and our ability to execute it. Spring 2009 was our first full season in this formation, and we continue to fine-tune and focus on the benefits it's bringing, building momentum and leveraging deeper insights and connectivity. Sub-segmenting the business by category and geography enables us to accelerate growth by delivering integrated, sharply focused product innovations, brand connections, and retail experiences to our consumers. It's how we capture short- to mid-term opportunities, and more importantly, how we leverage the power of sport to grow the overall marketplace.</p>
          <p>We can drill down with tremendous visibility into specific regions, sports, and demographics to get very surgical with our product innovation, messaging, and go-to-market strategies. That's why we continue to pick up share and expand our leadership position across the industry worldwide. So here's a few quick examples.</p>
          <p>In Basketball, we continue to see the game and our brand gain momentum. The big story focuses on a couple of franchise products, the LeBron VII and the brand new Kobe V, which we just launched last week; it's pure NIKE. We used technology and innovation to create a project that defies logic, put it on an incredible athlete that establishes its credibility, and shift the traditional paradigm that says you have to wear a high-top basketball shoe to play at the highest level.</p>
          <p>In Running, we used marathons in Chicago, San Francisco, and New York, along with the second annual Human Race, our global Nike+ event, and a fully immersed NIKETOWN presence to create an interconnected customer experience that drove tremendous sell-through of the LunarGlide, our best-selling new shoe of the year, and a big step forward in bringing energy to running at retail.</p>
          <p>In Apparel, Pro Combat has taken its rightful spot on the performance side of the U.S. apparel business. Nobody can match our relevance or performance in protective base-layer technology. Over the last 12 months, we've added about 4 points of market share, and we feel like we're just getting started.</p>
          <p>As exciting as the last three months have been, it's the next nine months that I'm really looking forward to. You're going to see even more of that integrated category offense beginning this spring with a concept we call Fresh Air. We're taking Nike Air, our iconic cushioning system, and creating a whole new level of performance, aesthetics, and comfort that will play out across multiple categories. This is a tremendous opportunity to leverage the strength of the NIKE Brand, and a key franchise technology to energize the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Next in Football, we continue to redefine the game. Everyone knows the big story coming up is World Cup. I'm not prepared to drop the curtain just yet, but here's what I will say. You can expect to see unprecedented intensity in our marketing and messaging, a global network of grassroots and community experiences, and a new generation of boots that are the lightest and most responsive in the history of the sport, true game-changing innovation. As Mark said, Nike is the biggest football company in the world. I would add that we're also the most innovative, and I'm confident that what we have coming will put to rest any claims to the contrary. And we're not stopping there, we will follow up our World Cup efforts with a couple of other surprises that I'm going to leave under the tree for now. They'll be something we'll be talking about in upcoming calls, when I'll be able to be more specific.</p>
          <p>I've talked a lot about product today, because it gives us the power to drive two critical and distinguishing competitive advantages: building and leveraging the power of the NIKE Brand, and connecting that power to consumers through premium experiences out in the marketplace. We've done a lot of things right to get where we are today, and we've got a lot more planned as we move through the second half.</p>
          <p>I'm very excited and optimistic about what this brand's capable of doing. I'm not focused on calling a bottom or predicting a turnaround. My sights are focused on growing this brand and serving its consumers. I have no doubts that what you see from NIKE between now and next fall will show you once again just how connected this brand is to our consumers and our opportunities.</p>
          <p>Now, here's Don.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Charlie.</p>
          <p>Well, it's not a surprise that I agree with Charlie and Mark. We are pleased with the performance of our businesses so far this year. While we're seeing hopeful signs of recovery in consumer sentiment around the world, macroeconomic indicators remain mixed, and not all of our businesses are recovering at the same pace. Yet over the last year, we increased our advantage over major competitors, and the strength of our diversified portfolio of businesses enabled us to deliver good financial results. Most important, by continuing to invest in our businesses while reducing costs and aggressively managing inventories, we've positioned ourselves to accelerate growth and profitability as consumer confidence strengthens.</p>
          <p>So let's take a look at our second quarter results. Second quarter revenues were $4.4 billion, down 4% on both a reported and constant-currency basis. NIKE Brand revenue was down 4%, while other business revenue was up 1%. Futures orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from December to April 2010 declined 1% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting sequential improvement from holiday 2009 through the spring and summer 2010 seasons. On a real-dollar basis, we estimate futures orders will be 4% higher than the prior year.</p>
          <p>Diluted earnings per share for the quarter decreased 5% to $0.76 as lower revenue and gross margin more than offset SG&amp;A savings and a lower tax rate. Gross margin for the quarter declined 20 basis points to 44.5%. The decline was driven largely by unfavorable FX and higher discounts, partially offset by higher in-line product margins driven by lower raw material and freight costs.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A for the quarter declined 4% on both a reported and currency-neutral basis. Demand creation was 2% lower than last year, due in part to a shift in spending to support second-half marketing initiatives, including Fresh Air and the World Cup.</p>
          <p>Operating overhead fell 6% overall, reflecting lower costs for head count, travel, and meetings. Retail overhead grew 6%, driven by new store openings. Other income for Q2 was comprised largely of currency-related gains. We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the currency gains included in other income increased pre-tax income growth by $10 million for the quarter and decreased pre-tax income growth by $18 million year-to-date.</p>
          <p>Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.5%, a decrease of 140 basis points versus last year. The improvement was a result of the settlement of uncertain tax positions, as well as continued benefit from international businesses, where tax rates are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate. At this stage, we expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 will be approximately 25%.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet continues to reflect the strength of our business and our long-standing focus on capital efficiency. At the end of the second quarter, our cash and short-term investments totaled $4 billion, or over $8 per diluted share. Tight working capital management was a key contributor to this increase. Versus last year's second quarter end, accounts receivable declined 1% and inventory fell 10%, the latter reflecting a 19% decline in inventory units for the NIKE Brand. By tightly managing the inventory in our supply chain and working with our retail partners to keep sales channels clean, we're maintaining the strength of our brands and maximizing profitability, both for NIKE and our retail partners.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at our results by geography. In North America, second quarter revenue declined 4%, reflecting a 7% decline in wholesale revenues. Direct-to-consumer sales grew 14% for the quarter, as comp store sales grew 9% and online sales advanced 23%. Profitability for NIKE's direct-to-consumer businesses also surged during the quarter, as significantly lower promotions drove gross margin upsides versus last year.</p>
          <p>Footwear revenue in North America fell 4% in the second quarter. Revenues for NIKE Basketball, Jordan, and Athletic Training were higher for the quarter, while all other categories declined. While overall industry sales trends have been challenging, we've continued to gain market share in the U.S. For the 12 months ended October 2009, NPD reported that the NIKE and Jordan brands combined to add 1.5 points of market share, while Converse added 70 basis points.</p>
          <p>Results for Apparel were also encouraging. As a result of the work we've done to improve the product line, clean up distribution, and manage inventories, the Apparel business in North America is much healthier than it's been in some time. North American Apparel revenue was down 6% in Q2, but full-price sales grew 2%, while off-price revenues dropped over 60%. As a result, Apparel gross margins were significantly better than the prior year, positioning us for profitable growth in future quarters.</p>
          <p>North America earnings before interest and taxes for Q2 increased 9% as improved gross margins and lower SG&amp;A more than offset the impact of lower revenues. In Western Europe, revenue for the quarter declined 6%, including a 2 percentage point benefit from the weaker dollar. Excluding the currency impact, Footwear revenue declined 1% and Apparel revenue fell 16% as a result of tough market conditions and lower off-price sales.</p>
          <p>Although all territories in the geography except Austria, Germany, Switzerland reported lower revenues for the quarter, we continue to maintain overall market share and share leadership in the five largest markets in Europe. Most categories reflected the overall market softness, although Action Sports and Basketball delivered year-over-year growth in the quarter.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, EBIT for Western Europe declined 5% as lower revenues were partially offset by reductions in SG&amp;A and favorable FX rates. Gross margins in Western Europe were essentially flat. In Central and Eastern Europe, second quarter revenue declined 24%, including 3 percentage points of erosion from weaker currencies in the geography.</p>
          <p>The macro environment remains challenging, as most countries continue to experience declining GDP, rising unemployment, and significant currency fluctuations. Russia and Central Europe have been particularly difficult, but there are some signs of stabilization. South Africa posted higher revenue for the quarter, as the football category drives strong growth in advance of next year's World Cup. Q2 EBIT for Central and Eastern Europe declined 36% due to lower revenue and gross margins, partially offset by reductions in SG&amp;A.</p>
          <p>In Greater China, revenue declined 3% on both a reported and constant-currency basis, an improving trend versus last year's tough comparison to the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Sell-through in both NIKE-owned and partner stores continue to improve, and futures have returned to growth for the spring and summer seasons. Footwear revenues fell 1% for the quarter, and apparel dropped 7%, as overall growth in sportswear, women's training, and kids was offset by declines in other categories. Q2 EBIT for Greater China decreased 7%, as lower revenues and higher demand creation spending more than offset improved gross margins.</p>
          <p>In Japan, revenue fell 2% for the quarter, including a 12% benefit from the strength of the yen. On a constant-currency basis, footwear revenues dropped 8%, while apparel revenues fell 21%, driven by consumer and retailer caution in a highly promotional marketplace. Although most categories were down with the market, we're particularly excited about our progress in Running, where revenues grew 10% for the quarter. Second quarter EBIT for Japan fell 19%, as lower revenues and higher SG&amp;A were partially offset by gross margin improvements.</p>
          <p>Our emerging markets business continued to deliver strong results in Q2, as revenue increased 8%, including a 6 percentage point drag from weaker currencies in the geography. The constant-currency increase was fueled by double-digit growth in all but one territory in the geography. Second quarter EBIT for the emerging markets increased 29%, driven by revenue and gross margin growth.</p>
          <p>Second quarter revenue in our other businesses increased 1% versus the prior year on both a reported and constant-currency basis, driven by strong growth at Converse. Revenues at Hurley and Cole Haan were essentially flat, while sales at NIKE Golf and Umbro were below the prior year. Second quarter EBIT for our other businesses increased 65%, as lower SG&amp;A expenses more than offset lower gross margins.</p>
          <p>As we look to the future, we remain very confident in our long-term prospects for profitable growth, but we remain cautious on the outlook for the next few quarters. We're seeing improving trends in some geographies, most notably China, Western Europe, and the emerging markets. Trends are more mixed in North America and Central and Eastern Europe, while Japan hasn't yet turned to the upside.</p>
          <p>Consistent with futures, we expect to report mid-single digit revenue growth over the next two quarters, yielding a modest decline in revenue for the full year. As FX headwinds moderate and we continue to effectively manage product costs and inventory levels, we expect gross margins for the second half of fiscal 2010 to be above prior-year levels. With a slight increase in Q3 and more significant growth in Q4, we now expect full-year gross margins to be about flat to FY '09.</p>
          <p>Our SG&amp;A spending for the first half of the fiscal year was well below last year, as we benefited from our organizational restructuring and shifted demand creation to the second half of the year. As a result, we expect second half SG&amp;A to increase at a low double-digit percentage rate versus a year ago, with a heavier weighting in Q4. For the full fiscal year, we now expect SG&amp;A to be roughly in line with the prior year.</p>
          <p>With that, we wish you happy holidays, and we'll open it up for questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question is from the line of Bob Drbul with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess the &#x2013; I'll step out on the first question, and hopefully I get more than one, Pam. I guess the big question that we've been getting from a lot of people, and you didn't really talk about it at all, but the Tiger Woods situation. Is there any statement that you can make around impacts that you see on the business, orders, inventories? And then I have another question that's different, totally different angle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, let me take that. This is Mark. First of all, you have to recognize that NIKE has about a $650 million Golf business, which as you know, like the rest of the broader golf market has really been among the most impacted or probably hardest-hit segments of our business, particularly in this economic environment over the past year. That said, I want to quickly add that we feel very good about how we're managing our Golf business through this period and our position in the broader golf market, and then certainly with our confidence in our growth potential going forward there.</p>
          <p>The only thing I'll say right now about Tiger is that we all know that he's chosen to step away from the game, and out of respect for his time and space he needs, that he's asked for, we'll respect that. And we'll continue to support Tiger and his family as we, of course, look forward to his return.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, okay. And then if &#x2013; just ask one additional question. When you look on &#x2013; this is on the European side &#x2013; but when you look at the improvement that you've seen in Western Europe on the business and you look to sort of the World Cup and &#x2013; how much do you think the industry will sort of rally around soccer as a category, as you think about the back half of the year? When you look at the changes that you've seen in the business and the order trend there, how much of it you think is related to the World Cup?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Bob, this is Charlie. I think &#x2013; well, the World Cup will certainly have a big influence on Western and Central and Eastern Europe for that matter, as well as key markets around the world for the second half. I think we're seeing some very positive signs around the build-up to World Cup. As Don or I think somebody mentioned, that obviously the South Africa business is very healthy and alive and benefiting from that, as you would expect. But I really feel good about our position as we go into this second half, and you're going to see a pretty aggressive approach to that business from us starting in probably Q4 and working all the way through the actual event that starts June 11 and ends July 11.</p>
          <p>So we feel pretty good about it. And I think the event itself is going to be a success. I think South Africa is ready, and with that being in the same time zone as Western and Central Europe, the ability to stay connected to the event for that Western European marketplace is &#x2013; it's a big advantage. So it's almost like a home-team event for them as far as the time and the ability to stay connected.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. My two are first on the gross margin side. Could you give us some sense of the breakdown of drivers for gross margin, if you look at input costs, discounts, and then currency. And then also on the futures window, just first half versus second half, and are you still seeing that sequential improvement in order trends that you talked about last quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, we usually don't get into quantifying all the drivers. But as I said, some of the key elements of gross margin for the quarter were that we definitely are seeing positive benefit for in-line product costs. That's both a combination of the work we've been doing around lean manufacturing and raw materials consolidation, as well as some of the benefits we're getting from raw materials and freight costs. So it's both how we're managing the supply chain as well as some of the macroeconomic factors; that's an upside.</p>
          <p>We are seeing some increased discounting. It's not to the level it was earlier in the year, but we're still up year-on-year as we continue to work to move through inventories on a pretty expeditious basis. And foreign exchange is a moderating negative, is the way I would frame that. It was a negative impact for Q2, it's getting better than Q1, and we expect over the balance of the year, it's actually going to turn the other way. So as we gave on the guidance, we expect Q3 to be up slightly and then Q4 to be up more significantly.</p>
          <p>With respect to futures, they're definitely a strengthening trend in the back half of the window, and it does reflect the sequential improvement in the seasonal futures.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. My question is about inventories. As we look into the back half of the year with the World Cup, should we expect an inventory build in the third quarter, and could inventories be up as a result?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Charlie. We're not expecting a large inventory build-up. I think you'll see maybe some of it that might be a point in time depending on deliveries. But we're not anticipating any large build-up. We feel pretty good about our order position going in and would expect it to stay relatively consistent.</p>
          <p>I think one of the other things that I would just point out with regards to the inventory performance, because I think there's been some questions if &#x2013; whether we could be maybe under-inventoried at this point, and maybe that's what you're alluding to. I would say that right now, one of the big benefits of our inventory management strategies has been to narrow down some of our product lines and creating a lot more productivity out of the SKU management that we've been doing as well. So I wouldn't expect to see anything out of the ordinary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And an unrelated question. I know you've been making changes to your Apparel business over the last year and instituting a good, better, best strategy and trying to raise the price point in some channels for your Apparel. And I wondered where we were, if you could update us on where we were in that process, and when it will be completed and when we'll start to lap some of the changes you've made in Apparel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, again, we're very pleased with the progress we're making in Apparel. Obviously, much harder hit as a segment than Footwear around the world, and we believe that we've actually navigated it very well. I think we feel much better about the qualitative position that the Apparel has. Our quality has improved, the overall performance has improved. I believe our average price per unit is up. Our inventories are down dramatically, and our performance apparel, which is obviously the cornerstone to what we do from a brand standpoint, has continued to improve, as we pointed out, some of the Pro Combat executions here in the United States, as well as in Europe around the sport of football. So I'm very cautiously bullish on our Apparel position. Certainly has a ways to go in that marketplace; it is still cleaning itself up overall as an industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I want to add, I think we've taken a very proactive role in resetting NIKE Apparel in the marketplace and feel very good, as Charlie said, about the progress that we've made. But I'll also add that the productivity per style is gone way up. We've done I think an excellent job in reducing the numbers of styles, and then increasing the productivity per style. And then as well, I think the opportunity beyond the NIKE Brand and looking at the other brands in the portfolio for Apparel growth remain very strong. So I feel good about the path that we're on to really optimize potential of that, those other parts of the portfolio with regards to the Apparel business.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just want to focus on the China business for a minute if it's okay. And maybe start with the capacity growth for the NIKE branded stores there. I think that in 2009 to-date, that square footage of those stores has been negative, but slowing declines lately, if I'm correct. And I was just wondering if you have any visibility yet on first half of 2010, if we're going to be turning positive based on your current plans. And then finally as you look at &#x2013; maybe as you look at your new store opens for the next year, can you maybe give us some thoughts on how that growth is going to skew between kind of the first-second tier cities versus the third-fourth tier cities, where the domestic brands have a little bit more of a presence today? And maybe your strategy with the different competitive environments in those third and fourth tier cities? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, Michael, your first question there regarding a decline in square footage, that's not the way we see that. We've certainly been adding stores pretty consistently over the last several years. The growth in the last &#x2013; this fiscal year is less than last fiscal year in the ramp-up to the Olympics, but we're still adding store space, and so we're still seeing a net increase in square footage and number of doors.</p>
          <p>With respect to where that is, we still do believe there's some growth opportunity in the higher tier cities, the Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, but we're increasingly focused on the other cities where we are less penetrated and we think there's additional opportunity. So I think going forward, there certainly is going to be a lot more distribution in those lower-tier cities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there any way you could talk maybe a little bit about just how you think about the different competitive environments in those lower-tier cities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is Charlie. Well, I think one of the big advantages in the lower-tier cities is your cost. Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Beijing represent a fairly &#x2013; I mean are fairly consistent with the global retail environment, and your cost bases are much higher. I think in the other cities, you're looking at lower operating costs, which enable us to continue to move forward at a relatively healthy pace. And as you continue to see an economic development or the quote-unquote "emerging middle class" move further and further west, that just represents another large opportunity for us as we look at China as one of the biggest growth opportunities in the portfolio over the next three to five years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good afternoon. I wanted to ask a question about Western Europe. Especially looking at the futures numbers there, constant currency, big improvement over the last couple quarters. What are you seeing in that marketplace? Is there something going on with the consumer, or is it inventory getting more rational at retail? Or are you seeing kind of a stronger consumer than perhaps we had over the last couple quarters? Especially relative as we think about Western Europe versus the North American consumer environment. And then I have another question, too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Omar, this is Charlie. Actually, I think you hit all three points. And I think it's an emerging trend towards a more stable marketplace, but I think that the things that you did mention are all playing factors in the performance of that Western European geography. I think that group has done a great job of really dealing with inventory management through the last nine to 12 months. As we talked, the Footwear business is very stable, still seeing Apparel weak, and that still will represent a pretty large opportunity for us, I think, over the next 12 to 18 months, hopefully. But I think the three points that you raised are all playing factors and playing roles in the health of that overall business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then, if I could actually follow on to Bob's initial question, his bold question on Tiger. As you guys &#x2013; and I know Don has said in the past that you've started to see as a result of the recession some deflation in kind of the endorsement sports marketing environment as some companies who had been involved in sports marketing get out of the business or get out of the activity. Do you expect this to change the landscape at all? How are you thinking about sports marketing overall as you think about the brand over the next three to five years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take that; this is Mark. First of all, I just want to remind you, everybody I guess, that our relationships, the relationships we have with athletes, with teams, are really critical in developing the insights that we need to fuel the product innovation that really distinguishes us in the marketplace, and ultimately the overall business performance of the company. That's hopefully been loud and clear in terms of our messages through many, many years. Though &#x2013; this is a strategy that works. It's helping NIKE win and continue to win in the marketplace, not just over this last year, but over these last 37, 38 years. And I think it's one that will continue to help us extend our leadership as a company.</p>
          <p>I will say that we continue to also look at the &#x2013; or consider the economics of these decisions that we make with regards to sports marketing, as we do, frankly, all of our investments. And the reality is that we participate in an open market, and &#x2013; along with all the dynamics that go with that process. So ultimately, we make those decisions based on the opportunity we believe we have to drive the brand, the strength of the brand, the business, and ultimately shareholder value. And I can tell you that that will certainly not change.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. The Footwear ASPs in the futures orders, can you just give us a sense of are they still going up in the U.S. and globally? And then quickly on China, I think you mentioned a higher demand creation spend for this quarter. Is that against a low comparison last year, or is it ahead of a reacceleration in store growth, maybe some color on what went on there? And then just real quick, I forgot World Cup. Can you remind us how it affects futures? Does it benefit NIKE Brand more than Umbro? Umbro's not in the futures. Could you just remind us how we should think about that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, footwear ASPs are up, both U.S. and worldwide. So the answer to that is yes. The second question, you'll have to remind me. The third one was China demand creation &#x2013; what was &#x2013; ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Second one was China demand creation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>China demand creation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The second question on China demand creation, the answer is yes. That was a fairly low level last year. So we're a little bit more on a normalized pattern now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are you accelerating store growth in China right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we are &#x2013; if you compare it to where we were last year, we're obviously not putting as many stores in. As I answered on the previous question, we are still putting in new stores, but it's not at the pace that it was last year. And as we said, we do believe there's opportunities both in the top-tier and the lower-tier cities.</p>
          <p>And then the third question, I think, was with regard to World Cup impact on NIKE Brand and Umbro. Obviously, from a percentage standpoint, Umbro is a one-category business in football. So they tend to be a little bit more focused on events as opposed to the overall impact on the NIKE Brand. But as an absolute dollar basis, obviously the NIKE Brand business is far larger, and that has a much more significant impact for NIKE, Inc. on the brand side.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. I guess my first question is just on the U.S. business. I was wondering if maybe you'd just talk about the divergence between your direct-to-consumer business and the strength you're seeing there at retail versus obviously the &#x2013; I guess on the wholesale end of the business, given the fact revenues were down in North America. I mean, in Apparel, obviously you're seeing some signs of improvement. Basketball, you saw some strength obviously in the Jordan business. I mean, is it Running, is it &#x2013; can you maybe just talk about &#x2013; I know everyone's managing inventories pretty well, but just your thoughts about the U.S. piece of the business and divergence you saw in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is Charlie. Well, overall, I mean, we've seen &#x2013; well, the numbers speak for themselves. The U.S. business is still down, I think 4%, and our futures are at 4%. So still a relatively challenging environment. We've talked over the last couple of calls about the strength of the brand and some of the share gains that we've had, I think as we've outperformed the marketplace, so to speak.</p>
          <p>I think when you start to look at the overall performance as a market versus retail, I think Mark alluded to the fact of our online business being very strong. We're seeing it as we come into the holiday period. Our outlet store program is driving a lot of our positive results for all the obvious reasons, I think. And I think that we've done a much better job this year in both merchandising and putting the right inventory into those stores as a distribution channel.</p>
          <p>And then I think that when you talk about the in-line stores, the NIKETOWNs and some of those things, the things that we're very encouraged with is the high end and the value that we're seeing, continuing to see, in the high end of the marketplace, driven by innovation and the overall gross margin performance in those stores.</p>
          <p>So when you add it all together, we're comfortable with where we're at with the U.S. business. We feel really good about the quality of the business that we're delivering right now. And as the U.S. economy continue to stabilize and hopefully returns to a growth position, we're in a great position to take advantage of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to add one more thing with respect to the retail performance. Obviously one of the things that many retailers face is tough traffic comparisons. But one of the things driving our retail performance is actually better execution. Our conversion has been better, our product flow has been a lot better, and as a result, those retail stores are performing better operationally, which is driving a lot of the growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could &#x2013; that's helpful. If I can just ask a follow-up to that. When you look at the futures and the backlog trends in the U.S. marketplace, is it fair to say that you're encouraged at least by an improving trend as you look to spring and summer? I think you made the references about China; obviously you're seeing a nice improvement there. But are you also seeing it on the U.S. side of the business as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're seeing some. Cautiously optimistic would be the reference that I use rather often these days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right, that's fair. One &#x2013; just one &#x2013; my second question here is just for Don. When you guys talk about the SG&amp;A spend in the second half of the year being up double &#x2013; I believe double &#x2013; low double-digits, I think you said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it, I mean, fair to say that obviously in the third quarter less of an increase relative to the fourth quarter, and I guess fourth quarter is a combination of World Cup and the Fresh Air campaign, or does the Fresh Air campaign start in Q3? Can you &#x2013; maybe just talk about the variability between the two quarters if you could.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the fourth quarter will be more spending and larger growth because of those two initiatives, among others, in the demand-creation space. So if you look back to last year, that's a lower base, and we do have a fairly significant investment in initiatives this year.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just &#x2013; in the Apparel business &#x2013; I have just three quick ones. On the Apparel business, can you break out the relative performance between branded, licensed, and your lifestyle? The difference in the comps, are they &#x2013; you touched on it, the difference of the sales in the full-price stores versus the outlets. And looking ahead into 2011, given the gross margin improvement that you're speaking of in the fourth &#x2013; in the improving gross margin, how should we think about that looking ahead beyond that, given the hedging and the dollar and so and so forth as far as gross margin, just looking out a little bit further?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So let me just make sure I got the questions here. Your first question was with respect to Apparel, and you were asking about performance versus sportswear apparel, and you were -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Versus licensed. You know, the three &#x2013; I have them three ways, but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's be clear about &#x2013; he said branded versus licensed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Branded, licensed, and lifestyle is what I asked about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Three areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So I think I get the gist &#x2013; I get the question. So the branded piece of the business, which is driven primarily from performance, feel very good about it and actually feel very positive with that on a worldwide basis. We talked about that over the last couple of calls; we continue to innovate. I think your reference to branded licensed is actually the licensed business that we have around our college programs -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; and our club programs in Europe in football. That has remained pretty steady throughout the time period. Obviously we continue to see relatively the same amount of participation in that area on the field. And then off the field the fan-wear piece of it remains pretty strong. We had another fantastic year in college football here in the U.S. I think we've got 48 of the &#x2013; or 46 of the 68 bowl teams, and I think we had 22 out of the top 25 programs this year. So again, a very strong performance here in the USA.</p>
          <p>I think the licensed business, the kids business in Europe around football, has been solid. And then as we ramp up towards World Cup, we'll see a little bit of an uptick in those numbers for Q4.</p>
          <p>And then as far as the lifestyle business, continues to be different almost everywhere in the world. But I collectively would say that it's probably down overall, as you would expect. As we talked about, the Footwear business has not been nearly as impacted as the Apparel business. And the lifestyle apparel business has probably been more impacted than the performance side of that business. So hopefully that answers your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In-line retail versus outlet futures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in the United States, which is really the most material piece of business, the in-line business was down low double-digits, so still in the negative space, but significantly improved versus where it had been say, last quarter. The outlet business up, and driving higher comp store numbers, and I talked about some of the operational drivers a minute ago.</p>
          <p>And then as far as gross margin guidance is concerned, at this point, I wouldn't want to give guidance past this year. We'll certainly get to that as we get into the next couple of quarterly calls.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. One last thing. How big is the overall &#x2013; the Football business? I mean, how big should we think about that, and what kind of growth are you seeing there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on a global basis, that market, I mean, it's &#x2013; the definition of that market gets a little squirrely, but I think from a performance standpoint, when you look at the overall marketplace, you're probably pushing somewhere between &#x2013; you're probably pushing close to 10 billion at retail, and worldwide if you include footwear, apparel, and equipment. I think the big opportunity that we see is the opportunity to bring lifestyle to football and vice versa. And you're going to see a very impactful part of our presentation for World Cup as we move closer, including some of the lifestyle components of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How big is your Football business, as you define it right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, Sam, that's not a number we can disclose. It is one of our largest global categories, though.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you so much. Happy holidays again.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Samuels with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob? Hello?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, sorry, can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, sorry about that. Can you talk a little bit more about the strategy behind the World Cup, and more specifically, how the core brand and Umbro may be thinking about the event a little bit differently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, we are in some ways approaching it in a very traditional sense, where our focus is around performance, and some of the new products that you will see launched as we get closer to the event. I will just say that I am very excited about it at this point.</p>
          <p>And then I think in the &#x2013; maybe the nontraditional sense, I think some of the connectivity and activity that we have going on with regards to consumer connectivity, both on the ground and digitally will be new and exciting. And so I think you'll get a chance to see some of that from the NIKE Brand standpoint.</p>
          <p>I think with regards to Umbro, certainly they are focusing most of their efforts around the English team, which by some reports would be believed to be one of the better teams that the English have fielded in quite some time, and there is quite a buzz around that potential opportunity, and I think Umbro is looking to leverage that as a big part of their approach to World Cup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I'll add that Umbro has a strong history and heritage in the sport, obviously, that we'll be continuing to leverage as part of the effort around World Cup. They have a strong performance position. And then of course we're going to be leveraging the sportswear side of that as well. So I think some sizeable opportunity around Umbro as a brand, as a business leading up to and then through the World Cup.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Operator, we'll have time for one more questioner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly. Our last question comes from the line of Tom Shaw with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, thanks for taking my call. Nice quarter. I guess a question for Don, just in looking at the gross margin guidance, I mean, how are you thinking about some of these changing dynamics around trade barriers, whether it's Latin America or some of the potential changes in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, some of these trade barriers are &#x2013; there's some explicit ones and some implicit ones. Certainly, the explicit ones have started to have an impact, but not material to NIKE, Inc. I'm using an example such as the Brazilian tariff on imported footwear. We also always work through delays at customs. And so far, while those things certainly slow us down and do affect some elements of the supply chain, they really have not yet been material. But as far as just long term, obviously making sure that we have a free-flowing trade environment is very important to us, and we are in a constant dialogue with various governments around the world to try to maintain that flow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And a last one. Any thoughts around how you're going to approach &#x2013; you talked about the China retail business, but how about the rest of the world? You've acknowledged some success with the Laguna kind of action performance store, but how are you going to approach that in-line business really going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think &#x2013; I mean, I'll speak for the NIKE Brand specifically. As we've said, retail will become a bigger and bigger part of our arsenal and our offense. That being said, a healthy marketplace is the most important thing in managing the brand at retail, and then our ability to bring the brand together in ways that maybe partnership retail is not as equipped to do, we believe plays a large role in the overall long-term growth of the brand. And so we'll continue to look for locations throughout the world in the key shopping districts, the high-profile locations, as well as the high-performing locations. So it's going to continue to be a very important part or what we do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me add, part of our strength as a brand is the level of consumer experience that we create at retail. And I will say that our ability to bring all of what we have to bear on the market, on the consumer, has gotten so much better as we've focused on this direct-to-consumer part of our business. I've said consistently that being a better retailer is going to make us a better wholesale partner and force us to actually elevate our game into critical pieces of our business. And I can tell you very confidently that the improvements that we're making to make ourselves a better retailer are definitely benefiting our ability to not only manage our own retail but be a better retail partner, better manage the marketplace, and really make NIKE a better company.</p>
