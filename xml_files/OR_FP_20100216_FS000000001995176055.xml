        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning to everyone. Welcome to this meeting. As usual, we are going to begin with Jean-R&#xE9;gis who will be giving us a few practical recommendations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies. Good morning, gentlemen. Before the presentations begin, I would like to give you a few practical indications on the way the meeting will take place. You will have found headphones for interpretation at the entrance of the room. The channels for the two languages available are indicated on the main screen here. We suggest you switch now to the channel of your choice.</p>
          <p>A telecommunications room with Wi-Fi Internet access is available. The hostesses may take you there. So, we would be grateful if you could switch off your cell phones now or put them on silent. At the entrance of the room, you received the booklet with the tables in both languages that Mr. Mulliez will be commenting and a booklet with Mr. Agon's table will be distributed during the break.</p>
          <p>There are many of you here in the room. Several of you are in the room next door, which will be treated in the same way as this one in particular, during questions. So, I would like to ask Carolien Renaud-Feitz to confirm that they can hear us properly in the room next door.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Carolien. So, on your seats, you will have found a card on which you may ask questions in writing initially. Do not hesitate to do so. The hostesses during the presentations of our leaders will be picking up the cards that you will hand them. And you may of course, ask questions directly whether you are in this room or in the second room. But we'd like to ask you to ask only one question at a time. Please indicate your name and who you represent. And you will be given the floor again later on if you so wish.</p>
          <p>Regarding the broadcasting of this meeting, the whole of the meeting is broadcast live on the website, the loreal-finance.com website. And the presentation will also be available this afternoon. You will be able to download Mr. Agon and Mr. Mulliez's presentations. You can have access to this website from the telecommunication room that I have mentioned. And a light lunch will be served as usual upstairs. And we encourage you to go upstairs immediately after the meeting. Mr. Agon and the Vice Presidents will welcome you there.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Jean-R&#xE9;gis. We are going to do things as usual. We are going to ask Christian Mulliez to present the 2009 results and then we will ask each head of division to tell you about the activity in each of the divisions in 2009 and the prospects for 2010. And I will tell you how I see our results. And since the year 2010 has begun already, I'd like to tell you about the future.</p>
          <p>Christian.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jean-Paul. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This presentation of the financial results of L'Or&#xE9;al in 2009 will include information concerning sales, profit, cash flow trends, the balance sheet situation, and dividend growth.</p>
          <p>As regards to sales, consolidated sales amounted to &#x20AC;17.473 billion, an increase of 0.8% at constant exchange rates. Like-for-like sales decreased by 1.1%. The structure effect is positive at plus 1.9%. It results mainly from the consolidation of Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9; over full year. After an exchange effect, which was negative at minus 1.2%, growth based on reported figures came out at minus 0.4%.</p>
          <p>The currency situation; although overall, we felt the impact of a negative exchange rate effect of minus 1.2%, we did, however, benefit from favorable average trends for the dollar at plus 5.3%, the Chinese yuan at plus 7.1% and the Japanese yen at plus 15.7%.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the pound sterling at minus 10.8%, the Russian ruble at minus 17.4%, and the Mexican peso at minus 13.4% adversely affected our sales growth. You should note that in 2009, the euro accounted for 34.2% of sales, compared with 35% in 2008.</p>
          <p>Let us look at the situation by brands and by division. Professional Products sales were down by 3.3% with the second half at minus 1.5% far better than the first half which came out at minus 5%. Consumer Products sales grew by plus 3.2% and here again, the second half at plus 5.6% was much stronger than the first half at plus 1%.</p>
          <p>Luxury Products are at minus 9% and at minus 2.2% based on reported figures with the integration of Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9;. I would like to remind you that the first half and primarily the first quarter were very difficult in this business. Active Cosmetics is at minus 1.5% with a second half increase of 1.1%.</p>
          <p>The Body Shop came out with a positive trend at plus 0.7%. And lastly, Dermatology, our joint venture with Nestl&#xE9;, Galderma posted another year of double-digit growth at plus 10.8%.</p>
          <p>By geographic zone now, in Western Europe, growth came out at minus 6.3% with the second half at minus 4.3%. North America was at minus 3.4% with the second half at minus 1.1%. Lastly, the new markets, you will recall that until now we've called this zone the rest of the world. As it has now exceeded the milestone of one-third of group sales in 2009, we have taken the view that it deserves the name, which gives a better impression of its dynamism. We have opted for the term new markets.</p>
          <p>Sales growth in the new markets came out in 2009 at plus 7.2% and really picked up from the second quarter of 2009 onwards. Each of the four zones, which together form the new markets, Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Africa-Orient-Pacific achieved double-digit growth in the fourth quarter of 2009. This group of countries, the new markets in 2009 represented 33.3% of our worldwide cosmetic sales.</p>
          <p>The profit and loss account; let's begin by analyzing gross profit. Gross profit came out at 70.5% of sales, compared with 70.4% in 2009, an improvement of 10 basis points. This improvement in a year, which was, however, difficult in terms of sales is the result of the following factors.</p>
          <p>Number one, the improvement in the manufacturing cost of products, mainly thanks, to productivity gains in the plants and gains in purchasing representing approximately 40 basis points. Number two, a technical factor, the end of the step up of Yves Saint Laurent inventories, a technical operation representing about 10 basis points.</p>
          <p>And on the other hand, an extra cost linked to trends in monetary parities, representing about 10 basis points. And lastly, an extra cost linked to the increase of promotional operations, which may be estimated at 30 basis points roughly. And I would like to remind you that this is the effect on gross profit of the advantages offered to customers.</p>
          <p>We should note that the increase in gross profit was particularly pronounced in the second half of 2009. And I will come back to this point later.</p>
          <p>Research and development expenses increased, as we had announced, to reach 3.5% of overall sales. Advertising and promotion expenses represented 30.8% of sales, compared with 30% in 2008. Investment in advertising and promotion expenses was all the more significant as in 2009 we benefited from lower media rates. Investments and support for our brands increased in each zone and in each division.</p>
          <p>I would remind you that advertising and promotional expenses reflect a variety of reality, depending on the divisions and commercial channels concerned.</p>
          <p>In the Professional Products Division, we are dealing mainly with technical training for hairdressers and salon merchandizing; in the Consumer Products Division, media and merchandizing expenses and point of sales initiatives; in the Luxury Products Division, we're talking about media expenses, the cost of beauty advisors, merchandizing and samples; and finally, in the Active Cosmetics Division, the cost of medical visits and media expenses and merchandizing in pharmacies.</p>
          <p>Selling, general and administrative expenses, these expenses declined to 21.4% of sales, compared with 21.5% in 2008. It is of course, in the Luxury Products Division that the decline was most significant, thanks, to the synergy resulting from the integration of Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9;.</p>
          <p>Overall, taking into account all these factors, operating profit amounted to 14.8% of sales down by 5.4%, compared with 2008. Note that at constant exchange rates, this decrease would amount to 4%. It is interesting to note that the decline in operating profitability corresponds to the increase in advertising and promotion expenses.</p>
          <p>Half years, although you are aware that at L'Or&#xE9;al half year profitability levels are by their nature relatively variable, it seemed to us that the difference in profile between the second half of 2008 and the second half of 2009 deserved some comments.</p>
          <p>As you can see from this table, gross profit increased significantly from 69.5% to 70.7% reflecting the efforts made in the industrial world and within our supply chain. Research and development expenses increased from the first period to the second period, advertising and promotion expenses increased significantly, and lastly, selling, general and administrative expenses declined quite clearly by 40 basis points from 21.9% of the overall sales to 21.5% of the sales. And I would add with regard to sales, general and administrative expenses that they declined by 3.7% in the second half of 2009 like-for-like.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the operating profit by division and by branch. The profitability of the Professional Products Division declined slightly in 2009 from 21% to 20%. Profitability of the Consumer Products Division remained practically stable at 18.4% of overall sales. Profitability of the Luxury Products Division decreased by 330 basis points, including 100 basis points corresponding to the dilution resulting from the Yves Saint Laurent acquisition. Active Cosmetics profitability increased very slightly to 20.2% of sales. Across all the cosmetic divisions, operating profit increased from 19% to 18% of overall sales. This is mainly due to a slight increase in research expenses and a strong increase in A&amp;P costs.</p>
          <p>Central expenses, non-allocated expenses declined as a percentage of sales to 3%. The Body Shop, after a challenging year in 2008 due to the crisis which took hold from the fall onwards a period during which The Body Shop makes most of its profit, saw its profitability improve strongly in 2009. There was a temporary freeze on store openings, renewal of the product offering, the better targeted promotional policy and major management efforts which were made in terms of the cost of sales and administrative costs which means that The Body Shop is now on track to continue the improvement of its profitability in 2010.</p>
          <p>Lastly, Galderma our joint venture in dermatology saw its profitability reach 17.4%. Galderma which currently has a very strong product launch policy made significant investments in 2009 to rapidly take new position in acne with its new drug called Epiduo.</p>
          <p>Operating profit of geographic zones, you could see the three zones. You could see that the decline in profitability in Western Europe to 20.9%, which is the result of the increasing weight of R&amp;D expenses and business drivers. In North America and in the new market zone, the lower profitability reflects the increased effort in business drivers.</p>
          <p>Looking at the rest of the consolidated P&amp;L account, finance costs were down and amounted to &#x20AC;89 million which means that they were reduced by half, compared with 2008. The decline in interest rates were significantly stronger than we had anticipated half year &#x2013; half way through the year. All other things being equal, we can anticipate that in 2010, this amount will be slightly lower than what it will have been in 2009.</p>
          <p>Sanofi dividends amounted to &#x20AC;260 million, an increase of 6.3%. Tax amounted to &#x20AC;749 million representing a rate of 27.3%, an increase, compared with 2008 when the figure, as I said, at the time, had been boosted by positive non-recurrent factors i.e., the favorable outcome of tax audits. Note that the rate of 27.3% for 2009 corresponds to the rate that we had anticipated when the first half year results were presented. For 2010 at this stage of the year, we can anticipate that the rate will be stable at around 27% assuming that there are no special circumstances of course.</p>
          <p>Net profit excluding non-recurrent items came out at &#x20AC;1,997 million down by 3.2% and at constant exchange rates down by 2%.</p>
          <p>Lastly, net earnings per share amounted to &#x20AC;3.42 down by 2.1% and at constant exchange rates down by 0.8%.</p>
          <p>After allowing for non-recurrent items that is a charge net of tax of &#x20AC;204 million in 2009, net profit amounts to &#x20AC;1,792 million.</p>
          <p>The non-recurrent items can be broken down as follows. Out of a gross total before tax of &#x20AC;277 million, we have, first of all, &#x20AC;54 million resulting from the depreciation of intangible assets or goodwill and &#x20AC;223 million which results from restructuring costs, that is number one the continuing industrial and logistical reorganization in Europe with the closure of the Albesa plant in Spain, the logistical reorganization in the Iberian Peninsula, the industrial and logistical reorganization in France, and the additional amount for the closure of the plant in Monaco, and this represents a total of &#x20AC;116 million.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the merging of the organizational structures of Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9; and the Luxury Products Division in the various countries concerned amounting to &#x20AC;45 million.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, the continuing reorganization of the L'Or&#xE9;al United States business for &#x20AC;42 million.</p>
          <p>And last point, fourthly, the organization and streamlining of the central and regional structures of The Body Shop amounting to &#x20AC;80 million. I can tell you that the average payback time for these restructuring measures is around three years.</p>
          <p>The cash flow statement now. Gross cash flow amounted to &#x20AC;2,758 million, an increase, compared with 2008. There was a very positive trend in changes in working capital as it decreased by &#x20AC;466 million. Inventories decreased by &#x20AC;170 million and represent 8.5% of sales, compared with 9% at the end of 2008. Trade accounts receivable which were very strictly controlled, declined by &#x20AC;312 million and this corresponds to 14% of overall sales, compared with 14.7% at the end of 2008</p>
          <p>Investments were also strictly controlled at 3.6% of overall sales, compared with 4.3% in 2008.</p>
          <p>Last point, after the dividend payment of &#x20AC;851 million, the residual cash flow comes out at &#x20AC;1.8 billion, which represents very strong growth, compared with 2008.</p>
          <p>Just a few words about the balance sheet now, a very robust balance sheet structure as you can see; the shareholders' equity represents 58% of total assets. The strong increase, compared with 2008 results mainly from two factors. First of all, the profit amount for 2009 and the new valuation based on market price of our stake in Sanofi. Gearing net financial debt amounts to less than 2 billion, &#x20AC;1,958 million to be precise, and a considerable reduction is the result of the performance in cash flow terms. The net gearing amounts to 14.4%, which is lower than the 31.3% figure at the end of 2008.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the dividend now, the dividend proposed to the annual general meeting in April &#x2013; next April amounts to &#x20AC;1.50 per share, which is an increase of 4.2%. So this increase in dividend -we have a new increase in the pay-out ratio at around 44% this year and this bears witness to L'Or&#xE9;al's constant concern to ensure that its policy towards its shareholders is both balanced and dynamic. Thank you very much for your attention.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>[French] Thank you very much, Christian. I'm sure you will have many questions on these accounts later on. Now, we are going to ask each head of division to take the floor now, Jean-Jacques Lebel, Marc Menesguen, Brigitte Liberman for Active Cosmetics, Nicolas Hieronimus for Professional Products. So each one of them will be giving you a short summary of his activity for 2009 and the prospect for 2010 and the future. Jean-Jacques, you have the floor for Consumer Products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>[French] Good morning to everyone. The Consumer Products Division progressed by 3.2% in 2009 and strengthened its positions on the markets, where it is present in the difficult environment that we've seen.</p>
          <p>By major geographic zone, the sales like-for-like were as follows: Western Europe minus 2.8%, North America plus 0.5%, new markets 13.3% &#x2013; plus 13.3%, in the new markets, Eastern Europe plus 10.6% with Russia at plus 16.8, Latin America at plus 13.7 with Brazil at plus 16.2, Asia at plus 16 with China at plus 23.9, and the zone Africa-Orient-Pacific at plus 12.6% with India at 32.7%. So you see that we scored high in all of the BRIC countries.</p>
          <p>For market shares, I will summarize by saying that there was a strong growth in the new markets area and good resistance in the developed countries. In Latin America and Eastern Europe, where we have Nielsen panels, we see how the market share has evolved on this slide. In total, with the Asia estimates, we gained one point on the new markets.</p>
          <p>Concerning developed countries, in North America we gained, in Japan also, in Western Europe, we lost a bit. If I come back to Western Europe, you must distinguish between three categories of countries. Spain gets a yellow card. We lost market share due mainly to private labels and one major retailer, in particular, who chose to push his own brands to the disadvantage of big brands.</p>
          <p>In France, in total, we were rather well-protected overall by our LaSCAD business, which is on the low end segment with great brands, such as Dove and Nesta and our initiatives in the popular organic segment were 12. In countries, such as Germany, Great Britain, Norway, Finland, Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden, we have gained market share.</p>
          <p>Looking at 2009 per major brand at the global level, we can confirm the dynamism of Garnier and Maybelline and for category, there is still great dynamism in skincare, which drives growth ahead of coloring, make-up, and hair care.</p>
          <p>Let's come back now to the strategy. Last year, I had shown you this slide and I can tell you that we achieved all of this. In particular, regarding innovation and geographic expansion, and I will be going into the details of that later on, a new category of deodorants, which we'll be driving 2010 and the sales yield which we have increased.</p>
          <p>Regarding innovation; we have innovated in all the price lines. In 2009, we launched a certain number of products at the low end of the line; for instance, Garnier's Soins Essentiels at &#x20AC;3, L'Or&#xE9;al's Triple Active Jour at &#x20AC;5, Vive Provo hair care at &#x20AC;5.8 for 750ml.</p>
          <p>We have launched spectacular innovations in 2009 at higher prices under the L'Or&#xE9;al Paris brand, S&#xE9;rum Re-Activant Cils number one serum, which visibly grows eyelashes, Mascara Telescopic Explosion and the Roller Accord Parfait Roll'on Foundation.</p>
          <p>[Advertisement]</p>
          <p>I would now like to show you on first the great innovation for 2010, Code Jeunesse, the genomics developed by our laboratories enable us to propose under the L'Or&#xE9;al brand a line of three products, which act on the skin's ability to recover and gives visible results after eight days on radiants and wrinkles.</p>
          <p>[Advertisement]</p>
          <p>For Garnier, the great success is Caffeine Eye Roll-on, we sold over 10 million of these units in 2009 and we're launching the tinted version against lines for the eyes, in 2010.</p>
          <p>[Advertisement]</p>
          <p>That was the lipstick and for Maybelline what we see in 2009 is number of innovations which come from outside of Europe. Three examples, Garnier Men, which was born in India is now deployed in all of Asia. This is the Indian film.</p>
          <p>[Advertisement]</p>
          <p>There also are Garnier deodorants which were born in 2008 in Latin America with B&#xED;-O extended to Eastern Europe in 2009 with Garnier Mineral and launched right now in Western Europe with the Mineral like innovation, which is a patented ingredient with very high absorption and 48-hour efficacy and finally, Els&#xE8;ve Total Repair, which was born in Brazil and it's a global success.</p>
          <p>Now let us move on to the geographic expansion. During &#x2013; for this year where we scored very well in the BRICs, I would like to take a few moments to tell you about these victories. China was a great success. L'Or&#xE9;al Paris with skincare number one growth globally and Men's Expert. In 2009 we launched hair care with enhanced value and great results potential that you can imagine given the size of the market. Then Maybelline, we added in 2009 the facial care product with again tremendous potential given the size of the market. And we wonderfully developed skincare with Garnier with a positioning, which is very complementary to L'Or&#xE9;al and Maybelline. So, China is in a good position to continue its profitable development.</p>
          <p>India had seen a bit of a weakness in 2008 and bounced back in 2009. I was there in January and I can tell you that the economy is very lively, and so is our business. We are active mainly with Garnier on all of our major markets covering with Color Naturals and you see here the latest launch of Fructis shampoo and oil, which is off to a great start and the Garnier Light Skincare.</p>
          <p>I had presented last year the &#x20AC;0.18 skincare sachet and the &#x20AC;0.04 shampoo sachet is now our main source of growth on the Fructis brand because it is the sachet which enables us to extend retail. And that is the number one growth driver and we still have a huge potential. We hope to reach one million by 2013 and it is sold in 350,000 retail sales at the end of '09. With Garnier Men already has the number two men's care and we're launching the sachet to gain in retail sales.</p>
          <p>Brazil is also doing great in 2009 and bounced back after 2008, which was a bit soft. Our hair care business L'Or&#xE9;al and Garnier developed well. There was the launch of Total Repair 5 and Fructis Liso Absoluto, the B&#xED;-O deodorant from Garnier is doing well with a strong foothold on the number one deodorant market in the world. The great surprise continues to be Russia, where we were the only top manufacturer to gain market share. Garnier had a hit with its deodorant, L'Or&#xE9;al with Triple Active Jour, Maybelline also had a very good year.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion for 2010, strong innovation program, regaining market shares in Western Europe, continuing our geographic expansion and maintain our growth drivers with markets which remained positive in 2009 and should perk up in 2010, we are decidedly optimistic.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Jean-Jacques. This is very optimistic concerning Consumer Products. Let us now move on to the Luxury Division, Marc you have the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>[French] Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. To start with, I'd like to give you some information on the market progress over 2009. After tough first half of the year, the luxury beauty market has made a recovery towards the end of the year. The Christmas period was fairly successful. According to our estimates, market sell-out was up by almost 2% in December. Reordering is currently underway, which is an encouraging sign at the beginning of 2010. However, the distribution experienced significant upheavals in 2009.</p>
          <p>First of all, retailers around the world cleared their stocks, particularly on the fragrance market and in certain countries, such as Spain and Italy. Also Travel Retail also experienced difficulties, particularly in Europe and America.</p>
          <p>Lastly, the liquidity crisis strongly affected a number of major luxury markets, including Russia and Dubai. In this context, the Luxury Products Division has evolved in line with the market. An assessment of our retail sales over 2009 shows a drop of 2% worldwide in line with the market and we have managed to maintain our position as number one leader in selective distribution.</p>
          <p>As regards our turnover, our 2009 results are down by 9% on the like-for-like basis and by 2.2% on the reported figures basis, including the incorporation of Yves Saint Laurent.</p>
          <p>2009 was a very constructive year for the Luxury Products Division and we have made three major advances. Firstly, the successful incorporation of Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9;, one and a half year after the acquisition the operation is fully up and running. At head office in each country and at industrial level, the integration is now complete and it has enabled us to achieve numerous synergies by completely rethinking our organizational structures. All in all, the Luxury Products Division's administrative and sales cost dropped by 7% in 2009.</p>
          <p>On the industrial front, we closed two factories in 2009 and regrouped all the division's European production facilities into an industrial center of excellence in the north of France. It comprises different factories, including BRI, the YSL Beaut&#xE9; factory in Lassigny.</p>
          <p>Lastly, the Yves Saint Laurent brand made a big comeback in 2009. Our division's takeover of the brand triggered a fantastic rise in Yves Saint Laurent retail sales in 2009 particularly at the end of the year in December, plus 50% in the U.S., plus 30% in France, and plus 24% in the U.K. And this was due to the success of our 2009 launches: the new men's fragrance La Nuit de l'Homme, first of all, and then Parisienne, the most successful YSL women's fragrance launch for 25 years. Success also for the make-up range with the new Mascara Singulier and the launch of Teint Resist foundation, winner of the Marie-Claire make-up Prix d'Excellence, the excellence award added to the success of top secret skincare, some great creations indeed.</p>
          <p>Second major advance, Lanc&#xF4;me's turnaround. Lanc&#xF4;me is the global leader in the selective distribution channel. It has increased its market share namely in the U.S., in Japan, in China, and this is mainly thanks, to two major skincare innovations. The first one is G&#xE9;nifique, it is the fruit of genetic research. The product turned out to be the highlight of 2009. It received numerous prizes, including the highly coveted Marie-Claire Prix d'Excellence for skincare.</p>
          <p>G&#xE9;nifique has been resounding commercial success all over the world, having already sold two million units. While the Youth Activator, the flagship in the range has become the brand's number one product in terms of value at a retail price of 78$US it offers without doubt the best value for money on the market.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, Lanc&#xF4;me enjoyed its second major success of the year with Absolue Precious Cells derived from 20 years of stem cell research. The product also played an important part in making the brand successful in the strategically important anti-ageing segment. As I announced to you last year, the upturn of Lanc&#xF4;me skincare was a priority for the division in 2009.</p>
          <p>In the make-up segment, Oscillation Power Booster, the first vibrating lush primer had a huge impact in the U.S., while Hypn&#xF4;se Drama has risen to second place in the European mascara rankings. Lanc&#xF4;me, therefore, showed renewed dynamism in 2009. After Kate Winslet in 2009, this resurgence will be boosted by the arrival of Julia Roberts as brand ambassador in early 2010. Julia Roberts will bring to Lanc&#xF4;me her universal fame, unique beauty, and also, her wonderful personality that touch women all over the world.</p>
          <p>Third major advance, the rapid rise of Kiehl's. The turnover at Kiehl's was up by 28% in 2009. Kiehl's is doing extremely well in all continents. As you can see Kiehl's and Body is the new luxury trend within a very original, very contemporary feel, a non-advertising model based on quality of service, commitment to charitable causes, the unique visual identity, and its own brand stores.</p>
          <p>Also note the success in 2009 of the A&#xE7;ai antioxidant skincare line, an organic range that carries the ECOCERT label and of the Rare Earth modifying face care, both of which have made a significant contribution to growth in 2009. The brand success in Asia with retail sales up 80% was one of 2009's highlights.</p>
          <p>Kiehl's achieved spectacular results in Hong Kong where it's of course, number three in terms of distribution and number two in Korea. In 2009 we penetrated the Chinese market where Kiehl's is already leader in the two major department stores. Lastly, Japan opened its first three point-of-sales in 2009 and their initial figures also look very promising.</p>
          <p>As regard 2010, I'm extremely confident for a number of reasons. Number one, people's appetite for luxury remains intact. This was illustrated by the selective market recovery at the tail-end of last year and the trend appears to be confirmed at the beginning of 2010. Travel Retail, which is an important indicator has been back on track for the past few months and Asia is very dynamic also although the continent never felt the full brunt of the recession.</p>
          <p>For us, one country symbolizes that irresistible desire for luxury, China. Sales of luxury beauty products are booming in the sector group at 22% in 2009. We are number one in the country with 27% market share. Lanc&#xF4;me, the market leader is an institution in China and Giorgio Armani is becoming a major player, Biotherm leads the men's skincare market, and shu uemura has been growing rapidly.</p>
          <p>The second reason I'm so confident is the growth of our brand portfolio. We have concentrated on the divisions 10 major brands, which account for 95% of its turnover. And these are, first, the division's three flagships, Lanc&#xF4;me, Giorgio Armani, and Yves Saint Laurent. These three world renowned and multi-acts luxury brands are our priorities in terms of international development. Then come the three so-called growth engines. Besides Kiehl's and Biotherm skincare specialist, Diesel, a fast growing alternative brand to classic luxury, thanks for the launch of the men's fragrance Only The Brave. Three brands with original expertise and business models that attract new younger customers to the luxury market.</p>
          <p>Lastly, four global brands with a strong regional footing: Ralph Lauren, very powerful on the American continent; shu uemura, breaking through with skincare in Asia; Cacharel, a major European fragrance house; and Helena Rubinstein, which is a leading name in key markets, such as Italy, Germany, and China.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, in 2010, we will be pursuing our strategy of innovation starting from first quarter. Lanc&#xF4;me keeps its momentum with three major launches in the first quarter in all three categories. R&#xE9;nergie Volumetry, the major anti-wrinkles derived from research and growth factors. Hypn&#xF4;se Precious Cells, the regenerating new mascara incarnated by Julia Roberts. And finally, a new fragrance, Tr&#xE9;sor In Love, from the month of March.</p>
          <p>After ending 2009 on a high note, Yves Saint Laurent is going to boost its fragrance dynamism with the worldwide relaunch of the legendary Opium, and continue its assault on the make-up segment by launching its Mascara Effet Faux Cils Noir Radical, and the new foundation Teint <mark type="inaudible" /> at the end of February, beginning of March.</p>
          <p>Armani, already the world's leader of men's fragrances, will be showing its expertise with the rollout of its new star products, Rouge d'Armani and Eyes to Kill Mascara before launching a new women's fragrance for the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally, the last priority for 2010 will be to intensify our development in alternative distribution. First of all, we have the brand freestanding stores. We have almost 150 of them in the division today with Lanc&#xF4;me, of course, particularly with alternative brands like shu uemura and Kiehl's. We are aiming to open new stores in 2010 in shopping malls and town centers or in high traffic areas, such as the spectacular railway station of Shibuya in Tokyo.</p>
          <p>Lastly, we are intensifying our e-commerce sales after 2009, in which turnover for e-commerce grew by 30%. We expect growth to be at least as high again in 2010, and we're well-equipped to make this happen. All our brands are developing on the net. Today, Lanc&#xF4;me is the world's leading brand in terms of the number of retail websites online, and we recently overhauled the Kiehl's, Armani, and shu uemura websites in the countries now. In the U.S., the division's turnover from e-commerce already accounts for almost 6% of the country's overall sales, and should reach 10% fairly quickly in the years to come. In China, e-sales of lancome.com.cn, which is the number one beauty website in terms of visitors, grew by 150% in 2009. The brand is doing a fantastic job with the online community in China. After Biotherm and Lanc&#xF4;me, we plan to progressively open several of our brands, all of our brands, to e-commerce in China, a highly promising growth engine for the future in China.</p>
          <p>To conclude, of course 2009 was not an easy year for the Luxury Products Division, but it was a year of construction. The division is highly determined, and extremely well-armed to capitalize on the luxury market's recovery, and gain market share on all continents in 2010, continuing the trend that began in the fourth quarter of 2009, and I can tell you that we've gotten off to a very good start. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marc. We're going to move on to Professional Products, and give the floor to Nicolas Hieronimus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. To comment, the year for the Professional Products Division, it is necessary to understand the evolution of the activity of hair salons, which as you know, were affected by the crisis. The three great variables of salon activity are footfall depending mostly on the frequency of visits, technical services, such as coloring and perming, and the retail of products for homecare shampoos care, or styling products.</p>
          <p>In 2009, as you see on this example, which is Italy, the economic context impacted the frequency of visits to salons, which dropped from eight times a year to 7.6 times, and the retail of products. Technical services did fairly well, only affected by the drop in frequency of visits. This drop of activity in salons, which we globally estimate at around minus 3.5%, created difficulties for the cash flow for many hair businesses, and they reduced their purchase of products imitated by wholesalers and distributors.</p>
          <p>Regarding selling, the global market of Professional Products saw an evolution estimated at minus 0.3% &#x2013; 5.3%, a drop in all the countries outside of Latin America and India, and the drop was particularly strong in the mature countries. In this context, the division achieved a relatively good performance, with sales down by 3.2%, we fared fairly better than the market with now performance in different parts of the world. This out-performance enables us to gain one point in market share, and increase our leadership with 27.3% of the market against 26.6 in 2008.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the major regions, in Western Europe, three major facts must be noted, the strong drop in the Southern European markets, market share gains, which were again significant in Germany, Austria, and Scandinavia, and an acceleration over the last quarter. In North America, we reached a record market share at 36.1%, thanks to our American brands Matrix, Redken, and Pureology, and a better control of our distribution. This control was further strengthened by our two new distributors, Maly's Midwest and Marshall in 2010 added to Idaho, but in 2009, at the beginning of the year, and add to our coverage of the Northeast of the United States.</p>
          <p>In the new markets, we had a year at plus 3% driven by Latin America at plus 8.3%. In 2009, the three main growth drivers for the division were Brazil, China, and India. On these markets, which represent our future, our initiatives on perms or durable styling played a major role.</p>
          <p>Finally, what will &#x2013; has enabled the division to gain market shares again in 2009 are the actions which were decided to cope with the economic situation around the four growth drivers that I had mentioned here a year ago. And despite the negative figures, 2009 was a great year, which is promising for the future. 2009 will remain an exceptional year in terms of innovation.</p>
          <p>Breakthrough technologies offering professional results were brought to hair care with K&#xE9;rastase with Volumorphose, the number one filler using Intra-Cylane and Ol&#xE9;o Relax Slim, the number one durable hair slimmer for sector from L'Or&#xE9;al Professionnel with five times more ceramides for brittle hair is a worldwide success. And there were natural innovations in Bio, but two of the great innovation, is in coloring with Dream Age from Matrix and Cover Fusion from Redken, which gives specific results for mature women in coloring. But the great innovation, which changes the face of the market is Inoa.</p>
          <p>Inoa is a revolution, probably the greatest technological innovation since the invention by Eug&#xE8;ne Schueller in 1907 of the safe coloring for hair, which is very patented oil-based ODS technology for the first time one can obtain wonderful performance for durable oxidation coloring which lightens hair by four tones covers white hair 100% with a wide variety of new nuances without ammonia, no odor and ultimate comfort for the scalp and respect for the fiber.</p>
          <p>Inoa was launched in Western Europe in September of 2009 which means in line with the innovation. There was an event with 4,000 offers in Paris, a high visibility campaign in the professional press and also, in major dailies and this all created a buzz and tremendous enthusiasm and the beauty editors have already have rewarded the product. For the first time in 20 years in the professional circuit, there was a major television campaign which started a few weeks go in France and which will be a standard to all the different countries and on Internet. This is the Inoa film.</p>
          <p>[Advertisement]</p>
          <p>So you have understood Inoa really changes the rules of the game and recruits for the professional circuits and enables us to switch many hair salons, which up until now had not been using our coloring products. This is the case for 8,500 of the 37,000 salons which have already been won over to Inoa since its launch. The second driver for our growth is the stimulation of the development of the market.</p>
          <p>In a circuit, which was losing traffic, we helped the hair salons to weather the storm. We educate them towards business development with the business stimulus kit from Redken, many merchant promotions which stimulated retail sales, new technical services, such as the Riviera highlights with some customers, the recruitment of new targets, such as seniors with K&#xE9;rastase's Age Premium, which is a great success over L'Or&#xE9;al Professionnel. And we also had symposium in Paris inspiration, which demonstrated our affinity with this industry and our ability to develop it.</p>
          <p>In new countries, we are continuing the construction of our high quality hair care and our future through the education and the creation of our first hair academy for L'Or&#xE9;al in Shanghai. And in 2009 the complementarity of our brand portfolio, our third growth driver, played its role fully. With Matrix, which is accessible and it's really effective with many hair salons which are looking for a low cost quality solution. The launches of Matrix, such as Design Pulse and the Asian care were also very successful. From Kiehl's to Matrix each brand played its role. The strategy will be continued this year with even more differences between the brands, also high luxury care, the corner resist from K&#xE9;rastase down to the so-called the Beaut&#xE9; Matrix and the new format with two applications at a very competitive price for the hairdresser.</p>
          <p>Finally, the best performance indicator is our fourth growth driver, salon switching, thanks, to our brand diversity, our ability to understand hair salons and help them develop, which is almost genetic and our ability to innovate with them. This has made L'Or&#xE9;al the preferred partner of hair salons.</p>
          <p>As you have seen in 2009, on a very negative market the Professional Products Division was able to run its four growth drivers to strengthen its leadership. In 2010, we will continue this strategy with new initiatives with enhanced value of the professional circuit, pharmaceutics, the filler care with Intra-Cylane from L'Or&#xE9;al Professionnel or K&#xE9;rastase um and this is all added to the deployment of initiatives at the end of 2009 and in particular. So we are beginning 2010 with a growth dynamism and in an ideal position to accelerate even more as soon as the first signs of activity begin to be felt. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>Then we will now finish with Brigitte Liberman, Active Cosmetics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. In 2009, just as we had forecast the dermocosmetic market resisted rather well between zero and 1%. Our sell out was also slightly higher than market rate which strengthened our position worldwide. Nevertheless, business activity was influenced by de-stocking throughout the distribution network particularly during the first half year.</p>
          <p>In this business context, the Active Cosmetics Division was 1.5% down on the year like-for-like, but returned to a growth trend over the second half year up 1.1%, Western Europe is down by 3.3%. There are two reasons for this result. First a reduction at wholesale and parapharmacy level, second, the difficulties encountered by both Vichy and Inn&#xE9;ov seasonal products. It is worth noting, however, that both La Roche-Posay and SkinCeuticals achieved significant increases in business in all countries.</p>
          <p>In North America, despite 4.2%, I mean, despite negative market conditions, the division achieved a good performance of 4.2% growth. All our brands contributed to this increase. SkinCeuticals increased turnover even though traffic decreased considerably in premium spas and beauty division. La Roche-Posay and Vichy continued their upward trend in American drugstores.</p>
          <p>In the Rest of the World, growth has been essentially driven by Latin America where we managed double-digit growth and as a result, took significant market share away from the competition. Eastern Europe has been severely hindered or impacted by the financial difficulties of certain distributors. Asia achieved double-digit growth during the second half year helped by successful product launches.</p>
          <p>On a global level, the Active Cosmetics Division confirmed its leading position way out ahead of its main world competitors with a market share of nearly 20%. In 2009, this leadership was transformed into four major developments or advances resulting from the division strategy. The first advance was the fact that the division achieved a major breakthrough in the main pharmacy categories, the most important being anti-ageing; the biggest dermocosmetic market in terms of turnover.</p>
          <p>Market leader on this segment, Vichy continued to grow its business, thanks, on the one hand to the launch of LiftActiv Retinol HA, a new generation of retinol which gives visible results on all types of wrinkles and on the other to the revamp of Neovadiol, the product of skin tissue research, which ensures debridging action on signs of the menopause. Then just an onside, the launch of the Elixir Anti-Age by Sanoflore containing lemon balm essential oil from the Vercors region. This has enabled the brand to become market leader on anti-aging in France.</p>
          <p>Acne is the biggest dermatologist prescription market. La Roche-Posay has innovated with Effaclar Duo, a product targeting a new segment for the brand, teenager. Just three months after its launch, this product has become the number one product prescribed by French dermatologists for greasy skin. The launch of Inn&#xE9;ov Imperfection in Western Europe has enabled us to offer an alternative solution to young women with slight acne problems. And because eczema now affects more than 15% of children in western countries, La Roche-Posay launched at the end of the year Lipikar, an anti-irritant, anti-scratch balm developed for all atopic skin types.</p>
          <p>The second advance of the year was the extension of our female consumer base in Europe and this was especially linked to Essentielles, the new Vichy range, which got off to a good start. The range contains five paraben-free, hypoallergenic products for less than 10 year olds to cater daily for the skin's basic needs. This range recommended by pharmacists is proving itself to be a real means of recruiting new customers to the brand and to the channel particularly for high volume categories, such as body care and hygiene.</p>
          <p>Globalization of our brands in 2009 is the third major advance. La Roche-Posay was up 17% in Asia, mainly thanks for the dynamism of the brand in China, which was driven by the Effaclar range for greasy skin and the Anthelios and Uvidea photoprotection ranges. And this is a clear sign of our ability to convince local dermatologists and thereby develop business in these countries.</p>
          <p>In Latin America after having led to 50% increase in the nutricosmetic market in Brazil, Inoa succeeded in breaking into Mexico and has become the number one brand for hair care nutritional supplements. But our mission is also to develop the dermocosmetic market in mature countries.</p>
          <p>SkinCeuticals, the premium and pioneering brand in cosmeceuticals in the United States increased its turnover in Western Europe by 30%. This was driven by cutting edge technological innovations in skincare. The brand is now present in over 1,000 pharmacy stores in Europe, but it's also recommended by beauty physicians and is also available in medi-spas and premium spas, which represent new sources of business for the division.</p>
          <p>Finally, the fourth advance is the strengthening of our links with the professional players on the health market inventing the pharmacy of tomorrow with 300 pharmacists who are opinion leaders from 15 European countries, training more than 50,000 pharmacists and skin advisors across the world to help them to get to know the products better and to provide better advice. Developing new innovative services like Vichy Skin counsel, an expert in exclusive diagnosis for the skin by dermo advisors or actively supporting dermatological associations in 25 countries to implement educational campaigns and skin cancer detection campaigns. These examples are proof of the increase in our key drivers for the coming year and enabled us to look forward to 2010 with a great deal of confidence and optimism.</p>
          <p>The geographical expansion of the dermocosmetic market is an enormous opportunity for our division. As today countries outside of Western Europe account for only 30% of the total market. In this context, our capacity to innovate is indeed a major advantage. We are approaching 2010 with major, major initiatives for each of our brands which I've taken on board recent changes in consumer behavior. Inspired by recent advances in aesthetic medicine, Vichy invented LiftActiv Retinol HA Nuevo which with its real proof of efficacy is the real step forward in the anti-age side. 2010 will also be the year when we rollout Yves Saint de Vichy in Eastern Europe and in the emerging countries.</p>
          <p>Skin types that are allergic to the sun are becoming more and more common. La Roche-Posay is innovating with its Anthelios fluids, thanks, to a new stronger photo protective system with reduced chemical filters, perfume and paraben-free.</p>
          <p>In hair care, Inn&#xE9;ov is creating the first food supplement for colored and fragile hair. It reduces hair loss, strengthens the hair fiber itself, and makes colored hair shine last longer. SkinCeuticals is inventing an alternative to peeling without side effects for all women looking for extreme efficacy.</p>
          <p>And Sanoflore with its honey-based nourishing cream has also got off to a flying start. Biotested and 100% safe on sensitive skin, it is totally in tune with our time.</p>
          <p>Finally, the diversity and complimentarity of our brand portfolio are a decisive advantage. We have an answer for every current consumption trend linking beauty and health. From organic to high-tech, at every price range and across all categories, including Eau de Toilette, and soap with Roger&amp;Gallet joining our division in 2010. We also have an offer adapted to all type of health distribution channels across the world, European pharmacies and parapharmacies, American or Asian drug stores, but also medi-spas, which are developing in every region. We have come out of this year of crisis stronger than before. We now understand our consumers better. We invest in a more efficient and effective way. We have established even stronger relationships with our partners. We are therefore, approaching 2010 with determination and the means at our disposal to grow our business. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Congratulations, I appreciate it. I think that what is very interesting in these presentations is that you really see the difference between our four types of activity. Sometimes people tend to consider that L'Or&#xE9;al is one single unit, but you realize that between the four different branches is four different worlds it's still beauty, still cosmetics, there are synergy in research, et cetera but there are four different activities with four different worlds and each division is fighting this global fight with strong positions and strong chances of success. So, this was very enlightening. So, it is my turn now. So, I would like to provide some perspective on the highlights of 2009 and share with you our vision for 2010 and the future.</p>
          <p>First of all, as usual I'd like to begin with the cosmetics market. After a very difficult start to the year, which was due, as you know, to a contraction in sell-through and a drastic reduction in inventories by distributors, the cosmetics market gradually improved in terms of order income and ended the year with slight growth as we had forecast at last year's meeting here. And growth rates, as you know, were highly variable according to our distribution channel as we had anticipated as well. The mass market segment remain positive, the order income plus 2 to 3% and dermatology and pharmaceuticals were slightly negative at minus 1%. There is an inventory adjustment effects of sell-in, the market was slightly negative at minus 1. The luxury cosmetics market like many luxury markets contracted. We consider that, it's about minus 6%. And finally, the hair salon channel also had a hard time. We were not so much surprised for the other channels, but this circuit surprised us a bit with a negative trend that we estimate at about minus 5%. So, weighted the overall, the total is plus 1%.</p>
          <p>Market trends were highly differentiated by region. Western Europe contracted by minus 1.2%. You have to be careful with the figures because they are fairly recent. Europe was very impacted by the southern countries, countries that people talk a lot about these days, such as Spain which really had difficulties on its market. North America also shrank by about minus 2.2%. But the very good news for the year is that the rest of the world markets which we now call new markets maintained very strong growth around plus 8.9%. I don't know whether it's plus 9% or plus 8.9%, but it's in that order of magnitude, plus 11 Latin America, nine in Asia outside of Japan, and 7.5% Eastern Europe, 7.5 for Africa-Orient-Pacific.</p>
          <p>So, this spectacular divide confirms that the cosmetics market is indeed shifting gradually towards the new markets as we have frequently mentioned. Today, this group of regions which account for 85% of the world's population already represent 50% of the global cosmetics market and the proportion is rising every day. Demand for cosmetics will follow population trends. This is a unique opportunity for growth for L'Or&#xE9;al over the next 20 years because we are now firmly established in all these countries and we also have a competitive edge. We have the ideal brand portfolio to succeed, given the remarkable attraction of women in these countries for the major leading global brands.</p>
          <p>So to sum up, the global cosmetics market proved very resilient in 2009 which clearly illustrates how strong consumers are attracted to beauty products. These consumers are more than ever sensitive to innovation, quality and efficacy in the products that they use. In terms of price, their buying behavior was not transformed totally by the crisis as some had feared. The market did not depreciate in value. There was no spectacular trading down as some feared. The low end brands and private labels did not see their market shares skyrocket. But there is no doubt, however, that consumers are paying closer attention than ever before to value for money. They are willing to spend for money &#x2013; their money for quality and performance, but they expect to get what they pay for at a price that they feel is fair. So, here in this slide our strategy of accessible innovation seems rather more appropriate.</p>
          <p>L'Or&#xE9;al did a good job of weathering the crisis throughout 2009. As the division managers have reported in their respective channels, the group strengthened its leadership on the cosmetics market in 2009. The Consumer Products Division grew faster than the market as a whole and won market shares worldwide. These events were very strong in the new markets and the division's objective is to accelerate the international rollout of its three main brands L'Or&#xE9;al Paris, the world's leading brand of mass-market beauty products offering excellent value for money in both quality and performance terms, the aspirational brand for women around the world. Garnier, which is the brand, which is in tune with its time, it's simple, natural, green, effective and great value for money. And Maybelline the world's leading make-up brand, all the modern and seductive trendiness of New York at very accessible prices.</p>
          <p>These three brands together offer a complete and targeted response to the needs and expectations of all women on all continents. The division is poised to take maximum advantage of the cosmetics market shift towards the new markets winning over hundreds of millions of new consumers both men and women in the years ahead.</p>
          <p>The Luxury Products Division experienced a difficult year in a context that was itself exceptionally difficult as you know. The market did contract, although, but it is true also that our division showed a sharper downturn to the market as a whole. There is a simple explanation along with a very difficult context. The acquisition and integration of Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9; made the challenges facing our subsidiary far more complex over an 18-month period and created a significant distraction for the entire division.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, there is some very good news. The integration phase is over now and behind us. The division is now going to be able to take advantage of the recovery of the luxury sector and bounce back as early as the first quarter of this year. The re-launch of the Yves Saint Laurent as Marc Menesguen has shown is a great success, it is proving highly successful and it is our ambition to make the brand one of the top global brands. This acquisition is a major strategic coup.</p>
          <p>The Professional Products Division as Nicolas Hieronimus showed explains a highly contrasting year in 2009 difficult in terms of sales at minus 3.3% but objectively very strong in terms of performance in its market, setting all-time records for recruiting new salons, market share gains in every division, and landmark innovation with Inoa.</p>
          <p>So overall, the division backed by its tradition of expertise, which is G&#xE9;nifique as Nicolas was saying its unique brand portfolio, its capacity for innovation, and its global presence, the division has everything it takes to continue winning over thousands of new hair salons all around the world year-after-year, and therefore, steadily strengthen its leadership in the professional products market.</p>
          <p>The Active Cosmetics Division consolidated its number one position in the global dermocosmetics segment in 2009, as Brigitte indicated the division is still mainly-based in Europe and will be able to take advantage in the future of the global trend as consumers' expectations move towards health-oriented brands and benefit from the international expansion of retail through pharmacies and drug stores.</p>
          <p>The Body Shop proved resilient in the crisis and even achieved slight sales growth in the retail market that was hit very hard. It implemented a policy of worldwide launches of core products, such as the organic skincare range, Nutriganics, the fragrance Love et cetera and The Originals range all three have been highly successful. And this has led to a significant improvement of the profitability of The Body Shop.</p>
          <p>Lastly, the Galderma achieved another great year of double-digit growth in its order income and again, made very significant market share gains, thanks, to the success of its new products and a successful integration of the acquisition of CollaGenex. Galderma is gaining considerable momentum in its drive for growth, which should in fact, even accelerate in 2010.</p>
          <p>In terms of regional performance, the salient feature in 2009 was a sharp contrast in growth rates. Western Europe with growth at minus 6.3% suffered from inventory reductions to fight erosion of market share and the particular impact of the crisis on Southern European countries like Spain and Italy, where our positions have been historically very strong.</p>
          <p>In 2010, one of the top priorities of our four divisions will be to start gaining market share again in Western Europe and resume growth. The strength and quality of our new product launches, as well as the power of our growth drivers mean we are confident in our ability to attain this objective.</p>
          <p>In North America, our market shares have extended slightly and our positions are solid and we are poised to take advantage of the recovery in the American market as soon as it begins. Hereto, we think that we will return to growth in 2010.</p>
          <p>The excellent news that came in 2009 was our gradual return to a strong growth in the new markets zone with large market share gains in all divisions and double-digit growth in all regions during the fourth quarter, plus 17.9% in Asia excluding Japan, plus 11.4% in Eastern Europe, plus 10.3% in Latin America. In 2009, many countries recorded very strong growth so Korea plus 36, India 32, Ukraine 30, Indonesia 22, China 16, Argentina 16, Brazil 15, Chile 14. Our four divisions are on the offensive and all these new markets, the BRIMC countries have all returned to growth with recovery of growth also in Russia and Mexico at the end of the year supplementing the performances of China, India and Brazil.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we are directing our efforts strongly towards growth-relay countries, such as Ukraine, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Turkey, and south Africa where we intend to accelerate the pace of our growth.</p>
          <p>Finally, the opening of our new subsidiaries in Vietnam, Egypt, Pakistan and Kazakhstan constitute additional steps in our globalization strategy. All in all, the new markets zone doubled &#x2013; has doubled every 10 years since 1990, as you see here 8% in 1990, 19% in 2000 and probably 36% in 2010. The acceleration is spectacular and the shift is taking place right now. After outstripping sales in North America in 2007, the new market zone will probably overtake Western Europe within two to three years and will account for more than 50% of total sales in less than 10 years from now.</p>
          <p>You must understand that this is a fundamental change in the history of our company. For decades now we have built our growth on a strategy of intensive penetration targeting a limited, rather limited number of consumers primarily in Western Europe and North America. The emergence of new markets with huge population, such as China, India and Brazil opens up fantastic and new opportunities for us to grow through extensive penetration of a very large number of potential customers.</p>
          <p>Our aim is to seek out, win over and secure the loyalty of one billion new consumers in these countries within the next 10 years, and so double the number of women and men to use our brands and our products around the world. We have the best assets for meeting this goal. First of all, the most attractive diversified and comprehensive portfolio of brands in order to fulfill all desired and all needs of consumers in these markets, research and development centers on all continents to formulate products that are both the most effective and the best suited to the needs of all these consumers, women and men, marketing hubs in all the major strategic countries capable of inventing major star products, both local successes and international blockbusters as Jean-Jacques Lebel has indicated. And now everywhere we operate we can rely on local industrial supply chain and commercial task force to develop our businesses in all these countries at full speed.</p>
          <p>This expansion will mark a new face in L'Or&#xE9;al's great adventure. It's a tremendous business opportunity to trigger a new acceleration of our sales growth, our profit growth, and these large sales increases will have a powerful leverage effect on the profitability of our subsidiaries and therefore, across new markets as a whole.</p>
          <p>Coming back to 2009, we devoted the year to preparing for the future and this entailed three major strategic changes. The first one is a new strategy for broadening our consumer base, the second one is an in-depth transformation of the company, and the third one is a determined strategy to boost investments in research and in growth drivers.</p>
          <p>The first pillar of this new strategic orientation is the broadening of the consumer base. In the current period of crisis, we realized that excessive value adding might narrow down our consumer target and result in niche products that would not drive the growth of our unit and our sales. Our new strategy is, therefore, what we call accessible innovation. But I would like to explain what accessible innovation is all about.</p>
          <p>Innovation is more important than ever because cosmetic is a supply side market and is driven by innovation. Secondly, we, call it, accessible because our aim is to position the prices of new products in such a way as to optimize volume and value, or in other words, to find each product right price. The one consumer's being fair given the level of innovation, quality, and performance we are offering them and that they're prepared to pay for. The term right price is in no way a synonym for low price. That has to be clear. For example, the most powerful success in 2008 was the G&#xE9;nifique by Lanc&#xF4;me. It costs &#x20AC;78 in the perfumery channel. There were 2 million units sold. There is another major resounding success. Inoa presented by Nicolas Hieronimus, which sells at a price 20% higher than marginal, but it's also the most significant hair color innovation in 100 years. We also have another product, the Roller Accord Parfait, which sells at &#x20AC;15, which means that it's more expensive than a traditional foundation, but it's selling like hot cakes.</p>
          <p>So as you can see, accessible innovation is by no means a trading down strategy or low pricing strategy, so it's not a trading down strategy, it's rather a trading right strategy. And this is demonstrated by the fact that our value effect remained positive in 2009 at plus 2.3%.</p>
          <p>As for the entry-level product concept, this is a different idea from accessible innovation and a far more minor issue. Our goal with products such new Essentielles by Vichy is simply to attract customers of lower cost competitive brand to try Vichy quality. We want them to try the Vichy quality. They come from other channels. The intention for this product is that they should remain very marginal in sales terms, probably less than 5% of overall brand sales.</p>
          <p>The second pillar of the strategy is the broadening of the consumer base also through extensions into new categories. Simply stated, and I'm sorry to be using English words in French here, what we want to do is to leverage our R&amp;D expertise, our brand equity and the capacities of our plants and sales forces to take our positions in certain product categories that we had rather left by the wayside in recent years. For example, as Jean-Jacques Lebel showed us the example of deodorants, where our initiatives in Eastern Europe and Latin America are meeting with resounding success. And naturally these are wonderful opportunities for further growth.</p>
          <p>The third means of broadening our consumer base is by geographic expansion. I've already mentioned this. We want to step up the international expansion that I mentioned earlier with the billion new customers we want to seek out and this is our company's key aim for the next 10 years. In 2009, we also began or accelerated fundamental transformations in the company to streamline it, to simplify it, and make it more flexible, more productive and more efficient. We have continued our industrial reengineering in every area, centralization of purchasing with very substantial cost savings, closures of industrial sites with no future, better utilization of equipments, and major advances in productivity.</p>
          <p>All of this has enabled us, despite slight drop in volume, to improve our gross profit by 10 basis points. And all these measures will continue to have a positive impact of course, on our gross profit in 2010. Similarly, the major advances that we have made in supply chain have led to a substantial reduction, as you've seen, in inventories and trade accounts receivables and have led to a spectacular improvement in our cash flow situations.</p>
          <p>We have accelerated our reorganizations in France and in all countries in the world to optimize our structures and our operating processes and to improve support services. Finally, we have also grappled with the issue of costs by freezing hiring, as you know, except for junior staff in the developed country by freezing the head count in the new market countries by cutting our travel expenses almost by half and by carrying out restructuring whenever and wherever needed for example, in North America or at The Body Shop. All of these efforts have resulted in cost reductions in absolute value, the first one in a very long time to 10 basis points in relative value despite the absence of sales growth.</p>
          <p>The third major change in 2009 was also the decision to proactively increase our R&amp;D and A&amp;P investments. Research and development budget grew by &#x2013; despite the recession by almost 4%, 20 basis points in 2009. And 2009, as you've seen, that was an exceptional year for innovations and progress, 674 patents were filed. We are determined to continue to increase the research budgets at least as rapidly as the rate of sales growth each year because we are convinced today more than ever before that it is the innovation, quality, efficacy and safety of our products that will enable us to stand out from our competitors.</p>
          <p>We've also increased our investments in P&amp;A sales by 80 basis points to strengthen support for our brands and products to give a new impetus to organic growth and to support our quest for new markets. This effort, coupled with a substantial drop in media costs in 2009, has led to a significant increase of our share of voice on every continent.</p>
          <p>We are confident that it will also lead to an acceleration in organic growth. In 2010, our intention is to maintain high level of investments in A&amp;P means while at the same time, undertaking an in-depth analysis and an all-out optimization of the productivity of our advertising and promotion resources to make sure that every euro we spend in this area generates maximum additional growth.</p>
          <p>All-in-all, in 2009, we did what we said we would do. And even though our results declined slightly in absolute value due to the trend in our sales, I consider them to still be at good quality. We have an improvement in gross profit, increased investment in research, increased investments in growth drivers and reduction in costs.</p>
          <p>In fact, despite the very challenging context, what we've done in 2009 is set in motion again the famous virtual circle of L'Or&#xE9;al, which is the traditional engine that drives the development of the company with good quality results, record cash flow situation, a very robust financial situation, a new strategy to broaden the consumer base. The company that is being transformed in a virtual circle once again set in motion. L'Or&#xE9;al has prepared itself well in 2009 to trigger a new dynamism in its sales and profit growth and it is now ready to outperform its market in 2010.</p>
          <p>We have in fact, gone off to a good start and we should be able to post a handsome growth rate in the first quarter. There should be fairly good increase and it is this confidence which has prompted us to propose the increase in dividend by 4.2% to 1.50 euros. 2010 is in fact, the first year of our new century, because as you know, we celebrated our hundredth anniversary last year.</p>
          <p>I'm convinced that 2010 will also be the first year of a new phase of expansion for L'Or&#xE9;al bolstered by new strategy and a new historic opportunity, which is the shift to the cosmetics market &#x2013; the shift of the cosmetics market towards the new country. Our mission and our ultimate purpose of the company are clear. We want to bring the world's men and women the best of cosmetics in terms of quality, efficacy, and safety, so as to meet all their beauty needs and desires in the infinite diversity. As I told you earlier, we set ourselves the target of doubling the number of men and women using the group's products within 10 years and that's winning over one billion additional customers.</p>
          <p>Our goal is us to consolidate modest, but lasting growth in Western Europe and in North America and to establish strong and sustainable growth in the new markets. We have everything it takes to be successful in this new adventure, the industry's number one R&amp;D force, the finest portfolio of international brands and talented, committed and enthusiastic team.</p>
          <p>We are emerging from 2009 not only stronger, but also revitalized. We have adapted and transformed ourselves. Our energy and our ambition have been renewed. The company is on the move. Our strategy is clear. Now, let's implement the strategy. I can tell you that we all determined to ensure that 2010 will be a very good year, the first year of our new century. Thank you very much.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Celine Pannuti, J.P. Morgan. I have three questions. Could you please explain the reasons for the deceleration of growth in western Europe and in luxury during the fourth quarter? My second question is on the A&amp;P expenses you spoke in your presentation. How do you access the return on investment? How can you explain that there is such a strong acceleration of that? And then for Q1, third question, you spoke about a noticeable improvement. What does that mean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I had bet with Christian Mulliez that you would ask me what noticeable soft figure meant for the Q1. So, I think most of you were disappointed that we didn't have a fourth quarter, which was accelerating full speed. There are several reasons to that. I think you must look at the figures very closely.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter globally &#x2013; I don't think we need the cards anymore. So, during the fourth quarter, if you look at the divisions for the consumer products division, as you saw, there was a great performance, nice growth globally, slightly above the other companies. So, I don't think there's any comment on that. Active Cosmetics also picked up well towards the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Professional products, as Nicolas indicated, are still in a market which is a little difficult. Professional products are gaining market share, but despite that, hair salons have not really seen an increase in visits to hair salons by consumers, neither in North America nor in Western Europe. Business is still a bit slow.</p>
          <p>And I think the only major difference between what we could expect, and what was achieved, is in luxury, and I think there is a reason behind all that. You know that traditionally, the end of the year is a period where we have launches, initiatives, because there's the holiday season. It's a major period for sales. And we always bet that sales will be good, and that we will start the next year on a good basis.</p>
          <p>We were little dampened &#x2013; our enthusiasm was dampened at the end of 2008, we felt it was not up to expectations. So, we voluntarily this year were cautious regarding the luxury products that we made available. And so we didn't really know what the end of the year would be like, so we were cautious. So, the good news is that the end of the year was fairly good.</p>
          <p>The second good news is that precisely, we're going to find ourselves at the beginning of the year with an inventory situation for our major products in the luxury division, which is healthy, low inventory; and this should give us a good beginning for 2010. We'll be able to bounce back.</p>
          <p>The other question is on A&amp;P, advertising and promotional costs. This represents a 2 to 3% increase. So, it's true that it's brave, it was brave because it was during a year where the context was difficult and many other companies reduced their expenditure in that area. We decided to proactively go in the opposite direction. And we also had more favorable conditions in the media. But it's not a tremendous increase. And this is no secret &#x2013; or maybe it is &#x2013; but the increase was mostly towards the end of the year.</p>
          <p>And maybe the 0.8% difference, increase, was despite mostly towards the end of the year, and the very last month of the year. In our industry, a lot of people stop investing at the beginning of December. We really continued investing all the way to the end of the year. Those of you who live in France, were able to see a very nice L'Or&#xE9;al Paris two and a half minute long ad just after the speech of the President of the Republic, so &#x2013; which demonstrated our presence in the various last hours of the year. So, we really expect results at the beginning of the year 2010. We did a lot of things in 2009 to prepare well for 2010. This is a strategic choice that we made, and we will see &#x2013; we will see in the next quarters whether this was a good choice, but we're pretty confident.</p>
          <p>There is one point you've raised which is correct, when you have investment amounts which are that large, you have to be as good as possible in the analysis of the performance of the investments, and what we've decided to do with the four managers of the divisions each in their business, because the advertising and promotion material is very different in the different areas. For Nicolas Hieronimus, it's equipment for hair salons, training of the hairdressers; for Marc, it could be beauty advisors, counters; for Brigitte, it's the visit by the representative that visits the doctors. And what we've decided to do with the four heads of division is to optimize in a ferocious way, so to speak, the sales yield for each of the different circuits, and try to really analyze the productivity of each of these resources to optimize our expenditure. Nicolas has begun doing this. He may wish to say a word for his division, where he has analyzed the investment, which is the most productive or least productive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I can say a word about this. For Professional Products Division, the number one means of promoting is training and events for hairdressers, but there is also point of sales advertising and the press at large everything that goes into the hair salons. And we did a study on several thousands of women to ask them about the advertising that they encountered, what was likely to affect their behavior in terms of hair color, et cetera? So, a very factual survey, I won't give you the exact conclusions of the survey, but this has enabled us to refocus our advertising and promotions for the year 2010 on elements, which in the form and the content will clearly influence the behavior of the consumer, compared with other means that we were using in the past, which may have looked good, but which were less effective. It's a touch point survey that we carried out during the second half of 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is one of our top priorities. This is Mr. Agon. This is our priority for the year 2010. We wish to refocus our budgets. We're not going to tell you exactly towards what resources, because there are competitors who might benefit from this, but it's a major shift in investment decisions.</p>
          <p>So third question, the first quarter, you said what noticeable acceleration &#x2013; I'll leave it up to you to interpret, but I'm sure you can interpret. I'm sure you have a lot of an imagination, Celine, and I'm sure you can very clearly imagine what this means, but you have seen that we are confident and what I would like to say is that, from my personal point of view, I don't think it would be very reasonable to extrapolate from the last quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year. Further questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[French] Oppenheimer. Could we have an idea of the organic growth for the year per category of product, skincare, make-up, hair care, et cetera that you give us traditionally? Next question, there was a share buyback option, these past months &#x2013; when would you be lifting that option?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I'm going to get Christian to answer that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think a table will show up on growth per category. [French] I should have the table on the screen in front of me, it's difficult for me to read behind my back, but I'm willing to do anything. I'm not asking for much.</p>
          <p>So, as you see, growth per category, skincare and sun products, that's the number one category at L'Or&#xE9;al. And I believe that this will continue to be the number one category and further strengthen its position in Asia, in particular, China, the number one product is skincare. It's important to them. And it's also the category on which we have the best gross margin. So, the more skincare increases proportionately in our business, the better increase for our gross margin, and that is indeed related to the good results we had on our gross margin. We had great successes, such as G&#xE9;nifique from Lanc&#xF4;me.</p>
          <p>Haircare went down by 1%, but we have initiatives which started at the end of 2009, we believe we're going to return to growth. Make-up was slightly negative, especially in the luxury department. This may be due to inventory reduction. Make-up was one of the categories which was the most affected by inventory reduction. There are many different references per colour, so this means higher inventories. Coloring, plus 1.4 and fragrances suffered a lot, mostly from inventory reduction. Sales weren't down that much, but there was a double inventory reduction in points of sale and also, in the consumers' homes. Some consumers have two to three bottles of perfume and in difficult times, sometimes they finish up one bottle before buying a new one. So, we're confident that the fragrance market should pick up again and hygiene and miscellaneous, you have the figure here. On the share buyback from Christian.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a balance sheet structure, which is very solid, strong improvement of the cash flow. We aren't excluding the principle of a buyback operation, but we're convinced that the best way of improving wealth for the shareholder is to carry out acquisitions. And you will have seen that we have announced a noticeable increase in the payback ratio, and that is one way of returning funds to our shareholders and the payout ratio, the dividend, it has increased.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>One question, general question, in the line of what the CFO has said, you have a good structure, a good balance sheet for this year, compared with last year, it has produced a lot of cash, given what you have said, we believe that this will continue. I would like you to tell us, because I'm more positive than what I've heard on your value, 2009 had a difficult context. These are not problems for the company. We fully agree with you, Jean-Paul Agon. So, this will generate cash, in the five to 10 years to come, is there a division that you plan to develop more than the others? Do you plan major acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for this excellent question. I fully agree with you. I would like to answer on what you've said. You may agree or disagree, but my feeling deep down inside is that 2009 was a key year. It's a year &#x2013; for 18 months the cosmetics market stopped. L'Or&#xE9;al stopped &#x2013; was interrupted in its growth and sales at the profit end, but it's a key year because it's a year during which we changed a lot of things. We changed our strategy. We strengthened the company regarding growth drivers in terms of research, redefined the development strategy, redefined a clear mission for the group, which is to go find these billion consumers since the market is switching towards the new markets. And as user, I agree that 2009 was a key year and the very good news is that, that year is now behind us and we are now in 2010 and we have a clear strategy and strong ambition.</p>
          <p>Coming back to your question, in terms of division, you've seen that we are on four parallel markets. This is important to understand in our business &#x2013; the four channels, the four circuits are fairly parallel, and the role of each of our divisions is to maximize its growth, its market share in each of the distribution channels. And this is what they each do, and one division will be playing the role of the scout, so to speak, and that is the Consumer Products Division, where we open up new countries, such as Ukraine, Indonesia, Egypt, Pakistan, and others, or India. Obviously, it is through the Consumer Products that we are able to penetrate into the market, that we're able to concur these millions of new consumers and this is probably the division in which we're going to be investing the most in the years to come, because that is the division which will give us &#x2013; open up our presence in these countries.</p>
          <p>But each division has its plan, its strategy, its way of developing its leadership. Apart from Consumer Products, the three divisions are the leaders in their channel. Brigitte is the leader in dermal pharmacy. Her role is to widen her activity and globalize her activity. The Luxury Products Division is the leader in the selective distribution channel for luxury, and we wish to strengthen our leadership and Nicolas Hieronimus is the leader on Professional Products.</p>
          <p>So if there really is a division where it is our feeling that the expansion will take place, will be there, it is that area because we have so much expertise and know-how in that channel that I think the road is wide open for growth for us. The challenge will be for Jean-Jacques to go looking for these billion new consumers, women and men, and he seems very confident and determined.</p>
          <p>Now regarding cash, as Christian Mulliez indicated, we have a very good balance sheet. We have a very robust financial situation. Nobody's talking about us anymore. A year ago here commentators were saying, oh my god the number one priority for a company is to have a healthy balance sheet, a year later, it's gearing. Okay, that's the way it goes. But a robust balance sheet remains a good thing for a company. Gearing is down to 14%, and so you've seen the numbers, we have a very good balance sheet. We will be giving money back by increasing the dividend, but we also have a stash which will enable us to carry out acquisitions, small, medium, or large, which might show up in the years to come.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have two or three questions. First question on the gross margin, sales remained fairly low in the second half, but gross margin increased quite a lot. So, if there's an increase in sales again, could we have an idea regarding the impact on the gross margin and what will happen in 2010 and later? That's a good question for Christian.</p>
          <p>Secondly, you said that you have more A&amp;P expenses, you invest more, but you said that you wanted to know exactly what was the return on investment, you've investigated that issue. So, this is return on sales investment that you want to understand. Is that a new trend at L'Or&#xE9;al, something new, which you're doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've never thought of doing that before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, but joking apart. Honestly, is this a new issue? Is this a redoubling of effort we are talking about here or is it really something that you would engage in systematically, something you will want to understand exactly where your money goes, trying to increase the return on investment and reduce the cost when &#x2013; the original return on investment and increase the costs, what that is. And you were talking about the cosmetic markets in 2009. You had made good predictions back then, good forecasts. So, what are your forecasts for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'd like to thank you very much for your question. It is true that a year ago in this very room, I had said that the cosmetics market would end up on a slightly positive note. And there were some doubts amongst the analysts in this room, and yet my forecasts were correct.</p>
          <p>So I would not venture to say that I'm always right, nevertheless, but I think &#x2013; we think &#x2013; today that the market should speed up further. But we should not regain our previous level of previous years. We had a market of plus 5%, if I remember correctly in 2007, and then plus 1% in 2008. And we should probably be in between 5 and 1%. So, probably plus 3% is a reasonable forecast.</p>
          <p>This may be of interest to you, what we can see is that the mass market products have been on the increase in Western Europe, not in North America, not yet. There's a very strong growth of course, in new markets, which I've already said. Luxury markets are stable at a relatively high level in Western Europe, and not yet in North America. Maybe &#x2013; well, January is slightly positive, so maybe there is a trend there. But a slight increase only for the time being.</p>
          <p>Active Cosmetics, same thing. We have some uncertainties regarding hair salons. However, we're really waiting for the sales to go up and for the number of visitors to go up. But it will happen. It's all due, of course, to the mood of our consumers, and hopefully, people will get more optimistic and the sales will benefit from this.</p>
          <p>Second point, of course, we didn't wait for 2009 to wonder about, as you said, where our money has been going, and the return on the money invested. I would like to maybe do away with the myth. When we say 30% of A&amp;P costs, people get the impression that we're really playing with very large amounts of money, hundreds of millions of euros in advertising, and so on.</p>
          <p>When we talk about A&amp;P means, or sales view, we're talking about recurring investment in each and every distribution channel. And what we want to do is invest in order to allow for these brands to take off.</p>
          <p>Take Active Cosmetics, for example. There's a fairly limited amount dedicated to advertising. Only Vichy is doing some advertising, but there's a very large part, for example, at La Roche-Posay for medical villages. I mean, this is not money that you throw out of the window and you don't know where it's going. It's very well targeted, very precise, it's very concrete.</p>
          <p>We invest in hairdressers, for example. In luxury products, we have counters with salespersons. At the Galeries Lafayette, for example, you have to pay for the desk, you have to pay for the sales person, you have to pay for the samples, otherwise you can't have a footprint at a Galeries Lafayette department store. So, it's not like we're juggling with millions of euros. These are serious, recurrent investments we're talking about.</p>
          <p>However, we should point out to the fact that there was a recession indeed, that the world has changed, and we have to take that on board. But the world is in flux, that's what Nicolas Hieronimus has been doing and he did this in a very smart way. Changing trends also create opportunities for changing attitudes and expectations on the part of our consumers. So, we have to readjust, we have to shift our investment priorities according to different criteria. That's exactly what we are going to do in all three divisions, in the other divisions &#x2013; Nicolas has already done this &#x2013; and paved the way for this trend in 2010. Maybe Mr. Lebel should tell us more about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the consumer division, first of all, how do we buy our media space? That's very important and it's a good measurement. You know that when there was a period deflation, it was less expensive. In Western Europe, it's 8 to 9%. But we have negotiating clout, strong negotiating clout, which means that we have double-digit percentage here. We do roughly twice the market deflation rate.</p>
          <p>Just to give you an indication in 2010, we think that there will be a further improvement in our media purchasing condition. So, that's the first measurement that we can talk about, the measurement of our performance and the efficiency of our investments. So, our money is money well spent.</p>
          <p>Another factor is very simple. You know that our brands are centralized, product and brand creation happens in Paris in a centralized way. The same film of the same video will be shown the world over. Whereas a few years ago it wasn't like that. It's not like every country would shoot its own film, but it was fairly often that we would have film production costs that would increase four-fold, five-fold, six-fold to maybe present to the world over. So, now we have streamlined our costs.</p>
          <p>We are also using top-notch technology, so that means that we have a good evaluation method for the types of campaigns that we launch. We have a number of weeks during which these campaigns are shown, several methods can be used to look at the quality of what has been produced. So, we want to optimize the types of media campaigns that we're launching.</p>
          <p>The list is long. I mean, there are many such indicators. But media purchasing, media space purchasing obviously is the &#x2013; where most of the efforts are focused.</p>
          <p>A few words, Marc and Brigitte maybe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we've already started with this in 2009. There are two examples that I can quote. In Asia, we have shifted. We have moved our media plans in 2009. We have split up our TV investments. For example, this had a very strong impact on second quarter plus 7% in the first half, plus 12% in Asia for sales. And this was true for China, Korea, Taiwan we've invested a lot in TV media space purchasing.</p>
          <p>And a second example in Europe, we worked with an outside firm and engaged in a major large scale study for the optimization of our A&amp;P resources, what Jean-Paul was talking about. We have the beauty advisors now present in department stores, over 3,000 of them in our European department stores. This has led to a very precise reorganization per country, per brand, per department store of the &#x2013; what we want to do with our beauty advisors.</p>
          <p>So we have had improvement in terms of the cost and in terms of the quality of service. So, this started in 2009, we're doing the same thing in the United States right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brigitte?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, quite a lot of activities were carried out. I would like to go through &#x2013; first of all, use of the media space. What Jean-Jacques was talking about is something that we've benefited from at corporate level.</p>
          <p>Secondly, everything to do with advertising on the point-of-sale. For the last two years or so, we've invested 30% of our total resources, everything to do with displays, counters, and so on. Now, these costs have been reallocated to training all of our pharmacy personnel and staff. And we've also fine tuned the allocation of all of our resources, customer-by-customer. We can now follow customer-by-customer, even the potential customer, whether we have very good allocation of our resources. So, this is something that is done permanently and on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p>Yes, indeed and you're right, it's a key point. And we have 30% of your overall sales that go, that feed the A&amp;P expenses, obviously ongoing questioning and analysis and assessment of the productivity of all of these investments. You want to of course, spend your money in a smart way. All of this ongoing evaluation process is absolutely key. So, this is something that's close to our heart. There was a question on gross margin in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Yes <mark type="inaudible" /> is absolutely right. We managed to show an improvement of our gross margin despite the drop in volumes in 2009, which means that chances are that with an increase, likely increase of volumes in 2010, gross margin would further grow.</p>
          <p>And just a few comments on this, if I may. The productivity will probably be once again very positive, especially because there are many efforts being devoted to increasing productivity; and we also have reorganization plans.</p>
          <p>I quoted a number of figures in that respect in my presentation. I indicated an average payback duration of three years, so it's not easy to do in this calculation, especially because you have half of the savings that go to the sales and half that go to the SG&amp;A, so that's a positive trend. Something that is not as certain, purchases, will we be able to save as much on purchasings in 2010 as we did in 2009. It's a bit premature to answer this question.</p>
          <p>And the third factor which by nature is uncertain, but we've just got off to a good start for the time being, everything to do with the currency situation. You know that we have 34% of our sales in euros, which means that 66% of the remaining sales are not in euros. From our perspective, the euro has done well, since over the last six or eight weeks &#x2013; and this indeed is a positive factor as far as our brands are concerned. So, we shall see later in the year how it turns out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You, sir?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a minor question, to complete what you said about advertising costs and I've another question regarding your new brand, the Yves Saint Laurent brand that you want to turn it into a major world brand. So just a little complement regarding the A&amp;P costs, have you changed in your budgets the share of advertising on a point-of-sales? Generally speaking, independently of the price situation, we know and professionals say so that it is on the point-of-sales that half of the purchases are decided. So you should not have reduced your budget on that. So that's the small question. And there is another question. Talking about the launching of this new brand, I don't really understand because you already have a lot of global brands across your different business lines. Do you still need yet another global brand and what will make it different from the other brands that you have? What will be the differentiating factors? Were there gaps that you needed to fill or is it something that will add in a quantitative way if not qualitative, what will be the specificity of this new brand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No problem, with great pleasure, Marc will do this, I'm sure, with a great deal of pleasure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course. Well, obviously we had two major world brand, Lanc&#xF4;me, which is the leading luxury brand worldwide and Armani, which is also a major fragrance brand mainly, leading in the fragrance position where we had no brand of French designer. This was a missing piece in the puzzle. And Saint Laurent allows us to fill this gap in a way and do this very well and this gives us two different opportunities.</p>
          <p>First of all, the opportunity to develop on the large category of women's fragrances and that's what we've done, but it could be after the acquisition with the launching of Parisienne, which is a fragrance which has been doing very well, very successfully everywhere. The December sales were incredible, ranking sixth in France on the French market, for example, in December. So a lot of growth opportunities on the main category, which is women's perfumes and then of course, another opportunity for us now is to complete our positions in the make-up range with a lot of prospective growth for the future. So indeed, there is a great deal of complimentarity and a net contribution, a positive contribution to our brand portfolio.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, the question cannot be heard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is something we won't tell you. This is something we can't betray. But anyway, if there is one brand on which we have no doubts when it comes to striking the right complementarities that's precisely it. It is a great brand. A great, the great opportunity that Yves Saint Laurent gives us is that the brand image of Yves Saint Laurent, the magic behind Yves Saint Laurent was much greater than the actual sales. So if we're not too bad, we will be able to capitalize on this brand and turn it into one of the leading global beauty brands, and we will be able to compete with other French brands by famous French designers, you could even know what I'm referring to. So there is a huge potential to be tapped. We are highly, highly confident with Yves Saint Laurent. There is a great deal of complimentarity with our existing portfolio. Jean-Jacques, may be you could say something about the first question, the advertising on the point-of-sale.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we don't want to reduce, but we want to optimize it, make-up obviously is sold on the point-of-sale, we don't want to have less advertising. We want everything to be more beautiful, more attractive, and we want the sales person to sell as many products as possible, but we can maybe again on purchasing prices, when we do promotions we have to be careful that we don't have to destroy anything. So optimization is always something we can do. There are very significant potential gains to be derived from this. Emmanuel, you had a question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Emmanuel from the Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. I have four questions. The first two on the margins and overall financial results, we are talking about growing results and profit in 2010, do you think you will be able to improve on your adjusted EBIT margin as of 2010 also?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a bit early, isn't it? It's a bit premature to answer this question. I don't think that we generally speak and talk about such things. I think that you, it's going a bit too far. Some of the meaning of my questions is as follows, is priority given to internal growth or to margins, are you expecting first of all, some kind of strong internal growth before you actually move on to trying to increase your margins. Well once again, it's a bit premature isn't it, this is only the 15th of February. So we have trends. It's very early, I mean, to tell you about what will happen. Our objective for 2010, however, is indeed to resume with organic growth in 2010 to continue improving our operating structure and to increase our results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, if you want to look at the actual structure of the P&amp;L, you have increased the A&amp;P cost for the last two years as a percentage of the sales. Have we now reached a threshold in 2009 or could the A&amp;P cost go beyond the current level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think that we are at the right level. We don't want to be too rigid at the same time. One of the consequences of the last two years is that we don't want rigid structures. Despite the relevance and friendliness of your questions, we don't want to make any firm and definite commitments. We want to &#x2013; we don't want to set things in stone once and for all. We're just giving you indications on the way we see things, but don't take them as firm and definite commitments, except when it comes to growing our business obviously. When it comes to the operating structure of our business, we consider today that we've reached a good level and we feel that it's very reasonable to keep this level in 2010. I mean, this is obviously in rough terms.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You said the payback period is three years, is 2009 part of these three years or are you talking about 2010, '11, '12, what three years are you talking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Parts of it is already in 2009, but it's a small share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How can we distribute this through the three years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, maybe the last six months of 2009 and then on from there three years after that, we could look at this calculation. You had 120 million professions in 2008, 220 in 2009 and if you consider that we have half of what could have done &#x2013; engaged in 2009, that was in 2008, you will reach the right figures.</p>
          <p>There is another point which you mentioned which I think was very significant. You said that for consumers the value for money aspect was getting more important than ever before. I didn't say more than ever before. I just said that they are essentially growing importance maybe, yes, to this aspect. We are convinced at L'Or&#xE9;al that consumers are intelligent, are smart. It's not new that they should be interested in the value for money aspect. It is nothing surprising. I simply said that because of the recession possibly this trend got even stronger. This trend towards value for money doesn't mean that we want low prices and evidence of this is the new innovation that I've presented to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I find it's interesting to see that L'Or&#xE9;al was a pioneer in terms of innovation. You were ahead of your competitors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We still are. We still are because remember the last three innovations that we talked about in 2009 are light years ahead of our competitors, if I may, say, in terms of coloring, skincare and in many different areas indeed the major breakthroughs of the cosmetic industry in 2009 were achieved by the L'Or&#xE9;al Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's precisely the point that I wanted to insist on. Your competitors more than ever before may have woken up in terms of innovation. I'm not saying that their innovations are at the same level as L'Or&#xE9;al, but L'Or&#xE9;al was the only company at the time, L'Or&#xE9;al was interested on innovation more than others. But your competitors over the last few years, we get the impression, have really woken up. At least they say that they have, they say that innovation is key and they say that the share of new products in their overall sales is greater. So the question is what will you do vis-&#xE0;-vis consumers? How will you bring it home to them that they &#x2013; you presenting products with good value for money?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well. Deep down you're right. All of the players in the cosmetic industry have understood a basic truth of this business. It's an offering market. It's a market where consumers are always interested by quality, by innovation, by performance, and so on. That's what brings the market forward and always has brought it forward. We produced a beautiful book called 100,000 Years of Beauty, for the last 100,000 years consumers are always looking for a beauty product that will outperform the previous one they had. So, cosmetics by nature is a market that is driven by innovation. So, everybody has understood &#x2013; has finally, grasped this truth.</p>
          <p>The second point, I would like to make is that the true competitive edge is not so much the fact that we should communicate about innovation where we want to have better performance and quality. That's the true obsession of our laboratories and our businesses, business lines. We don't want to just be telling nice stories to our consumers. We would also want to make sure that in each category of product we have a new, leading edge product that is different from competitors with the highest level of performance that goes further than others and it will give consumers a better level of satisfaction. Because don't forget that, as far as cosmetics are concerned, repurchasing happens very quickly and a product is a resounding success only if it is purchased again by consumers. So, consumers are voting every day with their feet; G&#xE9;nifique is a great success, not because there is a beautiful advertising behind it, but because deep down it is a great product that is purchased, repurchased, and hearsay plays a role in that respect.</p>
          <p>So, that's what we want to do and that's where we've been increasing our R&amp;D costs. We are convinced, more than ever before, as I said, in my little presentation that it is the difference of quality performance, efficacy, and safety that will really make a difference. It set us apart from our competitors and that's indeed what we have in mind, we are obsessed with this idea. Laurent Attal who is the new head of Research is obsessed with this idea. Jean-Francois Grollier had the same state of mind, that's what we have at the back of our minds all the time.</p>
          <p>We're highly confident because we consider, rightly or wrongly, that we have the best research team worldwide, that we are devoting a lot of resources to the R&amp;D, we are ahead of industry, we are ahead when it comes to genetic research, when it comes to stem cells research, hair care technical products, such as coloring, and we are going to keep this ahead of competition and amplify this gap with competition and it is thanks, to technological breakthroughs that we will be able to further ensure our leadership, vis-&#xE0;-vis our competitors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One last point at the end of 2009, can you tell us about the weight of the BRIMC countries and their growth like-for-like, compared to that in 2009 and will the Body Shop establish a foothold in significant markets, such as India and Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Body Shop is already in India, yes, but not with a strong presence. Well, yes, gradually, we'll do that, we have some 20 shops I think in this country, in India and in Brazil, we have quite a lot of competitors in Brazil. So, we are not going to have Body Shop fight bloody battles there, you know, the return on the investments of Body Shop are also important and I don't think that profitability should be an issue. So, launching Body Shop against Beaute Carieau and Natur is not necessarily the wisest decision in terms of management for the Body Shop as a whole. So, we will send Body Shop to fight battles where we can increase and develop, we will see later. And for the BRIMC now.</p>

          <p>So, the five BRIMC countries represented 14.2% of the sales and the like-for-like extension was 13%. So, you see that in 2009 this was interesting. China had growth close to 18%, Brazil went back to a very legitimate growth rate for a country, such as Brazil, India, is in full re-acceleration. And the latest news we've received were good because that's an average. But, towards the end of the year the numbers were closer to plus 60%. They come from a low sales figure. So, it's normal that they should accelerate to catch-up. The other good news is that Russia picked up towards the end of the year, oil at $75 a barrel has helped a bit, and so, they're returning to growth. Consumer products is at plus 16% and we had a positive beginning of the year in Russia. Mexico is also recovering. Mexico is more tied to the American economy, but they are returning to growth also.</p>
          <p>The important thing is that new markets is not only the BRIMC countries, but countries that I was mentioning earlier, Ukraine, Indonesia, which are also major countries. Indonesia has a population of 250 million inhabitants, it's the Brazil of the ASEAN region. There are new countries which have a tremendous potential and where our acceleration is going to be very productive. There is a question from the room next door, room two.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Eric Blanc, Tradition Securities. I'd like to ask a question on something that has some importance, which is Sanofi. If you look at the &#x2013; if it were available for sale, you would have a net positive cash, your co-shareholder assigned 2 billion shares a year, total. So, could you tell us the numbers at the end of the year, is there a price level at which you would change strategies and could that funding give you a fifth leg so to speak? Galderma or the Body Shop for instance, which you didn't mention as a leg. And has the valuation decreased? And what about the possible external growth possibilities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Sanofi at December 31 in our balance sheet accounts for &#x20AC;6.2 billion, we hold 9% of that &#x2013; of the company. We did not sell Sanofi shares in 2009 since the last sale, which had taken place about two years ago. We have remained clear on our position. We are a loyal shareholder of Sanofi, but this stake is there to fund the future needs of the group. And we will not indicate a price at which we would trigger an operation, as you can well imagine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The real reason for selling Sanofi would be more an acquisition to fund rather than a share price.</p>
          <p>Regarding acquisitions, we have always been very open to everything that comes up, Christian and his team are always very busy looking at all the acquisition dossiers that show up on the markets around the world and in all of the circuits, but we have always been very selective and we look into &#x2013; more closely only into what we are seriously interested in. And, as indicated earlier, we ask ourselves 10 times whether such and such a company is interesting? Whether it adds to our brand portfolio? Is it a global brand? Will it be useful for our growth? There are a number of very demanding criteria which lead to our keeping only a few operations in the end.</p>
          <p>But we are very open, we look at everything and, you know, this is a market, which is very fluctuant, it consolidates, de-consolidates, businesses come back on the market, and we have these financial means of carrying out the acquisitions that we would like to carry out. Ladies, I don't know who was first.</p>

          <p>Mr. Mulliez, would you please be so kind and walk us through the main drivers of the improvements in working capital of that have driven the reduction in net debt. And also, very importantly, could you give us an idea where you see the main drivers or main constituents in working capital moving next year? What will be the key moves behind there and what is your use of your free cash flow? Where are you going to invest it? Where can we see your shifting resources that you are going to put more towards faster growing markets? How can we see that reflected in your use of free cash flow? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. Christian?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I have explained in my presentation, the improvement in &#x2013; very strong improvement in working capital came from two drivers &#x2013; two factors, the first one is, as you know, inventories which decreased significantly and we are confident that this driver should &#x2013; this should be another driver for a possible improvement in 2010. The second factor was the improvement of the trade account receivables. I'm afraid to say that the turnaround of the business and the come back to growth should generate needs in working capital from the trade accounts receivable perspective. It's difficult to say what will be the variation of the working capital in 2010, but if you should consider that it should be something at least plus 200 million for working capital. It's likely to be in this order of magnitude. Then about the proceeds, the use of the free cash flow, as Jean-Paul explains, we're not close to a possible share buyback program as a principle, but we consider that the acquisition is suddenly a better way to improve the value of the company and the last point, as you've seen, we increased, significantly, the pay scale ratio in 2009 from 41% to 44%.</p>

          <p>Sophie <mark type="inaudible" /> from La Tribune. Going in the same direction, I would like to know what would be the share of the Group's investment devoted to new markets in 2009 and possibly in 2010? And also, I would like to know why you are cannibalizing yourselves, so to speak? Code Jeunesse is very reminiscent of G&#xE9;nifique, such as &#xD4;scillation from Maybelline is reminiscent of the &#xD4;scillation from Lanc&#xF4;me. So, is that a strategy not to be overrun by your competitors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think you've given the answer yourself. They are simple answers. When the L'Or&#xE9;al Group has spent 10 years studying genomic applications in cosmetics, has taken a lot of leading edge, compared with competitors, obviously one wishes to optimize this. So, the first technology that was launched was launched by Lanc&#xF4;me and since it's an area of research rather than an active ingredient, a year after the launch by Lanc&#xF4;me on the basis of the cascading principle, we decided to also launch a product in the L'Or&#xE9;al Paris line.</p>
          <p>The active ingredients are totally different. I could give you one is active bifidus and <mark type="inaudible" /> in the G&#xE9;nifique and adenoside and cogent-S. So, the ingredients are different, the textures are different, the products are different. But there is the same work upstream in basic research at L'Or&#xE9;al. So, this is important for us, this enables us to cascade down our major research efforts and investments when you look at 10 years of basic research, it's an area of research, I'm sure that our financial analyst friends here would be happy to see us capitalize on that. It's better, I think you would agree, that it's better for L'Or&#xE9;al Paris to launch a competitor to the G&#xE9;nifique product, than if it were to be a competitor of L'Or&#xE9;al.</p>
          <p>Investments in the emerging new markets; we don't have the exact distribution, the exact breakdown of the investment, but in terms of investment, most of our investments are in the emerging countries, not all of them. For research, we are investing in creating a new research center in Saint Ouen near Paris, which is going to be very important for hair research. We have also invested in the Shanghai, Tokyo, Rio laboratories. In industry, we are building a plant in Russia. We plan to enlarge the plant that we have in Indonesia. We're looking at the possibility of having a plant in the Middle East. So, obviously the investments we are making are also allocated to the development of our presence in these countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it doesn't necessarily cost a lot of money to start business Jean-Philippe Blanpain. We have a new low cost plant, low investment cost plant and we're able to set up new plants in new markets, such as Russia, with a very reasonable level of investment, and it is as the capacity ramps up that we invest to assist sales. We're doing what it takes, not in an excessive manner, but we are doing it everywhere to meet the challenge of finding a billion consumers. The billion consumers, for the most part, will come from these new countries, but that is something you know.</p>
          <p>A question from the back.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> from Euromonitor, and I'll ask my question in English.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions, one is did you have to utilize price discounts to push sales in the face of the economic downturn and did you think it proved to be useful? And the other question is you are focusing on deodorant and which are the markets are you thinking of sticking to? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good. Very clear. Price discounts, I would say, honestly, not really, it's a, obviously in the consumer division worldwide, I mean, the 2009 has been a very challenging year and competitive year and it would be &#x2013; it would not be honest to say that there were no price discount or price promotions. And I'm sure that at Wal-Mart or in Europe we did some price promotions, but Jean-Jacques will tell you that in fact, it was very limited. Jean-Jacques, do you want to say something?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say because we've just looked at the numbers of 2009, compared to 2008 and there is a very slight, but it's less than one point, difference in worldwide price promotions. So it's really insignificant in comparison with what you would have thought that a big economic crisis would have generated. There is a very small increase in promotion. It is very small.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>By the way it's a very interesting question because I've said in my expose before that in fact, the most surprising factor was that there was no real discount of price of trading down in 2009. I remember one year ago when we met with you or with investors, people were forecasting a kind of Armageddon in term of price falling down, consumption falling down, everything falling down. And in fact, in terms of level of price, honestly nothing happened. It's very interesting to see that in Europe, the hard discounters did not gain market share. In Germany, I guessed right that they even lost market share. That's quite something, interesting, you know. In the private label brands in fact, didn't gain very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, they gained 0.7, not the distributor, own labels in Western Europe gained 0.7 share points they moved from 9.3 to 10.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's nothing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They are still quite limited and not a big increase. It's a big increase, but still limited.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Outside of Spain, because of the special story in Spain, outside of Spain the growth of the private labels in the consumer division markets were plus 4 or 5%, which is absolutely nothing. So the good news is that, honestly, the crisis has not generated a trading down of the markets in 2009 and there is absolutely no reason to think that there will be one in 2010.</p>
          <p>So regarding deodorants, we are &#x2013; it's true that we are now more and more interested in deodorants. It's not the priority number one for us, but it's an opportunity that we want to take, because as I said, in my bad French we want to leverage, add the strength of our research and development, we want to liberate equity of our brands, and we have a beautiful brand called Garnier and this brand is absolutely made for deodorants. And the proof of that is that when we launched Garnier deodorants in Eastern Europe, they took immediately more than 10%. And in Latin America, it's doing very well too. So what we want to do in fact, is just to penetrate a new category and to add a new category in order to generate some incremental business. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may, the first is on SG&amp;A, you've done a decent job in H2 of reducing your costs as a percentage of sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you expect further improvements going forward, as a percentage of sales? That's the first one. The second one is I believe you've been quoted today in an interview that you no longer think low double-digit EPS growth as guidance is appropriate, I just wanted to check that I've heard that correctly? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, all right. The first question regarding the SG&amp;A, thank you for the decent job and we hope to please you again next year. No, we think honestly that all the measures that we have taken in 2009 will continue to deliver some improvements in the SG&amp;A in terms of ratio. As I have said also, I mean, we did most of the restructuring, or I would say all of it in the next year. So, we don't have any more big restructuring plans for this year. But the big moves that we have made last year are &#x2013; will deliver in 2010 again. So, we expect our SG&amp;A to be &#x2013; to do a decent job again.</p>
          <p>Regarding the double-digit profit growth what I said very precisely at Reuters is that we don't want to commit to do it every year. Because I think that this was a trap in the previous years and we don't want to fall again in this trap. It doesn't mean that we can't do it. It doesn't mean that we won't do it. It doesn't mean that we are not capable of doing it. It just means that we don't want to fall again in the trap and to be again in a situation where year-after-year, we have to deliver double-digit profit growth. Because some years it's easy or it's good for the company, some years, you can do more, but maybe in some years, you have other choices that are more strategic for the company. And I don't think it's healthy to be stuck like this in this kind of obligation, that's the only thing I said.</p>
          <p>But it &#x2013; I didn't say at all that that we are not maybe able to do it because that's exactly the, I think, the opposite, okay? Monsieur?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned the mobility of the global cosmetics market and consolidations that may take place. But there may be new competitors arriving on the market. And I'd like to know what you think of Procter &amp; Gamble's present strategy which seems to want to develop in new areas and seems to have very considerable financial resources. Could it be an emerging competitor, so to speak just &#x2013; and a large competitor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think they'll be happy if you call them an emerging competitor says Mr. Igel. I don't wish to comment. But, I don't want to comment on my esteemed and respected competitors. But, the great opportunity to take things differently, the great opportunity for L'Or&#xE9;al is that in all of the emerging markets, there is no major local competitor, we have the usual suspects. The great global players in cosmetics that you all know, no need to say who they are, but we haven't been seeing the emergence of a large new local player in the cosmetics area as we've seen in other areas. When I speak to investors, I tell them that it's a great thing to invest in a company, such as L'Or&#xE9;al because there is a very low chance that 10 or 20 years from now, it would have to compete with very major competitors from China or India. Cosmetics, in those areas, is not considered as a strategic axis fortunately and these investors will be operating in different areas. So, the field is wide open and it's up to us to play the game well, but the field is open. In all these countries, such as China, India, Brazil, obviously in Brazil there is Natur on a specific circuit, but on all these huge markets so the field is wide open and it's up to us to demonstrate that with our formulas, our products, we are capable of fulfilling the needs and expectations of consumers and I think this is very encouraging for the future. I'm must say that I'm very convinced and of course, believe it or not, I am very convinced that we're on the verge of a new expansion phase for L'Or&#xE9;al, there was a great expansion phase which followed the fall of the Berlin Wall, or the iron curtain.</p>
          <p>In the 90s, the world opened up and we increased from 8% for the new markets to 30% last year and 36% next year. So, there is a new step. These new markets have emerged and from an economic point of view the world of tomorrow is already here, 50% of the market is in those regions, for us it's only 33% right now. So, if we play it right, we have 10 to 20 years of considerable expansion of our business through our brands, through our formulas with our expertise and our know-how in all these countries which are opening up to us and where we can go seeking out these new consumers.</p>
          <p>Comment again without a microphone. Once again, if I were to say that they are a new major player they would be a little upset, they would be a little miffed, because they are already big. But regarding the market you were talking about, I was the manager for Asia in '97, we were at zero, three of us were working there. Next year, we will be having &#x20AC;1 billion in sales, we have over 10% of the market if I'm not mistaken, we are number one for hair salons, number one in pharmacies, number one in luxury, number one in popular make-up, number one in skincare, we have 11.7. So the competitor you are mentioning is the P here that you see.</p>
          <p>But we are very respectful and we don't give names. So you do see that we have no problem, we are on a nice trend. I'm not saying this in an ironic manner, I respect them as a competitor, they are great people, they believe in the performance of products in research and value, very high quality people, but let the best man win.</p>
