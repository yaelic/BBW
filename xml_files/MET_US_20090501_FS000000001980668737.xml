          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to MetLife's First Quarter Earnings Release.  At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.  Later, we will conduct a question and answer session with instructions given at that time.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>And before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife.  Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries.</p>
          <p>MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife Inc.'s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  MetLife Inc. specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Julie .  Good morning everyone.  Welcome to MetLife's first quarter 2009 earnings call.  We are delighted to be here this morning to talk to you about our results.  We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so-called non-GAAP measures.  We have reconciled these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly financial supplements, both of which are available at metlife.com.</p>
          <p>A reconciliation of forward looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of the net investment related gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.</p>
          <p>Joining me this morning on the call are Rob Henrikson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Kandarian, our Chief Investment Officer, and Bill Wheeler, our Chief Financial Officer.  After our brief prepared comments we will take your questions.  And here with us today to participate in the discussion are other members of management including Bill Mullaney, President of our Institutional Businesses, Lisa Weber, President of Individual, Bill Toppeta, President of International, and Bill Moore, President of Auto &amp; Home.</p>
          <p>With that I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Conor, and good morning everyone.  During the first quarter MetLife generated 7.9 billion in premiums, fees and other revenues, a solid result in what continued to be a challenging environment.  Obviously the pressure from unfavorable equity and credit markets had an impact on earnings.  However, our mix of business is well balanced and our business model and fundamentals remain solid.</p>
          <p>In a few moments I'll talk about the actions we continue to take to ensure our financial foundation remains strong, but first I want to provide some insight into the performance of our businesses.  Institutional business generated a solid top line result, as premiums, fees and other revenues were 3.9 billion for the quarter.  This strong result was driven by a 5% increase in both group life and in non-medical health premium driven mainly by organic growth.</p>
          <p>Our Institutional business has been built on years of strong trusted relationships with our clients.  In tough times like these, relationships become even more important.  We are spending more time with our customers, and the advice we provide is even more valued.</p>
          <p>Individual business earnings continue to be impacted by declining the equity markets.  However, fundamentals remain strong and we continue to benefit from a flight to quality.  Variable annuity deposits increased over both the first quarter of 2008 and sequentially, to reach 3.7 billion.  In addition, we continued to see significant demand for MetLife's fixed annuity products with deposits of 3.6 billion.  Annuity net flows remained positive by almost 1.9 billion in variable annuities and 2.7 billion in fixed annuities.  Both are benefiting from the strong sales and declining lapse rates.</p>
          <p>In International, premiums, fees and other revenues declined over the year ago period entirely due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies.  On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 3% over the prior year period, due mostly to solid performance in the Europe and Asia Pacific regions, despite volatile markets in a number of countries.</p>
          <p>As I said, the underlying fundamentals of our business are solid, and we remain focused on strong underwriting and expense management.  I'm pleased with the continued progress in our cost reduction and efficiency initiatives through operational excellence and remain confident that we will reach our goal of at least 400 million of annualized cost savings by 2010.</p>
          <p>Now I want to talk a little bit about the Treasury capital programs, and our own capital strength.  As you know, MetLife has been a federally chartered bank holding company since 2001.  And with more than $1 billion in total assets, we are one of the top 19 U.S. banking organizations participating in the Treasury's capital planning exercise being conducted under the Capital Assistance Program.  We are working closely with the Federal Reserve on this exercise and will share more information with you as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>As a bank holding company we were also eligible to participate in the Capital Purchase Program.  However, as we announced last month, we have elected not to participate in this program.  Let me tell you why.  At MetLife we are confident that we have the financial strength to continue to succeed now and over the long term.  We are well positioned with significant excess capital, a strong balance sheet and leading market positions in our core businesses, where our revenues continue to be healthy.  We have continued to take actions to reinforce our financial strength.  Aside from our capital raise in the fourth quarter, we have already in 2009 successfully re-marketed over $1 billion in debt, which was several times oversubscribed, and completed an additional 400 million debt offering.</p>
          <p>In a moment Steve Kandarian will provide more details on our investments, but I just want to say our portfolio remains well structured and defensively positioned.  While the credit markets continue to be challenging, relative to the size of our portfolio our loss experience remains modest.  In summary, despite the tough environment, our businesses are performing well.  MetLife remains well positioned to continue to meet the needs of our clients and has the capacity and the financial strength to further solidify its leading position in the industry.</p>
          <p>And with that, let me turn it over to Steve.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob.  I would like to spend a few minutes reviewing variable investment income for the quarter, realized and unrealized losses, our real estate related holdings and hybrid securities.  First, let me start with a comment on variable investment income.  Pre-tax variable income was lower than plan for the first quarter by $508 million or $321 million after-tax and other offsets, primarily driven by negative corporate joint venture and real estate fund returns.  The losses related to our corporate joint ventures were primarily driven by 2008-year end equity valuations, which flow through our Q1 income statement.  Real estate fund returns were negative due to continued decline in property valuations.  We estimate that property values have already declined 20 to 25%, with an expected peak to trough decline of 35 to 40% in total.</p>
          <p>While we expect some moderation in these returns, we anticipate that results from these sectors will remain weak at least through the end of 2009 and that we are unlikely to achieve our variable income plan for the remaining quarters.  On the other hand, income from our securities lending program continued to outperform plan.  As of March 31, our securities lending book was approximately $20 billion, down from $23.3 billion as of December 31.  In addition, hedge fund returns improved for the fourth quarter &#x2013; from the fourth quarter and were slightly above plan.</p>
          <p>Now let me cover investment losses for the quarter.  Gross investment losses were $535 million, in line with the previous four quarters.  Of this amount, $145 million were credit related sales.  Write-downs this quarter were $1.041 billion including 754 million of credit related impairments.  These impairments were experienced across a variety of sectors including $358 million in corporate credit, 136 million of equity, 126 million in structured finance securities and 134 million primarily due to our strengthening of general mortgage reserves.</p>
          <p>Non-credit related write-downs of $287 million included 191 million of impairments on hybrid securities.  These hybrid securities were impaired because they've been trading below 80% of amortized cost for more than 12 months and were downgraded to below investment grade in the first quarter.  The remaining $96 million of non-credit impairments related to other equity securities, which were impaired because of the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below amortized cost.  When added together, total credit related losses from sales and write-downs were approximately $899 million before income tax or 584 million after-tax.</p>
          <p>Gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities were $28.8 billion at March 31, essentially unchanged from December 31.  While spreads declined in the vast majority of sectors during the quarter, this was offset by an increase in interest rates.  For example, BBB and high yield corporate bond spreads declined 38 basis points and 182 basis points respectively.  However, five-year and ten-year treasury rates increased 11 basis points and 45 basis points respectively.  As spreads have continued to tighten, our gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities have declined by approximately $2 billion since quarter end.</p>
          <p>Next I'd like to discuss our real estate related holdings.  As of March 31, we held Alt-A residential mortgage backed securities with an amortized cost of $5.1 billion and a fair value of $3 billion including 2006 and 2007 vintage securities with a fair value of $1.5 billion.  As mentioned on the last earnings call, we expected that Moody's would downgrade virtually all-2006 and 2007 vintage Alt-A securities to below investment grade.  Approximately 87% of our 2006 and 2007 vintage Alt-A securities and 60% of our total Alt-A portfolio were rated below investment grade at quarter end.</p>
          <p>As noted on several occasions, we believe our portfolio has superior structure to the overall Alt-A market.  For example, 87% of our Alt-A portfolio is fixed rate versus 36% for the market.  Furthermore, we hold no option ARM mortgages as compared to 28% for the market.  In addition, 83% of our Alt-A holdings have super senior credit enhancement, which typically provides double the credit enhancement of a standard AAA rated bond.</p>
          <p>As of March 31, we held commercial mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost of 16.3 billion and a fair value of $13 billion.  Based on fair value, 93% of these holdings are rated AAA and 86% are from 2005 and earlier vintages.  Of the 2006 and 2007 vintage holdings with a fair value of $1.9 billion, 87% are senior or super senior securities with 20 to 30% credit enhancement versus 10 to 15% for standard AAA securities.</p>
          <p>At quarter end, MetLife's commercial mortgage portfolio was $35.9 billion.  As of March 31, the portfolio loan to value was 59% based on our rolling four-quarter property valuation process, or we estimate in the low-to-mid 60% range if all properties were re-valued today.</p>
          <p>In addition, we also stress test the portfolio with peak to trough valuation declines of 40%, which shows our average loan to value increasing to the low to mid 70% range.  In addition, our debt service coverage remained strong at 1.9 times.</p>
          <p>To date, real estate delinquencies and losses have been minimal.  We had one loan default during the first quarter.  In April, we foreclosed on the property, taking a write-down of less than 15% of the loan balance, well below historical loss levels.  In addition, only $2.2 billion of the portfolio matures in 2009.  We are very comfortable with this level of rollover and expect to refinance and hold the vast majority of these mortgages as we refinance them at market rates.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me say a few words about our hybrid holdings in financial institutions.  At March 31, our Tier 1 securities had an amortized cost of $3.6 billion and a fair value of 1.5 billion.  And our upper Tier 2 securities had an amortized cost of 1.7 billion and a fair value of $919 million.</p>
          <p>It should be noted that MetLife's hybrid portfolio is largely concentrated in top tier banking institutions.  Moreover, our entire hybrid portfolio remains current on all interest and principal payments.  Since the end of the first quarter, hybrid security prices have increased as the fear of financial institutions defaulting has declined and several top tier financial institution have called their securities at par.</p>
          <p>Let me conclude by stating that we continue to be comfortable with our overall investment portfolio.  While we have seen some stabilization in the financial markets, we remain cautious and defensively positioned.</p>
          <p>With that, I will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Steven.  Good morning everybody.  MetLife reported $0.20 of operating earnings per share for the first quarter.  Despite the challenging economic environment, our businesses continue to have solid results.  This morning I'll walk through our financial results and point out some highlights as well as some unusual items which occurred during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to premiums, fees and other income, we had top line revenues, which we define as premiums, fees and other income, of 7.9 billion.  This represents a decrease of 2.3% as compared to the first quarter of 2008.  Adjusting for changes in exchange rates in International and lower pension closeout sales in retirement and savings, revenues would have been up by 4.1%.  Given the current environment, I think this is an excellent result.</p>
          <p>Institutional's revenues were down slightly, 1.7%, as compared to first quarter 2008.  This was primarily due to lower pension closeout sales, which fluctuate from quarter to quarter.  Group life premiums grew at 4.8% as compared to the first quarter of 2008, and non-medical health was up 4.6% versus the year ago period driven by growth in the dental business.</p>
          <p>International had reported revenues of 933 million in the first quarter, compared to 1.2 billion in the year ago period.  Changes in exchange rates had a significant impact on reported revenue.  On a constant dollar basis, revenue actually increased by 2.8% as compared to the first quarter of 2008 driven by Europe and Asia Pacific regions.</p>
          <p>Turning to our operating margins, let's start with our underwriting results.  Underwriting experience was generally favorable this quarter.  In Institutional, group life mortality of 92.9% was well within our guidance range of 91 to 95%.  In non-medical health and other, group disability's morbidity ratio of 86% for the quarter was better than our target range of 89 to 94%, driven by stable incidence rates and strong claim management results.  Individual's mortality ratio of 82.6% is more favorable than our plan of 89% and that was driven by lower claim activity.  If we adjust for the impact of reinsurance our net mortality results were still favorable.</p>
          <p>Turning to Auto &amp; Home, the combined ratio including catastrophes was 92.4%, which reflects an uptick from the 90.8% experienced in the first quarter of 2008, but still below our planned ratio.  Included in this result is a prior accident year reserve release of $17 million after-tax and that's compared to a $23 million after-tax release in the same period in 2008.  Catastrophe losses for the first quarter were $8 million after-tax, higher than planned.  The combined ratio excluding the impact of catastrophes and prior year development was 91.7%.  And that's a very favorable result and better than the 92.4% experienced in the prior year period.</p>
          <p>Moving to investment spreads.  With regard to variable income, as Steve has just explained, we again saw a mixed performance of certain variable alternative asset classes this quarter.  We experienced losses in corporate joint ventures and real estate funds driven by significant year-end equity valuations, which flowed through our first quarter results.  Securities lending margins were strong and hedge funds performed well, with both asset classes coming in slightly above plan.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, variable investment income after DAC, tax and other offsets was $321 million or $0.40 per share, lower than the 2009 plan.  As Steve also mentioned, although we expect this area to improve, we probably won't get back to our plan.  Also, due to market conditions, we continue to maintain higher levels of liquidity.  Cash and short-term investments totaled 30 billion at March 31.  This higher level of liquidity is also adversely affecting investment spreads.</p>
          <p>Moving to expenses, our overall expense level was higher this quarter, but that was driven by high DAC amortization and higher pension and post retirement benefit costs.  The equity market decline of over 11% and interest rate movements in the first quarter reduced earnings through higher DAC amortization in Individual business by approximately $204 million after-tax or $0.25 per share.</p>
          <p>Pension and post retirement benefit expenses were approximately 80 million pre-tax higher than in the first quarter of 2008.  At Investor Day last December, we told you that pension and post retirement benefit costs would increase by approximately $180 million in 2009 due mainly to weaker investment results.  As we finalized our pension and post retirement benefit calculations at the end of 2008, we also lowered our discount rate assumption and made some other adjustments.  Using these revised assumptions, we now expect our pension and post retirement benefit costs to increase by approximately $300 million in 2009.</p>
          <p>Also this quarter, we incurred $34 million pre-tax in operational excellence charges, which consisted mainly of severance payments and consulting expenses.  The progress we are making in operational excellence is offsetting these higher pension costs I just mentioned.</p>
          <p>Turning to our bottom line results, we earned $159 million in operating income or $0.20 per share.  Given the results this quarter, we don't believe the earnings guidance we provided last December is still appropriate.  We have decided not to provide updated guidance because of the volatile capital markets environment.  That said, if you normalize our variable investment income and the equity market impact this quarter, I think you can get a good sense of our underlying earnings power.  With regard to net investment gains and losses, in the first quarter we had net realized investment losses of $760 million after tax and other adjustments, and Steve has just explained that in great detail.  Our preliminary statutory operating earnings for the first quarter of 2009 are approximately $120 million and our preliminary statutory net income is 45 million.</p>
          <p>In summary, the fundamentals of our business remain strong and we continue to deal successfully with the challenging market environment.  And with that, let me turn it over to the operator, so we may take your questions.  Operator, are you there?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Oh, hey, good morning everyone.  A couple of quick ones, maybe a big picture one, I'm thinking about TARP and I'm thinking about the government stress test and MetLife's sort of open comment in a press release a week or two ago, whenever that was, a couple of weeks ago, that indicated that you had no intention of participating in TARP.  And I know that this is a bit of a touchy situation, but what can we take away from that commentary and that decision as it relates to your expectations around the government stress tests?  Should we feel more comfortable, should your investors feel more comfortable about the stress tests in light of your advanced sort of commentary about not wanting to participate in TARP?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm laughing at your question a little bit, John, because you know I can't answer it so, but let me, &#x2013; a little bit of color might be helpful here or kind of walking people back in terms of what we have said about TARP and what not.  And I don't spend any time thinking about TARP quite frankly, but you know, at the beginning when we first had out there in the marketplace this discussion of TARP, which was a new program, we were asked about it and we said then and we've said consistently ever since then answers that essentially said MetLife has no comment.  There was reason for that, if for no other reason that it was our understanding that any activity relative to or conversations by anyone about anything about TARP was non-public information.  And we stuck to that and for quite a long period of time, every time TARP was mentioned, and of course as time went forward, the discussions on TARP started to morph a little bit, as to what it was.  It was announced originally, I think the nomenclature TARP was very clear, Troubled Asset Relief Program.  Then it moved to the sense that this really couldn't work as quickly as the government hoped and so it sort of changed into capital injection, capital injection into healthy financial institutions that &#x2013; or large players in the credit market to help unfreeze the credit market and so forth.  And if I recall, there was even discussion about encouraging consolidation.</p>
          <p>Time went forward the definition and the requirements around TARP continued to change.  And during all of that period, we were asked periodically, do you have anything to say other than no comment and our answer was no.  And I think there were a lot reasons for us wanting to do that; we just thought it was the appropriate thing to do.  The problem recently, however, with the new sort of rising interest in TARP relative to the insurance industry, there was quite a bit of press and discussion about TARP and who was eligible and who wasn't.  And at one point, people were connecting the dots and the facts became inconsistent with the messaging in the press relative to MetLife.   And at that very point, I felt, well this is not good, we need to set the record straight, because by not saying anything or saying no comment, in effect we might be sending a message that the implications were correct and they were not.  So we simply wanted...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we simply wanted to set the record the straight.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's the whole story about TARP.  In terms of, and I mentioned in my comments about the stress tests, there it's very specific that there is to be no discussion at all about the stress tests by any of the participants, and I know there's been a lot of questions and people guessing as to who is on first and so forth.  There, we simply don't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>-- quite frankly when the Fed will release so there is no comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Two other quick ones and thank you Rob for that; that's helpful.  Bill, you mentioned statutory net income was marginally positive for the quarter.  Can we infer from that that risk-based capital, since there was only modest deterioration in the investment portfolio, that risk-based capital was generally flat from year-end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if I had to guess, I'd say it's a little lower.  We did have positive statutory income.  We had &#x2013; the balance sheet shrunk a little bit because we paid off some liabilities in our retirement and savings area.  So those were, that would have implied that RBC would have picked a little bit.  I think the ratings migration that Steve alluded to in a lot of asset backed classes where we had to, you know &#x2013; stuff got re-rated from investment grade to junk, that's a strain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a lot of &#x2013; underneath this, there's a lot of other moving pieces.  You know, I would just kind of tell you that RBC calculation is really complicated and so that's why for instance on Investor Day last year we didn't really want to guess a single point number, I gave you a pretty wide range because it is complicated.  We don't &#x2013; we only calculate it once a year.  So I think that the number is relatively steady.  My guess is it's a little lower.</p>

          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but I don't really want to be much more precise than that because it's &#x2013; and we do the math every quarter and the math is complicated.  So for instance the fluctuations in interest rates have probably had a greater impact in some of the reserve calculations we have to put up and, but we don't do those calculations until we do them, so I think some of the reserves came down from year end, is what I mean.</p>

          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>

          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only other thing I'd add by the way since you brought it up is, so RBC maybe down a little bit.  Cash at the holding company is $1 billion higher than it was at year end and that's not coming from dividends from the insurance subs, that's from some of the financings we talked about and we sold a little business and stuff like that.  So, if I think about our excess capital position, I think it's &#x2013; I would say it's &#x2013; the $5 billion plus number that we've sort of have out there is I think, I think that's still the &#x2013; an appropriate number.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great.  Last one for you.  If you think about and I'm sorry if I joined this late and missed, maybe Steve commented on this.  But Steve if you think about the sort of very broad and in some cases material credit improvement during the month of April, can you give us a sense for what kind of improvement in your mark-to-market or your net unrealized losses you would sort of guesstimate if we marked the portfolio from 1Q to the end of April?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure John, I did give that comment, but it was about $2 billion improvement since quarter end driven by tightening and spreads.  Although we have seen a little bit of an increase in interest rates especially in the long end of the curve which offsets the number but nets down to about 2 billion.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  A couple of questions, first, with respect to the VA hedging Bill, can you just run through us one more time, specifically what you do on the GMIB and particularly how you hedge for the dollar-for-dollar withdrawal feature on that is question one?  Question two for Steve, if you could give us some idea of where you were putting up new money during the last quarter in terms of investments and duration.  And then for Rob, given the continued ramp up in the pension costs, perhaps you can give us some thoughts on, does it still make sense for Met to have a defined benefit pension or is this something that you should be looking at doing yourselves, closing it down?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Colin, I'll start it about the VA hedging and the specifically talking about the dollar-for-dollar...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah particularly focused on GMIBs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, GMIB.  Well and Stan's sitting here next to me so he'll correct me when I say something wrong.  It's a &#x2013; remember now GMIB is &#x2013; the accounting there is SOP 03-1 and so the ability to hedge to the accounting and to the economics, it's a little looser than if it was a withdrawal benefit product, where you could use FAS 133, where we can, we can do everything much more tightly.  So, in general for GMIB, we just use, we use obviously a portfolio of S&amp;P put options in general.  We also, to kind of I would say hedge the longer-term economic risk, we also buy some long dated S&amp;P put options to kind of also hedge more of the economic risk as oppose to just focusing on the accounting.  So, it's &#x2013; so that's in general how the hedging works there.  It's &#x2013; you know the hedges &#x2013; it's hard for the hedges, because of the accounting convention of SOP 03-1, it's hard for the hedges to be perfect, but our track record is that we actually do a pretty effective job of a matching off and that we have very little breakage or noise around that hedging program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Bill, can we just specify it though? I just want to make sure that I am hearing this very clearly.  Are the economics here driving your hedge program or is it the accounting, and what here is properly hedged, the economic exposure or the GAAP results?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My smart alec answer is yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it sounds to me that you're hedging the accounting and I'd want to get out with these movements in interest rates and the decline and I am glad you've got Stan there, is how much has the economic exposure moved from that particularly given &#x2013; and also to talk about the experience on the dollar-for-dollar withdrawal and how you are trying to hedge for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Colin, let me try to help answer that.  In addition to what Bill said, clearly we're direct hedging the GAAP accounting because we don't want to create volatility in our income statement.  But we supplement the direct hedging with capital markets reinsurance.  And that capital markets reinsurance is what protects us against catastrophic movements in the equity market and interest rates on the piece that we're not able to directly economically hedge.  In terms of dollar-for-dollar withdrawals, we do have models that predict policyholder behavior depending on how much the benefits are in the money and that kind of helps us estimate what the dollar-for-dollar withdrawal effects would be in different economic environments and that's kind of built into our direct hedging program as well as our reinsurance program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you give us some sense of how the economics are unfolding here versus the accounting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know both parts are doing well.  As I said, we do have a reinsurance program, which is more catastrophic in nature.  And we've determined that we could absorb some losses on our income statement, but we're more worried about the tail risk and that's pretty much what we hedge.  So, in terms of the economics, we do have some noise there, but it's all very manageable and it's all measured and it's really the tail risk that we've hedged against.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the tail and not the drop in interest rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's a combination of a drop in interest rates.  You know, for the GMIB benefit to be in the money, you have to have either a catastrophic reduction in the equity market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we're there on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Or a big reduction in the equity market and lower interest rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Well, that kind of sounds like the current scenario, but if, maybe we can keep moving on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it's Bill again, I don't want to leave it there.  The interest rates have to even be lower than there now effectively and that's a little bit about what's going on there. Remember too, when we did this on Investor Day &#x2013; Stan is trying to cut back in but I'm not letting him.  I'm just going to monologue this.  Remember on Investor Day, we also talked about how the product, the GMIB product, is designed, and how we think that's a very favorable design in terms of the assumptions built in regarding mortality and stuff.  A lot of times that doesn't get appreciated about GMIB and I think that's part of the reason.  Obviously GMIB is our most popular rider by a long way.  So that's &#x2013; that I think gives us some additional comfort about sort of the real economic risk here.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if I could just remind you Colin, at Investor Day, Bill showed some slides showing how conservative the purchase rates are in the contract, and in fact on May 1, we have made some modifications to make them even more conservative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say some modifications is an understatement but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Colin, I'll take up the next part of it.  This is Steve speaking.  You asked for the new money for the first quarter.  Most of it went into governments and agency backed RMBS.  So those were low yielding assets that were quite safe and we felt like that was the right thing to do in the first quarter to remain very liquid in safe assets.  There was some investing into high quality corporate bonds, investment grade bonds in defensive industries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what about mortgages?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mortgages went up a little bit and the things we looked at with mortgages, we take a look at what we believe were both current market valuations today meaning down 25% from the peak or so.  And we stress test them down further to 40% from the peak, which actually means below where they started and &#x2013; in terms of the run up this last several years.  And we try to do things kind of in the 50%ish range in terms of loan to value on that basis with very strong coverages.  And when we looked at the tenant rolls, very strong tenant rosters, no big tenants dominating the properties.  So again with an eye really to our preservation of principal.</p>
          <p>For the second quarter, you didn't ask about this, but let me, I think your question kind of begs it.  The second quarter we'll probably ease a little bit back into some more spread assets, but still very much with an eye toward principal preservation, after taking account again some severe stress tests on the assets before we purchase them.  So, we could end up going back into things like CMBS, but only those that are trading down extremely hard, very high quality securities after being stressed, virtually no chance of losing principal.  The only question there would be how much money you'd make on the upside and we've modeled those things out, we're starting to see things we think that could make some sense in terms of principal preservation, remain defensive and getting a chance to get our yields up a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll take the third one Colin.  You gave me so much time to think about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I bet every employee at Met is listening to this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I could have retired by now, just thinking about it.  First just a slight look back.  Those who have been following the company, you may &#x2013; I know you would recall, that when we became a public company, we did quite a review of all of our employee benefit plans.  The defined benefit plan was essentially left open for people who were currently members but closed to new members.  We changed the shape and form to a cash balance plan and so forth.  So for the plan that is closed to new members, it eventually, in other words it doesn't really increase in terms of expense going forward because it's closed.</p>
          <p>And so having said that however, what we do each and every year is continue to review the total value proposition relative to talented employees and so forth, compensation in general, the employee benefit plans here relative to your question specifically, and we will continue to do so.  The total value proposition is very important when we look not only at certain parts of our company, but all across the board including our sales forces, but relative to operational excellence, relative to everything else we're doing, the employee benefit plans are definitely in scope.  Keep in mind, we're in this business not only as an employer, but we give terrific advice to a massive book of business relative to employee benefit plans, mostly to public companies, and we certainly go about following our own advice.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, let's see, wanted to start out on the commercial mortgage loan side.  Steve, can you talk about &#x2013; I know you mentioned you increased balances of commercial mortgage loans a little bit this quarter.  Is what you are putting to work there pretty much just rolling over existing loans, or are you actually putting out new money on new loans.  And can you talk a little bit about, of your rollover portfolio, the loans that are actually maturing this year, can you give us an idea of overall how you are looking at that?  Are you going to just roll over the vast bulk of it, is there a portion of it you're not?  Is there &#x2013; talk a little bit about risk of foreclosure and how things are looking there, that's my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Tom.  We've done both in terms of rollover and new loans, but again the new loans we're looking at and considering for extending credit to are very low loan to value after being stressed.  And there's not a lot of activity, because those who don't have to refinance are holding on right now.  So you've seen some decline in activity in both directions meaning in the heated period of 2005-2007, we had a lot rolling off prematurely because they refinanced at lower rates or more aggressive terms as to loan-to-value.  So we're seeing very little of that right now; the portfolio is pretty stable.  As I mentioned, 2.2 billion anticipated in roll off coming up here and we've looked at the loans that are rolling off, and in virtually all cases we're very comfortable with those credits, with the loan-to-values, with the tenant rosters in those cases, with the sponsors &#x2013; equity sponsors, and the amount of equity below us.  So we would anticipate in most or all cases we would actually extend credit on terms that we find attractive at -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, can I interrupt you there?  When, as you're rolling these loans, the 2.2 billion, are you getting meaningfully higher yields?  So kind of how is that playing out, because I'm just curious if you're doing it at existing rates, is it at a subsidy or what's going on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  We're doing it at market rates, so they are very attractive yields, higher yields than we've had in the past several years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And would that be north of 8%, north of 9%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's generally right now in the sevens.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you consider that market rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Given loan-to-value of the properties we're talking about, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Hey, one other follow-up on that is, I think the comment was 134 million of commercial mortgage reserves.  Just curious, is that related to specific delinquencies or foreclosures and what does that imply for your mortgage experience adjustment factor on RBC, is that, are you are at risk of tripping that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The number is actually 110 million.  I gave you that 134 in total for real estate, 110 of that was the strengthening of mortgage reserves.  And I'm sorry, the rest of your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Was, is that related to specific delinquencies or potential foreclosures and would that trip you up with the MEAF calculation for RBC?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It relates to looking at the overall portfolio.  Certain loans we felt should have additional reserves strengthening against them.  And in terms of tripping up I don't think that at this point, there's this one delinquency, so at this point, we don't think that's going to be an issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And last question I had was just on cash.  I don't know if Eric is there -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, Tom, Tom...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just add one more comment before you move on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To a different topic.  When you see yields in terms of new loans being written, most of the properties we're talking about here are very high quality properties, kind of A properties in the top markets.  So if you hear someone else on an earnings call talk about they got an 8% yield, that could be in a B market.  That could be a property that's not very attractive, that could be high loan to value.  There's a whole bunch of factors that go into what the appropriate yield is on these different kinds of mortgages.  So please remember that we're talking about very high quality properties with strong sponsors, low loan to value and in the top markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood.  And last question for either Bill or Eric if he's there just on cash and what happened.  It looks like cash and short-term went down by about 8 billion.  Is that because you're redeploying or was that the $5 billion net redemption in Global GICs, and then can you also comment on what's going on with the FHLB, because I think you borrowed something in the $15 billion ballpark, should we expected that that's going to remain outstanding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'll take that, it's, so with regard to cash, we had 38 billion of cash and short-term at year-end and now that's &#x2013; the comparable number stands at 30 billion.  So that's the 8 billion decline.  Now of the 38...</p>
          <p>Sorry that's my other phone.  Of the 38 billion, the 8 billion of that is actually cash that's sitting at collateral for derivatives with our counterparties. A lot of derivatives as you can guess are way in the money, so that collateral sits there.  That 8 billion has declined for a variety of reasons down to 4 billion at March 31.  So if you can follow the math here, our cash balance has actually declined now.  Our real cash balance, if you will, has declined from 30 billion to 26 billion.  So where did it go?  It actually got, it's been put out in investments.  So I think you get the sense from Steve that we're tiptoeing our way back into the credit markets a little bit.  I think most of that probably went into agency securities.  Now we did, at the same time repay, and you see this in the roll forward chart in the retirement savings.  We have repaid some Global GICs and some funding agreements, Max securities that matured in the second quarter.  And we repaid those from the securities, those liabilities from the securities that were assigned to them.  We have to use, especially in Global GICs, we have to have very tight asset liability matching.  It's a separate portfolio, and so when stuff matures, there's assets that also mature at the same time to pay it back.  So, I mean, cash is a little fungible in some way, but that's sort of how it played out.</p>
          <p>With regard to the FHLB, the balances really didn't change very much this quarter.  Some of it rolled; we also extended some out in &#x2013; some of the FHLB balances out into 2010.  So some has rolled, some has &#x2013; we've extended.  Our expectation is, is that we're going to keep drawing on those lines for probably the remainder of this year.  I mean certainly in the current environment we want to have &#x2013; we want to be drawing on the lines and we want to have that cash.  So that's my expectation.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great thanks.  Just a couple of questions.  First, on the equity market exposure, I guess we're getting a sense of what that does to your earnings on the way down, but can you just talk about how say a recovery in the markets, if we're up more than your 1.5 to 2% appreciation assumption in a quarter, how that will impact both the GAAP earnings and the stat earnings.  And then separate question related to the VA market, I guess there were some comments earlier about some changes that you were making.  You didn't get too specific on them; I was hoping that you could do that.  Really what are you doing to the VA in terms of pricing, how much is it going up and what sort of restrictions are you implementing and how do you think about what you're doing relative to what you're seeing in the market, if you have any color on that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So maybe I'll talk a little bit about accounting and then I'll let Lisa talk about the VA product and the changes we have recently made.  You know, obviously you know, March 31 the S&amp;P ended the quarter right about 800, and I don't know, it's 870 something right as of yesterday.  And so, and you know, and it had begun the year, December 31 of 2008 it was almost exactly 900.  So, we've gotten almost all the recovery back, not all, but close, and obviously the stock market recovered a lot higher than sort of our 1.25%.  So how does that affect the numbers?  Well, obviously that decline in separate account fees which we would have seen if the stock market had stayed at pretty much 800, that decline is now going to be very muted.  So you'll see higher fees throughout the remainder of the year, because of that and that'll obviously sort of get our earnings back, help our earnings recover a little bit more than our base assumptions, so that's good.</p>
          <p>The second thing is you'll see some DAC adjustment going the other direction.  Obviously, when you have a decline in the market, you have higher DAC amortization.  There'll be some slowdown of that when you see &#x2013; when the market moves the other direction.  But you don't get it all -unfortunately, because of where we are, relative to sort of what I would call the base case, you are not &#x2013; we don't get it all back.  So that $0.25 that I talked about, which was really an adjustment for equity markets, you'll get a piece of that back in the &#x2013; if this equity markets stay where they are in the second quarter, but probably not even half I would guess, and &#x2013; but you'll get some back.  I don't know, was that clear?  That probably is clear as I want to make it at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's fine.  We go to the VAs then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  Hi, it's Lisa, in terms of the VA market, we continue to see that business as strong for us with the flight to quality and people looking for safe havens.  As you know, we did take pricing action in February, and as commented earlier, further benefit changes in May, which are really very significant.  May 4, we are decreasing the step-up, which is probably the most significant change, from 6% to 5%.  We are also decreasing the period starting on the GMIB annuitization from 10 years to five years.  We're increasing the age setback from seven to 10 years and we are modifying the portfolio flexibility from 85%, 85-15 equity fixed to 70-30.  The no lapse guarantee is going from age 60 to 62 and it will still be at 100 basis points.  So, those are changes; they are significant.  We still continue to see ourselves in the enviable position because we are comfortable both with our product offering as well as our pricing, our hedging, which was commented on earlier, and very significantly our strong and broad distribution which continues to bode really well for us, particularly in this market when many other firms are letting go of wholesalers, our wholesaling force has stayed strong, has stayed loyal, has stayed dedicated, as has our affiliated field force.  And so as I mentioned, we are continuing to gain market share.  So, we are positive as we go forward here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just a follow up for Lisa or Stan.  Those are quite a few changes, so as you think about rolling those changes through to the economics of the product, what does that do to the returns of the variable annuity in a sort of a more normal equity market environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me just comment first, and then I'll pass it over to Stan, which is that the price increases that we &#x2013; the fee increases that we made in February were really in response to the volatility of the market.  These benefit changes are more in response to the interest rates changes and we are confident that with these changes we'll regain profitability.  Stan, do you want to answer further?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the reinsurance we had in place was kind of like the equivalent of long dated options, so we were protected at least on that part with the increasing volatility and changes in interest rates.  So, these changes are really to restore profitability going forward at the levels that we'd like, so it's really to get back up to our targeted returns given the changes in the market in both interest rates and volatility.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, and then one last quick one for Steve, the $2 billion number in terms of the decline in gross unrealized losses, is that sort of pre-tax and pre-DAC or is that gross &#x2013; net of that stuff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a pre number.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Perfect.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  We'll go to the line of Jimmy Bhullar with J.P. Morgan.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you.  I had a few questions, first for Bill, I think this was asked, but I'm going to ask in another way.  On earnings, if you take out the DAC expense being high and normalized for investment income, I think you're in the low 80s, maybe $0.83 for this quarter.  You mentioned in the second quarter fee income should get better, maybe DAC will be a little bit lower, but on the other hand your variable investment income should be weaker than what's implied in that 83 which is probably 150 million guidance.  So, directionally should we expect the earnings to rebound with the rebound in the market?  My expectation is that they should actually be lower, but if you can comment on that one.</p>
          <p>Secondly for Steve, I think MetLife talked in the past about realized investment losses being about 1% of the portfolio in 2009, which would imply 3 billion for the year.  This quarter I think it was 584 million pre-tax roughly &#x2013; or after-tax, 900 million pre-tax.  So, you're running a little bit higher than that what your expectation is for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>And finally for Bill Mullaney on retirement and savings, your sales this quarter were very strong, mostly driven by structured settlements, but I'm assuming close out activity was weak and if you could just talk about your expectation for close out sales given that rates are pretty low and most plans are underfunded.  So, most likely I don't think there should be a pickup in sales as the year goes on basically if you could just comment on that.  That's all I have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Jimmy I'll go first.  It's Bill Wheeler.  If, so we reported $0.20, we talked about the miss versus plan on variable investment income being worth $0.40 and then the equity impairment, the equity impact in the equity linked products being $0.25.  You could just take those moving pieces, you get $0.85, now there's a whole bunch of other noise which nets to I think to sort of a negative $0.02 if you will.  So that's your 83.  Now a couple of things to keep in mind about that.  The $0.40 miss, that's versus plan.  Now you heard both Steve and I talk about, we don't think we're going to get to plan for the remainder of the year and I don't think we will in the second &#x2013; second quarter, where we have some visibility now, we don't think we'll get back to plan, okay? It's going to be a meaningful improvement over the first quarter and I think we'll get most of that $0.40 back, but we're not, I don't think we're going to get it all back.  So, that would imply that sort of the run-rate isn't in the 80s; it's lower, in the seven &#x2013; I mean maybe it's in the 70s.  Now where the equity markets are at, I mean obviously that will help a little bit on the margin, if the stock market stays high, but who knows?  We have a couple more months to go here yet in the quarter.</p>
          <p>And the other thing that I think that's sort of out there that I just want to make sure you mention is the cash levels we're holding and even when some of our money which isn't in cash, it's in fairly low yielding, very safe, highly liquid sort of treasuries and agencies, this conservatism, which I think is appropriate, it's costing us money though.  And it's always a little hard to calculate exactly how much that's costing you a quarter but it's at least a dime a quarter, and could be more.  We're not going to &#x2013; we're also not going to change that situation right now.  I think we will change it eventually but certainly not in the second or third quarter, we're probably not going to change it very much.  So I hope that I will give you little sense of sort of what I think the run-rate might be and sort what are the other issues around it in terms of current earnings power.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jimmy, as to realized losses going forward, it is difficult to know whether the 1% number will be where we come out or not.  It could be somewhat higher.  It really depends on how things unfold here in the economy in the coming quarters.  And some of the likely places where you'll see some stress would be the hybrid area.  As we said, it's improved a little bit since quarter-end, but let's see where that comes out.  Loans related to more leveraged corporate credit could be an area you could see some stress over the course of the year and a few other buckets that might be under pressure.  So, it is very difficult to say precisely where these things will come out, but I think the 1% or somewhat higher area's what we are talking about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jimmy, its Bill Mullaney, just to give you a little color on closeouts.  You did hit on some of the key points that we're seeing in the marketplace.  Obviously, with equity markets down in 2008, the number of plans that are in now under-funded status is up and the low interest rate environment obviously does have an impact on prices.  But having said that, there are some plans that remain fully funded and we've been in active discussions with a number of plan sponsors around some of these opportunities.  The fundamentals of this business don't really change in terms of assessing the underwriting or the underlying liabilities and then doing the analysis around the pricing.  So, I would say we still remain very comfortable with this market.  We are willing to do deals at the right prices and we have the capital to be able to do that.  So, we continue to be in market.  There are some active discussions and we are optimistic that we may see some deals takes place in 2009.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jenny, we are right up at the time here, can we just squeeze in one more and finish it at that please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the last question comes from Mark Finkelstein with FPK.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.  I guess Bill, first question.  Can you just help explain how stat earnings were positive in the quarter?  It surprised me a little bit.  I mean, I guess what I am really getting out without wanting a reconciliation but rather, were there any single notable items that we should pay attention to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's a good point.  It isn't obvious why we would have GAAP net losses and stat positive earnings.  Now, so remember now, when we take an impairment, we impair both for GAAP and stat and we've said that on, we've always done it that way and I think everybody is supposed to now follow us and do it the same way we do, that's my impression.</p>
          <p>And the second &#x2013; but what you don't see is, remember in the last quarter, we had some very big derivative gains because of some interest rate floors and swaps we had which went way in the money.  We did and we &#x2013; those are hedges &#x2013; we have used those as hedges against some of our minimum interest rate liabilities.  So while Treasury rates were still very low, overall interest rates factoring in credit spreads, were still relatively high.  But we had this gain.  So what we decided to do in the first quarter is pocket some of that gain, because in GAAP, of course, it's the change in the value of the derivative gets &#x2013; flows through the income statement.  But in stat, it's when you actually sell it.  And so we sold some of those derivatives, or cashed them if you will in the first quarter.  And we pocketed the gain and that basically offset the $1 billion impairment that we took on a GAAP basis.  So, we did have some very &#x2013; small realized investment losses on a stat basis, but they were &#x2013; but net income was therefore still positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess just following on that.  What kind of risks are there in terms of interest rate changes that by selling the derivative we take going forward in earnings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's funny.  It's &#x2013; the answer is I think you want almost none unless you get back to a sort of a Japan interest rate scenario.  I mean that's what that was really &#x2013; that's what those interest rates are really &#x2013; interest rate derivatives were used to protect against.  We have &#x2013; for instance we had a lot of 10 year floors and stuff.  So you probably won't see hardly any impact in earnings unless we have a severe interest rate scenario.  Interest rates have obviously moved up since year-end.  So it's coming our way.  We will also probably at the right time, we'll re-strike.  I mean we want to put the &#x2013; and put on some new hedges.  But, we just felt, here's all this value sitting in front of us and we think probably Treasuries are going rise and are going to decline in value, or interest rates are going to go up, it should be a real shame to let that just dissipate.  Why don't we just take some off the table?  And that's what we did.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then Steve, a lot of discussion about the commercial real estate block or the commercial mortgage loan portfolio.  I guess, can you just provide some color on I guess the fundamentals in the agricultural book, thinking about performance, risks you're focused on, what is on your watch list, maybe just some color in that area since it does get a little bit less attention?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, first let me note that in general our ag mortgage portfolio has a lower loan to value than even our commercial mortgage portfolio.  They tend to be very conservative loans, historically very low delinquencies or defaults or losses.  The area we'll see some stress would be the biofuels sector.  And we don't have a great deal of exposure there, but we have some and that's the area that we're watching most closely and if there is some stress, we're most likely to see the stress in.  But overall the portfolio still is very sound and very strong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then I guess just finally, you talked about stressing the commercial mortgage loans and I think you said you looked at it on a 40% decline and kind of what the result in average LTVs were.  Are there any metrics that you can give us in terms of kind of what percentage falls above a certain LTV range, maybe it's 85% after you do that stress test, or are there any kind of metrics to kind of look what would be perceived as the more risky areas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah we've done that. I'm not sure I have that number right with me, but the stress tests we took things down 40% from the peak just to kind of review that means.  That's a way of taking a look at 2003 or the beginning of the uptick.  And if you take 100 for example and take it up 40 to 140 and you take it down 40%, that takes you down to 84, which means 16% below where you started from.  So under that extreme scenario, I gave you the numbers about low-to-mid 70s overall.  But obviously there'll be some above the 85% range and we've done that stress testing. I have the numbers but I just didn't bring that with me.</p>
