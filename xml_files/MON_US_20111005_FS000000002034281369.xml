          <p>Greetings, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2011 Monsanto Co. Earnings Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Bryan Hurley, Investor Relations Lead for Monsanto. Thank you, Mr. Hurley. You may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, <mark type="ph" /> Kevin (00:30), and good morning to everybody on the line. Thanks for joining Monsanto's fourth quarter earnings conference call. I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; by Pierre Courduroux, our CFO; and also joining me are Manny Cruz and our new colleague in Investor Relations, Bryan Corkal. This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast and supporting slides at Monsanto.com. The replay will also be available at that address.</p>
          <p>We're providing you today with EPS measures both on a GAAP basis and on an ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which are posted on our Web site.</p>
          <p>This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent 10-K and in today's press release.</p>
          <p>For today's call, Hugh will walk you through the context for our fiscal year 2011 earnings and then focus on how these results set up our growth into 2012. Pierre will lay out the translation of that growth into our guidance and financial outlook for 2012. With that, let me move directly to Hugh to begin our review today.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bryan, and good morning to everybody on the line today. I see the year end as a punctuation mark for us in fiscal year 2011. It closes out an important year and it puts the final emphasis on the results and execution that we've seen building over the course of the fiscal year. So that's where I want to focus today, but before I get to that, as I did in the last quarter, I'll start with one update on the reporting adjustment noted in our press release today.</p>
          <p>As I shared with you in our third quarter conference call, the staff of the SEC is conducting an investigation regarding the financial reporting of our customer incentive programs related to glyphosate products. Following the SEC notification, we initiated our own review, and the Audit and Finance Committee of the board retained independent advisors to conduct a full investigation. As a result of that work, Monsanto will adjust and restate portions of the financial statements from 2009 through 2011. As a result of the pending restatement of the prior financial statements, we don't provide comparisons with our prior financial periods for Ag Productivity or Total Company in today's earnings release. However, we do include the relevant comparisons for the Seeds &amp; Genomics segment.</p>
          <p>So let me briefly walk you through the expected changes. First, the adjustments will be made only to Ag Productivity. They mainly relate to the accounting treatment and the timing of accruals for annual customer incentive programs for our glyphosate products. These programs had been treated in an individual accounting year and are now associated with other fiscal periods. Ultimately, total revenues and total costs for the company for these years taken as a whole do not change. While these particular incentive programs are no longer in place, the adjustment on timing of the accounting for them will be reflected across multiple years.</p>
          <p>In fiscal year 2009, the adjustment reduces the full-year EPS by $0.05 to $0.10 negative. For fiscal year 2010, full-year EPS would reflect the change of a negative $0.02 to a positive $0.03 and the fiscal year 2011 ongoing EPS of $2.96 that we're reporting today includes a benefit of $0.05 of EPS change from these accounting adjustments.</p>
          <p>All of the adjustments will be reflected when we make our 10-K filing later this month. These changes don't affect any prior financial information for the Seeds &amp; Genomics segment. Importantly, the fiscal 2011 financial information that we're reporting today includes all the adjustments that we're making for the 2011 fiscal year. As I indicated when I first discussed this last quarter, we take this matter seriously and will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC.</p>
          <p>So if you step back from those adjustments, what does it mean for 2011? Practically, 2011 is a higher base, but given the strong performance in the core of the business this year and the growth opportunity next year, we will grow mid-teens earnings off that higher base in 2012. I'll let Pierre handle the specifics of our guidance, but fundamentally, there's a compounding effect to our guidance as the 2012 growth is additive to our larger 2011. And that actually frames how I see 2011 and how that in turn sets up 2012, which we cover on Slide 5.</p>
          <p>First, 2011 was a year of reestablishment for Monsanto and with what we've accomplished this year, we've turned the corner. We've reignited the core momentum in our business and we've returned to a growth mode on a wider stage. With these financial results we've proven that we can deliver mid-teens earnings. If you pair that with our ability to generate strong free cash flow then we emerged from 2011 with strong fundamentals. Second, from a business perspective, we reconnected with our farmer customers and we turned that into positive momentum that we now carry into 2012. That's most visible in the U.S. where we overhauled our strategy and we told farmers that our focus would be on what helped us earn our leadership in the first place, bringing more innovation and creating more incremental value for our grower customers than anybody else. The response to date has been very good and the results shined through in our numbers this year.</p>
          <p>Third, from a strategy perspective, in 2011 we set in motion increasingly global opportunities. In previous iterations of what I'd term as breakout years, we'd be quick to highlight a primary product for a region that drove the results. That's not the case in 2011. The sources of our growth this year, whether sliced by crop or by geography, were more diverse. That's by design. Our core will continue to revolve around the U.S. but with the ascension in Latin America in particular, fiscal 2011 ushered in the next evolution of Seeds-and-Traits and takes it to a more global stage.</p>
          <p>We have re-established our business in 2011 and I see that momentum continuing into 2012. If we go to Slide 6, I'll focus on the strategic drivers for this next phase. At the top of the list is the opportunity to capitalize on the strong response that we've seen to our product and pricing strategy in the U.S. As Brett Begemann mentioned a few weeks ago on our pre-harvest update the positive feedback from our customers has been a highlight this year, but we don't take it for granted and there's still work to do. So here's the keys for 2012: if 2011 was all about establishing our platforms in Corn and Soybeans, 2012 is about accelerating them to become our lead business drivers.</p>
          <p>So if you start with Soybeans on Slide 7, with the step-up of more than 10 million acres in 2011, Roundup Ready 2 Yield was planted on 17 million acres and has clearly achieved the status as our key platform in Soybeans. That 10 million acre growth pace is a good trajectory as we see our platforms expanding, so we'll anchor off that increment again in 2012. Practically, that means that we expect Roundup Ready 2 Yield penetration to step up to around 27 million to 30 million acres in 2012. The step up does two things. That means Roundup Ready 2 Yield is the primary product in our Soybean brands, reflecting approximately three-quarters of our branded volume in 2012.</p>
          <p>Just as importantly, the acceleration puts us squarely on the penetration trajectory to allow us to upgrade our Soybean platform to Roundup Ready 2 Yield well ahead of patent expiration of the first generation Roundup Ready.</p>
          <p>If we move to Corn on Slide 8, the strategy and the core outlook are similar. In practice, our platform revolves around three products in the Genuity Reduced-Refuge family: Genuity SmartStax, VT Triple PRO and VT Double PRO. As with Soybeans, we saw a 10 million acre step-up in 2011, establishing our platform in its second year at 13 million acres. We plan to step up again next year, anchoring off a similar 10 million acre increment in the third year of this new platform, as we expect total acres to expand to 22 million to 24 million acres in 2012.</p>
          <p>That tracks with the earlier history that we saw as triple-stacks ramp up, and it means that we expect the Reduced-Refuge family will reach about three-quarters of the total peak penetration of triples in just its third year of availability.</p>
          <p>We expect the Reduced-Refuge family will be the majority of our volume in both DEKALB and across all our Corn brands in 2012 and we're going to take full advantage of our competitive lead with these products.</p>
          <p>For SmartStax in 2012, we now project that we'll have more than 100 hybrids available across all channels. We've been able to build a deep portfolio offering for growers in the core northern Corn Belt where SmartStax is the lead product. Likewise, all of our branded SmartStax will be SmartStax RIB Complete, positioning it as the industry's only 5% single bag RIB product for above and below ground insect control. And we see this driving continued interest and adoption.</p>
          <p>Following the regulatory approval, we also expect that the Double PRO volume that we have in 2012 will be RIB Complete as well.</p>
          <p>I also recognize a key differentiator in these platforms is performance so it's particularly timely that we can give you an update on some of the very early harvest results coming in. As you know, we're less than a quarter into the total U.S. harvest, so I won't get ahead of the data with a deep dive, but in Slides 9 through 11, we've given you a snapshot of progress and early results where harvest is most advanced.</p>
          <p>I'd summarize it by saying that in areas where we have good data like the data for Triple PRO coming out of the early southern harvest, we're squarely on track with our expectations and we're delivering the yield advantages that will differentiate our products. In areas where harvest is still pending, like the northern areas that are home to our SmartStax volume and the later soybean harvest for Roundup Ready 2 Yield, the early <mark type="ph" /> single reports (12:45) and the anecdotes reinforce our confidence in our product performance. We'll update harvest data at our upcoming November Investor Day, but I think my early take is that in a year where heat and stress are going to depress overall yields, our products are going to show yield advantages that will differentiate us from competitors and reinforce that we have the best product offerings for our farmers.</p>
          <p>That's the perfect segue for the final area of emphasis for 2012 in the U.S. and that's volume growth. Coming into 2011, we anticipated our new product strategy would reignite volume growth in the U.S. and it did. With our returns now finalized we can definitively say our branded Corn volume grew by the largest increment in the last three years. Even if you consider a continuum of where the ultimate acre base lands for 2011, our volume outpaced the market expansion and we've achieved organic share growth in DEKALB and across our brand platform.</p>
          <p>In Soybeans, the strong uptake of Roundup Ready 2 Yield allowed us to end the share erosion that we've seen in the past two years and we've stabilized our brand share.</p>
          <p>In Cotton, even in a significantly expanded market, we've seen a resurgence in Deltapine as our breeding improvements pay off, and volume and share were up significantly in 2011.</p>
          <p>These overall trends project globally as well. As our global Seeds-and-Traits volume increased in 2011, and for a global crop like Corn we grew volume in every significant corn growing country.</p>
          <p>Embedded in our planning for 2012 is our expectation that volume growth continues. So in key areas like the U.S., we will look to use our new product strategy to both enhance mix and drive continued volume growth.</p>
          <p>The next place where we expect momentum to accelerate in 2012 is in Latin America, starting on Slide 12. In particular, we expect the ramp up of the Corn opportunity in Brazil and Argentina will be one of the single largest sources of new growth in the next few years. The core drivers are the same as the U.S. They'll be about volume growth and mix expansion from Seeds-and-Traits. But the starting point and the pace are quite different and they speak to the ability for our Latin American business to ramp up its relative financial contribution so significantly.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. we launched Corn Biotech Traits on a branded footprint of about 10%. In Brazil and Argentina, our branded footprint are multiples of what existed in the U.S., so we expect our ability to promote Trait penetration and upgrades within our own brands can move the needle for the overall market.</p>
          <p>In Argentina with the volume growth our share is above 50%. Against that we'll expect to grow volume and, most significantly, accelerate the conversion of Double Stacks to Genuity Triple PRO which brings new insect protection and value that bolsters our mix.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, you'll see in Slide 13 that we hold the industry leading share position with more than 40% in our brands. On that footprint we've expanded Trait penetration from zero to more than 64% in just three years. With recent approvals for second-generation stacks we expect the margin upgrades in 2012 will get a double shot as we simultaneously ramp up our overall Trait penetration and upgrade from first generation products to higher value second-generation Traits.</p>
          <p>We saw the early indicators of the Latin American acceleration show up in the fourth quarter, but the point of emphasis for me is that this opportunity has now graduated from an area of potential to a central component of our growth, and that's why it's now become a key driver. Not surprisingly, with a more balanced business with global contribution, the opportunity in the U.S. and Latin America is complemented by growth from our other key areas.</p>
          <p>In the interest of time this morning I won't dissect each area today, but we also expect to see growth from of our other international Corn geographies and the continued contribution from Cotton in the U.S., India and Australia.</p>
          <p>Also in 2012, we expect to see further growth in the gross profit of Vegetables as we focus on our growth crops and our emerging pipeline. I've focused on what drives 2012 but these drivers are at the heart of our core business. We'll spend more time on this at our Investor Day in November, but as a prelude, let me finish up today with a strategic thought that sets the scene for our investor event.</p>
          <p>As you can see on Slide 14, it's a macro environment that clearly needs more grain over the next decade to satisfy escalating demand curves. That productivity focus plays to our strengths and I think that you'll see a couple of structural trends driving opportunity in the next decade.</p>
          <p>First, the stage is set for geographic expansion. That creates yield and it drives growth. Second, the underlying genetics are becoming more important as improvements in Seeds drives yield potential and value in every region.</p>
          <p>And third, optimizing yield ultimately won't be enough, so innovation becomes the differentiator that will take new yield that comes from innovation and breeding and biotech and in agronomic approaches and Monsanto is in the best position to provide that.</p>
          <p>We turned an important corner in 2011. It shows up in the financials but also speaks to deeper strategic opportunity as we reignited growth in our businesses. And ultimately, 2011 is the platform from which we can hit our stride in 2012 as we capitalize on the momentum and we see the pieces our strategy start to come together globally.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me hand the remainder of the time over to Pierre who will give you the specifics on how this translates into our guidance outlook for 2012. Pierre?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everybody on the line. Today, I'm going to focus on translating the fiscal year '11 endpoints and the priorities Hugh described into the core elements of our earnings guidance for 2012. But before I do so, I'd like to start on Slide 15 and step back to summarize my view around where we stand from a financial point of view.</p>
          <p>First, as Hugh said, we've built our mid-teens earnings growth for 2012 from a higher base and this reflects both the fact that our business came in above our revised guidance as well as it takes into account the benefit of the $0.05 change from the financial statements adjustment in Ag Productivity. But the bottom line is our growth in 2012 builds on the strong financial base established in 2011.</p>
          <p>Second, through the year, we've been able to translate a greater portion of our growth into free cash. I'll spend more time on this in a minute but this reflects both our ability to convert core earnings into cash and the strong business position we're in to realize the benefits of a record year in collections.</p>
          <p>And third, the sources of our underlying financial results this year speak to the balance and flexibility that's emerging in our business. Agriculture is by nature variable, but with the growth of our International business, we've diversified our financial profile and that creates more flexibility across more crops and more geographies to address annual variability and deliver on our bottom line earnings commitments.</p>
          <p>So I think the best way to see the translation of strategy into guidance is to walk you through the key lines of the financial statements on Slide 16.</p>
          <p>If we start with bottom line earnings, our ongoing EPS guidance range tracks mid-teens growth of the FY '11 endpoint of $2.96, which translates to $3.34 to $3.44 per share for fiscal year '12.</p>
          <p>That expected mid-teens growth is underpinned by two things: The core growth we deliver from our base business, complemented by the below-the-line leverage as we maintain our operational discipline. So above the line, the source of projected growth in 2012 is again going to come from our Seeds &amp; Genomics segment on Slide 17.</p>
          <p>You can see the base for that growth in the record quarter we had in Seeds &amp; Genomics in the fourth quarter. On the strength of the emerging Latin American business, total Seeds &amp; Genomics gross profit was $790 million in the quarter, a record contribution and more than a 50% improvement versus the fourth quarter last year. Given that strong fourth quarter, our overall gross profit for Seeds &amp; Genomics for the year ended at $5.3 billion, coming in considerably stronger than even the high end of the full-year range of $5.2 billion we projected in the third quarter. And in each of our core crops, Corn, Cotton and Soybeans, gross profit was up by double digits for the year.</p>
          <p>As you would expect from the priorities Hugh laid out, we expect Seeds &amp; Genomics to step up again in 2012. Practically, we expect Seeds &amp; Genomics gross profit to be in the range of $5.7 billion to $5.85 billion this year with the biggest contributors coming from volume growth and mix upgrades. On the high end of our target, this is an incremental step-up of more than $0.5 billion and it fits with the pattern of annual GP contribution we observed during our previous growth trajectories.</p>
          <p>The other above-the-line contributor will be Ag Productivity. After the accounting adjustments, Ag Productivity delivered $773 million in total gross profit in fiscal year 2011. That strong showing in the first year following our Roundup repositioning reflects the positive shift to branded volume and good response to our Roundup Ready PLUS strategy. And in addition, the Lawn and Garden business concluded its second strongest year ever, adding the contribution from other Crop Protection businesses. Given those, we expect that we've reached a new base level for GP in these segments, and we project total gross profit for the segments in the range of $800 million in 2012.</p>
          <p>If we now move below the line, this is a key area on the financial walk-through. As we have focused on maintaining a disciplined approach to our spending, so we can leverage the top-line growth of the business. Within this, the place to start is SG&amp;A. We ended 2011 with SG&amp;A at about $2.19 billion, as SG&amp;A ran a little higher consistent with the significant uptick in our Seeds &amp; Genomics gross profit. Going into 2012, we expect SG&amp;A to be in the range of $2.25 billion to $2.35 billion. That is consistent with our expectation that SG&amp;A will grow at or slightly above inflation. Over the past several years, we've significantly reduced our SG&amp;A spend rates as a percent of sales, and our 2012 range will maintain that trend.</p>
          <p>On the R&amp;D line, we ended fiscal year 2011 with an R&amp;D spend of $1.39 billion. As discussed during our third quarter call, we accelerated some of our planned R&amp;D spend into the fourth quarter of '11 to support our Latin American opportunity. As a consequence, our net 2012 R&amp;D spend will grow at a lower rate than we've seen in the past few years. Practically, that translates to an expected R&amp;D range of $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion which reflects a roughly 1% to 5% year-over-year increase.</p>
          <p>The final factor in our earnings guidance is the tax rate. With our year-end rate right at 30% for fiscal year 2011, we project our annual tax rate in the range of 30% to 32% for 2012. And practically, these rates reflect the geographical distribution of our earnings as we see increased growth from some of our ex-U.S. businesses combined with our expectation we'll realize some discrete items.</p>
          <p>If I now bring all the P&amp;L elements together, let me tell you how I expect to see the flow of earnings throughout the year on Slide 18. With the ascension of Latin America, I think we'll see 2012 as the first year of some structural changes to our historical earnings pattern. Our first quarter will still be a small quarter, but with more contribution from the growth in Brazil and Argentina, it will start to reflect a higher percentage of full-year earnings. So while we don't traditionally give specific projections for the first quarter, we wanted to provide some better clarity during the transition.</p>
          <p>In 2012, that means we'd expect first quarter ongoing earnings in the range of $0.10 to $0.15 per share. The bulk of our earnings will still fall in our second and third quarters as those quarters reflect the majority of our Seeds-and-Traits business. And the fourth quarter will still be a loss, but likely slightly less than we saw in 2011 as the same Latin American effect begins to contribute more earnings to offset our full load of expenses.</p>
          <p>The last piece I will cover is the outlook for free cash flow on Slide 19. At the beginning, I mentioned one of the highlights of the year was that we were able to generate such significant cash flow in fiscal year 2011. For the full-year, our free cash flow was $1.8 billion. I look at 2011 as a transition year where we enjoyed significant and stronger-than-expected tailwinds from a cash viewpoint. Simply put, the step-up in cash reflects a record year for collections with the highest-ever collection for the full-year as well as in the fourth quarter. Those strong collections also benefited from our restructuring actions that streamlined key elements of the business for 2011, and the benefits of restructuring also show in our inventory and payable percentages. Taken together, we've been able to improve our balance sheet position for working capital, excluding cash and cash equivalents, by nearly $600 million in 2011.</p>
          <p>As we look to fiscal year 2012, I don't expect us to repeat that type of improvement again, although, we will maintain our discipline and focus on working capital. We expect free cash generation in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion, which if we exclude the 2011 benefits, means we expect our free cash generation will track very closely to the growth that we see from net income, and that earnings to cash correlation is certainly the way to look at how we see our free cash profile in 2012. But it also becomes a good pattern to track how we see the cash generation capability of our business.</p>
          <p>Converting earnings into cash and maintaining a strong balance sheet continues to be one of my fundamental priorities. I see cash generation as critical to support our business opportunity and to return value to our owners. In particular, it's not our intention to build reserves of cash on the balance sheet. In fiscal year 2011 we used more than $1.1 billion for dividends and share buybacks, almost two-thirds of the free cash we generated, and this is consistent with how I look at that as a priority for cash deployment.</p>
          <p>While an earnings call like this turns the attention to the fiscal year in front of us, there are two pieces of context I don't want to lose as we lay out guidance. First, our first priority was to deliver on our guidance and we did that. We saw the growth where we wanted to see it and we showed the right discipline on the below-the-line factors we control. Second, the base we established in 2011 sets us up very well for 2012. We'll continue our mid-teens earnings growth from a higher base so the compounding benefit of an expanding business plays out nicely in our growth strategy.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it back over to Bryan for the question period.</p>

          <p>The gross profit in 2012, do you expect margins to expand given the mix impact? And how will the impact of higher production costs impact the margin in that business?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Just talking about Corn Seed gross profit in 2012 versus 2011, expectations for margins next year versus this year, given the impact of mix and higher costs.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks much. I'm going to ask Pierre to make a comment on our margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So speaking specifically about Corn, I mean the way we look at it there is definitely an opportunity, I mean based on the mix upgrades we've been talking about, to see margin expansion now.  Obviously, I mean based on the geographic mix and I mean the choices farmers are going to make, the margin improvement I mean will vary, but there's definitely a potential there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe a way to look at it is Latin America and North America. So in Latin America, as we mentioned, strong footprint, first-generation Traits washing through and nice margin upgrade as growers reach for those next levels of technologies, David, and I think you'll see the margin upgrade there. And then in the U.S., as we've retooled it's that brand ladder, so we've put more rungs in the ladder so we're giving growers more options but we expect we'll see some of them step up to these better performing hybrids and better performing technology and there'll be a lift there in those segments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And I realize I didn't answer the second part of your question which was regarding production costs. So, as you know, there's been a lot of conversations around productions, I mean mainly in the U.S. this year and I mean based on production in terms of, I mean the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere and based on the investments we've made in productivity around the globe, I mean we feel that we are in the range of the assumptions that we built regarding our margin, so we are not at this point in time concerned about the impact of those production costs.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you, just on cash, what's your expectation for the use of cash next year? Do you need to keep $3 billion on the balance sheet over the course of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, as I said, this is definitely not our philosophy. Our philosophy has not changed. And in the same way as we've been thinking about, I mean using our cash this year through acquisitions within the technology space, I mean we are obviously looking at all of the opportunities in this area and we also, as I said during the script, we gave back two-thirds of our cash to our owners this year. So definitely, our intention is not to pile up cash on the balance sheet but we'll need to consider I mean the opportunities we have in the business and we'll obviously let you know.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and good morning, everyone. My question is just on the South American order book. If you could just &#x2013; obviously you had a great quarter there and from the guidance it sounds like you've got a lot of confidence in how the next quarter's going to play out. I just want to understand if and how the South American order book differs in sort of the way that it's put together relative to the one that, the U.S. one does from a timing perspective? And then also, is there a difference from an SG&amp;A perspective in terms of did you pay commissions down there in South America relative to the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the second piece. We do pay commissions and that rises as a function of sales rise, and so it's different in that respect and we've also, to Pierre's point, we made some incremental investment in Brazil in the last year and bolstered our sales team in anticipation of our Roundup Ready VT Double-Stacks Soybean coming on stream so we lifted investment in our sales organization there a little bit pre-launch. Pierre, a little bit on order book and timing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Vincent, although the order book is not as structured as it is in the U.S., what we've seen and that's actually been one of the drivers for our cash flow in Q4. We've been actually very happy to see prepaid coming from South America as you can see on the balance sheet in the deferred revenue line. So overall, it's not of the magnitude that we see in the U.S., I mean those prepays and those early orders in South America make us feel pretty good about our first quarter right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, maybe just as a follow-up. There's an increase in acreage it sounds like from what I'm reading in both Corn, in both Brazil and Argentina. So is the driver -- how much of the driver of the strength in South America is just that increase in acreage and how much of it do you think is going to come from gaining share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's three legs to the stool. A piece is acreage expansion, a piece that will be share growth and a piece that, to the previous question, is increased technification. And the fascinating thing in Brazil, for the last couple of years acres were flat to down but the bushels that they produced were up. And I think the -- that's the underlying evidence that even in flat to down acres, those big growers were technifying and driving yield. So I think it's intensity of production and there's still a long way to go in Brazil if you if you look at Brazil versus U.S. corn yields, it's <mark type="ph" /> intensive (37:23) production, it's growth in share and it's expansion on acres. And the three of them are important.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Thank you. Hugh, I understand it's still early with less than 25% of the U.S. of the U.S. crops pulled out of the ground, but based on the data you've seen so far, perhaps in the south, is it your expectation that your yield differentials versus competitive products will increase, decrease, or stay about the same for this harvest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's still early, Kevin. I mean we're -- it's hard to call a year or call a season based on southern data. I would expect it's going to be probably the same, but I'd rather get the harvest done. What we're seeing this year is because of the high temperatures in the summer, we're seeing bigger variability than usual. So I think the performance in some of those cases is going to be magnified because of that variability, but it's still early days. We'll have to get more in the Midwest and up in the northern country before we opine on that. I think come Investor Day we're all going to be a lot smarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. Just as a follow-up, Hugh, with regard to the 22 million to 24 million acre range you put forth for the Genuity family of products next year, what is the U.S. planted acreage forecast that that is predicated upon? And do you expect the mix or the composition among the constituent product family, SmartStax, VT Triple PRO and Doubles, to change materially in '12 versus '11?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll see the continued ramp in the Reduced-Refuge piece. I think that the interest, so the family you see becoming disproportionately important and occupying about three-quarters I think, of the Triple PRO, Triple market. So steady advancement. I think the interesting thing when you plot growth, we don't have 30 years, it's not too many years ago the number of acres in this you could lose behind the sofa. It was really quite small. Three years in, Kevin, if you look at that growth ramp over three years, it tracks almost exactly what our Triple PRO &#x2013; no, Triple growth was in the early years. So we saw phenomenally fast growth in Triples and if you look at that Reduced-Refuge family it tracks exactly on the same curve. And then on acre assumptions, we've not released that yet but we've tried to, we're usually conservative and we try and take a realistic band on that. But I'd rather get this year harvested before we get out on that.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Hugh, a question on your launch strategy going forward. When I was at the Farm Progress Show some of your researchers indicated that you've revamped your launch strategy a bit, specifically they cited drought tolerant corn, how it's going to be hopefully unregulated before the next planting season and you'll do some pretty wide scale testing. So are you kind of making a shift from fast and furious launches to get up to speed as quick as you can, to a slower, more deliberative approach? And if so, what do you think the benefits of this new launch strategy might be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Don. Thanks for the question. So the short answer is yes. So we're modeling this loosely on some of the beta testing that other companies have done over the years and other industries, so getting smarter faster and working more directly with growers in the early years and getting their feedback early, I think will stand us in good stead. So if you think -- I was talking earlier about that ramp or that growth curve in years one two, and three; the first year is financially immaterial. But the market research intensity on that one year is disproportionate to its importance.</p>
          <p>So we're going to spend, it's back to the future, we're going to spend more time with our growers in that first year and we're actually working through that beta-test model in Brazil, I think a couple of hundred farmers. Yeah, a couple of hundred farmers in Brazil on our Roundup Ready VT product and the beauty of that is you can fit 200 in a room together so they'll be our ambassadors on Intacta and we're going to learn a whole bunch more about that product directly from them as we go into our second year of launch and that's our intention with our first drought Trait that we will mirror that approach in the U.S. So, there's a lot of benefit and it's the truism, there's a lot of benefit in staying close to your customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So as a follow up, is one of the benefits here that hopefully with more expensive testing you can find out where you might have some genetics, Trait interactions that don't work out all that well and avoid some of the issues that you saw on Roundup Ready Beans and SmartStax in certain germplasm?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's absolutely right and the other benefit is you create the coffee shop so you have a community of 200 people who are going to be immersed in the early experience, are very proud to be part of it and are in an environment where they can give us direct, unvarnished feedback. So we're at an early stage in this but I really like the model, and the feedback from our grower customers has been very good.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. I was hoping that you might speak a little bit more at length about your success in the Corn segment, in that through the first three quarters, your revenue growth had been a little bit less than 10%, been high-single digits. And likewise, your gross profit growth had been similar. But this quarter your revenues were up, call it 60%, and your profit doubled. So, what was it about the fourth quarter that was so different from the other three quarters? Were there any special features? Were there currency effects? What made the numbers so good in the fourth compared to the previous three quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the way we look at the fourth quarter, so first of all, we had an extremely strong business performance in South America that definitely drove our margins up. And the second element that impacts also our overall margin in the fourth quarter is some of the true-ups we do at year-end that have been ending up being favorable in certain cases. So these are the major drivers for the region in the fourth quarter that we see this improvement in the margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so, if I could follow-up, how big were the true-ups and with the Brazilian currency weakening by 15% versus the dollar since the end of August how will you contend with that in the first fiscal quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So regarding the true-ups, I don't have the precise numbers. I mean this was basically fairly small. These were the returns that we saw in the U.S., the adjustments on the returns we saw in the U.S. And as it relates to the first quarter in Brazil, so I mean during the month of September we've been working with a set of assumptions regarding currency and definitely we are watching how the currency is evolving, but so far we are still within the range of assumptions we've been using to build our plan.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>You have given lower yield in North America due to heat stress, has that impacted your Seed production at all? And do you have to do more winter production in Latin America this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. P.J., thanks for the question. I'll maybe let Pierre say a few words as well. So we feel good &#x2013; so the short answer is, we saw some impact on Seed production, as did the whole industry, with warmer temperatures this summer, particularly evening temperatures. We get diverse production spread across the U.S., so all our eggs aren't in one basket there, and we still use the mitigating effect of production in Latin America and we've been watching our costs in that. But I think today we would say, there might be constraints in some varieties, but if the market grew significantly next year, we feel we'd be in decent shape to supply that expansion. I'll maybe ask Pierre just to say a few words on costs and how we're looking at that relative to &#x2013; covering that cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So as I mentioned, thanks to the investments we made over time in productivity in the U.S., ex-U.S., thanks to the diversity of the production sites we are using, we've been able for the most part to mitigate the impacts of those heat conditions. And although there has been an impact, I think we are still within the range of the assumptions we've built our plan around in terms of costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then secondly, as you grow your share and acres in Latin America, even today, their Trait Seeds and prices are lower than the U.S. So can you quantitatively talk about your profitability per acre in Latin America versus U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, PJ, our Trait pricing is &#x2013; expense is really quite similar to the U.S. So on the technology side of the house, it's very similar. The challenge &#x2013; and it's changing quickly, the challenge in those Latin American markets has been the pricing on germplasm and you can see that if the U.S. average yield in the last couple of years was 150 bushels per acre, then average yields in Brazil, India and Mexico were 50 bushels to 60 bushels an acre. So it's changing really, really fast because of technifying and the first big wave of technification is embracing better-performing germplasm. So the tech side of the &#x2013; the biotech side, pricing is pretty similar. On the Seed side, when you go down and you talk to these growers, they absolutely get it in germplasm and they're looking to trade up and drive more bushels off an acre, rather than breaking ground and bringing new acres in. So it came up on an earlier question, technification is really the central driver in this because that unlocks bushels.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hard to say. I mean, the last week was choppy with the USDA &#x2013; second tranche of USDA data and there's uncertainty in that, but the conversations that I've had and the feedback from our teams even with corn at these prices, growers are really focused on unlocking yield. When you look at the shift in commodity prices that's occurred relative to the assumptions that we made when we took the pricing decisions that we did, and there's always a really &#x2013; there's a long sequence in those, but as we looked at our pricing trajectory and the conversations we had around where we would place our pricing, even with these commodity prices, we feel very good with the decisions that we made.</p>
          <p>I can't speak for the growers, but the conversations that I've had, they are laser focused on driving yield. Even with the slippage in commodity prices, they're going to optimize yield and they're going to be looking for the best performing stuff. There is some chatter in the countryside about seed availability, and I think that's going to heighten their focus as they go into the back end of the year, but still time to go. We have got to get through harvest first, but that would be, if you're looking for color, that would be my experience in the last few weeks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hugh, I'm just trying to get a sense of how to put the 100 SmartStax varieties in perspective. You've often given us charts showing us how this launch works relative to other ones, but obviously it's, I can't compare this directly to the VT launch because it's such a different geography. But can you help us think about the geography of SmartStax and where this would place this launch in its evolution relative to where you would've been with VT in that same geography?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It puts us bang on target with hybrid expansion and previous historical launches. The difference would be the concentration. So we've really migrated our concentrated in that northern corn market and 100 hybrids there, pretty much colors in the map for that region. So it would be thinner in the central belt but where the market exists and where growers are looking for this edge with technology, 100 hybrids, we're where we need to be.</p>
          <p>&lt;Q &#x2013; [05KSVH-E Mark Connelly]: Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess first I just wanted to ask in the past you've given a gross profit multiplier for the migration from the Single Traits to Double Traits. Can you give a sense for what that gross profit multiplier will be in Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good one. You've got us scrambling here. Have we indexed that or --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah -- I'm sorry, this is Bryan. We've looked at that and I think as you kind of make the similar ascension in technology you're going to make similar step-ups in value. So if I isolate down onto a place like Brazil and then isolate down to what's currently commercial, you really go first with a first-generation insect control Trait and if you index off that as the baseline, when you're talking a step-up to the second generation of the Double Stack, you're really talking about better than a 50% increase in the value there. So it's a similar kind of ultimate trajectory that we would see in Trait price with the U.S., because as Hugh mentioned, the Trait pricing, particularly on the insect Traits in Latin America, is very similar to the U.S. So you would expect the step-up to be similar as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just to round out that picture, the gross profit multiplier of the Single Trait compared to the no-Traited product, just so that we can build out the bridge?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Some of the new Traited products that literally haven't come online yet will certainly be additive to that, but since we haven't priced those we haven't broken those out in particular.</p>

          <p>Okay, our next question is coming from the line of Michael Piken from Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning. A couple of questions. Number one, given that the farmers are potentially looking at a tight supply of hybrids for corn, and we've heard some talk that some guys may be trying to order from multiple suppliers to ensure they get the best hybrids, I mean how do you guys prevent farmer hoarding of maybe the top hybrids? Is there a way to do that and would the return policy potentially change next year given a potential for tight supplies of the best hybrids that the farmers want?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I tell you, I just love the idea of farmers ordering full stop. So I'm always happy to be at the end of the field and take that first order. And every year there's complexity and they have choice to buy from multiple people and they do. My experience, and I saw this last year, is some of these hybrids are literally ordered from the combine, so as he's cutting corn, he's on a cell phone trying to get hold of that top-performing hybrid for the coming year.</p>
          <p>So all that goes on in a normal year, there is some talk this year of tight supply and that will probably heighten sensitivity. But you can only do what you do, and for us, it's making sure we've got adequate supplies, making sure we're working directly with those growers. It's early days, a quarter of our way through harvest, but even with the shift in commodity prices in the last week, it wouldn't surprise me if this was a record income year for growers in the U.S. and if it's not a record year it's going to be in the top two or three. So they are really, really focused on optimizing genetics.</p>
          <p>And I've seen a heightened awareness on the performance of genetics and a heightened awareness on individual hybrid performance. So to your question, they may be laying off orders against multiple suppliers but this eventually shakes out and those orders firm up. And at the end of the day, you get through the noise and you make sure that you get the best possible stuff, priced properly. So that's kind of where we've been focusing on this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just as a follow-up question, there's been a lot of talk about potential shortages of corn hybrids. I mean did the freeze particularly have any impact on soybean seed availability for next year? And do you see that being an issue in any regions? Or do you think there is going to be an adequate supply of soybeans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In general, no. There's maybe some crimping in the extreme north, but the challenge was warm summer temperatures and there'll be some squeeze in some areas, but I think broadly speaking we're going to be tight but okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Kevin, this is Bryan. I think I see we're running up against out time here. I do want to leave just a brief moment for Hugh to give a quick wrap up. So I think we'd like to move to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I will be very brief because we ran over a little bit. I wanted to thank you for joining us on the call this morning. I think the obvious benefit on a call like this is we now officially turn our focus to 2012 and the opportunity that we see ahead in the next fiscal year and I think you gather from the tone today we see real opportunity. So if we look into 2012, let me tell you how we think that it sets up.</p>
          <p>First, with '11 complete, we are well set up for '12. We've carried the focus and execution and delivery through our last four quarters, and we accomplished what we needed to do this year to set up well to achieve mid teens earnings growth in '12 off a higher base. Second, we have good momentum going into '12. Beyond the financial opportunity, I would underscore that we feel good about where we stand with our strategy. More importantly we feel good where we stand with our grower customers and the positive direction that we take into this new fiscal year. And finally, and it's the obvious, but finally all of that is wrapped up in a larger, longer-term opportunity that we see as the global grain demand expands and that there's opportunity created for companies that can deliver new innovation to drive real productivity gains. And that's at the heart of our business model.</p>
          <p>So we will speak to more of this at our upcoming Investor Day in November. I hope that you'll be able to join us there. I look forward to sharing more with you at that time. Thanks very much for your attention this morning.</p>
