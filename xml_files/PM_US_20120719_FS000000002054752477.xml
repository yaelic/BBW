          <p>Good day and welcome to the Philip Morris International Second Quarter 2012 earnings call. Today's call is scheduled to last one hour including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2012 second quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.PMI.com. During our call today we will be talking about results for the second quarter 2012 and comparing them to the same period in 2011 unless otherwise stated.</p>
          <p>References to volumes are to PMI shipments. Industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to the volume excluding acquisitions and net revenues exclude excise taxes. Operating company's income or OCI is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles. You will find data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the end of today's webcast slides which are posted on our website.</p>
          <p>Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward looking and cautionary statement disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>It's now my pleasure to introduce Hermann Waldemer, Chief Financial Officer. Hermann?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Nick and welcome ladies and gentlemen. We again achieved strong underlying business results in the second quarter with actual results impacted by both unfavorable currency movements and the hurdle we faced in Japan due to our extraordinary results there during the second quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Our organic cigarette volume in the quarter was down 1.2% to 238.3 billion units. However, excluding the Japan hurdle of 6.3 billion units, organic cigarette volume was up 1.4%. In addition, our organic volume of other tobacco products increased by 11.8% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Net revenues and adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, were up by 2.9% and 3.5% respectively. Without the Japan hurdle, our growth rates would have been in line with our annual mid to long-term currency neutral targets of 4% to 6% and 6% to 8% respectively.</p>
          <p>Adjusted diluted EPS reached $1.36 in the second quarter, slightly ahead of last year and were up by 9% excluding the currency. If one also takes into consideration the previously disclosed Japan hurdle of $0.10 at an EPS level, then adjusted diluted EPS excluding currency was up by a very strong 17.7% in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Our results for the first half of the year were excellent. Organic cigarette volume was up 1.8%. Excluding currency and acquisitions, net revenues and adjusted OCI grew by 6.5% and 8.3% respectively. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS increased by 13.3% excluding currency.</p>
          <p>These results confirm our expectation of solid organic cigarette volume growth in 2012. We have the best geographic footprint in the industry and leadership in both emerging and developed markets. Our volume is growing strongly in many markets in both the Asia and EEMA regions, offsetting weaker volume trends in the EU region due to the deterioration of the economic situation and weaker consumer confidence.</p>
          <p>Consequently, we expect to continue to grow currency neutral profitability at a rapid pace with sustained strong pricing and a favorable product mix only partially offset by an unfavorable geographic mix.</p>
          <p>Exchange rates, however, continue to be volatile. At prevailing exchange rates, the forecast currency headwind this year is slightly higher than the $0.25 per share that we predicted in June. However, our underlying business is very strong. And this is expected to offset the additional unfavorable currency impact of $0.02 per share.</p>
          <p>We are therefore today reaffirming our reported diluted 2012 EPS guidance of $5.10 to $5.20 compared to $4.85 in 2011. On a currency neutral basis, our guidance implies a forecast growth rate of approximately 10% to 12%, compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $4.88 in 2011, this despite the Japan hurdle and weak industry volume in Europe. Let me remind you that our mid to long-term currency neutral annual growth target for adjusted diluted EPS is also 10% to 12%.</p>
          <p>As we indicated during our Investor Day last month, cigarette industry volumes in the EU region were unusually depressed in the second quarter. The overall decline was 9.7% with significant reductions not only in markets such as Greece and Spain, but also in Italy and Poland with even Germany suffering a 5.1% drop. The decline was driven by a reduction in daily consumption while smoking incidence has remained relatively stable.</p>
          <p>For the first half of the year, cigarette industry volume in the EU region was down 5.8%. This confirms that the second quarter decline was unusually severe as adult smokers adjusted to the renewed recessionary environment and there were some unfavorable timing issues.</p>
          <p>Our current expectations for the second half of the year is that the decline rate for cigarette industry volume in the EU region should be similar to that experienced during the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>The average unemployment rate across the European Union increased by 0.7 points between June 2011 and May 2012 with significantly more pronounced increases in Greece, Spain and Italy. Only Germany showed a meaningful decline. As a result of the deteriorating job market, the average unemployment level in the EU stood at 10.3% in May, with Spain and Greece double this level. France and Italy are just below the EU average while Germany and the Netherlands continue to have relatively low levels of unemployment.</p>
          <p>We have always highlighted unemployment levels and trends as key indicators for industry volume. We therefore do not expect a return to the normal underlying decline rate of 2% to 3% in the EU region until the issue is addressed in a meaningful way.</p>
          <p>We have achieved a resilient market share performance in the second quarter with 38.5% overall in the EU region, 0.2 points below the previous year's level. On a half-year basis our share of 37.9% was down 0.4 points. We are very encouraged by the performance of Marlboro in this difficult economic environment. In the second quarter, Marlboro's share in the region grew by 0.3 points to 18.4% and it was up slightly on a six-month basis. Marlboro gained share in the quarter notably in Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy and Poland.</p>
          <p>L&amp;M continued to grow share in markets such as Finland, Germany, Poland and Slovakia but this was not enough to offset declines in the quarter in Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.</p>
          <p>Chesterfield is performing very well, and is being successfully established as a strong second leg for us in the low-price segment in the EU region.</p>
          <p>We are rapidly gaining share in the growing fine cut category. Industry volumes increased by nearly 8% in both the second quarter and the first half as adult smokers downgraded to less expensive options. Our share of the fine cut category rose by 1.4 points in the quarter and by 1.7 points in the first half to 14.1% and 14% respectively.</p>
          <p>The market situation in Italy deserves specific attention. Cigarette industry volume in Italy declined by 10.5% in the second quarter and by 8.5% in the first half of 2012. The most important single factor has been a reduction in consumer purchasing power, aggravated by the payment of increased property taxes in June, and the increase in cigarette prices over the last 12 months. This unfavorable development in the cigarette industry is not a unique phenomenon as a wide range of consumer products have been affected by the economic slowdown.</p>
          <p>Impacting specifically the cigarette industry, there has also been downgrading to the fine cut category and an increase in illicit trade, particularly the so-called illicit whites which list brands such as Jin Ling and Classic. Despite recent price increases, the fine cut category grew by 74.6% in the quarter, though it still represents a relatively modest 6.5% of total tobacco industry volume.</p>
          <p>In terms of market share, Marlboro is performing strongly. It gained 0.3 points to reach a 23% share in the quarter, despite the continued pressure on the premium segment. However, our overall cigarette market share declined in both the quarter and the first half as the strong performance of Marlboro and the launch of Philip Morris Selection in the low-price segment were unable to offset the decline of our local heritage brand Diana. In contrast, our share in fine cut grew by 24.5 points in the quarter to a record level of 31%, firmly establishing us as the category leader in Italy.</p>
          <p>In Germany, cigarette industry volume declined in the quarter by 5.1%. This was attributable to the impact of the recent price increases, a decline in consumer confidence in spite of low unemployment rates, a difficult comparison with the second quarter last year that was up 4.6%, and some timing issues. We believe that the first half year decline of 1.3% is a better reflection of the underlying trends.</p>
          <p>PMI continued to perform strongly with further share gains in the second quarter. Our share in cigarettes was up 0.3 points to 36.4%. And our share in fine cut grew by 1.2 points to 16%. We are very pleased by the improved performance of Marlboro, which gained 0.3 points in the cigarette category and 1.2 points in the fine cut category while L&amp;M continued to grow share in the cigarette category and Chesterfield gained in both the cigarette and in the fine cut categories.</p>
          <p>As a consequence of the industry volume declines, our second quarter results were soft in the EU region. Cigarette volume was down 9.4%, only partially offset by a strong 18.2% growth in OTP volumes.</p>
          <p>Net revenues and adjusted OCI excluding currency and acquisitions were down 0.7 and 2.7% respectively. We were largely able to offset the lower volumes with higher prices. Excluding currency and acquisitions, June year-to-date net revenues increased by 2% and adjusted OCI was just above the prior year level on the same basis.</p>
          <p>In contrast, we had another very strong quarter in the EEMA region and our results year-to-date June, were equally excellent. In the quarter, organic volume grew by 4.9% while net revenues and adjusted OCI excluding currency and acquisitions increased by 12.7% and 22.9% respectively.</p>
          <p>While pricing at $114 million continued to be a significant contributor to the growth in EEMA's OCI, it was almost matched in the quarter by our $104 million volume mix variance. This is in fact the fifth consecutive quarter of positive volume mix in the region. This was driven by the strength of our brand portfolio, with a particularly encouraging performance of our premium brands, with volume up 7.4% in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Overall, nine of our top ten brands in the EEMA region grew volume in the quarter, with just Chesterfield down. Marlboro had a strong quarter with a volume gain of over one billion units or 5%, driven mainly by North Africa, Saudi Arabia and Serbia. The performance of Parliament was truly outstanding, with volume up 1.1 billion units or 16.3% driven mainly by Eastern Europe and Turkey.</p>
          <p>On a market basis, our strong results were led by Russia so let me provide you with further details on this important market. Though we do not have definitive data yet, we believe that the Russian cigarette market grew slightly during the first half of the year. We attribute this to an improvement in the economy and a return of foreign workers as the construction industry has started to pick up again. As a result of recent price increases in cigarettes, foreseen hikes in utility prices and a slightly slower expected economic growth in the second half of the year, we forecast that full year industry cigarette volume should reach a level similar to last year's.</p>
          <p>We are outpacing industry volume. During the second quarter, our volume increased at a much faster rate of 8.7% and was 5% higher in the first half. Two very important positive aspects of the Russian market were upgrading by adult smokers in spite of significant price increases and our ability to gain market share thanks to the strength and breadth of our brand portfolio.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, through the end of May, our market share was 0.7 points higher and 26.1% thanks to the strong performance of Parliament, L&amp;M, Bond Street and Next. We took a further price increase of 3 rubles per pack across our portfolio in July. We launched Marlboro Clear Taste in Russia in June. This is a much smoother tasting line of products, which addresses adult smoker preferences. We started the launch in key cities and have already achieved outstanding distribution and point of sale. Initial consumer feedback and trial data are positive. It will of course take several months before we can draw any further conclusions.</p>
          <p>Our performance in the Asia region was again very strong in the second quarter. This was, however, masked by the aforementioned hurdle in Japan. Our organic cigarette volume in the quarter was up 7.4% excluding the Japan hurdle, driven primarily by Indonesia, though down 0.7% on a reported basis. Likewise, excluding the Japan hurdle, adjusted OCI excluding currency and acquisitions would have shown a strong increase but it was down 2.6% including the full comparison for Japan.</p>
          <p>Industry volume in Japan increased by nearly 10% in the second quarter, compared to the distorted period last year. For 2012, we are now forecasting a stable total market, though the underlying trend remains a moderate decline of 1% to 2% a year going forward.</p>
          <p>During the first half of this year, Japan Tobacco accelerated its program of new launches and this has had some impact on our market share which reached 27.8% in the second quarter. This was 0.2 points lower than the previous quarter, but still substantially above the pre-earthquake share levels. Log Cabin 100s maintained an 0.4% market share and we launched Marlboro Black Menthol Edge 8 and Marlboro Menthol Edge 1 during the second quarter. Our latest launch this month is Marlboro Ice Blast in five milligram and one milligram variants, 8 milligram variant having achieved a 1.3% market share during the second quarter. With these efforts and additional new launches in the pipeline, we are confident that we should be able to stabilize our market position going forward.</p>
          <p>On the fiscal front, the Japanese government obtained parliamentary approval for a two-step increase in consumption tax, from 5% today to 8% in 2014 and 10% in 2015. While prices remain government-controlled, the last tax increases resulted in margin-enhancing price increases.</p>
          <p>Volumes continue to grow in the second quarter in Indonesia as expected at the slower rate than in the first quarter. Industry volume grew by 6.9% in the second quarter, while PMI volume increased by 17.8%. Supported by a strong economy, adult smokers have been up-trading to the premium segment, which has grown by two points in the first six months of this year.</p>
          <p>PMI has the strongest and broadest portfolio in the Indonesian market, along with an unmatched national distribution network and highly qualified and motivated employees. Our market share grew by 3.1 points in the quarter to 33.5% as Sampoerna A remains the fastest growing brand in terms of share gains, with an increase of 1.2 points to 13.1% and we continue to benefit from rounded price points. Going forward, we forecast a market growth of around 8% for the full year and look for further PMI share growth, though slower pace than in the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>Pricing continues to be the most important single driver of PMI's profitability. The pricing variance was $463 million in the quarter, giving a half year pricing variance of $872 million. This year we have increased prices notably in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Korea, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain and Ukraine.</p>
          <p>Our volume mix variance was obviously negative in the quarter due to the Japan hurdle. However, as you can see on the chart, excluding the hurdle, eight of our top ten brands grew volume in the first half of the year and the other two were essentially stable. In volume terms, Marlboro achieved the largest growth while in percentage terms Fortunes, Sampoerna A, Parliament and Lark all recorded double digit growth.</p>
          <p>We are continuing to expand our market share in our top 30 OCI markets. Our June 3-month moving average share of 36.9% is above both our 12-month moving share and the 2011 results, and 1.4 share points above the 2010 share level.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow declined in the second quarter by $703 million to $3.2 billion. Unfavorable currency movements were responsible for over half this decrease. In addition, we built up finished good stocks in Brazil and Russia and working capital consequently increased by $388 million. This will be reversed during the third quarter when this inventory is sold.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter, we spent a further $1.5 billion to repurchase 17.8 million shares. In June, the board approved a new three-year $18 billion share repurchase program which will start in August and funds from the previous program will have been fully utilized ahead of schedule. Our target remains to spend $6 billion on share repurchases this year. Since the spin through the end of June this year we spent $24.4 billion to repurchase 449.9 million shares, representing 21.3% of our shares outstanding at the time of the spin, at an average price of $54.21.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, the second quarter of 2012 was as expected a very strong one in terms of underlying business momentum, but a challenging one in terms of reported results due to the Japan hurdle and unfavorable currency movements.</p>
          <p>As we foresaw during our June Investor Day, EEMA and Asia region results are strong in the first quarter enabling us to offset unusually weak cigarette industry volume in the EU region. The breadth of our geographic footprint, the continued strong pricing environment based on our superior brand portfolio and productivity gains enabled us to grow both net revenues and adjusted OCI in the second quarter excluding currency and acquisitions. Adjusted diluted EPS ex-currency increased by 9% in the second quarter. If the $0.10 hurdle related to Japan were excluded the increase in adjusted diluted EPS ex-currency was a very substantial 17.7%, confirming the overall strength of our business.</p>
          <p>We have reaffirmed today our 2012 reported diluted EPS guidance of $5.10 to $5.20. Compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $4.88 in 2011, this represents a growth rate of approximately 10% to 12% excluding currency.</p>
          <p>Thank you. I'll be happy to answer your questions now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Hermann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two things I wanted to ask you; first in the EU do you think that you can maintain on a local currency basis the overall profitability of the business for the foreseeable future if volume declines persist at these above-trend rates, maybe not the rate in the second quarter, but at higher than historical rates of decline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'd say for this year, I mean for the second half we expect a similar decline but at the same time we continue to be cautiously optimistic to achieve low single digit OCI growth excluding currency, nevertheless. In the EU region in years before where we had similar decline rates, we had similar results.</p>
          <p>Yes, we see continued market declines there. But there are also, talking for this year, also several positives in there. In Italy, there was still the potential VAT increase looming in September that has been called off, postponed to next year. But who knows what happens until September of 2013, but it's not going to happen this year. In Spain, the VAT increase of 3% on all goods is being compensated for cigarettes by an ad valorem decrease. That's good news, too, of course. And in France some sort of price increase is going to come in the remainder of the year, and despite this economic trouble in the entire region, the Marlboro share is actually up.</p>
          <p>So overall, yes, I think we can do that. We can still achieve low single digit OCI growth also in the EU.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then the second question, Hermann, can you just update us all on the status of the potential excise tax increase in the Philippines and the potential for fairly substantial duty increase potentially in the GCC countries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Philippines first. The situation there is that the House of Representatives has passed a bill with a pretty substantial disruptive excise increases for 2013. Thereafter, even in that bill, the positive is that it takes a multi-year approach. But that is for now the House of Representatives. The legislative process is by far not being closed. After the summer recess first the Senate is expected to weigh in on the question. Then should there be a disagreement between Senate and House of Representatives, then it goes into the so-called Bicameral Committee. So what I'm telling you here is there is more discussions to come in the third and in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Then on GCC, well, there is a discussion going on. That discussion we have had for many years also in the past. It's still an open question. I really don't have an update to that one. To be seen the remainder of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're welcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Bonnie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow-up on the Philippines. Thanks for the update on the tax situation, which is helpful. But could you provide just a little more color on the current market dynamics? Just in terms of the market declining there, what's going on and how you expect this to evolve as the year unfolds and into next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, okay. First of all, let me start, then, with the economy. I see that the economic outlook in the Philippines, which is actually brilliant, the GDP the last number I saw I believe it was the quarter one number, up 6.4% with an inflation I think it has been May, a little less than 3%. Remittances of Filipinos working abroad up substantially. In one month, that's about an amount of $1.7 billion coming to the country. Therefore, I mean in terms of consumer environment, that's actually pretty good.</p>
          <p>That translates now in a total market where for the full year we would expect slight growth. So I would say the full-year market about 100 billion cigarettes. Last year was 97.5 billion roughly. So a slight increase, therefore, in the total market despite the price increase, as you know, that was there. In terms of shares, yes, fair we lost a bit of share and we lost that share essentially to some local company there which, let me put it this way, sells at surprisingly low prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thanks, Hermann. Then just a second question on your Be Marlboro campaign. Could you give us further details on the roll-out and then maybe a little more color on just some key markets where this campaign has been having a positive impact on Marlboro.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>First of all, is, of course, where it started. It's in the German market, where it has been doing tremendously well. Continues to do tremendously well. I mean it is, as you know, it is the continuation at the end of the day and the translation into modern values of what also the Marlboro campaign, the cowboy campaign, stood for. So it's receiving excellent feedback, continues to receive excellent consumer feedback in the German market.</p>
          <p>In adaptations, you will find it in more and more markets around the world. It's not always going to be exactly the same what you see in Germany. But it's the same idea, the same philosophy behind. And we will roll it out from there. It has started in some Latin American markets and it will go further. It is the new worldwide campaign.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First, in Japan, so the consumption tax proposals that you've talked about in Japan, other than the consumption tax increases, are there any discussions of national or regional tax increases that are being discussed at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>While not regional, what will come later in the year is, of course, a discussion on the excise tax outlook. Typically as the budgetary year of the government goes from first of April to the end of March there, as you of course perfectly know, these discussions will start in December with a decision kind of by year-end. At this point in time, I really couldn't predict the outcome there.</p>
          <p>But it is obvious and clear that we will be advocating for a multi-year excise tax plan which would be beneficial for both the government in their quest to maximize revenues and could also be profitable for us at the same time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there anything to glean from the fact that they did approve the other consumption tax increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would say it is a positive there. It is a first step into developing an entire refinancing plan, if you like, for all the funds needed to cope with the cost of the natural disaster of last year. So in that context the discussions take place. Consumption tax was, of course, the key element in there; excise tax, I believe, is going to be a normal discussion. It will not be dominated by that question.</p>
          <p>On the consumption tax, just also to put that a bit into the context, that's something that is going to be manageable for us. It always depends, of course, what you assume to be the price level when the consumption tax kicks in at that time, April 2014 and October 2015. But kind of the first increase means a rollover about &#xA5;15 yen and the second one means a rollover of about &#xA5;10 per pack. That's manageable, of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. And you've talked about the market in Japan, the market consumption decline this year being now more stable. Can you just talk about why at least this year the market seems to be doing better than expected?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, at the first quarter call I think I still expected 1% to 2% decline there. It's, of course, to be honest, it's a hard market to read with all the distortions from last year into this year. We had a prolonged period where smoking incidence had stayed stable. It has come down a little bit the last two months but not much. So that's why I think that the underlying really is probably a 1% to 2% decline going forward. Now I'm talking next year and thereafter plus, of course, eventually pricing. I'm talking about the underlying trend. But this year when we take it all together, it will be our best estimate is now it should be about flat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just in terms of your guidance, so if you look at first half, your adjusted earnings up 13.3% excluding currency, even with the hurdle that you faced in second quarter from Japan. It sounds like just based on your guidance maybe a little bit of a slowdown in the back half. I'm just wondering if there are any other factors that sort of makes you think that that earnings growth could slow down in the back half, are you thinking just in terms of Europe potentially a bit more conservative stance? I'm just wondering if there's anything to think about in the back half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean there is nothing on the underlying business trends there. It is simply often a question of comparisons. If I take the Japan hurdle out, then organic volume in the first half has been growing 3.3%. I can't expect 3.3% for the full year, and I think nobody does. Although we are optimistic to achieve our mid to long-term organic volume growth target of 1% despite the hurdle in Japan. To give you one example of tough comps, if you go to the EEMA region, then the first half volume results compared to declining trends in the first half of 2011, whilst the second half of the year will compare to already an overall growth rate of 2.4% in the second half of 2011 last year in that region. So it's a bit of comps, but underlying our business is in very good shape and Europe has of course been factored in into our full-year guidance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just going back to Europe and Southern Europe specifically, could you just talk about if the volume trend in those countries has changed much compared to what you indicated at the Investor Day and what gives you confidence that the volume in southern Europe will have been most weakest this quarter and then stabilize more in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, things have not really changed much compared to the Investor Day projections. The quarter has come out slightly worse than what we already had highlighted there. I mean, in terms of market size, the best will be because of the biggest markets there. Germany which has been down in the second quarter by 5.2% is down on a year-to-date basis 1.3%. So I would say in Germany expect about 1.5% for the full year. So the 5% are not representative at all in that sense.</p>
          <p>Italy is a complicated market these days. And I had it in my prepared remarks. Austerity measures and consumer confidence going down doesn't make it easier. However, I would say for the full market for Italy I would expect something like 7.5%, maybe 8% decline; the first quarter was down 6%. The second quarter was down 10.5%. 7.5% to 8% could be a full-year number there in Italy.</p>
          <p>Spain, I think the forecast that we had of something in the range of 10% for the full year outlook is still a reasonable assumption. It is, of course, was very important that the VAT increase has been offset by reduced ad valorem rates. So therefore in that context I think the minus 10% for Spain is still a realistic number. If I add in then France, then I would say take out the technical factors and stuff, something like 3% is probably a realistic assumption for France.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then the other question I had is your commentary in the guidance, the language about the anticipated business improvement in Asia and EEMA regions, it sounds like that's mainly you're seeing better macro trends in Russia. Your growth in Indonesia, are there any other specific positives that you are calling out in those two regions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we just raised our prices by three rubles in Russia in July. It plays into that one as well. But other than that, yes, the overall environment is really good. The economic environment is kind of the antidote of what we see in the EU region and with the right portfolios, the right brands we are benefiting from those trends in those parts of the world.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I wanted to ask you two questions if I could. The first was a bit of a follow on to Japan. It sounds like you're now expecting sort of share stabilization there for the year. And really just more of a question about why. That is, do you have less new product activity, you're seeing a little bit more competitive activity of course out of Japan Tobacco, maybe it's a combination of factors. I just wanted to get a little more perspective on your expectation for share in Japan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, we had a very slight loss here. I mean, we came down from 28% to 27.8%. That's a slight loss. We are competitive people. We don't like that. But one also has to acknowledge that competitors are not asleep on the switch either. We have had a very successful launch with Marlboro Black Menthol as you remember. JT has come out now also with a successful highly mentholated product that they pushed into the market that has had some share consequence on us. But that's the second quarter.</p>
          <p>As I said, we are already out there in July ourselves with new launches with five milligram and one milligram versions of Marlboro Ice Blast. The eight milligram version is the one that has 1.3% share, which is after such not so long period in the market a fantastic share, while competition will go on. And we are never afraid of competition, but we take also the other one serious. That's all there is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sounds like it's not a change, though, in sort of new product introductions or plans for, say, the second half of the year, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We still have more in the pipeline for the second half of the year, of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just wanted to be clear on that. And I just had a question for you, follow-up on the EU. Obviously we had a obviously difficult quarter this quarter and expectation for that to improve a bit from where we were this quarter, and I wanted to be clear in the second quarter, were there any &#x2013; was there any negative effect on volumes from inventory distortions or movements that made this quarter look a little worse than what the underlying results would have shown.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, Germany has been comparing to a second quarter in 2011 that was up by 4.6%. I mean, it happens to be that the Easter is in the first quarter and the second quarter from one year to the next. That's just very, very technical there. So, yeah, there were some inventory movements in there. And typically at quarter end you sometimes see intense activity of some competitors with the trade which we don't do.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I wouldn't expect a change in general trends there. It's really &#x2013; it's kind of a lot of activities go into the second quarter before the summer break and then you have it picking up towards year end. That's a very normal pattern which has not changed over the years. I don't see it changed now either.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brazil. Well, in Brazil you, of course, have now had the pricing is implemented, the tax increase was made first. All the prices are there. We do see an adherence of local manufacturers to the new minimum price of R$3 there but as the minimum price is still relatively low, I think the real effect will only come with the already scheduled and foreseen minimum price increases over the years. We don't see, however, really an improvement on the illicit product flowing in from Paraguay into Brazil.</p>

In Germany, the growth has &#x2013; it's still growing but it has slowed down a little bit. But that's fine with me. It's been recuperated with Marlboro. And then when you go over to Spain, well, in Spain the declines there in Spain are actually linked to brands that absorb part of the minimum tax today there. I'm talking about brands that sell at less than $3.55 (sic) [&#x20AC;3.55] This is today &#x2013; this is today to kick in with minimum tax. That kick-in actually is going to &#x20AC;3.77 September 1. So I look forward to that date.</p>

We will keep on working on our new launches and being competitive in the market. A one-time hit is not a change of trend.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then last question I had for you, with illicit trade picking up again in Canada, is that a cautionary tale that maybe sustainable fighting of illicit trade is much harder than some short-term successes might imply?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Honestly, to the contrary, or you might further elaborate thereafter, to the contrary, I have big hopes that illicit trade will come further down in Canada because the province of Ontario has declared that they are essentially copying the measures that the province of Quebec had implemented, what was it now two years ago, which have brought quite a bit of volume back into the legal tax paying market. So as the enforcement in Ontario kicks in and the total illicit trade in Ontario is estimated to be about four billion cigarettes. So quite a bit of that could come through and the legal market could benefit from that. So honestly I would expect the opposite going forward in Canada.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My first question has to do with the launch of the new Marlboro line in Russia. You guys posted volume growth on the Marlboro brand in that market for the first time in a number of quarters. And I'm curious if you could give us a sense of how much of that growth was from the sell-in of the new products versus any kind of underlying benefit to organic volumes from Marlboro.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the second quarter, on Marlboro Clear Taste, that is of course now we talk shipment numbers. We don't talk Nielsen numbers. We talk shipment numbers. You still of course have a pipelining effect bringing the product to the distributor and from there into wholesale and retail trade. The volume, total volume increase in the EEMA region in the quarter was 3.8 billion cigarettes. Out of that, roughly 10% has been Marlboro Clear Taste. So, yes, it's there. It's some pipelining effect. But it's just 10% of the overall growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. My next question again on EEMA has to do with Turkey. At your analyst day you highlighted some early successes in reductions in the illicit trade, and it sounds like that was again a benefit to the Turkish market in the quarter, given the acceleration you've seen there, I think 4.5% percent roughly year-to-date volume growth for the industry. Do you have a sense of how much volume is coming back into that market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Our latest estimate is that illicit trades has come down by about 3 percentage points national average from 20% actually to 17%. That's our latest estimate. These are of course by definition always estimates. So the 4% growth that you quoted, that's actually a good estimate for the full year.

        <plist>
          <p>Wonderful. And my last question has to do with Spain. And I hate to split hairs here, Hermann, but as I think about your outlook for the full year of 10% in line with year-to-date and I look at the comps that you face, I think it implies some kind of improvement in the back half of the year, because one-half of 2011 the market was down 19%. Then you finished the year down 17%. So is it the VAT change or is there something else that gets you on the margin incrementally more positive that despite a tougher comp you can maintain the trend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a multitude of factors at play here. There were the price increases that we have seen. Several ones as you remember. There is now -- there hasn't been a price increase now for a while and the VAT threat has been avoided. Then in terms of comparisons, it was also a question of how much volume is in retail trade. So at the end of the day that's the best estimate we have coming out of the Spanish market, can it be 11%, can it be 12%, it could. But we talk something around 10% for the full year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'd like to ask about plain packaging; and I'm wondering if there's a difference in the WTO challenge having the Dominican Republic file a complaint. Does this mean that there's more momentum in the formal adjudication panel? And then secondly is there any read-through from that to what may happen in the UK with the consultation underway, and then perhaps just a result sometimes towards the end of this year beginning of next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On plain packaging, you have actually mentioned two of the three developments in that area. The WTO claim of the DR that has now officially filed a request for consultation with Australia actually I believe yesterday or the day before yesterday, that adds another country and adds more clout and pressure into the procedure. We continue to be optimistic that more countries will actually follow that example. So that puts simply more weight into the WTO claims between those governments.</p>
          <p>On the UK, the extension of the consultation period by another month now to mid-August because that was supposed to end mid-July is simply driven that a lot of people have made submissions and continued to make submissions to the government. I take it as a sign that the government is serious about their evaluation effort in that process. And if that is all happening on a rational basis, and I continue to think that this is the case, then I would also expect that the UK government comes to the same rational conclusion as they came to two and a half years ago in order to implement.</p>
          <p>The third new element, the new one is actually under the bilateral investment treaty claim that Philip Morris has. The first procedural hearing is actually now scheduled for July 30 in Singapore.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Remember when we were here the first quarter call, there we had a press statement of the finance minister and the deputy prime minister that they will address the excise tax structure. That has happened. The Council of Ministers has authorized specific tax to be implemented to an amount of up to 20% of the minimum excise tax. The timing and the actual percentage and amounts, that's still to be defined. But I would expect it still this year. So I think that is a positive development and a sign of rationality in the whole process.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was wondering if you could help me with the Marlboro brand franchise. We saw volumes slow sequentially from Q1 to Q2, and we saw good share growth continuing in Q2. But how should I think about that franchise in the second half, the impact of markets, pricing, innovation, can you just help me think about volume and share progression as the year unfolds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, really not even the quarter if I go to year-to-date, yes for Asia, I have to take the hurdle out. But excluding the hurdle in Asia Marlboro is up 0.2 to 6.2%. That's all year-to-date June numbers. In the EU, it's up 0.3 to 18.4%. In EEMA it's up 0.1 to 6.9% despite still measured by Nielsen declines in Russia. Latin America up 0.4 to 14.2%. So, yeah, it's growing. It's also growing in terms of shipments. So even year-to-date, including the hurdle it's up 1.7%. Excluding the hurdle, it's up 2.9%. And if I then move over to really to the big markets where it's really substantially up, then you have there, first of all, I would think of Mexico, it's growing &#x2013; now I mean the quarter &#x2013; 1.2 percentage points to 53.2%. I mean, the brand's in terrific shape there.</p>
          <p>It's growing by 0.9% in Poland. In Poland you see a phenomenon that the top ten brands really capture more and more of the market volume and you see a consolidation into fewer brands. That's clear upgrading potential for us and for Marlboro, also L&amp;M there. Germany we talked about earlier on the call. Italy it's growing despite recessional environment. And 0.3 percentage points to 4.5% in Indonesia given the size of the Indonesian market is quite some volume.</p>
          <p>When you go to those markets where Marlboro is actually down, then there are very specific reasons in there, understandable reasons, which are not there to be forever. Korea it's down 0.9 to 7.7%. While that is clearly driven by our price increases that we implemented, and we compare still to the periods that we had a price advantage versus international competitors and we're at par with the Korean competitor. In France, it's down 0.8 in the quarter to 25.2%, very simply driven by the fact that Marlboro is the only big brand who is retailing at above &#x20AC;6 there; a lot of brands retail below &#x20AC;6. As I mentioned earlier, there is a price increase coming up in France. And in Spain, the decline, well, in such a recessionary environment, what else could we expect?</p>
          <p>But take it all together, driven by the innovation, driven by new campaigns, driven by better execution on the marketing and sales level, i.e., our new commercial approach, Marlboro is doing well. Pockets of weakness like Russia exist and we work on those. I'm very positive on Marlboro overall.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Hermann. Just one last question on the EU not to beat this thing to the death but it does sounds like you're indicating broadly across the segment that I guess the first half volume numbers may be a better indicator of what the go-forward looks like than are the Q2 numbers, right? Even though it looks like things have continued to worsen, especially from a macro perspective and the number was a little worse than you even thought a month ago. So I guess can you give a little bit more color on what the inventory/timing piece of the EU is that will cause Q3 and Q4 to get better than Q2? Just trying to understand why we think that that first half number's a better indicator than the more recent Q2 number. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is many markets in there and as I said earlier, Germany is just, I think, it's the most flagrant example there. I mean, you had a Q2 down by 5.2% whereas the year-to-date is down by 1.3%. And our full-year estimate for the German market is down 1.5%. So you have this technical reason in the second quarter where in Q2 2011 you compare to an up of 4.6%. These are comps. Let's not get hung up too much really on quarters. Year-to-date trends are the more reliable indicator. And I'm not talking it rosy here. Yes, EU region is not easy. But there is no reason to believe that the EU region is now going to be down 10% for the rest of the year. It's not going to be down 10% for the year. It's going to be down in the range of where the year-to-date is, which is anything around 6%.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>One quick question. You had said your estimate for the increase in leaf cost was around 2% for 2012. Has that changed at all with the drought in the U.S.? Is there upward pressure on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I mean what we see there really is about 2%, 2.5% 2.5% I think is the most realistic number of the kilo prices going up, for the drought in the U.S. I mean, this is a worldwide business. One individual geography does not change total trends. So maybe marginally but not substantially.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And then you had cited Thailand and Vietnam as a couple of the drivers for growth in Asia. Those are obviously relatively small markets for you. But could you give a little color on what's going on there, were they up quite a lot to be worth mentioning? What sort of growth is it you're seeing there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Vietnam, remember we have kind of restructured a bit our business setup there last year, which has given us better influence on our marketing and sales of our products. We are actually from a very low base almost doubling our volumes in that market. But admittedly from a low base. We concentrate on five or six big cities. The best example that highlights the future growth potential is actually that in the city of Hanoi we now have a market share of about 15%. So there's plenty of possibility going forward.</p>
          <p>Thailand is a bit more volatile environment where we are up against a well-protected third Thai monopoly, but we have good brands there, but it's a bit more complicated there, I would say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful. Thanks. And lastly just in Indonesia, obviously the volume growth there is very strong. What kind of pricing gain did you see in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Indonesia, the way we implement pricing in Indonesia is actually that we increase several times over the year. It can be anything between five to eight times on average per year, our trading prices into the wholesale trade. So it's not like in many other places where you have whatever an excise increase and the morning thereafter all the prices changes. So Indonesia has constant pricing throughout the year.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Two if I can. Just coming back to the guidance not changing obviously as you made the point, a little bit worse than we saw you in June, the currency obviously a little bit worse as well. Could you be a little bit more specific about which markets have got better over the last, I guess, four to six weeks that leave you confident that you're still in that range, or was there a little bit of comfort baked into the previous guidance and you're just not through that level yet?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just following up on that Indonesian point, clearly that's been a huge success for you both in terms of the market but your market share performance. Are you seeing anything from competitors in terms of trying to arrest that market share momentum that you're seeing or would you be confident that that will continue given what you're doing there through the second half in terms of market share? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with Indonesia. As I said, also even in the prepared remarks and before I mean we don't &#x2013; nobody can expect continued share growth in the range of three percentage points all the way along. We have said that this is going to slow down a bit. But that being said, I'm just convinced that we have the best company there. We have the best brands. We have great management. We have great employees. We have great distribution. We're just doing extremely well. And overall the pricing environment is rational. The government, yes, is increasing excise taxes every year. But has not done that for years in a disruptive manner. So the elements are all there for a very positive performance to continue in the Indonesian market.</p>
          <p>And then to your first question on the overall guidance, I mean, let me answer that way. We are all very pleased to see that our Asian growth engine is now complemented by very strong performance also in Eastern Europe.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Russia by its sheer size, of course, is the most important market in the EEMA region. But there is also Turkey. There is also Ukraine. There is Kazakhstan. There is North Africa, there is the GCC countries which are also very prosperous countries with growing population and growing purchasing power. So there are many places in that region. Of course, Russia is the most important, but there are many others.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just wanted to go back to the EU and ask you to comment on how you see the balance of volume and pricing in light of the apparent increase in price elasticity and the illicit trade and really what I'm trying to get at is whether or not these conditions and competitive dynamics might warrant a change in thinking about pricing, particularly if macro pressures seem &#x2013; as they do &#x2013; seem likely to persist? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Honestly, I don't think so, because when it comes to pricing, then the first thing you need to think about is excise tax. And governments all across Europe have been rational. I think there can't be a more convincing example of the very recent one in Spain that disruptive measures do not maximize excise revenues but regular moderate steps maximize excise revenues. That is at the same time the best not only for the governments but also the best for industry competitors like ours.</p>
          <p>So I do not see a change in the rational environment. You have seen a continuation of that rational environment if you look back over the last two years. The European crisis is already going on for a little longer than the last six months. And I see no sign why that all of a sudden would turn and change into an unreasonable environment. I can't see that.</p>

          <p>Hermann, I'm delighted to ask the last question of you in this role. Congratulations and good luck. My two quick questions, can you spend a second talking about the role of Lark in Japan. It seems like the brand that's been most impacted by the Japan hurdle. And tell us about the strength of Lark and the innovation applied to Lark in Japan. And then the second question was just to look for an update, any kind of narrative on the next generation products that you tipped us to recently and whether there's been anything newsworthy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean on Lark in Japan, let me put it this way, Lark is more of a traditional brand, more of a Japanese brand, as funny as that might sound. That's why it's probably a little bit more vulnerable than a truly international brand like Marlboro is. That's why successful launches of competitors as the one I was quoting probably is putting more of a dent into a Lark than it eventually could put into a Marlboro. That being said, it has been a big growth driver last year. So everything has two sides. So we did capture a lot of additional smokers into Lark during the special situation, the crisis of last year.</p>
          <p>In terms of NGPs, there's really nothing new to report compared to our presentations that we had at our Investor Day really only a month ago.</p>
