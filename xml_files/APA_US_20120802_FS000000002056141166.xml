          <p>Good afternoon, my name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation second quarter 2012 earnings release conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Patrick Cassidy, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Regina. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us for Apache Corporation's second quarter 2012 earnings conference call. This morning we reported earnings of $337 million, or $0.86 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings, which exclude certain items that impact the comparability of results, totaled $821 million, or $2.07 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations totaled $2.4 billion for the quarter.</p>
          <p>On today's call, we will have three speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. First, we will hear from Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Rod Eichler, President and Chief Operating Officer, and finally Tom Chambers, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>We've prepared our quarterly supplemental data package for your use, which also includes a reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss, such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations, or pre-tax margins. This data package can be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com/financialdata.</p>
          <p>Today's discussions may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions, and no assurances can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website.</p>
          <p>With that I'll turn the call over to Steve.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Patrick, and good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us today.</p>
          <p>I'm sure all of you have seen, in our recent Investor Day we outlined our extensive oil and liquids drilling inventory in the onshore U.S. We have over 67,000 future drilling locations that have been technically assessed, and we also have 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent net unbooked inventory that is available to drive our growth in the years to come. And this inventory is already beginning to deliver meaningful results in our onshore. During the second quarter, our Permian and Central regions grew net production at an annualized pace of 23% and 18% respectively. And this is before the contribution of Cordillera assets that we acquired at the end of April.</p>
          <p>Obviously not every quarter's going to be as good, but we're firmly on track to deliver the double-digit growth in these regions for the years to come, as we outlined in our Investor Day. Moreover, if you count the land drilling rigs operating in the United States from the Rockies to East Coast, Apache has 62 rigs running, which is the second-most-active operator out of all the independents and majors. And that's only behind Chesapeake, which really has a different focus and business model. I might point out that not a single one of the 62 rig is drilling a gas target. We said we were going to step up our U.S. drilling activity to exploit our enlarged portfolio, and we're doing just that.</p>
          <p>Our total reported production in the second quarter was reduced by &#x2013; which is the difference between a hit and a miss on our production growth. We had offline about 16,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. This includes 4,800 barrels a day due to unscheduled downtime, at our third-party operated SemCAMS plant in Kaybob in Canada. We had 2,000 barrels of oil a day down in the Gulf Coast onshore due to a third-party pipeline outage in the Lake Pagie field. 3,200 barrels of downtime due to unscheduled facility repairs at Grand Isle 43, which is a complex in the Gulf of Mexico. And 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day out of service due to ESP failures at the Forties field. Most of the 16,000 barrels a day is already back on stream or is expected to be back before the end of the year.</p>
          <p>I know downtime happens; it's part of our business. The important thing is that we have a robust portfolio, so it really doesn't impact us over the longer term in the performance of the company. We remain on track to deliver our production growth guidance in 2012, without any need to significantly increase our capital program for the year. We have a very active exploration program through the rest of the year, and we expect to further accelerate our exploration activities in next year and beyond.</p>
          <p>I'm sure most of you have read, the Gulf of Mexico, we've expanded our exploration block portfolio by 40%. We were the most active bidder in the central Gulf of Mexico lease-sale held in June. We picked up 90 blocks, 61 on the shelf and 29 in the deepwater. We're excited about the prospects we've identified on the blocks that we've won and expect to ramp up our exploration activity in the Gulf of Mexico significantly over the coming quarters. We've already secured one new-build semi, submersible deepwater rig, which will be dedicated to this effort, and it should be delivered in the middle of 2013.</p>
          <p>In Kenya, our offshore Mbawa well prospect is expected to spud in about 10 days. We should have results by our earnings call in November. This month, we're deploying one rig in the Mississippian Lime, where we've built it to 580,000 net acres. We're also deploying one rig in the Williston Basin, where we have secured a new exploration position of about 300,000 acres. Both of these, we're expected to drill four to six wells at each one of these two exploration plays over the next six months. We also plan to spud our first Alaska Cook Inlet well in October. So we're very enthusiastic about Apache's enlarged portfolio &#x2013; what we're delivering and what's ahead of us.</p>
          <p>We've already become one of the most active U.S. onshore drillers among our peers in the majors, and we're pursuing an exciting portfolio of global exploration opportunities. We're doing this all while maintaining our rate-of-return focus and the financial discipline that are defining characteristics of Apache.</p>
          <p>I'd like to turn the call over to Rod Eichler.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve.</p>
          <p>I'll begin with onshore North America, as it was the focus of our recent Investor Day conference and is the area where we are currently most active. In the Permian, we reached a company milestone in the second quarter, with production surpassing the 100,000-barrel-of-oil-equivalent-per-day marker for the full three-month period. During the second quarter of 2012, net production was up 5.3% over the previous quarter at 104,500 barrels equivalent per day, of which 72% was liquid, and more than three-quarters of that was crude oil. Also included in total volumes are nearly 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of positive prior-period adjustments, the majority of which are attributed to non-operated fields.</p>
          <p>Drilling at Deadwood in the Midland Basin in Glasscock County continues to be a large contributor to growth, with horizontal drilling in the Wolfcamp emerging as a new development area. For the quarter, the Permian averaged 32 drilling rigs, up four from the previous quarter, on the base properties, adding 187 wells, of which 167 were vertical and 20 were horizontal. We are currently running 36 rigs. Other than two weeks of working inventory, we have almost no backlog of stimulation jobs.</p>
          <p>In the Deadwood vertical play, we are targeting Wolfwood &#x2013; that is, the Woodford through the Wolfcamp reservoirs, Fusselman vertical wells. We've had several notable test results, with wells flowing in excess of 300 to 400 barrels of oil per day for intervals covering the Wolfwood reservoirs. We also have a number of locations where we'll initially complete only in the deeper Fusselman formation and recomplete at Wolfwood formations at hole. Our Amberjack well is a Fusselman-only completion and tested at a rate of 285 barrels of oil per day, plus 180 Mcf per day. These add volumes at a very low cost, boosting the well's EUR and rate of return. We estimate that one out of five Deadwood wells can produce from the Fusselman. We're currently drilling primarily at 40-acre spacing at Deadwood, testing some 20-acre downspacing. This program's expected to remain active through 2012, drilling more than 300 wells in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>In our Wolfcamp Shale play in Irion County, our four Wolfcamp horizontals have produced more than 190,000 barrels of oil equivalent since March 19. These are outstanding wells, all upper Wolfcamp producers, nothing from the middle zones. This appears to be a very thick, very brittle shale and breaks nicely with fracture stimulation. We currently have three rigs running in the play and have already drilled five additional wells, which are currently being completed or are expected to be completed soon.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our Central region in Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. Second quarter production averaged 55,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 47% increase over the preceding period. Nearly 30% of that production was liquids, as the region continues its transition to oil and liquid-rich plays. A total of 28 wells were completed in the period, with 12 in the Granite Wash formation, averaging a 30-day IP rate of 1,625 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 54% is liquids. We also completed 10 Tonkawa wells with an 30-day IP rate of 310 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and these are 80% liquid producers.</p>
          <p>I continue to be impressed with our Bivins Ranch development in the Texas Panhandle. Apache holds a 74% working interest in 24,000 contiguous acres in Oldham, Hartley, and Potter counties. We have completed eight out of our first nine Canyon Wash tests. Six wells averaged more than 400 barrels of oil per day for the first 30 days. Our two newest wells completed in the last couple of weeks are currently testing just under 700 barrels and roughly 1,000 barrels of oil per day. We have just completed installation of a 10-inch pipeline and gathering system and are now selling 3,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day from Bivins Ranch. Look for even more results in the future, as a second rig is scheduled to arrive in Bivins Ranch in mid-September.</p>
          <p>Assimilation of the Cordillera operation is fully under way. We started the period with 10 rigs, averaged 19 for the quarter, and exited with 22. And we're currently at 24.</p>
          <p>Before moving to the Gulf of Mexico, I want to comment briefly about onshore costs and takeaway capacity. We are seeing some softening for service costs across the board. Historically, we've seen costs come down in a lower commodity price environment. Our activity level and growth plans provide us with the flexibility to adjust our operations as circumstances change. Our drilling program is based on a rate of return, not on commodity prices. If trends continue, we expect to maintain or even increase our activity in today's market conditions. We also have not had any material issues involving NGLs. Apache has been very proactive in securing markets for its liquids where possible. For example, we've entered into a joint venture to build a new gas processing plant and to rail NGLs to the Gulf Coast. We are continuing to work with other Permian Basin or midstream players that control Apache NGLs to secure unconventional means to avoid product curtailments due to NGL constraints.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Gulf of Mexico shelf, we TD'd seven wells during the quarter and operated five rigs with an 83% success rate. Our production for the second quarter of 98,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was down 7% over the previous quarter. Downtime at the Grand Isle 43 complex for repairs and maintenance impacted our production during the period. Third-party pipeline and host facility downtime during Tropical Storm Debby also deferred volumes. These shut-ins were partially offset by new pipeline installations at Vermillion 380 and Ship Shoal 91, and new wells at both Eugene Island 330 and Main Pass 308. The Grand Isle 43-8 facilities began ramping back up last week and is expected to be at the full rate, over 7,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day net, later this month.</p>
          <p>Notable drilling activity during the quarter included a well at Main Pass 308, which IPed at more than 900 barrels of oil per day. We have four additional locations to drill here. We also successfully drilled two wells in the Main Pass 311/314 area, finding 120 feet and 39 feet of pay respectively and are in process of completing them.</p>
          <p>On the regulatory front, 17 of 61 blocks where we were the high bidder in the June lease sale have been awarded so far. The permitting environment continues to improve, both for drilling and exploration plans.</p>
          <p>In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, production increased 13% from the previous quarter to 15,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The Mandy subsea tieback project in Mississippi Canyon 199 came online, producing 5,000 barrels of oil per day and 3.5 million cubic feet of gas per day gross. We hold a 50% working interest in two wells in this field and a 15% override in the third.</p>
          <p>Our Geauxpher well, Garden Banks 462, continues to produce, holding up the start of our Bushwood development in the adjacent block, Garden Banks 463. We are ready to commence production once the Geauxpher well is depleted. Bushwood's expected to IP at about 50 million cubic feet of gas per day, and we hold a 50% working interest.</p>
          <p>Development continues at Lucius in Keathley Canyon 875, with spar and topside construction in progress and major service and equipment contracts awarded. We expect development drilling to commence in the second half of the year, with initial production still expected by year-end 2014.</p>
          <p>Our deepwater team was also very active in the central Gulf of Mexico lease sale, bidding on 43 blocks, 19 with partners. We were the apparent high bidder on 29 blocks, and three have been awarded to date. We have identified 20 new prospects on these blocks, 17 of which would be Apache-operated.</p>
          <p>In our Gulf Coast onshore region, production in the second quarter was 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 11% sequentially, due primarily to third-party pipeline issues at the Lake Pagie field in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana. We anticipate Lake Pagie being brought back online by mid-August, according to latest reports from the pipeline operator. During the quarter, we ran three operated rigs drilling a total of 18 wells with an 89% success rate. One well to highlight is at Chapman Ranch in Nueces County, Texas, which came on at 9 million cubic feet a day and 1,020 barrels of oil per day.</p>
          <p>Turning to Canada, the region's drilling program continues to focus on oil and liquids-rich gas plays. The second quarter coincides with the traditional spring breakup season, which impacts our drilling activity. So we saw production decline 3.8% to 123,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day, as we drilled only five wells during the period. Our drilling is ramping back up in the third quarter, targeting oil and liquids-rich gas. We plan to drill 20 Viking horizontals, and 39 wells in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (15:44) we expect to drill four additional horizontals.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the international areas, in the North Sea, production was up 36% over the prior-year quarter as we continued to assimilate the Beryl properties. We're following up on the Beryl Bravo B72 well with the B73. As you may recall, B72 tested in excess of 11,600 barrels of oil per day, 13 million cubic feet of gas. The B73 accounted 358 feet of net pay TVD in four zones, and it is planned to come onstream during the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking forward to new prospects, the Beryl 3-D seismic campaign will begin in early August and continue through until mid-October. The Bacchus field commenced production during the second quarter. This is the first subsea tieback to the Forties field. The second horizontal well, Bacchus West, penetrated Jurassic-aged, Fulmar reservoir sandstones and logged 889 feet measured depth of net pay in three Fulmar sections. Both Bacchus wells are now online and flowing at a combined gross weight of nearly 13,000 barrels of oil per day. Following completion operations at Bacchus, the rig will move to appraise the Aviat shallow gas accumulation.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Egypt, we were operating a record number of rigs, 28, in the Western Desert. During the second quarter we drilled 68 wells, including 16 exploratory wells with 13 successes. Second quarter production declined from the preceding period primarily due to planned shutdowns at our Salam gas plant, where preventive maintenance was undertaken on Trains 1 and 2, resulting in the 13 days of downtime.</p>
          <p>Among the drilling highlights were an exploration well in our West Kalabsha Concession in the Faghur Basin that tested 1,600 barrels of oil and 730 Mcf of gas per day from the Jurassic Upper Safa. In our Khalda area concessions, we drilled our first Jurassic discovery in the Alamein Basin, identifying five hydrocarbon-bearing passages in the Upper and Lower Safa. We're currently planning to test this well, but it requires high-pressure equipment, as it is the deepest well drilled to date by a Khalda <mark type="indiscernible" /> (17:44).</p>
          <p>An exploratory well, the <mark type="ph" /> Hawk 1-X, (17:52) was drilled in the WD-30 development lease of the Abu Gharadig Basin, testing nearly 3,000 barrels of oil per day. This success high-grades numerous nearby oil-prone prospects. Also in this basin, on our WD-30 development lease, <mark type="ph" /> Shadow 1-X (18:08) encountered 62 feet of gas and oil pay, testing at an initial daily rate of 1,200 barrels of day and 6.5 million cubic feet of gas per day.</p>
          <p>In the Khalda Offset concession, we conducted production tests from the first two producer wells in the <mark type="ph" /> Yunis (18:23) field during the quarter, with each producing in excess of 2,000 barrels of oil per day. This is a traditional core KPC property, and we have 12 more wells approved for the field. We are seeing a shift to more complex drilling <mark type="indiscernible" /> (18:37) particularly at Khalda. This includes record-setting drilling depths, new frac records with percs in deeper zones at high pressures, and our first horizontal well, which we plan to frac and test in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we continued to make progress on a number of commercial issues. This included the signing of five new gas sales agreements at <mark type="ph" /> Hawthorne, Yunis, Saltan, Alpha, and Chelsea, (18:58) which should allow for the debottlenecking of gas production in those concessions. And our Hydra development lease was signed, commercializing this  200-plus Bcf gas and condensate discovery. Hydra is expected to come onstream by year-end 2013, producing at an expected rate of 11,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day.</p>
          <p>In Australia, second quarter net production was 66,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 3% from the first quarter, largely due to forecasted declines in major oil producers Pyrenees and Van Gogh and seasonal reductions in gas purchases by industrial customers. Van Gogh production averaged 10,700 barrels of oil per day during the period. Up time has been excellent, and the facility produced continuously throughout the quarter. On July 5, 2012, Apache achieved a milestone when it took operatorship of the Ningaloo Vision FPSO from the previous contract operator. We purchased this FPO vessel earlier this year.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to the third quarter, production from the new Pyrenees Stickle 8H well commenced on July 14 and added an incremental 11,000 barrels of oil per day or 3,135 barrels of oil per day net to Apache, to the total field production. Gas sale volumes in Australia will be reduced in late September when the Yara Pilbara fertilizer plant shuts down for maintenance. It is expected to be offline for approximately three weeks. Yara Pilbara normally takes 75 million to 80 million cubic feet of gas per day, Apache's share being 80%.</p>
          <p>Finally, in Argentina, net production in the second quarter was 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 5% increase over Q1 2012. Our gas price realizations in Argentina continue to be supported by the Gas Plus program. Our second quarter gas realizations were $2.76 per Mcf, and in June we sold 97 million cubic feet of gas per day at an average of $4.96 per Mcf under the Gas Plus program. In Tierra del Fuego, the elimination of an existing provincial tax benefit reduced our average oil price realizations in the region by 30%, contributing to a reduction in the overall Argentina oil price realization to $72.69 per barrel.</p>
          <p>On the exploration front, seismic sequence mapping, petrophysical modeling, core descriptions, and mud log analysis have helped to high-grade recompletion candidates, identifying sweet spots within the Vaca Muerta, as we look to identify horizontal drilling locations. We plan to drill four horizontal and two vertical exploration wells and to conduct six vertical recompletions with 10 fracs in 2012. The first horizontal well will spud within a week and is expected to be completed in September. We are hoping to have more well results to disclose in the first quarter of 2013. Exploration work continues on the Huacalera and Cortadera blocks to identify additional intervals in the Vaca Muerta for testing at Huacalera x-1.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, across our portfolio, we have no shortage of opportunities, and the ramp-up of our drilling program is well under way. Our major prospects are progressing and on schedule. With results of our accelerated drilling activity beginning to take hold, we anticipate most of our 2012 growth to be in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>That concludes the operational highlights, and now I'll turn it over to Tom Chambers.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rod, and good afternoon, everyone. As you read previously in our press release and heard earlier on the call, we're rapidly building a significant inventory of drilling opportunities and have established a robust platform for long-term growth across all of our regions. We have achieved solid production level this quarter, averaging 774,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, despite some significant third-party challenges. This is the ninth consecutive quarter of production growth, and we exit the quarter with continued upward momentum.</p>
          <p>For the second quarter, we reported earnings of $337 million, or $0.86  per diluted share, and adjusted earnings of $821 million, or $2.07 per share when we adjust for certain items that affect the comparability of results, such as the noncash property write-down in Canada and foreign currency fluctuations.</p>
          <p>Our bottom line results were impacted by lower commodity prices, yet we were still able to generate revenues of almost $4 billion. This translates directly into significant cash flow from operations: $2.4 billion this quarter. Year to date, our cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital was 3% higher than the prior year-to-date period. On the quarter, our cash flow from operations was down 10% over the previous quarter, primarily driven by lower oil and gas price realizations, which were down 12% and 8% respectively.</p>
          <p>International gas prices helped mitigate the decline in earnings and cash flow, with realizations up slightly from the previous quarter and 29% higher than North American average realizations. For the past two quarters, we have realized over $4 per Mcf on our international production, a sharp contrast to the North American prices, which averaged well below $3 per Mcf over the same timeframe without the benefit of hedges. Year over year, we've produced 100 million cubic feet a day of additional international gas. In the second quarter, it represented 37% of our worldwide gas production.</p>
          <p>As economic uncertainties continue to weigh on commodity prices in the global economy, we remain optimistic given our ability to consistently generate cash from operations. Our position is supported by the strength of our portfolio, which has enabled us to benefit substantially from our oil position and the fact that oil currently sells for nearly 30 times the price of North American natural gas.</p>
          <p>Our efforts to expand our North American liquids portfolio was also evident this quarter, as we closed the Cordillera acquisition in April for approximately $2.6 billion in cash and approximately 6.3 million common shares. This significantly increased our Central region's liquids production, 60% over the first quarter, and added over 300,000 net acres to our prolific Granite Wash play and the surrounding areas. We were also able to secure a significant number of offshore blocks in the deepwater and shelf regions through the Gulf of Mexico offshore lease sale in June. This provides more growth potential in these regions, where we receive some of our highest liquids prices in North America. In fact, over 40% of our North American oil production comes from our Gulf Coast regions, where average crude price realizations currently reflect over a 20% premium to West Texas Intermediate pricing.</p>
          <p>Our focus on oil and liquids will continue given the general weakness in North American gas markets. As a result, we again had a noncash write-down of our North American and Canadian properties. Our Canadian region is the most gas levered of our portfolio, and we recognized a $480 million after-tax write-down of the property balance during the quarter. As a reminder, full-cost accounting rules require us to discount our proved reserve value at 10% using prices in effect for the past 12 months. The amount of our recorded book value over this discounted value is written off. This is a noncash event that will continue to impact us until North American gas prices no longer decline compared to the prior year.</p>
          <p>Excluding the write-down, our margins for the second quarter remain strong. At $39.72 per boe, we're still realizing robust cash margins despite the 12% decline in average price realizations. You can find a detailed calculation of our margins, adjusted earnings, and cash from operations in the financial supplement located on our website.</p>
          <p>For the second quarter, you will specifically notice an increase in our debt. Our strong balance sheet enabled us to reach into the debt market to fund significant acquisition activity. In April, we issued $3 billion of debt in three separate tranches at very attractive rates to fund the cash portion of the Cordillera acquisition and repay $400 million of higher-interest rate notes that came due in April. We finished the quarter with a debt-to-cap of 25%, cash on the balance sheet of $360 million, which is $116 million higher than the prior quarter, and available borrowing capacity of nearly $3 billion. So our -- we remain -- to have a flexible balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Turning to taxes, the second quarter effective tax rate of 56% reflects the Canadian ceiling test adjustment, as well as higher-tax foreign earnings. Absent the Canadian write-down and the impact of foreign exchange movements, our effective tax rate would have been a more typical 43%. Similarly, these adjustments impacted our percentage of deferred taxes in the quarter. However, we would expect a deferred rate of 20% to 25% for the year, absent these adjustments.</p>
          <p>As we head into the third quarter, our income taxes will be impacted by the UK government provision to decrease tax relief attributable to decommissioned expenditures on the North Sea oil and gas facilities from 62% to a maximum of 50%. The legislation was enacted in July of 2012, and as a result we'll record a deferred tax charge in the third quarter of 2012 estimated at approximately $40 million.</p>
          <p>To wrap up, we had another quarter of solid production and cash flow. Apache is not immune to the current commodity price pressures faced by the industry, but we are optimistic about the second half of 2012, given our ability to deliver strong cash margins with a rising inventory of drilling prospects. We are actively increasing our activity across a broad portfolio of opportunities and are confident our results will reflect continued growth and add value to our shareholders over the longer term.</p>
          <p>And with that I'll turn the call back over to Patrick.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I was wondering, Steve or Rod, if you could give us a little bit of a roadmap relative to the near-term production picture. The guidance is 6% to 9%. I know that's adjusted for asset sales, but the way I'm thinking about it is you produced about 748,000 barrels last year. If you back out 11,000 from asset sales and then you apply the 6% to 9% range, that would put you in the 781 to 803 kind of range in terms of a thousand barrels of day. Is that how you're thinking about 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We better hit that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And obviously, Steve, you highlighted you had quite a bit of production, 16,000 barrels had come on line. And you said most of that's come back. I don't know if you could give us a little bit of specificity around when that came back, and just so we can kind of fine-tune our third quarter and Q4 numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'll mention a couple of them, and then Rod probably give some more detail. The SemCAMS plant in Canada went on on July 6. So we should get all of that back. Now, that's -- you got all kinds of things going on in terms of -- but that plant is back on. That was about 70 million a day. It was a big hit.</p>
          <p>We should have Lake Pagie on about the middle of August. Grand Isle &#x2013; I mean <mark type="ph" /> West Can 43 (31:14) is ramping back up. In fact it should be back up right as we speak. It started ramping up about the 4th of July. And that was very unexpected downtime. Lake Pagie was totally unexpected. We had a confluence of things that hit us all in one quarter, which you usually get over the whole year.</p>
          <p>In terms of the North Sea, we're doing two things. One is we're going and replacing ESPs or pulling ESPs on Forties, but we also got &#x2013; as Rod pointed out, we just had the Bacchus well come on and also our Beryl well, hopefully, will come on, Rod, in the middle of this month?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It sounds like you got a lot, most of that coming back on track this quarter. My follow-up is, guys, obviously you talked quite a bit at the analyst meeting about the Permian and the Cline Shale and the horizontal Wolfcamp. The results look pretty positive. As you think about next year, I know it's early, but I was just wondering how you're thinking about activity in each of those plays and broadly into the Permian into 2013.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're running 36 rigs in the Permian Basin right now. And honestly, you're going to &#x2013; I mean, it's not a lack of inventory, so you're going to see that ramp up. And I think right now, I think Alfonso's plan had it at 40 rigs next year. That's probably conservative.</p>
          <p>In terms of the Anadarko Basin, we're running 26 rigs right now, and frankly that's higher than we had in our outlook for the Investor Day. So we're &#x2013; I think in the Investor Day we showed that the Permian would grow on annualized rate over a five-year period of about 13%, and the Central region, if you don't include the Cordillera, our five-year growth would be about 23% and we're very comfortable with those two numbers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just to follow up on the last question, again, on the downtime. I didn't quite hear; the 6,000 BOE that's offline on the Forties, just a ballpark idea of when that returns?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That Forties production, we have nine ESPs <mark type="ph" /> that put off the barrel &#x2013; I'm sorry, off the (33:59) Forties Bravo platform. Those are being restored in sequence, and we've fired up the platform drilling rig here in the late part of the second quarter. So we're <mark type="ph" /> siting (34:12) in the ESP replacements with new drill wells. Whichever has the highest rate of return to us gets the favored treatment. So we'll probably see those ESPs return to production throughout the rest of this year and perhaps even into the first quarter, intermixed with normal drilling activity off the same platform.</p>
          <p>I should note that the ESP run life out there is typically about 680 days, and that gives you a idea that about two years ago most of those ESPs were replaced in the last cycle, and so they all started falling about the same time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon, fellows. I'm going to try a couple as well, if I may. I guess on the first question that was asked about production, I wonder if I could just push you a little bit on that, because clearly get the target &#x2013; this dividend target this year, it looks -- at least in our numbers &#x2013; that you're going to have to have a fairly big step up in the second half. Can you give us an idea of what the portfolio is doing currently, and would you be prepared to give us a trajectory through the back end of the year? Because obviously we're &#x2013; I guess the market needs to see a little bit of a line of sight here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, with respect to direction, we've got half a year and you've got two quarters of production. I think it's pretty easy to calculate what it's going to take to get to 6% to 9%. In terms of &#x2013; I'm sorry, I didn't catch your other question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't -- I got to tell you it's higher &#x2013; I will tell you, we don't give month-to-month production. I will tell you, it is higher than what our average was &#x2013; and we went -- each month went up. So July is higher than our average for the first &#x2013; the three months of the second quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, I won't push that one too much, fellows. Just one other one for me then is Egypt. Production obviously was kind of flattish despite the decline in the oil price, while realizations were &#x2013; seemed to have dropped off relative to kind of your historical capture relative to Brent. Anything unusual going on there, and what should we expect going forward? I'll leave it at that. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Doug, this is Tom. That price adjustment, or the price that you see in Egypt, which is lower than what you typically, relates to the timings of the liftings. And it's more pronounced this quarter because of the volatility in the prices. We had a bigger drop in prices this quarter. But the key thing to note is there is no change in the underlying pricing of our oil in Egypt.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On a gross basis, we had 13 days of production downtime at the Salam gas plant. That's 200 million a day, downtime for 13 days. And the associated condensate production of that gas. That was probably the biggest impact for our overall volumes in the quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, certainly all of those blocks are exploration plays. And the good thing about the deepwater is you get the blocks for 10 years, so we're going to &#x2013; we plan on drilling four to five wells as year, and obviously they're going to be the best projects that we can find.

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, honestly it's going to be &#x2013; we're not going to have 100% of any well we drill in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater. That's a number one premise. Number two, we're going to balance  the risk against the size. So some of them will be lower risk, but they're also going to be lower size.

          <p>No, that's correct. It's still on schedule for shipyard time to do some modifications. And you're correct in your assessment about the uptime. In the transition period, we began actually operating the vessel with the contractor's ownership back in February, and subsequent to our involvement in the day-to-day operations, we experienced 95% uptime over the last six months. We're very pleased with the vessel's performance.

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it really has to do with balanced portfolio and risk and reward. Certainly anything that has liquids with it in the Gulf of Mexico, given the rate, has a leg up on anything that you drill horizontal, frankly, just because of the profile. But in terms of risk versus reward, the predictability in shales is probably 99.9%. The question is what's the rate? So we try to balance both of those. And if you look at both of those programs honestly, the Gulf of Mexico is always the highest rate of return project we can do. I mean, we just got to find good ones to do.</p>

          <p>Well, we're going to drag a rig in there here next week, and we're going to drill our first Mississippi Lime horizontal well. And we honestly, if you -- watching that play, there are in people that have very good success up there, and honestly, I don't expect anything different than that. We have a good position, and it's a question of how long it'll take us to ramp it up.</p>

          <p>Okay, so no notion of how many you'll drill this year?</p>

          <p>Okay. And then second question. In Argentina, any comments you can make on this new legislation they're talking about, the submittal of budgets to the government for approval?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't -- other than what we've read in the press. We've interpreted the preliminary decree information. We've not had meetings with the government yet. We are currently scheduled to have our first round of meetings with the government per that new decree by the end of September, in which case we'll introduce our financial investment plans for 2013.</p>
          <p>Now, in the past, we have annually produced an investment plan of similar format to the provincial governments; that's been standard procedure. This will be the first time having to do that as a requirement of the federal government. So we don't know exactly what form it's going to take. We don't have the details from them yet on specifically what they want to have us prepare or disclose at the meeting. But that's coming up, end of end of September, and they will have an answer for us within 60 days with regard to the nature of our investment plan and any comments they might have. That's our understanding of where it stands presently.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, historically, we have &#x2013; and one of our philosophies down there is to spend our cash flow. And I think in terms of Argentina, that is what they're looking for, because they have a number of companies down there, one of which has been in the news forever, and that is a &#x2013; they didn't spend anywhere near their cash flow. And I think honestly that's &#x2013; I think that's what they're looking for. Who's  not spending their Argentine cash flow in Argentina.</p>

We're continuing to work with the governments, both provincial and federal, on some final permittings that we would like to have before we make any decisions.

        <plist>
          <p>Question on the Tonkawa. You mentioned, I think, 10 wells at about a 310 MBOE, or 310 BOE IP. I think at your analysts meeting you had a number of wells you talked about and a type curve that was higher than that, and maybe it's apples and oranges, but I just wondered if you could put into context the rates you're seeing and that you talked about in the Tonkawa relative to your expectations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it was over 400 barrels a day, if I recall Rod's comments. The other one is that's a 30-day average, and that -- actually, that makes tremendous economics. And you got a lot of mix of wells in there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, from the analysts day, the type curve we showed for Tonkawa, we were expecting a typical well to come on to 350 barrels of oil per day. We've exceeded typically by like 10%. So we're very pleased with the results on a 30-day average IP basis, and we have a significant inventory of Tonkawa locations to drill right in the heart of the play.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. And then when you think about the CapEx required for some of the unconventional NGL transport options, such as the rail one that you mentioned, is that factored into your budget, or is that kind of incremental spending to get the better realizations?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, afternoon. Any update on the Liard Basin? I know you talked about it at the analyst day, but is that well still holding up? I mean, I think that was a well from last year, but is that well still holding up? And if so, what's the go-forward plan up there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, that well is still holding up. We're drilling an additional well as we speak. And we're going to drill enough wells, 10-year wells in order to hold all our acreage -- or the vast majority of our acreage.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so we should expect one rig running up there over the next year or so, six to 12 months? Is that the right way to think about it?</p>

          <p>I'm just &#x2013; obviously, gas prices impacted impairment charges. I'm just trying to figure out what the impact of NGLs was as far as --</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so nothing &#x2013; okay. Do you have a cushion left in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously some cushion, but how much cushion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have -- 30% of our production in the Central region is oil, so &#x2013; and the majority of that is black oil, so we're in pretty good shape there. I mean, you should never say never, but depends upon what happens to oil price there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, all right. And then a final question. I know you said gas prices have to be higher. Let me ask the question a different way. Whatever number you have in the back of your head for gas prices, how long would it have to get to that level and stay there? Are you looking at a 12-month strip, 24-month strip before you make that decision? I'm trying to get the thought process as to when people start looking back toward gas. Does it have to sit there for three months or six months, or can you talk a little bit about how you think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, number one, I think gas in this country -- most gas wells are going to be challenged. And the reason is if you see prices increase, there are so many locations that people can drill gas wells that what you're going to see is an influx of rigs and people drilling gas wells, and you're going to run into the same problem. There are some things we could do right now to turn gas price, but we've got a limited amount of capital, and as Tom Chambers pointed out, the price differential is about 30 to 1. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out to drill an oil well if you've got the opportunity. So it's -- that as much as the what the actual gas price ought to be is really driving what everybody's doing. I mean, it's economics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, thanks for taking my question. Going back to the Mississippian and the Williston plays, I heard &#x2013; I got your point that you've got one rig running in each of those and you think we'll have four to six wells this year. Is there a timeline you have in mind on when you will share your results in those plays? Is there like a certain number of wells you think you have to get down before you can come to a conclusion you want to share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we've got to be satisfied with what the conclusion we reach on both of those. I would expect us to make some results known by the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thank you. And what would a rig count ramp look like that those plays in the success case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, then it's going to have to compete with what we've got in the Central region and the Permian region. Certainly with our acreage position, we own a significant interest, 100% most of the Bakken stuff, and large interest in the stuff that we have in the Mississippi Lime. So it gives us a real opportunity to ramp that up if it works. And certainly the Mississippi Lime is going to work. It's going to have to compete with capital in terms of rates of return with some of the other things we're doing. But the Mississippi Lime is -- we're going to drill good wells. It's going to be whether or not &#x2013; what the economics are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thank you. And then one other kind of obvious question. Is there anything to add on the political situation in Egypt? I mean, it seems that it's been relatively news-free, at least by those standards. And so that seems welcome. But I wonder if you could add your impressions there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. As Rod pointed out, we haven't &#x2013; we have continued to deal with the Minister of Petroleum and continued to deal with the Chairman of EGPC. I think Rod mentioned we have seven new gas contracts that we've just signed. If anything, frankly, what we're seeing is that their need for hydrocarbons is such that it may have gotten a little bit better than it being the status quo, just because of the urgency nature of bringing production on.</p>

          <p>There was a significant political developments for them. They announced a new prime minister. And he has subsequently appointed new cabinet as of yesterday, and I believe they took the oaths of office today. So we do have a new Petroleum Minister as of today, Osama Kamal, out of the petrochemical sector. So there may be some other changes associated with those ministerial changes.</p>
