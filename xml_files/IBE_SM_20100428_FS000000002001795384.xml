        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. We're going to begin the presentation of results for the first quarter of 2010. The meeting will last approximately an hour and a half. In other words, we will have finished by 11. So the Chairman of IBERDROLA, Mr. S&#xE1;nchez Gal&#xE1;n, has the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking you for attending the meeting, both of you that are here and those that are connected via phone or the website. We will have the usual structure. First of all, I'll comment on the main aspects of the results for the first quarter of 2010. Then Jos&#xE9; S&#xE1;inz Armada will analyze those results and the financial position, and I will end with some brief conclusions before moving on to the questions.</p>
          <p>In these first 3 months of the year, IBERDROLA has obtained a gross operating profit of &#x20AC;2,178 million with a growth of 11.6% and a net profit of &#x20AC;922 million. This is an increase of 16.2%. These results come from the investments made in recent years which have made IBERDROLA a diversified group, a leader in generation with clean energy and a world reference in efficiency. And this since our business portfolio and geography enables us to stay on the path of sustainable growth and focus on the various areas, depending on the circumstances.</p>
          <p>The regulated and renewable activities have benefited from an increase of 15% in Group production as a result of the hydroelectric and wind power technologies. And this once again shows the wise decision of putting our stakes on emission-free technologies. As I announced at the recent presentation of the financial forecast for 2010-2012, efficiency is going to continue to be the sign of identity for the Group. The effects of the measures implemented can already be seen in the first quarter where all Group businesses have shown improvements.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Group balance sheet structure, it is very clear that IBERDROLA is committed to a solid financial position. Leverage is 45.6% with an improvement of close to 7 percentage points since March 2009 and the main financial ratios have also been significantly strengthened. Thanks to this, the Standard &amp; Poor's rating has recently reaffirmed an A rating for IBERDROLA.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to highlight the approval of the Royal Decree on the securitization of the tariff deficit. This represents a significant move forward in the collection of the amounts due to the companies. So IBERDROLA starts the 3 year period 2010-2012 with results that based on the strategic basis announced some months ago have already exceeded the forecast growth rate for the period.</p>
          <p>Group production in the first 3 months of 2010 amounted to 42,000 gigawatt hours with a growth of 15.4% compared to the same period last year. This has been possible thanks to the increase in 100% emission-free generation, the contribution of which has increased by more than 10 points up to 50% of the total, driven, as I said, by the hydraulic and wind power technologies. If we add gas combined cycle generation, the most efficient technology in thermal generation, over 90% of the Group's total production comes from sources that respect the environment.</p>
          <p>Regarding production in Spain, it has benefited from the growth in demand, close to 5% in the quarter, as well as from the increase in hydraulic and wind power production. All this has enabled us to obtain an increase of 28% in energy produced, up to 21,700 gigawatt hours. Also, and as we have been reporting over the last quarters, the full liberalization of the market has opened new opportunities in the generation market. In this sense, over 90% of the energy produced by IBERDROLA between January and March has been sold on markets that are different to the daily market, mainly term markets or end customer markets. This reduces price volatility.</p>
          <p>The high hydro levels in the quarter has meant we have sold a larger amount of hydroelectric energy to the pool, slightly over 2 terawatt hours. With this major increase in hydraulic production which has multiplied by 2.5, our reserves are currently at over 80% of the capacity, with a 9,000 gigawatt hours. This represents an increase of 45% over the figures recorded in March 2009.</p>
          <p>Regarding cost developments, in the first quarter of the year, the Group has achieved an increase of 8% in operating efficiency. The increase of 9.2% in gross margin has been obtained with a very moderate development in net operating costs which have grown less than 1 percentage point. Personnel costs have significantly contributed to this with a drop of 0.5% in gross terms and they're on the same level in net terms. The increase in activity together with efficiency improvements means that the Group's gross operating profits have grown by 11.6% to &#x20AC;2,178 million.</p>
          <p>The breakdown by business areas is very similar to our objective for 2012, with the exception of the contribution of the renewable business, which obviously will increase in the coming years with the planned investments. The contribution of the energy business in Spain is 33% and has behaved solidly in the quarter. Scottish Power contributes 24%, RENOVABLES 20% and businesses in Latin America and IBERDROLA USA each contribute approximately 10%. By activities, these results show the benefits of the diversified business low-risk model at IBERDROLA.</p>
          <p>In the last 2 years, the Group has obtained similar EBITDA growth, so close to 10%. But the businesses that have driven this growth have alternated, showing that the combination of IBERDROLA's activities makes it possible to grow in very different environments.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of 2010, we can highlight the positive performance of IBERDROLA RENOVABLES, with a growth of 30% in EBITDA and especially in liberalized businesses in Spain. In regulated businesses, the growth registered by Brazil and the UK has offset the drop in business in the U.S., mainly affected by the exchange rate.</p>
          <p>Regarding the most outstanding events in the various businesses starting with the regulated businesses in Spain, we must first highlight the approval of the Royal Decree to develop the securitization of the tariff deficit. As announced recently on Investors' Day, this norm concludes the regulatory process for securitization and now it only needs to be registered at the CNMV. On the other hand, I would like to highlight the efficiency measures implemented in the regulated business in Spain, the personnel cost of which has dropped by 7%.</p>
          <p>Regarding activities regulated in the UK, on April 1, the new remuneration for distribution for the next 5 years came into operation. Scottish Power is already implementing different saving initiatives which according to our estimates will make it possible to obtain profitability over assets of more than 100 base points over the regulatory profitability.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., the negotiation for the new remuneration of activities for electricity and gas in New York continue and the expectation is that the new tariffs will come into effect at the end of the summer. On the other hand, the company is already working on the implementation on operational improvements. And a number of plans have recently been announced to adapt the workforce, which has already allowed a reduction of 6% to be carried out in comparison to the figures 12 months ago.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to highlight the good performance of regulated businesses in Latin America, particularly in Brazil, where demand is growing at levels close to 9% in our business areas, with the consequential effect on results. Brazil will continue to be a strategic country for IBERDROLA, not only in the distribution area, but also in the area of generation. And as you all know, we have an important portfolio of hydraulic projects.</p>
          <p>Regarding liberalized activities, we can highlight the very good performance of the business in Spain as a result of the flexibility of the generation portfolio as well of the use of the opportunities offered by liberalization. In this sense, we have sold over 62 terawatt hours on the Spanish market, a figure that represents more than 90% of our budgeted production at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we are carrying out a number of measures to manage our long-term gas contract portfolio in order to ensure supplies with the lowest risk for the Group. We have already placed all the gas for the year 2010 and we have recently signed a contract to supply 1 bcm of gas per year during a period that could be as much as 15 years, starting in 2011.</p>
          <p>Regarding the United Kingdom, the consortium led by Scottish Power recently became one of the two finalists in the contest to build a plant for the capture and sequestration of CO2. During the next months we'll carry out an engineering study financed partially by the British government to specify the technical and economic conditions for this project. I would also like to highlight that the main parties of the British election, show in their programs a clearer support for this technology through measures such as establishing a tax to finance up to 4 projects.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, Scottish Power recently announced a drop of 8% in gas prices as of April 1. This initiative together with others will enable us to preserve a competitive position in the commercial business in the United Kingdom. So far this year, Scottish Power has been capable of maintaining its number of customers with a variation of less than 0.4%.</p>
          <p>Regarding IBERDROLA RENOVABLES, the company recorded in the quarter an increase of around 25% both in operating power and in energy produced. The company continues to show its capacity to bring together its expansion process with a significant cost reduction, which has obtained a gain in efficiency of 6%. And at the same time RENOVABLES will continue to work in the future both in the short, medium and long-term.</p>
          <p>In the recent months, we have signed energy sales contracts in the U.S. Thanks to this we have increased the proportion of energy subject to a fixed price and covers 93% of our total production. With our sights on the next few years, the company has also started up its ocean wind power division with headquarters in Glasgow to ensure an advance in the various projects in the UK and the rest of Europe.</p>
          <p>And now I would like to briefly cover the regulatory situation for the renewable energy sector in Spain. As many of you know, and as you heard yesterday, as a result of the presentation of the results for RENOVABLES, in recent years there has been a very different development for the various renewable technologies in Spain. In 2009, installed wind power in Spain was 90% of the objective set for 2010, about 20,000 megawatts. While in the case of photovoltaic power, installed power was more than 3,400 megawatts. That is seven times more than the objective set for 2010.</p>
          <p>This situation is a result of the existing remuneration for each technology. Wind power in Spain has a tariff of around &#x20AC;77 per megawatt hour, which is much lower than that in the rest of European countries, whose average remuneration is around &#x20AC;102 per megawatt. However, in the case of photovoltaic energy, our country which has high load factors, much higher than in Germany, for example, has a tariff of &#x20AC;466 per megawatt hour for around 3,500 megawatts, according to Decree 661, much higher than countries in our area. As a result, there's a major difference between the contribution of energy and the contribution to production costs of the various technologies.</p>
          <p>In 2009, wind power produced 14% of the total energy generated in Spain, representing 16% of the total production cost, while solar energies contributed only 2% of the energy and also cost 16% of the cost of supply. On the other hand, cogeneration, biomass and other technologies produced 12%, representing a cost of 18%. The special regime, that is all the technologies under some kind of premium, produced 28% of the energy and represented 50% of the total cost.</p>
          <p>With the rate of the new renewable power estimated in the pre-register, this situation will become more intense in the future and will have a major impact on the sustainability of the system. In 2013, it is expected that wind power will produce 19% of the energy, representing 18% of the cost, while photovoltaic energy will only provide 3% of the energy and will represent 15% of the cost. On the other hand, and this is very important, the major thermosolar expansion anticipated in coming years will mean that this technology will represent 8% of the production costs and will only contribute 1.8% of the energy to the system. The rest of the technologies, cogeneration, biomass and other technologies, will represent around 13% of the production and also 13% of the cost.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, it can be said that while the development of wind energy has been sustainable, and according to the objective set in the Renewable Energy Plan 2005-2010, solar technologies have grown exponentially in recent years and have exceeded the objectives. In this way, the greater use of less mature renewables, that is that have a great potential for improvement in the future, have significantly increased the cost of the electrical supply since the investment costs are much higher.</p>
          <p>The annual economic impact &#x2013; and these figures are important &#x2013; for each 1,000 megawatts of these technologies, thermosolar energy increases &#x20AC;900 million. Photovoltaic increases the cost by 600 million and wind power represents an increase of only &#x20AC;70 million. These are the premiums for these technologies with the current remuneration. If we do not want to substantially increase the price of electricity, it is necessary to defer the growth of thermosolar and photovoltaic energy, which contribute little energy and represent a very high cost.</p>
          <p>Moving on to analyze the balance sheet, the situation of the company in March reflects the measures implemented during recent quarters in order to control investments and optimize the debt structure. Leverage is 45.6%, almost 7 points below about 12 months ago. And the main financial ratios have experienced a significant improvement and are comfortably in levels that correspond to a type A credit rating. As a result of all this, Standard &amp; Poor's have recently reaffirmed, as I said earlier, the A rating for IBERDROLA debt at this time.</p>
          <p>The solid operational development of the company and the improvement in its financial position has represented an increase of 16.2% in net profits, &#x20AC;922 million, and 17.1% in operating cash flow, which has come close to &#x20AC;1,500 million in just 3 months.</p>
          <p>And now I'll hand the floor over to Jos&#xE9; S&#xE1;inz Armada, so that he can give us more details on all the results.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, President. Good morning, and now what I would like to do is review the most relevant aspects of the accounts of the first quarter and the operating evolution by businesses. And I would like to finish with an analysis of the funding situation of the Group.</p>
          <p>The company initiated the year, as the President pointed out, with strong growth in the main lines of the results account, which shows the strength of our diversified business model in different environments. So the gross margin has grown 9.2%, EBITDA 11.8%, and recurrent net profits have grown 10.6%. So the impact by the rate of exchange is very low in the consolidated statement of this quarter, about 5 million, because the devaluation of the dollar has been compensated by the appreciation of the pound and the real in Brazil.</p>
          <p>The gross margin has grown 9.2% and now stands at &#x20AC;3,224 million, thanks mainly to the growth of the national energy business which has grown 14%, renewables 28%, and because Brazil has behaved very well, with growth of 44%. The basic margin that registers the net effect of the emission rights in the accounts has grown 8.4%, which is somewhat less than the gross margin, and now stands at &#x20AC;3,292 million because of the lower price and consumption of CO2 in 2010 versus 2009.</p>
          <p>The sales figure grows 0.6% up to &#x20AC;7,687 million with higher volumes in Spain compensated by lower price in the ordinary regime and by lower remuneration and distribution, and by strong growth in renewables and Latin America. As far as the procurement of the Group is concerned, they have dropped 3.8% and now stand at &#x20AC;4,363 million, especially on renewables, Scottish Power, IBERDROLA USA and <mark type="inaudible" /> that compensate the growths of the other businesses.</p>
          <p>Net operating expenses have grown only 0.7% and now stand at &#x20AC;893 million as a consequence of the efficiency plan that is being carried out by the Group, as the President pointed out. And the net personnel expenses are stable at about &#x20AC;430 million and the net external services have only grown 1.2% and now stand at &#x20AC;463 million. As regards the levies, there has been an increase of 11% up to &#x20AC;221 million. And this also includes the inclusion of the payment of the ENRESA rates and the social bond and other rates in the United States. And this compensates the claw back of CO2 compared to the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>So as a consequence of this, the EBITDA of the Group has grown 11.6% and has reached &#x20AC;2,178 million, so therefore, shows how strong the business model is. And the different operating environments of 2010 means that in this quarter the businesses are boosting the operating growth of the Group are the deregulated business that has grown 17%, renewables, that's grown 30%, whereas the regulated business has grown 2%.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to give you some details regarding the evolution of EBITDA in each of the Group's businesses but starting off with the deregulated business in Spain that includes generation, commercial and non-regulated gas. IBERDROLA has increased its ordinary regime output by 27% and it's improved its evolution in the system. That has dropped 3%. And this positive trend can be explained by the growth in demand in Spain, that is 4.7% more, and because there's been a sharp increase in the hydraulic production of IBERDROLA, 158% more than last year.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, our nuclear output has grown 5.4% whereas the thermal technologies have dropped from 30% in the case of combined cycles and coal plus fuel 64%. So that means that the production, the percentage of production, at a zero variable cost has gone from 67% in the first quarter in 2009 to 83% in the first quarter of 2010. We've achieved an average sale price of &#x20AC;55.6 per megawatt hour with an output that is much higher than what we expected.</p>
          <p>The average unit cost of fuel at IBERDROLA has only been &#x20AC;10 per megawatt hour and this average fuel cost cannot be replicated by our competitors because of our competitive low-cost production mix. It has to be pointed out that we are selling &#x2013; we sold 62 terawatts hour in 2010 at a price above &#x20AC;50 per megawatt hour, which represents more than 90% of the output that was estimated for this year.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA of the deregulated business in Spain has grown 41% and now stands at &#x20AC;492 million because there's been an improvement in the basic margin. That's grown 29% and now reaches &#x20AC;765 million, which is due, as I said before, to the greater volumes and to the greater percentage of technologies that are low-cost in the mix. And this growth to the basic margin is clearly higher than that of operating costs that have grown 8%, in spite of the increase of the commercial activities and because the last resorted tariff has been transferred to the deregulated business. Taxes have gone up 20% and now stand at &#x20AC;93 million because the reduction of CO2 compensates this item in relation to the social bond and the ENRESA rate.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA of the regulated business in Spain has grown 1.7% and now stands at &#x20AC; 254 million. This has managed to counteract the 7.5% slump that was recorded at the level of the gross margin, thanks to an 18% reduction in the net operating expenses because the area is improving its efficiency, and we are transferring costs to the deregulated business. And this 7.5% reduction in the gross business margin is a consequence of the temporary reduction in the remuneration of the business, are subsequent to the new ministerial order of December the 31. And this reduction has been 6.5% vis-&#xE0;-vis Q1 of 2009 and 2.8% if we were to compare it with the average figure of 2009 after the adjustment of &#x20AC;61 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. So we're talking about temporary remunerations but we have to wait for the definitive remuneration that is based on the reference model.</p>
          <p>EBITDA grew 30% and now stands at &#x20AC;441 million. That is the RENOVABLES EBITDA, thanks to the strong increase in production which was 26%, which has to do with the greater operating capacity. That's grown 22.1% and we now have a figure of 10,789 megawatts installed. And we also have had a slight increase in prices and the average price is &#x20AC;73.53 per megawatt hour because of the hedging agreement in Spain as well as because of the PPA signed in the United States. And then the gross margin of the gas business has grown 45% and nearly provides &#x20AC;60 million to the accounts.</p>
          <p>Net operating expenses have grown less than the gross margin, 18.6%, which is less than the increase in operating capability. And as the President had pointed out, the OpEx per operating megawatt has improved by 6%.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA of Scottish Power in local currency dropped 2.7% and now stands at &#xA3;465 million after 2.1 slump that has affected the base figure gross margin. Whilst net operating expenses still continue with the containment after being reduced at 0.5% in euros, the EBITDA have reduced its drop to 0.5% and now stands at &#x20AC;527 million after having positive impact because of the rate of exchange, 10 million.</p>
          <p>And as regards wholesale and retail, they are drops that have been partially compensated by a much better development in networks. Wholesale and retail provide &#x20AC;324 million for the EBITDA with a net 7% drop, basically due to the retail business where there are less volumes, that is, minus 1.7%, and less unit margins, about 4%, because of the reduction in prices in 2009.</p>
          <p>Networks has contributed &#x20AC;184 million and that means that it's an 8.5% growth. And this has to do with the 7.3 growth of the gross margin where there has been more revenue linked to the new investments made both in transmission and distribution with a very important part for the connection of new renewables. And these effects are partially compensated by lower volume of distributed power, which is under 1%.</p>
          <p>The outcomes of IBERDROLA USA in dollars in U.S. GAAP are the following. EBITDA has dropped 3.1% and now stands at $279 million. However, the gross margin shows a growth rate of 0.7%, thanks to the increase in prices, especially in the gas business that compensates the slight decline in demand in this business that was 0.8%, as well as a lower contribution of the electrical business after the slump in demand, which was about 2%. There has been an improvement in net operating expenses, 3%, after a 6% reduction in the personnel figure.</p>
          <p>Then improvements in the net operating expenses will be higher in the next quarters. The increase in levies, which is 28%, that was applied in April 2009, explains the progression of the EBITDA in dollars and in U.S. GAAP.</p>
          <p>As regards the results of the business in euros and under IFRS, IBERDROLA has made a contribution of &#x20AC;202 million for the EBITDA which is an 11.3 slump, which can be explained fundamentally by the effect produced by the devaluation of the dollar, which is about 7%, which is nearly $15 million, and the increase in levies of 12%. And in this quarter, the adjustments because of the application of the U.S. GAAP to IFRS have been minimal.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA of Latin America has a strong growth rate, up to 20% up to &#x20AC;226 million and has maintained a progression that has been seen in terms of the gross margin because there has been an improvement in the Brazil results.</p>
          <p>Brazil and Mexico have a completely different kind of behavior. Brazil contributes &#x20AC;135 million to the EBITDA. That means that it's a 47% growth including &#x20AC;22 million that have to do with the revaluation of the real. In local currency, the business has grown 18%, thanks to the increase in demand, that was 8.5%, as well as to an improvement of the margins in our distributors in the region that have registered the positive effect of the adjustments made represents inflation.</p>
          <p>Mexico contributes 91 million to EBITDA, which is a 5% drop. The effects caused by the rate of exchange, which is 7.3%, has subtracted &#x20AC;7 million. So that means that the behavior of EBITDA in local currency presents a positive trend, 2.1%, linked to an improvement in margins and linked to the availability of power stations. And EBITDA of non-energy products and engineering has 16% slump, totaling &#x20AC;56 million. Engineering or ingenier&#xED;a is the main contributor as regards the gross margin with 48% of the total. And there's been 10% reduction in net operating expenses which tries to soften the drop in gross margin.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA of the Group grew 7.8% and now stands at &#x20AC;1,536 million, which is somewhat below the growth we've registered at the level of EBITDA after a 22% increase in the chapter on amortizations and provisions, with a total of 642 million. Amortizations are 604 million after growing 90 million due to the increase in renewables with higher installed power, and in Scottish Power with the appreciation of the pound and more assets under exploitation in the networks area. But environmental investments in Spain have increased this item in the Spanish liberalized or the regulated business. Provisions have been increased 25 million and now stand at 38 in a quarter that was unfavorable compared to 2009, in which there was some reversals.</p>
          <p>So the net financial result shows an 8.8 reduction and it now stands at &#x20AC;297 million. Net expenses in relation to interest related to the debt have dropped 13% and now stand at &#x20AC;325 million as a result of the decline in the average costs which is now 4.2 instead of 4.9, in spite of a slight increase in the average balance of the net debt and the lower rate of remuneration of deficit and certain hedging actions because of the revaluation of the dollar and the real have had a slight negative impact in terms of financial expenses. However, the total net financial result has achieved, as I said before, a reduction of 8.8%.</p>
          <p>Profit before taxes has grown 14.5% and now reaches &#x20AC;1,310 million at a rate that is somewhat higher than that of the EBITDA based on an 11.6% increase registered in recurrent profits. And the credit control of financial expenses and the increase of 36 million in the results of non-working assets, which includes divestiture on behalf of EDP more than compensate the reductions that have occurred.</p>
          <p>And the improvement in operating results have increased the Group's operating cash flow 17.1%, which nearly has reached &#x20AC;1.5 million in the quarter. And the net profit has grown 16.2% and now stand at &#x20AC;922 million. And the tax rate is 26.5% in the first quarter which is somewhat lower than what we had last year with 28%.</p>
          <p>I would like to start off with the presentation that has to do with the financial chapter with an updating of the tariff deficit that the President pointed out. And on April the 21 of 2010 Royal Decree 437/2010 was published that develops the regulation of the securitization process of the deficit of electrical system. And the Royal Decree confirms the key issues that were represented at the Investors' Day.</p>
          <p>The tariff deficit that's on the balance sheet of the company will be transferred to the fund at its nominal value. And the Royal Decree says that the maximum figures recognized will be up to 10 billion including past deficits until 2008 and 3.5 billion for 2009. For 2010 and 2012 each year, this will be determined without being able to exceed the maximum figure established in Royal Decree 6/2009.</p>
          <p>And the figures established are 3 billion for 2010, 2 billion for 2011 and 1 billion for 2012, and the tariff deficit will disappear as from that moment onwards. And the tariff deficits generated between 2010 and 2012 will be recognized ex-ante and can be awarded to the securitization fund of the system. And the fund has 12 months to purchase rights from the moment that the electrical utilities wish to surrender them.</p>
          <p>So subsequent to the Royal Decree, the regulatory process, as the President has pointed out, has finished. And now it is at the Securities and Exchange Commission where this has to be duly registered, and apparently this has advanced.</p>
          <p>And on March 2010, the tariff deficit has increased &#x20AC;166 million relative to the figure we had on the balance sheet on the closing date of 2009, and now stands at &#x20AC;3,784 million. And this increase of 166 million is the net result of an increase in the deficit of 218 million in the quarter and a collection of 52 million from the tariff. And the funds at the end of the first quarter of 2010 account for &#x20AC;30,184 million, that is, &#x20AC;4 billion more than one year ago, whereas net debt without considering the tariff deficit stands at &#x20AC;25,310 million, which is more than 3 billion less than in the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>And all of this means that we've achieved a substantial improvement in the leverage that has gone down from 52.5% one year ago to &#x2013; it's nearly 700 basis points less. But if we include the tariff deficit, we're talking about a debt of &#x20AC;29,094 million, that is, &#x20AC;2.1 billion less in debt compared to last year, and leverage would be increased to 49.1%.</p>
          <p>The strict control of debt and the growth achieved as regards the generation of operating cash flow has allowed the company to show that all the financial ratios on the closing date of Q1 have grown a lot vis-&#xE0;-vis the ratios of the same period of the previous year. With the exclusion of the tariff deficit, the FFO relative to the net debt stands at 20.5% versus 16% last year. The FFO relative to interest, it's 5 times instead of 4.4 times. And the return cash flow relative to the net debt stands at 14%, which is nearly 3.4% above the figure of 11.6 reported for last year. The improvements in the financial ratios shown in this quarter will be consolidated throughout the year, which will allow us to achieve the objectives that have been set for 2010.</p>
          <p>As regards the breakdown of debt, based on funding sources, we still maintain a suitable diversification. We have increased the weight of the debt financed in capital markets which now stands at 72%, 64% in bonds and 8% in IOUs.</p>
          <p>And as regards the structure of the debt by currencies, we have to say that the coverage policy or the hedging policy tries to reduce the risk in terms of rates of exchange. At the same time, it also tries to adjust the percentage of debt per currency to minimize the volatility of the leverage and of the solvency ratios. And in this regard, the debt in euros accounts for 50% of the total whereas the debt in pounds and dollars stands at 26 and 21% respectively.</p>
          <p>As regards the structure of the debt by interest rate, we maintain a very cautious structure, with 40% of the debt with a variable rate and 52% with a fixed rate. And we also have a wonderful liquidity position, because right now we have nearly &#x20AC;7.8 billion in liquidity and available credit lines and special &#x2013; 4,900 are as from 2012. And we have to point out that we are covering the needs for more than 15 months of operation of the Group without having to resort to the market. And the maturity time schedule, and for loans as you can see here, offers comfortable system which is also stable. The average life of the debt is 6 years, which is in line with the objectives set by the margin.</p>
          <p>I would like to close this presentation by showing you the tentative time schedule of the upcoming scrip dividend, the new remuneration system that was approved by the General Shareholder Assembly that will allow people to receive shares released by the company or to pay for them. And on May the 14, we'll send to the Securities and Exchange Commission information on the scrip dividend and on the enlargement of capital released. And this slide shows the temporary time schedule. And as you can see, the date of payment for those shareholders that decide to sell their shares to IBERDROLA will be July 1 and on July the 2 these new shares will be listed on the stock exchange.</p>
          <p>And now, the President will close this presentation of results.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Pepe. I think that results we are presenting show the capacity of the IBERDROLA business portfolio to obtain growth in any macroeconomic and business scenario. The investments made in recent years have enabled us to increase our presence in markets such as the U.S. or British market, maintaining our stakes in Mexico and Brazil and reducing the weight of the traditional business in Spain, which currently represents only one-third of the Group's gross operating profits. The contribution to the results of the regulated and renewable businesses stays around 60%, therefore, providing a high predictability to the accounts.</p>
          <p>This solid position has enabled us to obtain in this first quarter of 2010 an increase in results of 11.6% on an operating level and 16% on a level of net profits. In the first 3 months of the year, the Group also increased its production by 15.4%, thanks to the contribution of technologies with a reduced variable cost and emission-free, such as hydraulic and wind power technologies.</p>
          <p>All the countries in which IBERDROLA is present have contributed to this increase with the exception of the UK, which has been affected by a more timid development in demand and the shutdown of the coal power station at Longannet, which is again operational. The increase of 28% in production in Spain is linked to the good status of the wind power business in the U.S. country where generated energy has increased by 23%, and activities in Latin America where energy production has increased by 7%. In other countries, renewables has increased its production by over 40%.</p>
          <p>One of the signs of identity of the Group is the constant search for improvements in efficiency. And one of the results we can present today are clearly the first effects of the saving measures implemented in the various businesses. Cost containment, which has enabled costs to grow less than 1% in homogeneous terms, have enabled an overall efficiency improvement of 8%.</p>
          <p>But I want to highlight the following aspects. In Spain, the Group is carrying out the transition to a fully liberalized market efficiency, which has provoked an increase in costs of less than 2%. In the UK, Scottish Power has cut down costs by an additional 1% in pounds. In the U.S., the workforce has been optimized with a 6% reduction. And IBERDROLA RENOVABLES, the costs per installed megawatt, have fallen by 6%, showing once again the capability of the company to carry out its expansion process in an efficient manner.</p>
          <p>The third key point in the results we've presented today is that the improvement of our situation. Over the last 12 months, the balance sheet of the company has been strengthened very significantly as the CFO has said, with an increase of over 4 billion in equity and a drop of 3 billion in debt. Thanks to this, leverage is 45.6% with an improvement of close to 7 points, which is significant related to last year. The financial ratios of the Group have also experienced a major strengthening with the support of cash flow generation which has increased by 17% in the period, and therefore, Standard &amp; Poor's has recently reaffirmed our A rating.</p>
          <p>Regarding prospects of the Group for the rest of the year, I would like to reaffirm the plans announced 2 months ago, when the results for 2009 were presented. We expect the regulated businesses to show a neutral to positive trend both in Spain and Latin America, and to improve in the UK and United States as a result of the regulatory revisions. IBERDROLA RENOVABLES will maintain the path of growth, thanks to the increase in capacity and price stabilization, mainly thanks to tariffs or PPAs.</p>
          <p>In liberalized businesses, we continue to expect a positive development in Spain, thanks on the one hand to the recovery in demand and the historic level of hydraulic reserves, 9,000 gigawatt hours, 45% more than last year. In the UK, the situation will be more complex, particularly because of the pressures on generation margins and retail prices. As I said, we will maintain our focus on operating efficiency in all businesses, and especially in the United States where the measures launched from the beginning of the year are already being fruitful. The financial position of the Group will continue to improve, thanks to the securitization of the tariff deficit and investment controls, which will be in line with the cash flow we generate.</p>
          <p>All this means that we maintain our expectations for the year, where we expect a positive evolution both in operating results as well as in recurrent net profit. Once again, you can be sure that all the men and women that work for the Group will continue to work with every effort to maximize these results and so benefit all our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much, and we will now take your questions.</p>

          <p>Questions from the room, Raimundo [Nomura], please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Questions for the President and his team, we have 3 questions. The first has to do with the new remuneration action. I think that it's going to be supplemented by the actions taken in 2009 and the board it seems will be approving this for the 2010 accounts. But what I would like to know is if this initiative is successful do you think that this could be a usual practice in the future or what would make you go in favor of maintaining this new mechanism as long as the tax incentives don't change, of course?</p>
          <p>And secondly, the future commercialization and contracting, so when will you start to cover 2011? And what do you think is going to happen in terms of prices, although yesterday you did answer this question? And partially we talked about 40 something euros. This is increasing a bit. But would it be better to postpone this as much as we possibly can this year?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, domestic coal. It seems that the Ministry is getting new version ready where they've eliminated the annex that referred to those power stations that are going to be displaced. So they are going to be set aside due to technical restrictions if you can put it that way, restrictions that apply to domestic coal. So I would like to know why is it that nobody is complaining about that? There seems to be no noise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as regards the scrip dividend, yes, of course, and the payment of the dividend in the month of July as was pointed out by the CFO, we do expect to be using the General Shareholders Assembly resolution. And also if the tax situation remains unchanged we also think that this is an issue that could also be applied for the dividend to be paid out in December. So we'll have the supplementary one in July and in December we'll do so too if the tax conditions are maintained, December or January. And next year, we'll see if this continues or not and we might be able to extend this very format. As regards the contracts for 2011, Paco, could you say something about that please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in relation to yes, contracts for 2011 right now we have a level of commitment of just under 24 terawatts per hour and the average price levels that this has been contracted as we are talking about 55. So what does that mean? That means that firstly, it means that as was pointed out by Raimundo, it means the prices are going up and I would say that this is very outstanding because in the last month and a half there has been a nearly &#x20AC;8 increase. And what remains for the balance for 2010 nearly &#x20AC;5 in increase in the 2011 calendar. So that's nearly &#x20AC;1 a week.</p>
          <p>And prices are increasing and this can also be seen by what we've already contracted. So we want to have a level of contracting that is balanced according to our generation capability. We do not want to be too far fetched as some competitors say we're doing. And according to that strategy, what we will do is immediately adapt as we've already done in the past. We'll adapt the price of what we're offering to wholesale prices and this is what is producing this increase. Would you like to answer the coal question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes. The Royal Decree that was passed by the Council of Ministers, as regards restrictions, what that meant basically is that a minimum consumption level was to be guaranteed. And I think in the first year it was 22 terawatts. We're talking about 22 terawatts. Of those power stations that were not linked to the market, well, they had to substitute imported coal-fired power stations. And those power stations substituted according to the Royal Decree, would be remunerated according to a loss of profit, which is the market price at which they've already offered and their variable costs.</p>
          <p>Well, that seems that they didn't like that in Brussels at all, the loss of profit concept. And it seems that they've changed that. They've modified the Royal Decree and they've got rid of that clause on loss of profit and some other things. And we're now waiting to see how this remuneration is going to be replaced by something else, which I suppose will be a capacity payment or something along those lines. But we still do not have a clear cut idea of what the government is going to be doing about it. And as a matter of fact the Decree, as we understand things, well, it's like the one we had before but without the remuneration for loss of profit. So in the case of the power stations that are going to be substituted it doesn't leave them in a very comfortable situation, I must say.</p>

          <p>Virginia?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Virginia Sanz from Deutsche Bank. I had several questions. Firstly, I wanted to know, since you mentioned elections in the UK and it seems that it's not at all clear what's going to happen, is there any scenario that would be more favorable for the offshore investments that you plan or would other scenarios be more unfavorable? I would also like to know, we've been investing for almost a year and a half in Energy East, and I think that this is where we are finding negative surprises in results. So are you really very pleased with your acquisition there?</p>
          <p>And then I wanted to know the cost of debt, 4.2% that you expect for the end of the year. Yesterday at IBERDROLA RENOVABLES you said that it was especially low, but that it would go up during the year and I would like to know whether that's also the case for IBERDROLA?</p>
          <p>And finally regarding the securitization of the deficit, I would like to know how you see the success of the securitization in our current environment with Greece? And I know that this is guaranteed by a government, but I think that this has lost credibility with regard to investors and the issue of retroactivity. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, obviously I'm not going to comment on the programs of the British political parties. But yesterday in a newspaper, I think it was the Guardian, there were comparative figures on the energy proposals of the 3 main groups running for election and I think that the energy issue was something that they shared things in common. And the issue was to see who was going to put the bigger stakes in it. In other words, they all seem to be saying, well I'm going to do a bit more than the others. And there was some discussion regarding the remuneration. Some wanted to maintain the current systems and other were in favor of feed-in tariffs, payments and premiums.</p>
          <p>But in general &#x2013; well, and something else that I like very much in all 3 programs is that all 3 start with a phrase that I think we should copy in many other countries, and that is what do we do to provide legal and regulatory safety to get investors to invest in the British system. And this is quite comforting.</p>
          <p>So I don't think that we have different scenarios. In energy issues, I think all 3 are very, very similar. And all 3 are supporting this scheme, this scheme which means energy for the UK and it means more potential, new jobs and development of new activities in the UK. And the offshore issue is a tremendous opportunity for the British Isles, because of the situation of their continental shelf with a depth of only 30 or 40 meters, which is what today's offshore technology allows for reasonable investments.</p>
          <p>But this is going to produce a great deal of movement in all areas. Just in steel we were informed at the board meeting the other day, the tonnes for each of the pylons for each of the wind generators, around 700 tonnes if I'm not mistaken. Multiply that by thousands and we're talking about spectacular figures.</p>
          <p>And regarding the U.S., well, it's true that we've been working for over a year, but until recently for a number of circumstances we haven't been able to manage or support the management of that company. Important changes have been made from the organizational point of view. The regulation is something we're working on. Regulated business, until the regulation changes, well, it doesn't give you many areas to manage.</p>
          <p>We're working on it and everything indicates that things are going to go well in the case of the state of New York where 70% of the business is. And everything points to the new expansion of the transmission lines that we're negotiating to connect Canada with New England through Maine. All this is going in the right direction and we think that in the next few months we'll have the go ahead for the full project with major investments and the magnificent remuneration.</p>
          <p>But where have we been able to act? In these few months, we have been able to act on what we've been able to do, which are costs and expenses. And reducing a workforce by 6% in a few months, without creating any kind of trauma or problem, well, I think that means that things are starting to move. That expenses have dropped, as the CFO mentioned, that they've dropped in dollars in this period, shows that things are moving forward. And from the point of view of earnings, the margin is practically stable, which has to be the case in a regulated business.</p>
          <p>If the regulation doesn't change, the earnings are stable and you can act on cost as we've been doing. And so that our regulated business will have a better performance and we trust that we will be successful in the next few months. And Paco and I are leaving this afternoon. We're going over there and I'm sure that we're going to have good news in the next few months.</p>
          <p>Regarding the cost of debt Pepe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the expectations are that the cost of debt will remain at around 4.2% during the year. We don't expect a growth for the cost in the Group. But since we have a variable size it will also depend a bit. But in principal the expectation regarding the rates don't make us think that the cost of debt will increase over the year.</p>
          <p>And regarding the deficit, as the CFO said earlier, this has been a very long process. This started last year, in the month of June last year with the Royal Decree and the Act that said how the payments were going to be made with the government guarantee et cetera, et cetera. It's taken a year to finally have the document to be able to take it to the Stock Exchange Commission and to be able to approve the securitization. And I think that we are coming to the end of the process.</p>
          <p>So, what could happen on the market? If anybody knows, they'll have to use a crystal ball. But in any case I think that it's a very solid asset, because in the end it has a base of 22 million citizens that are going to pay for it. We are not talking about a loan to a company that has a single source of funding. Here there are 22 million citizens that have to finance this issue over the next 10, 15, 20 years, according to the securitization arrangement. So, I think that makes it very solid and I think that it's a financial product that can be attractive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Any more questions from the room? Okay, let's move on now to the telephone line questions, and I think the first one comes from Alberto Gandolfi, UBS. Yes, we are going to give the floor to Alberto Gandolfi, so go ahead with your question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My name is Alberto Gandolfi. I have three questions. Firstly, talking about England, we are talking about the Deregulated business, it seems that the spreads have collapsed and the outlook in relation to supply margins is pretty cautious. Could you please give us a little bit more guidance on how many losses can be expected this year relative to last year? What is your outlook for 2011? What are the drivers you expect? Because demand is very slack and it's loosing capacity and it seems that these coming years could be pretty tough in that region.</p>
          <p>And secondly, securitization of deficit seems to continue in line with what you have explained in your presentation. But there's still an exogenous factor which is the sovereign risk and that nobody can control. And there's a very extreme case in which the Spanish government bonds are increasing and the government decide to postpone the securitization of the deficit. I know that it's a very remote scenario that you might not want to talk about. But I'd like to know if you have a B plan, because it seems that in the UK there's a big demand and it seems that premiums can be obtained that are pretty substantial. Is that possible as a B plan or could you say something about that please?</p>
          <p>And finally, just a clarification. On transparency number 24, you were saying that 55.6 per megawatts-hour is the price including the margin. How much is that margin please? And could you please clarify, EUR 55 per megawatt-hour that Paco mentioned for 2011, does that include the retail margin? Does it include the payment of the capacities? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you reply on the dark spreads?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In response to the question with regard to dark spreads, yes, it is true that they have been weak this year. And it's a combination of two things. It's the strength in the price of coal relative to the price of power. The thing I would say from Scottish Power's point of view, we hedge forward and, therefore, we have sold a reasonable proportion of our &#x2013; significant proportion for 2010, but a reasonable proportion for 2011 is the first point in that area. Secondly, relative to those standalone coal producers, we are structurally much stronger because of course we have the integration and the benefit of the retail business, which provides us with additional income over and above that.</p>
          <p>My reflection on this in the time that I've spent in this market, when you look at the amount of investment that has to go into these assets, things like selective catalytic reduction, they can't stay down for too long because these things have to correct themselves. Because the large producers, the non-integrated producers such as Drax for example, cannot continue unless this resolves itself and therefore there will be a correction. That's the nature of commodity market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As regards to the question on the deficit, Pepe, could you say something about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, let's say the situation that IBERDROLA has at this point in time is a splendid situation as far as liquidity is concerned and funding. Because we this year, as we've pointed out, and by taking on a securitization of the deficit of about &#x20AC;3,600 million which is what we expect, because there are tensions in the market but then markets tend to become normal. So that means that markets are not in this volatility all the time. So this year we have a surplus of &#x20AC;2 billion.</p>
          <p>So if there were not a securitization of the deficit, which is something that we do not contemplate, our maximum level of funding would be something like &#x20AC;1.6 billion apart from the IOUs. But I'd like to remind you that we have credit lines that go beyond 2012 totaling more than &#x20AC;5 billion. So in 2010/2011 we can be completely calm and feel at ease. And last year we also demonstrated that we are very flexible in terms of our investment program, as well as in our divestitures program.</p>
          <p>So what does that mean? That means in essence that we contemplate these market turbulences with concern, and it couldn't be otherwise, but we also feel at ease. We feel very calm about what's going on because the tariff deficit will be securitized throughout the year and the financial position of IBERDROLA is extremely solid, and it has management mechanisms that make us feel absolutely safe. And in that regard, Alberto, I think that the work that has been done by the group by reducing the debt and by increasing its own resources will produce a very, very solid situation.</p>
          <p>And as regards the retail margin, you will understand that this business starts off with the end customers or finishes with the end customers, and it starts at the gates of the factory, which is what we are doing, what we are giving. This is the price between the gates of the factory and the entrance. In other words we're talking a margin of &#x20AC;45 is what we have between what it costs for us to produce this with the raw materials and the price we sell it for at the end.</p>
          <p>So the movements are between companies &#x2013; well, not even between companies but between departments that are managed by Paco Martinez Corcoles, who knows what's happening at each point in time. He knows how much this is costing and how much he has to sell if for. And this is turnover divided by the amount of gigawatts that are sold and that's what he knows how to do perfectly well. Next question please.</p>

          <p>Good morning everyone. I am Javier Suarez. I think it's clear through the presentation yesterday afternoon and this morning that the focus of the company is very much centered on cost reduction. And it was interesting to listen to the Chairman say that there are different savings initiatives in ScottishPower that could enable the company to have an additional return over the regulated return, around 100 base points I think you mentioned. Could you give us some details on where this cost initiative comes from for the cut back of additional costs at ScottishPower, which could be a way of producing additional value for the company? And also through the first quarter we saw an enormous cost reduction effort throughout the company. And I would like to have the intangible of knowing where the market can be surprised by the amount of cost reduction in 2010.</p>
          <p>And regarding the UK business, related to an earlier question, it has been said that the hedging level or covering level for 2010/2011 of ScottishPower is very significant for 2010 and reasonable for 2011. Could you quantify in percentage what that coverage level is? And I don't know whether you mentioned the price level for this coverage or hedging in the UK. And the final question on the level of provisions that we've seen in the first quarter of this year, we've seen an increase in provisions and I would like to know what the reasons are for this increase. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the first point, cost reduction, what have we done, well, exactly what we're doing in the U.S. We have multi-disciplinary teams at the various companies and we're doing benchmarking. We're changing operating procedures and we're exchanging best practices between all companies in the group. And this brings about a reduction in the workforce.</p>
          <p>It was done in Spain some years ago in outside services, in equipment standardization. We are standardizing our different equipment so that you can buy much more standard equipment and therefore more global equipment, and under better conditions. We're analyzing our offices, headquarters et cetera, et cetera to decide how many are necessary or unnecessary, how to relocate in a less costly manner. And we're looking at the issues of cars, vehicles, travel et cetera, brigades, number of people in each brigade or work team. This is a complete restudy of the processes. This is nothing different to what we've done in Spain.</p>
          <p>In the case of ScottishPower it was done in the commercial area and is still being done in the commercial and retail area. And we currently have the opportunity of doing it in the network area once we have a regulatory framework established for the next five years. We're going through the same process in the U.S.</p>
          <p>And again as a matter of analyzing things top down, is the complete process reengineering to do things in much more efficiently, with a study on each and every cost aspect that has an influence on the production or service process. How can we improve our service? How can we improve the quality we give to our customers at more logical and more rational cost based on a process reengineering through interdisciplinary work teams at companies in the group that are exchanging their best experiences. This is the outline. Regarding ScottishPower coverage, Nick, can you please answer this question?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>If I may Chairman, I'd just like to add to the last question. We have benefited significantly from group-wide procurement practices and the strength of the IBERDROLA Group. Monthly I see contracts coming in that are significantly improved on where they would have been had we been a standalone purchaser. So it's another thing I'd like to add to that.</p>
          <p>So far as our cover is concerned in terms of our generation output for 2010, it is around 85%. It's a level that we are comfortable with. It is part of a well-structured, well-thought-through delta hedging program, which leaves us the room for operational flexibility and leaves us the room to benefit from any changes in prompt prices. So far as next year is concerned we are well over 50% hedged as well at prices in which we are comfortable. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jose, would you answer the provision issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The increase in provisions regarding 2009 in this quarter is around &#x20AC;25 million, which are explained first, because first last year in 2009 we applied a provision we had made related to our distributor in Guatemala. In 2008 in Guatemala the tariffs were dropped significantly and perhaps in a surprising way. So we made a provision, a write-off of the assets at the end of 2008. After that what we did was to reduce investments, reduce spending and so on. And part of the profitability of the Company was recovered and the auditor advised that we revert part of that in a provision. That provision was &#x20AC;12 million. That was done in 2009, in other words a reduction in provisions in 2009.</p>
          <p>And in 2010 we have increased provisions for two reasons, one because of the real estate assets, &#x20AC;10 million, a provision for the whole year. And this year we've included in the accounts &#x20AC;10 million. This is internal to the company and not external. And secondly we have an increase in insolvencies. We've provided &#x20AC;4 million in provisions, but fundamentally because of the commercial business, the last resort commercial business, which didn't exist last year and it does this year. And there's not much more.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Antonella Bianchessi from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yes, just a quick question on your sales mix in Q1. So if you can give a detail on how much the sales were sold directly to customers out of the 90% sold forward and covered, and if you can do a projection for the future?</p>
          <p>Second question always on this subject, if the achieved price of &#x20AC;55 in Q1 is sustainable for the full-year or if you expect any change to that? And then to come back to Scottish Power, if you can give us a little bit of details in terms of customers? The volumes are going down. What's happened to the customer, you are retaining customer or if you are losing some of the customer?</p>
          <p>And finally is on the fuel cost of Scottish Power, can you give us a little bit of granularity on what's happened in Q1 and what you expect is going to happen over the next few quarters in terms of fuel costs? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Antonella, could you say it again the first question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Basically the customer mix, if you can give us a detail of the first quarter of 2010, how much of the generation was sold to customer excluding the forward markets, excluding the real customer, how much of this was bilateral contract, and if you are planning to increase this quarter or if it's fine for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paco, could you please answer the first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I understood you correctly its sales to end customers, yes? It's the mix of customers. Yes, I would like to say something about 2010. Jos&#xE9; Luis has the data.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jos&#xE9; Luis can answer then. No, you carry on, carry on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to give you a figure of the 62 terawatts we have given for the entire year 2010, on the market we have, in the term market we have 7 or &#x20AC;8. Let's see if I can find this note. Sorry, we are talking about millions of terawatt hour. We are talking -- I think it's about 40 or 45 terawatts hour, which is what we have in relation to end customers, end customers in a free price market. And to this we have to add on the last resort supplies and that would be something like 10 or something along those lines. So if Jose Luis has any better data he can confirm this, but I think that something 50 out of the 62 terawatts go to direct customers, that is direct sales to customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the figures that I have, I have figures for the first quarter. They want the data for the first quarter. Well, I have them here. The sales in the first quarter were 8.2 terawatts. And the commercialization of the last resort, that was 6. So it's a total of 14 terawatts that have been sold directly to customers in Q1. And that gives you a figure at the end of the year of something like 45 to 50.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the other issue is if the &#x20AC;55 are sustainable or not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our forecast, more than a forecast, let's say that the information we have at this point in time, because we have practically the entire year closed, is that the 55 of the first quarter will end up at something like 53. Because right now, we've closed at 52 to 62 terawatts, our standard about 53. And when we close the entire year, I think that we'll end up with 52 and quite a lot more. And that's what we expect. And most of this has already been closed.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As of now versus the beginning of the year we are out of 5.24 million customers 18,000 down on the beginning of the year. Let me just give you a bit of context on that.</p>
          <p>We have deliberately put in place a targeting program whereby the credit worthiness of these customers are very important and therefore, we have actively deselected those that don't have good payment records. And that has been reflected in a very good performance in terms of our debtor days, cash collection and bad debt. So that's working very well.</p>
          <p>And also when you consider that the largest player in our market, British Gas, announced their gas price increase on February 7, some 4 to 5 weeks ahead of the market again, our marketing stood up very robustly against those 2 things. Should I answer, Chairman?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So far as fuel costs, you asked the question on fuel costs, I'm afraid I don't have the data with me. We'll need to provide it separately. Apologies for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Tom Gibney from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just quickly on the tariff deficit securitization, what's the timetable for the CNE registration and what does that registration exactly entail?</p>
          <p>And also could you give us the percentage or a rough idea of how much of your available liquidity in terms of your credit facilities and your cash are with Spanish Banks? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding the tariff deficit where we are not obviously in control of the process what the information that we have is that they have pretty advanced what is the booklet <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Yes, what we know that the booklet is fairly advanced. TDA is doing it. The information we have is the booklet is fairly advanced. It shouldn't be a very complicated booklet. Therefore, we expect that to take, well I don't know, 3 weeks. We don't think that it will take longer.</p>
          <p>And regarding who provides us with our credit lines? Well, the fact is that the entire market. If we currently have very limited exposure to banks, that means both international and national banks, and therefore, they are anxious to loan to IBERDROLA. So, we currently have credit lines provided by 10, 15, 20 of the biggest world international banks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the question sounds a bit strange. Well, I think if we look at page 40, what the CFO says is fairly obvious, bank loans 15%. The rest is market bonds, investment banks and project finance. Therefore, our dependence on banks is fairly limited. We are not a company that depends on the situation of banks because of the rating. With an A rating, we're a very attractive company for issues on the market as we have been in recent months.</p>
          <p>And therefore, we don't need to knock on the doors of banks. They are permanently knocking on our door to offer us credit lines. They want to talk to us. So our situation is exactly the opposite of that of many companies in this country that are facing serious difficulties in this country and other countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have a question from Manuel Palomo from Citi. Yes, the question is from Mr. Manuel Palomo, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody. This is a question that has to do with the potential impact because yesterday, we saw that the Portuguese debt has been reduced. I don't know if this could have any impact in terms of your company. And could you please quantify things? Should Spanish debt have the same problem if it will be downgraded? So would this produce a downgrading of the rating of IBERDROLA, meaning that would be greater financial costs or there would be a greater impact on the financial costs of the corporation? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the truth is that the fact that there was a downgrade of the sovereign ratings obviously has an effect on companies operating in these countries. But what is clear is that firstly the market in a way is already including a premium in the price. At this point in time or yesterday, the Spanish sovereign rating was 190 and the CDS of IBERDROLA was 117 or 114.</p>
          <p>And what does that mean to say? Well, that means that we've obviously been penalized that the market is penalizing us to a lesser extent. Why? Well, because nearly 60% of the business of this Company, of the results obtained by this Company or revenues obtained, they are outside Spain. And also because this Corporation in last year substantially improved its solidity and this is something that has been recognized by the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would also like to add something else to what the CFO has just pointed out. And that is because the markets believe that we are capable of managing things and we do so according to what we say.</p>
          <p>And at the end of the day, credibility is the sum of many factors. First, we have that diversification of markets and products, products that are very predictable, which is our case with the regulated businesses. And secondly, when this Company says it is going to do something it does it, and that's our track record. When we say that we're going to reduce our expenses we do so. And when we say that we're going to stop investment we stop them. And when we say that we're going to maintain leverage we maintain it. And we've played with all these elements. So this is what gives us credibility on the market in order to have this situation of CDS, which is 80% lower in the case of the Kingdom of Spain.</p>

          <p>I don't think that there are anymore telephone questions, so let's move on now to the website questions. Michael Parsons from Banco Santander, and he is asking to the debt relative to tax equity investment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, I understand the question is that the tax equity investor, and this was mentioned yesterday by the CFO of IBERDROLA RENOVABLES, consists of two sides. First of all, the gross tax equity investor concept, around &#x20AC;679 million and around 872 in dollars and the net tax equity investor, because there's cash collaterals, and when we show the net debt or talk about the net equity investor, we deduct the collateral, so its 571 or $725 million.</p>

          <p>Three questions from Pablo Cuadrado from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The first is can we quantify the impact on EBITDA of the social bond and the increase of the payments to Endesa during the first quarter?</p>
          <p>Second question that was partly replied and they want to know if we want to present more clarifications on the rate case for the State of New York, and when do we expect a final decision from the regulator?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, have we had any contacts with the securitization fund that makes us believe that this process could be delayed in view of the current conditions?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I believe that more or less the sum of the impact of the social bond and the Endesa levy has meant a lower EBITDA of around &#x20AC;45 million in this quarter.</p>
