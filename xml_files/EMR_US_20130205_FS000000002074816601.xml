          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Emerson's Investor Conference Call. During today's presentation by Emerson management, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> This conference is being recorded today, the 5th of February, 2013.</p>
          <p>Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Patrick Fitzgerald, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alicia. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>Today's call will summarize Emerson's first quarter 2013 results. Conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website at emerson.com. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website after the call for the next three months.</p>
          <p>I'll start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on page 2 of the conference call slide presentation.</p>
          <p>First quarter sales increased 5% to $5.6 billion, with underlying sales growing 6%. Sales trends were mixed across end markets and geographies, with the strongest growth in Process Management driven by robust energy end markets and favorable comparisons from supply chain disruption in the prior year.</p>
          <p>Gross margin of 39.7% improved 100 basis points and EBIT margin expanded 160 basis points to 13.1%, as strong volume leverage and cost reduction benefits offset mix headwinds. Earnings per share of $0.62 increased 24% from the prior year. Cash generation was strong with free cash flow up 115% to $439 million. The results reflected solid growth in margin amid a tenuous global economic environment and kept Emerson on pace for financial &#x2013; the record financial performance 2013.</p>
          <p>Next slide, P&amp;L summary. As I mentioned, total sales grew 5% and underlying sales grew 6%. Operating profit margin of 14.6% increased 140 basis points despite a stock compensation increase of $22 million and a $12 million pension expense increase. Earnings per share of $0.62 increased 24%, benefiting from share repurchases of 2.1 million shares.</p>
          <p>Next slide, underlying sales by geography: underlying sales in the U.S. grew 6%; Europe declined 2%; Asia increased 6%; Latin America increased 19%; Canada grew 6%; and Middle East and Africa was up 22%. Total underlying sales increased 6%. Currency translation and divestitures deducted 1%, for reported sales growth of 5%. We expect Asia to gain orders growth momentum in the second quarter, especially in China and India.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 5, cash flow and balance sheet; operating cash flow grew 66%, driven by strong earnings and lower working capital growth. Free cash flow was up 115%, reflecting 97% conversion from earnings. Working capital as a percent of sales increased 90 basis points, as strong payables performance and lower inventory was more than offset by higher receivables.</p>
          <p>Next slide, business segment earnings; business segment margin, which reflects $12 million of incremental pension expense, improved 130 basis points. Corporate expense decreased slightly as retiree medical charge in the prior year was offset by higher stock compensation expense. Interest was down $4 million and the tax rate was slightly lower than prior year.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 7, Process Management: Process Management net and underlying sales increased 24%; with the U.S. up 26%; Asia up 25%; Europe up 11%; Latin America up 44%; and Middle East and Africa up 36%.</p>
          <p>The oil and gas, chemical and power industries continued strong growth, particularly in Asia, where orders grew 11% in the quarter. Segment margin expanded 520 basis points as strong volume leverage and cost reduction benefit offset less favorable project mix especially in the U.S. The near-term outlook remains solid, supported by energy end market strength and high backlog.</p>
          <p>Next slide Industrial Automation: Industrial Automation reported sales declined 7% and underlying sales decreased 6% with the U.S. down 7%; Asia down 7%; Europe down 9%; Latin America up 9%; and Middle East and Africa up 4%.</p>
          <p>Global demand for industrial goods remains anemic, which was particularly pronounced in the power generating alternators business. Weakness continued in the electrical drives and industrial motors business as well, which was partly offset by solid growth in the hermetic motors business.</p>
          <p>Segment margin declined 40 basis points, primarily due to volume deleverage. Industrial Automation's cost structure is well positioned for the expectation for continued sluggish demand for industrial capital goods in the near-term.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 9, Network Power: Network Power reported and underlying sales declined 2%; the U.S. flat; Asia down 3%; Europe down 8%; Latin America up 8%; and Middle East and Africa down 2%.</p>
          <p>Softness continued in global telecommunications and IT end markets, especially in Europe. AC power systems were strong in the U.S. and Latin America. And sales were flat in the embedded computing and power business.</p>
          <p>Segment margin declined to 7.2% as volume deleverage and unfavorable mix more than offset cost reduction benefits. Order trends have started to improve, supported by telecommunications infrastructure investments; Emerson expects solid margin expansion in 2013.</p>
          <p>Next slide, Climate Technologies: Climate Technologies' reported sales grew 2% and underlying sales increased 3%; with the U.S. up 1%; Asia up 7%; Europe up 2%; Latin America down 4%; and Middle East and Africa up 32%.</p>
          <p>Strong growth in Asia benefited from improved residential air conditioning end markets, particularly in China and U.S. growth reflected more favorable conditions in residential end markets as well.</p>
          <p>Global refrigeration demand remains weak, particularly transportation. Segment margin declined 20 basis points, primarily due to unfavorable mix from the residential growth. We expect demand to remain steady in the near term from continued recovery of residential end markets in the U.S. and Asia.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 11, Commercial &amp; Residential Solutions: Commercial &amp; Residential Solutions' reported sales declined 1%, while underlying sales grew 4%, as the Knaack business unit divestiture deducted 5%. By region, the U.S. was up 7%, Asia down 2%, Europe down 3%, Latin America down 6% and Middle East and Africa down 14%.</p>
          <p>U.S. residential end markets remained steady, led by robust growth in the food waste disposers business.</p>
          <p>Segment margins improved 30 basis points, benefiting from the Knaack divestiture and cost reductions. The recovery in North America residential end markets is expected to continue in the near term.</p>
          <p>Finally, slide 12, 2013 detailed outlook. We expect reported and underlying sales to grow 2% to 5%, EBIT margin expansion of 10 basis points to 20 basis points, despite pension and stock compensation headwinds, and earnings per share growth of 4% to 7%. We also expect strong operating cash flow growth of 8% to 11%.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to David Farr.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Pat. First, I want to thank everyone for joining us today and I appreciate your time. And I'm also looking forward to our Investor Conference next Monday and Tuesday in Columbus, Ohio, where we're going to share a lot more information relative to our business segments and also some insights into our Network Power systems business.</p>
          <p>Also, I want to thank all of the Emerson employees around the world for their excellent performance and the strong execution in our first fiscal quarter. Obviously, the first fiscal quarter is always very important, relative to delivering the full year. Last year, we really struggled with a supply chain issue, but this year, the performance is greatly improved and on track to delivering what I think can be a very strong, exceptional 2013 at all levels.</p>
          <p>As we look at the global economy today and the environment around the world, it is slightly better than 60 days ago, but still below trend line and still not a typical recovery that you would see from the typical economies that we face and serve around the world. We'll talk more about that next week, but fundamentally, the trend is positive, but the trend is not going to be a sharp recovery, and I think that clearly, strategic investment is going to be very, very important to drive growth again as we move into the 2013 and 2014.</p>
          <p>Also, I want to remind people out there, that Emerson presents GAAP numbers, which means that we include all pension costs, all intangible amortization, and our performance share stock programs in the consolidated numbers.</p>
          <p>We present GAAP numbers. Also, I want to make sure people understand, in the business segments, we include the pension costs and goodwill amortization of the businesses, which is also very appropriate, given they are making investments and those employees are creating the business well for this shareholders going forward. So, I feel it's very appropriate that we hold them accountable for those costs, and delivering the profit improvements across those business segments.</p>
          <p>We will be funding our pension plan again this year at $150 million level, about the same number we've funded last year, and I think that's very appropriate, given what's going on around the world in a low interest rate environment. And to make sure that we keep our pension plan, which is not a huge cost, in line to what I think is appropriate for the employees that have built this company over 130 years.</p>
          <p>Again, I'm looking forward to our Investor Conference next week. We have a lot of interesting things to share with you, the time to spend with the management team, and to talk about what's going on across this company and the exciting opportunities we see as we move into 2013 and 2014.</p>
          <p>One last point before I open up for Q&amp;A. I want to remind the investors, as I said on the last conference call &#x2013; remind the investors as I said in the last conference call that 70% to 80% of our earnings this year; EPS delta, will occur in the first half. 70% to 80% of our earnings delta will occur in the first half. We just did the first quarter, a delta of $0.12; pretty easy to calculate what the second quarter should be in the range of.</p>
          <p>So, with that, I'll open up the phone lines to make sure that we answer some of the interesting questions, but also I will not get into a lot of great detail about the business segments now, because we'll be doing that in Columbus next week on Monday and Tuesday.</p>
          <p>We shared with you more detail on that one page, the financial chart that we normally would give you at the conference, but I thought you should have that as you finalize the numbers coming out of our first quarter and look at your own models for the investors out there for the whole year, and not have to wait until next week. So, that's why we gave you that one page with all the detailed information in there, so you can factor that into your own financial models.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll open up the lines. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks a lot. Yes, so firstly, I guess just on the <mark type="audio gap" /> (13:30) more positive than what we heard throughout last year. Maybe if you could just talk a little bit about what's driven that, if it's something you're seeing in the January order intake or something in a specific region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, as we've been reporting in monthly orders, we've been a little bit more positive on the monthly order statements for the last couple months.</p>
          <p>The last &#x2013; since September, October our order trends have turned up, in some of the businesses now in Climate Technologies, Network Power systems, Residential Solutions, have all now become positive and driving on a continuing basis on a three-month roll.</p>
          <p>So from my perspective, this trend has been improving. It's &#x2013; I would say a moderate amount of improvement from that standpoint, but just the global economies have stabilized and feel more comfortable for the financial institutions and I think money is again flowing and people are starting to make those investments. No, it's not a &#x2013; it's not a real robust economic environment out there, just look what happened on average the second half of the United States' economy. And so, in total, it's still &#x2013; basically you're looking about 2% to 3% type of growth. And we'll get into the various regions of the world next week, but I still see a 2%, 3%, 4% underlying growth in the general economic trends that we'll be facing this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thanks. And then just secondly, the issue of mix comes up a lot in the slides in the different segments and how that affects your margin. How do you see that playing out over the balance of the year? Because, I guess, as you emphasized, the margin growth is very front end loaded. Is that because there's mix or something you think will carry on weighing on the margins over the balance of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Julian. I think, from my perspective, we &#x2013; our business; in particular, Process business or the Climate business or the Residential Solutions business in a given month or quarter, we could have a surge of sales shipments from the standpoint of the systems versus our instrumentation.</p>
          <p>The last &#x2013; I would say the last three quarters, not the most recent quarter, but the last three quarters, we've had pretty good mix and we &#x2013; from last year as the profitability of some of these businesses things went our way, and so Climate, even though they had down sales last year, we had pretty good mix from the type of business, and therefore there have improved in profitability. Same thing with Process.</p>
          <p>If you look at the underlying quarter, Process had a very, very strong systems and solutions orders and shipment quarter. Instrumentation a little bit weaker, driven by &#x2013; the product just came in quite strong, a lot &#x2013; and that will create a lower margin in the Process world. Same thing in the Climate Technology.</p>
          <p>We expect that mix to come back as we look at the &#x2013; our order books right now. We look at the order pace. I would expect that margin to come back, that's why we still believe that we'll have 10 basis points to 20 basis points improvement consolidated. And I'll give you the <mark type="ph" /> business (16:27) margins by each of the segments; the forecast next week, but it's not uncommon as you hear me talk, we'll have a quarter, the mix goes the wrong way; quarter goes the right way. And I would say, we had good margin improvement this quarter, it could have been better with the right mix, but we'll make that back up as we go into that second quarter. It just moves around. That's what happens.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thanks. And then just lastly...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...just quickly on the Network Power specifically. The decremental margins have been pretty severe the last six months. Is that again mostly kind of just mix-related?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's mix-related and we expect that will start turning here. It is starting to turn as we see that business starting to recover. As I expect, that will continue to improve now as we move into the year in the second quarter. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Julian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you elaborate a bit more on the comments about expecting the Asian orders to gain momentum? And in particular, what's your visibility like in front of the Chinese New Year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have pretty good visibility. We've been doing business there a long time. We see what the order pace is. I mean some of the businesses will not have a good couple of weeks before the Chinese New Year, then it'll come back. Clearly, every year there's a Chinese New Year, it just comes up at a different time. We've just seen &#x2013; I mean, we just came &#x2013; Ed Monser and I just came back from an Asia trip, talking versus just couple of months ago. You're seeing a recovery now in China, pretty raw across all of our businesses &#x2013; early cycle guides have already started coming into play.</p>
          <p>I would say what you'll see for our businesses right now is a recovery will start happening in the second half for more of the Industrial and Network Power systems, and Process and Climate will go earlier and they're starting to move right now. So, that visibility is pretty good relative to order pace and just what's happening. So we feel good about that. Same thing in India. We see that recovery going on right now.</p>
          <p>The one market I think is going to be weaker for us this year will be Australia, because of huge investments the last couple of years. But overall, visibility right now in China, India, Southeast Asia, pretty good. The order book, pretty good. And I think that we'll progress, things will get better, assuming the economic progression continues to happen as it is, we'll get better as the year progresses. But I think you're going to see in the second half that really get better, much better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you also called out in the press release, a negative margin mix and Process from the lack of higher margin maintenance type projects. Is that already in the results this quarter or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, we saw that impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean, what happen is, with a lot of discussion &#x2013; and I was just talking to Julian a few minutes ago, the same thing.</p>
          <p>In a quarter, we have things that &#x2013; clearly, the MRO business which had been extremely strong in North America for us prior to last quarter was a little bit &#x2013; people got a little bit nervous about what was being discussed and concerned about the U.S. economy. So, they really pulled back a little bit. And I would expect that as we go forward, you will see that turn loose. But that mix is already built into the quarter. That's a pretty quick &#x2013; MRO is a pretty quick type of situation for us.</p>

          <p>Yeah, it caught up pretty well amongst last year, if you push and shove last year and it's hard to track it, but by the time, we finished the year we're there. In my opinion, we're there.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct. Yes, exactly right. Projects moving in and out and things like that. And the key thing for me right now to be honest is the last gentleman asked a good question on the MRO with North America. That is, we need that to come back a little bit. People, I think, were a little bit cautious in the first three months and I'm hoping as we get into this &#x2013; deep into the second quarter, we'll start seeing that MRO business activity comes in.</p>
          <p>Now we &#x2013; if you remember correctly, we grew over 20% last year on North America in Process. And so, the question is, do they have to digest some of that and maybe the first six months this year could be kind of slow. So, that's where we're watching carefully right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just on receivables, maybe a quick comment on just the higher level this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're still versus last year, we're still catching up. We did make headway relative to the receivables we built at the end of the fiscal year. We will continue to make headway here as we go forward. Part of the receivable delta is, about a third of it is basically prepayments from large projects and basically that's good thing. I mean, we've got large projects coming down the road in Network Power systems and also Process. So, that creates a balance sheet issue for us, but that's a good sign, but we are making good headway. We had good cash flow. I feel very good about the cash flow this year and if we have a strong second quarter, we will set a record year in cash flow in 2013.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Dave, you don't often talk about hermetic motors, but maybe give us some color about the HVAC market there. How does that relate to the compressor side and how do inventories look?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, a hermetic motor goes in every compressor we sell. So, and we only &#x2013; we basically &#x2013; we're a captive type of business here. And from that standpoint, you saw in the quarter, our Climate Technology business did grow and we had a good quarter; we had good orders. Our Climate Technology orders are above the line, as we say, and I expect them, when we see the final January numbers, to be above the line. I do know in January, they had another good global order book.</p>
          <p>So, from my perspective, Climate Technology has turned, and we had two tough years after one really strong year, and I expect them to have good growth in 2013 and 2014. We'll talk about it. We maintained our investments in a big way in that Climate Technology area, and we're going to start seeing some payback in that and I think in 2013 and 2014. I'm very positive about that right now.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I don't think it &#x2013; by the way, I think, they expect us to serve them without rebuilding compressor inventory. I don't think they're going to rebuild inventory. I think they expect us &#x2013; we ship within days. They expect us to rotate, move around, change our lines and go. So, I don't worry about that too much, but I just &#x2013; let's put it this way, it's low.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>So, a question on Process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You characterized the backlogs as strong although it seems like orders have softened and you've had this huge revenue surge. Is actual physical backlog strong or it's just what you see coming in the pipeline kind of bid and proposal work. Any color you could share there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say both the physical is very strong and the pipeline is very strong. One of the things, and somebody asked me the question earlier, we raised the top-line a little bit in sales growth. We have a little more head &#x2013; we're going to have &#x2013; currency is going to help us as the year finishes, and that does not give you a lot of margin, as you know. So, that's one of the reasons why I should have said that earlier, that we look at that &#x2013; the dollar definitely right now is a little bit weaker, and therefore it helps us. But, we don't get a lot of earnings out of that.</p>
          <p>The backlog from the standpoint of the Process is still at record levels, maybe not quite as high as it was a smidgen below September, and the pipeline that we see is very, very strong around the world. Not a lot of &#x2013; I hear about delays out there from other people, but I don't &#x2013; we have not had a lot of delays. The short-term impact to us has been more than North America MRO businesses, as those guys slowed down a little bit and they're just digesting all they did last year. But right now, it looks pretty good.</p>
          <p>I expect to have a good second quarter. We're coming off very &#x2013; we grew <mark type="ph" /> 50-50 (26:48). I mean, we added $1 billion a year for two years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Those are big numbers. And so, we still expect solid single-digit growth in the Process sales this year, solid single-digit. And I expect pretty good profitability out of them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are you seeing kind of the downstream kind of more gas-driven, I guess, but oil and gas-driven projects moving forward on people's drawing boards? Do you think there's delays there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now, we're not seeing delays. The projects are moving forward. We're bidding on them. We're winning them. That's going to help us as the year progresses and as we move into 2014.</p>
          <p>In particular, North America, the oil and gas downstream projects are enormous. And that's why I've been so excited about trying to get the pipelines open, why I believe in having natural gas, shipping &#x2013; even exporting natural gas, we need to have that natural gas flowing out there to make those investments happen. I just came back from South Africa, I was just in India, and we're all seeing the downstream numbers coming both around the world and then also here in North America, which I'm pretty good &#x2013; excited about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe just finally, any thoughts on kind of M&amp;A versus share repo? You started to kind of lean into the share repo a little bit more here. What's the thought for the year? Any change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No change. I expect share repurchase to be in the $600 million to $800 million range. No change at that point in time, pretty much in line with what we did last year.</p>
          <p>At this point in time, we'll be talking next week, I do not see any big, big acquisitions. I expect us to spend somewhere around $400 million or $500 million this year. When I look at the quality of assets out there, it's not very high at this point in time, and therefore, we're going to generate very high levels of cash. We'll pay the dividend, we'll buy share repurchase, and keep our balance sheet ready to go for an acquisition. But right now, it's going to be both, we're going to be passing back close to 60% of our cash to our shareholders in 2013.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you &#x2013; I want to go back and talk a little bit about the drives and the motors business. I mean, I think there was a new product launch that you guys were doing, I just can't recall the timing and how that may be impacting results. Can you update us there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Yeah, we will talk again about this next week, but the new drives are coming out. They're being introduced. We're starting to take orders. Our motors and drives business right now is being negatively impacted by the strength in Europe. We are very, very strong in Europe and that's been a tough marketplace. But the new drive launch is going. It's going to be very positive and it's going to expand a certain market. I would expect we'll start seeing that impact more in the second half of 2013 and in particular in 2014. It's started, therefore we typically have a lag as people wait for the new drives. So, with the European slowdown and that product launch, it was pretty predictable that we would have about &#x2013; I would say, about five, six quarter slowdown. That's where we are right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And it looks like embedded had a pretty good quarter, and that's a positive surprise versus, I think most of us were probably expecting it to continue to bleed down for the year. I mean, is this kind of low-water mark? You said this quarter, I expect them to have another good quarter. And how do you &#x2013; and since you're just talking about revenues, what about profits? Are margins picking up there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yes. We've &#x2013; they've gone through enormous restructuring. My hat's off to Jay and his team here. I mean, first of all, we announced we're going to sell them. That's hard to do. We took out a lot of what I call deadwood business. We've got a few things going on on the customer base, like Dell, HP, guys like that, a little few things going on out there.</p>
          <p>And from my perspective, it looks to me like the order pace has actually turned up. You can't see that yet but we will show this next week too, I think we'll actually show you a curve, and you'll be able to see that the curve for embedded has actually started to turn up. It's still negative, but it's getting &#x2013; I think it might cross the line real soon. So, I expect growth to start happening and I expect profitability to continue to improve.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, Shannon.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Dave. So, what about your own CapEx? I mean, it was down a little bit year-over-year in the quarter. You're talking about taking it up a little bit, but not a lot for the year. What are you looking for to sort of loosen the purse strings a little bit with your own capital spending? What would you need to see?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Serious top line growth in growth fixed investment on the world, which we haven't seen. I mean, you haven't seen it at all. And our forecast is for this year, global GFI will probably be up somewhere around 3%, 4%, 5%, and we can cover most of that &#x2013; a lot of that with productivity.</p>
          <p>So, I mean, I expect us to have a little bit of increase. If Climate business continues to trend nicely and other business come along, we can always increase that as the year goes on. We have the cash, but I'm just going to be very careful metering out that capacity that we don't need until we need it. So, that's what it caused me.</p>
          <p>We're running at around $700 million, which is not a bad number, and I think it's going to stay that way. If we got the opportunity and the growth &#x2013; let's say that growth started coming up nicely, then you'd see us maybe take that up a little bit. But right now, I think that the growth rate we're looking at, we're in pretty good shape.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just in terms of thinking about Network Power margin improvement through the year, some of the pickup in orders recently has been in telecom which isn't quite as favorable mix as data center might be. I mean, are you &#x2013; I think, you thought the mix would get a little better from here, but is it mix or is it the restructuring benefits from last year following through? How do we think about what drives the margin improvement through the year in Network Power?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you're going to see the restructuring kick in. And we're also starting to see some of the better mix of products. The telecom business is &#x2013; yes, is improving, but the other parts of the business are starting to have pretty good standpoint.</p>
          <p>The other issues &#x2013; in the first half of the first quarter, particularly last year, our China Network Power systems business was extremely strong and that's a very profitable business for us. And really it started tailing off last year including this quarter here and the quarter we just finished. That business order pace is starting to pick back up, that mix is starting to pick back up, so I would expect this &#x2013; as we get into the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter, that business is going to help us and that will help us mix up and also grow. So, there are a couple of things that are starting to kick into gear here that will be &#x2013; will really help us as we get into that second half of the year.</p>
          <p>I keep reminding everyone, we're going to have 78% of our earnings per share in the first six months for the reason; we had record, record levels the last year. So, I'm &#x2013; this mix is going to come and help us, but I want a driver &#x2013; most of our earnings opportunity is really in the first half when we got hit last year with the Thailand flood situation. So, things are starting to mix the right way for us.</p>

          <p>We pushed the pension cost down &#x2013; our pension cost down the businesses and they don't like that, but that's where the cost is and we also pushed the amortization. We did the acquisition and I expect them to recover.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there's definitely a drift away from GAAP in the sector. So, just interested in your comments on China. You definitely called the recovery fairly early in 2013, but I think you've been quite skeptical about the sustainability of the growth beyond 2013. Do you still feel that way?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I &#x2013; we'll talk about it next week. I have a lower growth expectation in China for 2014 and 2015, though I still expect it to grow a very solid single-digit. I like the way they're unfolding this, to be honest, Nigel. I think they're trying &#x2013; they're not trying to prime the pump way too fast. I like what they're doing right now. They're being very measured. And I like some of the actions being taken by the new leadership team. And so right now, based &#x2013; and I'll be going back over there early in March. I'm very encouraged by what I see right now and if that continues for the next three or four months, then I'll feel better about that 2014 and 2015. But right now, we're going to have a pretty good recovery here as the year progresses in 2013 for sure.</p>

          <p>They're going to put money out. I mean, India's been in a tough place for the last couple years. I think 2013 and maybe even the first part of 2014 for us will be okay; then I get concerned again. But right now, they are priming the pump and the money's being spent and I look at my order pace, it wasn't great in the first quarter, but I look at what's going on in the activity, the bookings, and I think India will get better as the year progresses.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I didn't. Quick one on the macro. China. So, last quarter when you gave initial guidance, you said China for you would be up 5% to 10% in 2013. And I've seen the presentation you have a GFI expectation of 6% to 7%. And that assumes maybe growth, a multiple over GFI for you, but is that 5% to 10% change or is that a potential room for upside later in the year depending on what you see?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now my answer would be no change, if it unfolds the way I'm seeing it unfold, we could probably have some upside. But right now, it's too early to say from my perspective, because I think that the changes we're seeing in China are just starting to happen. I mean, as you know, I try to be very open and I see this and I feel better about it, and I'll be back there in 30 days, so if I walk away feeling better about it, then the answer would be yes, we should do a little bit better, more like towards the 10%. But we've got to start getting it there first.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. So, Europe kind of continues to disproportionately drag your ops. This quarter seemed to hit Industrial Automation, Network Power. Are you seeing these markets begin to inflect perhaps more positively any aspect of this? And I know you've done a lot of restructuring there, I mean presumably when you start to get some of these volumes, these margins could ramp back at pretty high incrementals. Is that a fair statement? Or maybe we should be thinking about this somewhat differently. How do you think about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think if we can get &#x2013; I mean, you've got to get a reasonable level of margin. I mean, I'm sorry, growth. One or two points of growth aren't a lot of ramp through a factory. Now if all of a sudden &#x2013; I mean, I feel better about Europe today than I did 60 days ago. So, I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if we don't grow &#x2013; our European business doesn't grow in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>So, what I &#x2013; I think to get the margin improvement &#x2013; a significant margin improvement in Europe you've got a get above 5% type underlying growth for us. I mean at 2%, 3%, 4%, that's not enough to really ramp at margin, but if you start getting up above that 5% with the restructuring underway, we should see a pretty good margin improvement. And that will help us obviously in our overall business. But that's where you have to get to. And I don't have a forecast that Europe's going to grow 4%, 5%. So, I think that's the type of growth you need to see, and I don't see that happening for a while.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, but does your forecast assume it starts to get better in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we assumed our European business starts to have growth. And like I said, I wouldn't be surprised if we don't have growth in the second quarter. But it's going to be moderate growth, probably like onesie-2s, which is not a whole lot of incremental volume. I mean, when it's no growth and there's negative growth that you deleverage pretty hard, even though with the cost reductions, because you have cost inflation there. But with the &#x2013; you get above that 2%, 3%, I start feeling better. When you get above 5% it really feels good. But right now, I think you're &#x2013; we're talking about onesies-twosies as this recovers in the second half. That's where my gut lies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that makes sense. I was going to save the European strategy questions for next week, but I did want to ask you about China restructuring. You had called out, I think a year ago, your plans to automate in China and as you're seeing these markets turn and you're not the only company that has done this, does that suggest, it's almost a similar question to Europe, because that suggests as China comes back, which presumably can come back a lot more forcefully than Europe that your margins there in terms of contribution benefits do much better than they have historically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is yes, they should. If we got the restructuring and the automation done properly in the right locations &#x2013; we are profitable, pretty profitable in China already, but it should help us be more profitable and more competitive. So, from my perspective, I think profitability, and we'll talk about this, I think we have room to go in this cycle on profitability. This year, we've got a couple of things we have to overcome and we're working our way through that from the pension standpoint and then also from the performance shares and amortization, but we'll work through that. And then, if we don't add any additional cost, you're going to see us continue to leverage quite nicely. So, I feel good about upward mobility and profitability as we get into that 2014 and 2015 range. And that's what I'm going to tell you. We're going to be setting pretty margins in 2014 and 2015.</p>

          <p>I mean it's hard to measure, because it's not an accounting type of number, but I mean, I look at overall for the total Emerson, you're looking &#x2013; the underlying growth rate was probably in the 1% to 2% range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so, that's how I look at it. I mean, we try to keep track, but it's impossible to say what you didn't ship in a quarter or first six months of the year and what we shipped back. I mean, it's &#x2013; and you just &#x2013; I did not want to create an accounting nightmare out there. So, this is sort of our gut in looking at what we looked at and so on and so forth. So, obviously, we didn't grow at 24% underlying in the quarter for Process, so. But they were still up very solid in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so then you said it's going to be mid-single digits for the year, you are up 24%. I guess your orders are kind of comping flattish right now. Will there be a quarter this year with a tough comp in the back half where Process is negative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now, we don't see it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When I'm talking for the year, I would say that we're going to be up somewhere between, I'm saying 6% to 8%. And right now, we do not see &#x2013; they get real flat. Frank's giving me the detail <mark type="indiscernible" /> (46:15), Frank, they get real flat by that fourth quarter. So, if things &#x2013; if they hit a bump in the fourth quarter, you could have a top-line, underlying negative fixed rate. And then they're going to get currency helping them too.</p>
          <p>So, I would say the one risk I see right now is the fourth quarter. That's why I've been so focused on the 7% to 8%, because we had, as you well know, a very strong fourth quarter as things clicked in, reductions and the sales and stuff like that. And so, I get a little bit nervous about our fourth quarter. From a profit standpoint, growth standpoint it was a phenomenal quarter last year, but I think that would be the one quarter that I would be worried about for Process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the margin there, again a very strong second half. You had stuff that was shipping. We did have kind of an unusual benefit to the margin. I mean it didn't look like it from an incremental perspective. You are still 35% to 40% incremental there in the back half...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...which is pretty damn good, but kind of normal. So, is there any weird comp on the margin that we have to think about in the second half at Process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think Process had a phenomenal, I'm looking at EBIT margin, they had a phenomenal &#x2013; their EBIT margin in the second half was close to 23.5%, if I read this correct. And so, I see &#x2013; yeah. So, what I see going on forward here is that they're going to trend towards &#x2013; they basically from an EBIT standpoint, they were around 20% last year, and I expect them to be slightly higher than that for the whole year. And clearly, they need to make margin &#x2013; good margin in the first half from an EBIT standpoint. And then they're going to struggle from a comparison standpoint in the second half. So, that's why I watch them right now. I would expect them to be down in the second half in EBIT margin and up significantly in the first half.</p>
          <p>The other thing we had in there last year, the best that we can tell, about &#x2013; probably about $40 million of costs that we &#x2013; when we made the decision to protect our customer base at all costs, we spent a lot of money to do that. And we're having to overcome that $40 million this year. And so a lot of that's going to work our way out, but right now, the first half good margins. Second half, I think they'll be down slightly. For the whole year, they'll be up slightly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. And then on the Network Power...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You can do a forecast off that. It's pretty quick. You want me to do it for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the Network Power ramp that you guys are expecting, you said it's going be up year-over-year, but we're obviously starting from a hole, down 100 bps this quarter. I mean you kind of snapped back last year, I think you averaged 30% to 40% sequential incrementals, it was a little volatile around that line. But anyway, I mean is &#x2013; should we think about last year as the appropriate sequential from a margin perspective? Or is it a little more back-end weighted? Or how do we think about the Network?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I expect &#x2013; I want to see these guys, to be honest. From an EBIT standpoint, I want to see them close to 10% in that second quarter. Now, they don't want to hear that, but that's where I want to see them. And then you're going to start moving up from there on a sequential basis like we did last year. So, I mean, if you go 10%, you go 12%; then you're going 14%, 15% type stuff in the fourth quarter. So, that's basically how I expect them to see that unfold. But I really would hope they're going to get close. They may not get quite 10% in the second quarter, but they're going to be closer to 10% than they are 5%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, that's almost 300 basis point increase sequentially?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we just did &#x2013; what did we just do? 7%? 7.2%. So, if you can get up, yeah, I'm hoping to get to above 9% and close to 10%. That's what I'd like to see. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wow. Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We got to get &#x2013; I mean, we &#x2013; I feel that's how we have to move it. We &#x2013; again, our first and second quarter, we have going on right now, and you've been around a long time, you've watched this, we have different segments of our business starting to shift into play here, as I always refer to them; horses. And Climate shift upfront now, I've got Pat's Slides business, Residential, and I've got Network Power systems and Network Power starting to improve, and the sales are going to be down slightly probably in the second quarter still as we rake off, but they're going to start improving, hit positive growth in that third and fourth. But I still feel with cost reductions and the right mix that we should have a good &#x2013; we should have a better second quarter than we had first quarter profitability.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick question. We listened to the Eaton call earlier today and they were sort of talking, bragging, they said the data centers are slow, but they've gotten a lot of orders and a lots of wins. Is there anything going on in the dynamics of that marketplace that Eaton claimed they had a whole bunch of wins now, or is it just the timing and peculiar for certain contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just the timing. I don't think &#x2013; I think the marketplace is fairly stable right now, and I think we &#x2013; I could brag, I've got a couple of wins too. So, I don't &#x2013; I mean, I don't feel worried about it at all. I think right now, we'll present to you guys next year, I think we have a very strong hand and a recovery plan underway. And so, Network Power systems orders are green, they're above the line, and that's a good sign. So, I feel good about where we are right now, we're on a good progression there. And I want to share next week with how we're building this business and how we're going to make this a very strong value creator for our Emerson shareholder going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and with Climate beginning to turn, one of the big complaints we hear from Ingersoll and the people involved in that part of the business is the adverse shift downward to lower share products, that's continuing and not changing. Is there anything going on in the marketplace or anything you have to do to reflect the big change that seems to be going on? And it looks like, it's almost &#x2013; it's semi-permanent at this point in this business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't &#x2013; we don't have to &#x2013; I mean, I don't &#x2013; I mean, we've created the product for the lower-tier, lower performance type of product, but what we have is a pretty broad offering between &#x2013; from the residential up to the commercial to the transportation. So, we have a broader offering capability than something like an IR. So, I don't think that &#x2013; we're still running pretty good levels of profitability, I expect us to run record levels of profitability this year, even with the mix that we're going to &#x2013; I think residential, we're going to be very strong, but you're going to see a good story, where our things are taking off and this &#x2013; the investments we're making and the cost reductions that will show that we will have again a pretty good growth year and coming back. And then, also with that some good profitability.</p>
