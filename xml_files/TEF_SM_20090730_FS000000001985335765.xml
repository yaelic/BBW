      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mar&#xED;a, and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for joining Telef&#xF3;nica's 2009 first half results conference call. Today with me I have Julio Linares, our Chief Operating Officer; Guillermo Ansaldo, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a; Jos&#xE9; Mar&#xED;a &#xC1;lvarez-Pallete, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Latin America; and Matthew Key, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Europe. During the Q&amp;A session you will have the opportunity to ask questions directly to any of them.</p>
          <p>Telef&#xF3;nica has presented today a solid set of results that reinforce our depreciated profile in the industry. Our high diversification, our integrated business model and our proven execution skills back our sound performance in a challenging economic environment. We continue to deliver on management priorities for the year with the second quarter results showing similar underlying trends to those of the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>The strong growth captured in Latin America and the robust performance in Europe continued to push revenue up in organic terms offsetting the lower contribution from Spain. As embedded in our guidance, organic operating cash flow year-on-year growth ramped up notably in the second quarter driven by our discipline in OpEx and CapEx management.</p>
          <p>As a result, we have delivered benchmark profitability levels. Solid operating results fully flow to bottom line with underlying net income posting double-digit growth in the first half of the year. Additionally, our balance sheet remained strong, driving our high financial flexibility. And let me stress that we are on track to meet our 2009 guidance and our growing dividend policy is fully reaffirmed.</p>
          <p>Please turn to Slide number 4 for a quick review of group financial and operating performance. In the first half of the year, we continued to grow solidly in all major metrics in organic terms. Telef&#xF3;nica Latinoam&#xE9;rica continues to be the main growth engine of the group, driving organic sales up more than 1% year-on-year, despite notable drags from regulation and seasonality in the second quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>Operating income before G&amp;A increased in organic terms by 2% and operating income by 4% on an annual basis respectively. Strong cost containment in the current trading environment and higher efficiencies from our scale allowed consolidated OIBDA margin to expand by close to one percentage point year-on-year in organic terms to 39.7%.</p>
          <p>Please notice the negative contribution of Forex across the P&amp;L dragging between one to four percentage points from the underlying performance of revenues, OIBDA and operating income through &#x2013; though improved FX in the second quarter of the year has reduced the negative impact recorded up to March.</p>
          <p>Operating cash flow generation in the first six months of the year exceeded the &#x20AC;8 billion mark, growing nicely 12% year-on-year in organic terms, well ahead of revenue growth.</p>
          <p>Overall, a solid performance on the back of our ability to maintain commercial momentum in the slowing down markets, capturing new customers and extending their usage patterns to new services through bundled offers across markets. We ended June with close to 264 million accesses at the group level or 8% more than a year ago with a strong push in mobile and good traction in mobile broadband services.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 5, January through June 2009 net income topped &#x20AC;3.6 billion, posting an outstanding 11% underlying year-over-year growth. The reported figure was flat year-on-year due to the positive impacts derived from monthly disposals which were recorded in the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>Reported earnings per share reached &#x20AC;0.79 and continued to excel with an underlying year-on-year growth of 14%. Had we excluded the impact from purchase price allocation, EPS would have reached &#x20AC;0.86. And free cash flow per share totaled &#x20AC;0.78 in the first half of the year, recording a notable 7% annual growth.</p>
          <p>Let me now quickly review our progress towards meeting our full-year guidance. Up to June, all metrics we have guided on are fully aligned with 2009 year-end targets. After adjustments for guidance calculation, growth in revenues, operating income before D&amp;A and operating cash flow were 1.7%, 3.2% and 12.1% respectively. CapEx is up to June stood close to &#x20AC;3 billion. We maintained our target of CapEx below &#x20AC;7.5 billion for the whole year, which will be part of the budget expected to be executed towards the end.</p>
          <p>Organic growth exceeding by more than 10 percentage points the growth rate of sales at the group level.  Trends up to June are similar to those recorded in the first quarter. Disciplined management of OpEx and CapEx allowed to limit top line pressure and to pose strong operating cash flow growth both by Telef&#xF3;nica Latinoam&#xE9;rica and Telef&#xF3;nica Europe while maintaining flattish Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a's strong cash generation.  Group OIBDA margin continued to be affect by efficiencies underpinned by further margins expansion in Latin America and Europe and Spain for gross margin.</p>
          <p>Slide number 8 will show our steady focus to flexibly manage OpEx and CapEx in order to maximize cash flow generation without jeopardizing future growth. Group CapEx decreased 10% year-on-year in organic terms and excluding the licenses acquired by Vivo in the second quarter of '08. Most items show reductions. The high investments already made in past years across European markets, broadband, GSM CapEx while lower commercial activity in their traditional fixed-line business also led to reduce CapEx.</p>
          <p>However, we continue to focus on capturing the broadband growth opportunities both in fixed and mobile. As a result, CapEx devoted to these project was up year-on-year, amounting to 28% of the total CapEx in the first half. We are heavily pushing the deployment of 3G with 3G CapEx increasing 50% versus last year's figure. We do retain flexibility to manage CapEx. As of June, CapEx committed is roughly 50% of the annual target.</p>
          <p>We do also keep our flexibility in terms of costs as shown by the 6% year-on-year drop in commercial costs driven by lower handset subsidies, advertising and commission costs in very competitive markets. Interconnection costs are also going down driven by MTR cuts across regions.</p>
          <p>The reign of manageable OpEx partially offset by higher operating cost mainly in Latam derived from fast customer growth, high inflation in some countries and the negative impact from the appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.</p>
          <p>Let's now review the performance in Spain where we continue to focus on sustaining our revenue leadership in the market and maximizing operating cash flow generation. And we are delivering. Operating cash flow reached close to &#x20AC;4.1 billion in the first half, remaining almost flat year-on-year on a comparable basis despite the 6.3% drop in revenues. Underlying trends were stable overall compared to the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Good news is that the second derivative for year-on-year comparable revenues is positive for both wireline and wireless businesses. Top line deterioration slowed down in the second quarter. It's too soon to say this trend will continue, but despite the current macro conditions we are already seeing consumer and business confidence as well as other consumer-related indicators starting to recover.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, an efficient management of OpEx and CapEx is allowing to sustain robust margins and to reduce CapEx without jeopardizing growing businesses prospects. Wireline margins are down just 0.4 percentage points on a comparable basis to stay at 47.3%, while wireless margin went down 0.5 percentage points to 43.9%.</p>
          <p>Going now into the operating metrics in Slide number 10, in the second quarter of the year we recorded sequential improvements in most businesses. Broadband operations are posting a solid growth with mobile broadband making up for lower wireline growth. Wireless data flat rates exceeded 1.2 million or over two times those of June 2008 and 3G devices surpassed 7.5 million or 1.5 times the figure of June 2008. This performance shows not only the Company's strategies they have input, but also our customers' willingness to get new services.</p>
          <p>Wireline broadband, despite lower net adds, we are sustaining our market leadership with an estimated 56% market share. Moreover, effective retail broadband access performance was slightly better in the quarter to show a 6.6% year-on-year decline up to June compared with a 7.2% drop in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>In Pay TV, we did also record an improvement versus the first quarter as we were back to positive net adds in the second quarter while we maintained our market share. The wireless business is also improving as we have led a market growth with close to 101,000 net adds in the quarter versus less than 10,000 net adds in the first quarter, driven by increased commercial efforts and churn remaining stable. This performance is even more impressive in the contract segment where our share of net adds in Q2 of 2009 was close to 40%.</p>
          <p>In mobile number portability we also posted positive results in the contract segment in the quarter versus the negative one last quarter.  Traffic and ARPU declines, despite being slightly more negative than in the previous quarter due to seasonal effects showed a significant improvement compared with the performance recorded between Q4 of '08 and Q1 of '09. Retail fixed line losses also showed a containment versus the previous quarter, and 55% of them were compensated by a net increase in wholesale, which generate revenue for the Company.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to Slide number 11 to see the main drivers behind revenue performance, which is showing a similar trend to previous quarters. On the positive side, IT and data wireline services continued to post very healthy growth both in the quarter and in the first half of 2009. Wireless data connectivity revenues are growing even faster in the second quarter, almost 57% year-on-year. Also it is worth to mention that the stabilization of year-on-year decline of total wireless revenues.</p>
          <p>On the downside, revenues related with customer consumption <mark type="audio gap" /> to go down due to the lower usage patterns across businesses, though excluding the negative impact from the Easter holidays, the performance in Q2 would be pretty similar to the one recorded in the previous quarter. While wireless revenue and wireline was mainly explained by the 20% cut in ULL prices and the reduction in the total assets base. Wireless incoming revenues derived from roaming-in and interconnection were impacted by lower usage and a significant run from mobile termination rate cuts.</p>
          <p>As our core strategy we remain focused on revenue share. Despite customers becoming more price sensitive and players recognize this, we are maintaining our revenue share leadership in the market both in wireline and wireless.</p>
          <p>Finishing with a review of Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a on Slide number 12, let me update you on the numbers of efficiency we shared with you last quarter. Total OpEx plus CapEx over revenues has gone down by 1.6 percentage points over the last 12 months, showing an improvement of 0.3 percentage points versus the figure reported in March of '09.</p>
          <p>In the first half, CapEx went down 30% year-on-year explained mainly by the same drivers as in the first quarter.  Lower investments in GSM, deployment of traditional loops that has mostly halted in line with construction sector and broadband demand that remains lower versus 2008 with subsequent related investments being adjusted.  And fiber rollout has also been limited due to the current economic environment.  These, together with per unit cost reductions benefiting from more purchasing power and vendors adjusting prices to current economic conditions and other initiatives aimed at increasing CapEx efficiency are helping us to deliver CapEx cuts while keeping investing in growth businesses such as mobile broadband.</p>
          <p>On the OpEx side, reductions came to 5.5% year-on-year on a comparable basis due to commercial costs down almost 8%, the expenses for mobile handsets dropping by 17% and interconnection down declining 12%. Finally, personnel expenses are also contributing to the decrease of costs, all last year's head count reduction together with low CPI levels.</p>
          <p>In Slide number 13, we start reviewing there robust performance of our Latin American businesses where we continue to balance growth and profitability. Our total customer base in the region expanded rapidly across markets reaching 161 million accesses in June of 2009. Revenues grew a healthy 7% in organic terms in the January through June period, driven by the increase in mobile service revenue and Internet and Pay TV sales.</p>
          <p>OIBDA growth remained solid with a 14% year-over-year growth rate in organic terms in line with the previous quarter. Our selective commercial approach, focus on quality and efforts to enhance efficiency paved the way for OIBDA margin expansion both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter to 38.9%. Sustained advances in margin across mobile businesses more than offset the impact of a different revenue mix in wireline.</p>
          <p>Mobile OIBDA margin expanded by 670 basis points year-on-year in the first half of 2009. In both profitability and lower CapEx growth is significant, 32% organic, year-on-year increasing operating cash flow which exceeded the &#x20AC;3 billion mark in the first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>Slide 14 outlines the evolution of our Latin American wireless businesses. Our customer base rose 11% year-on-year in a region where penetration rate continues to expand at a healthy rate to 85%, 10 percentage points more than in June of 2008. Q2 '09 net adds increased 7% versus the previous quarter with 29% of the net adds in contract, 10 percentage points up year-on-year. This reflects our selective customer acquisition policy which is focused on revenue share rather than in accesses share.</p>
          <p>Solid net adds were driven by the sustained year-on-year churn reduction on the back of the higher penetration of GSM services that already reaches 85% of our customer base. The positive customer growth drove traffic up 9.3% in the first half, which together with the outstanding evolution of mobile data usage allowed outgoing ARPU to remain pretty flattish versus last year in organic terms.</p>
          <p>Blended organic ARPU dropped 2.9% impacted by the lower mobile termination rates. Mobile service revenues grew more than 14% organically underpinned by the remarkable 37% year-on-year increase in mobile data revenues, which already account for 17% of service revenues. The mobile data growth opportunity will be further exploited along the year with a push in our 3G networks and mobile broadband offerings.</p>
          <p>Let me now share with you how we are advancing in the transformation of Latin American wireline operations. We continue to record an outstanding growth in broadband accesses, leveraging our bundling strategy. During the first half, broadband net adds reached 285,000 to reach over 6.3 million customers. Bundles already represent 51% of our broadband connections and 61% of our fixed line accesses. Moreover, bundles have allowed to limit the decline of our fixed line accesses in the region.</p>
          <p>Pay TV customers went up by more than 24% annually to achieve 1.7 million at the end of June. As a result, new revenue sources like Internet and Pay TV increased their contribution to total revenues with an average rate of 21% in the region, up 2.4 percentage points on last year's figure.</p>
          <p>And to conclude with Latin America, let me highlight the performance in our key markets. Mexico, second quarter commercial results were strong on the back of the new initiatives launched. Gross adds in the second quarter increased 10% compared with Q1 '09 and churn went down sequentially 0.2 percentage points. More importantly, service revenue growth posted an acceleration versus Q1 with an increase of 240 basis points to over 19% year-on-year. With OIBDA margin expansion continued to reach close to 34% in the second quarter, while operating cash flow more than quadrupled last year's figure.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, we will continue to outperform in a very competitive market. After adding 1.2 million net adds in the quarter, outgoing ARPU performed better than in Q1 of '09 with flattish ARPU quarter-on-quarter in local currency. In addition, OIBDA margin expanded by four percentage points in organic terms annually to reach a healthy 30%. Telesp's performance was weak impacted by service quality and network issues in a market where competition is stiff.  Nevertheless, we have already executed an initial plan to enhance network operations and in the coming months we will be anticipating CapEx to enhance our networks and to improve service quality.</p>
          <p>Peru recorded a good growth across businesses with a notable expansion in margins, and finally the results in Argentina and Venezuela continued to be outstanding on the back of strong customer growth, increased usage and lower subsidies.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 17, Telef&#xF3;nica Europe has maintained its walking momentum and delivered a strong financial performance in the first six months of the year against a challenging economic backdrop reflected in an ongoing optimization of usage of traditional mobile voice and data as well as lower roaming activity overall. Total number of customers reached close to 48 million at the end of June '09, an 8.3% year-on-year growth.  I would highlight that mobile contract customers made up 85% of total mobile net additions in the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>Revenue continued to show a healthy foreign exchange growth of 2.2% in the first half. It is worth highlighting non-SMS mobile data performance was an outstanding 34% year-on-year growth in constant currency.</p>
          <p>On the other side, mobile termination rates dragged 0.8% points to growth up to June. Further impacts will come from MTR reductions in the U.K. from the third quarter. There is clear evidence that the rebalancing of our European business portfolio is continuing to bear fruit, especially with the performance of Telef&#xF3;nica O2 Germany, which has been the main contributor to our OIBDA and operating cash flow growth in the year-to-date.</p>
          <p>Operating cash flow saw a significant increase of 17% in organic terms in the first six months of the year, leveraging P&amp;L driving long-term value by satisfying customer demands.</p>
          <p>In the U.K., we continued outperforming competitors in a flat to declining mobile market by ongoing record low levels of churn, income trends and best-ever customer satisfaction scores. The recently awarded Best Network Operator for the second year in a row is again confirming that strategic consistency is key for Telef&#xF3;nica O2 U.K.</p>
          <p>Mobile contract segment was again driving customer growth in the second quarter with a year-on-year increase of 73% in net adds. Now 44% of total customers are contract customers. Simplicity, mobile broadband, high-end devices and new customer propositions around families are sustaining growth in this segment. As anticipated, Telef&#xF3;nica O2 U.K. saw a slowdown in the year-on-year growth with ongoing voice and traditional SMS usage optimization being partially compensated on improved customer basis by strong growth in data fueled by mobile broadband and the usage of Smartphones.</p>
          <p>As a result of the increased commercial activity and the ongoing efficiencies in managing non-commercial costs, OIBDA margin remained stable year-on-year at 25% for the first half of 2009. Operating cash flow growth in the first six months of the year was strong at 20% year-on-year in local currency, reflecting the above mentioned profitability of the business coupled with 18% year-on-year reduction in CapEx.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 19, Telef&#xF3;nica O2 Germany's commercial and financial performance in the second quarter continued to gain traction. New and simpler core product portfolio combined with further churn reduction quarter-on-quarter pushed total net adds to 427,000 in the second quarter compared to 307,000 in the January to March period with a steady increase in contract net adds.</p>
          <p>O2 o was launched last May, changing the rules in the mobile voice market, showing an initial good level of acceptance. And Fonic as of today achieved 81 million customers milestone.</p>
          <p>From a financial standpoint, we have delivered a significant improvement versus our competitors.  Excluding the drag from MTRs since April, year-on-year mobile service revenue growth improved sequentially to 1.2% in Q2. Moreover, data revenues increased a positive contribution to mobile service revenue growth ramping up in the second quarter to over 8% underpinned by our mobile broadband offering, which is backed by the fastest UMTS network of the market. Enhanced commercial efficiencies and higher proportion of gross adds through direct channels are paying off in terms of profitability with a good acceleration in OIBDA growth in the second quarter and sustained margin expansion to close to 26%. As a result, operating cash flow is growing nicely with a positive contribution to group figures, reversing last year's trend.</p>
          <p>Slide 20, financial profile remains strong. Our net financial debt stood at 2 times OIBDA at the end of the first half or at 2.1 times when adding up cash commitments, just slightly above the first quarter's level. This has been mainly due to the appreciation of several currencies increasing the value of our debt &#x20AC;1 million due to the translation effects.</p>
          <p>Please also note that we paid our last dividend in May. This quarter, we have seen &#x2013; we have been able to strengthen our debt maturity profile while reducing our financial expenses. During the second quarter, we have issued close &#x20AC;3.5 billion in bonds with more than seven years average maturity in order to pre-finance debt maturing in 2009 and 2010. This has helped us to extend again our debt average life from 5.9 years in December '08 to 6.6 years as of June 30. To be highlighted also our undrawn bank credit lines have increased more than &#x20AC;800 million from the 7.4 billion total in December '08 to 8.2 billion total as of June 30.</p>
          <p>Our total financial expenses were close to &#x20AC;1.3 billion, equivalent to 5.7% of our average total debt of &#x20AC;45.1 billion without annualizing the foreign exchange results. This is an improvement versus the first quarter when interest expense reached 5.95% of our total debt.</p>
          <p>To recap, we have delivered another set of strong results posting solid organic growth rates as we do leverage our diversification by geographies and businesses. In the current environment, the performance recorded in the second quarter shows similar underlying trends sequentially. We continue to post best-in-class profitability levels with a strong acceleration in organic operating cash flow generation and double-digit growth in underlying net income. We maintain a robust balance sheet and finally we fully reiterate our 2009 guidance and confirm our growing dividend policy.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. And now we are ready to take your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from Tim Boddy from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks for taking my question. You haven't reiterated your 2010 guidance in the presentation.  Could you comment on that? And then my second question would really just be about the trends you're seeing within Spain. Obviously you've mentioned sequential stability, at the same time there's obviously been quite a change in the dynamics of the market with more focus on pre-paid and more success on bundles. Can you hear me? Yeah, I guess so. So if you could comment on whether those changes you see as being cyclical or structural, that would be helpful. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you please repeat your question, because there was another analyst in the line and we couldn't listen properly. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So there were two questions. The first one is really around your guidance for 2010, which you haven't reiterated in the presentation, if you could comment on that. And then secondly in Spain, the increased focus for example on prepaid in the mobile market or the success of the unbundlers. Are these structural changes in the market where people become more price sensitive or do you think these are cyclical factors that can improve with the economy at some point? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Tim, it's Santiago. Let me take the guidance question first. The right time to think medium to long-term will probably be when we meet for the Investor Day in early October. So far, we thought it'd be a good idea to reiterate the year we are talking about, which is 2009 and we have fully confirmed both our numbers guidance for this year and the dividend policy, the growing dividend policy. Just to update on the impressions, what I can tell you is that last time we spoke, we had produced a stress case that has received not insignificant attention of the analyst community. All of it has been mainly critical as to how do we get there. And when we produced it, we said that two things were behind it.</p>
          <p>One was the continuation of a rather severe economic downturn and second the currency effects. I think it's fair to say that despite the fact that we are only one semester down the four semesters remaining through the end of 2010, the economy is no better than it was, although there are some signs that it is improving or stabilizing. And that currencies, especially those of interest most to us like the real in Brazil and sterling have improved to our benefit. So I think we could say that looking into 2010, first we will update you in October and second, beyond the fact that we are only one quarter down and three more quarters of the period into 2010 still have to go, we think that the economy is doing no better and that some currencies are doing slightly better than before.</p>

          <p>Hi, this is Guillermo Ansaldo. Regarding your question in the Spain, what they will look at is our site cyclical trends.  We are seeing, as we commented before, more price sensitivity in some customers, some customers seeking predictability in their expenditure and some others looking for simplicity.</p>
          <p>On the other side, on the large corporates and the mid-corporates are more willing to outsource, so that's some things that are positive to us and some things that we need to adapt our offer. So far we're doing fine, we are defending our leadership and again we do believe that these are cyclical &#x2013; typical cyclical change in behaviors we will revert when the economy reverts.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Two questions, please. First, I'd just like to know what the shape of the quarter was like in Spain? For example was June better than May, which I think there's been some commentary that May was similar to April, which had in turn been better than March. And then secondly, I just wondered if you could talk through the issues in Columbia, I think there was a pickup in bad debt this quarter? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Guillermo Ansaldo again. Regarding the shape of the quarter, when we looked some of the variables, we tend to look very closely is the traffic revenues in mobile for example. That is a good indicator of what was held for the consumption.  And when you take away the seasonality effects, meaning in April the Easter effect and also the number of Labor Days or weekends and so on, the trend is pretty stable between April without these effects, June and May. July is almost the same again. What we are seeing that is improving is the commercial activity in terms of number of new customers adds in the mobile business for example, and July is a pretty strong month. So across the quarter pretty stable, July a little bit better on commercial activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking your question on the Columbia on the wireline side, we have suffered a line drop of 7%, and a significant profit drop joining with decreasing broadband ARPU. But we have been increasing our growth on access by 45%.  That have drove us to have a decrease in revenues of 3.4% on the wireline side. Mainly the reasons behind the ARPU performance or the EBITDA level are high level of down selling from over our customer base, high cannibalization for mobile.  We have also had some impact of bad debt. Let me stress that this is a highly competitive market.</p>
          <p>Action that we are taking to reverse those trends. First we are upgrading our broadband offer. We keep pushing on the bundles, and we will be more aggressive on that side.  We are repositioning our offer and for sure we are reviewing our cost structure. That's on the wireline side.</p>
          <p>On the wireless side the EBITDA performance is very weak. We had decrease of 28.7%, but we have a significant non-recurring impact, namely on &#x2013; a provision on &#x2013; for one of our distributors that went down and the impact of some of the process, the legal process that we are suing &#x2013; that we are having against DTV. Where we to correct those impacts, EBITDA &#x2013; OIBDA margin has been significantly improved. There are also some positive trends on the wireless side in terms of, we have been able to reverse the trend of decreasing on the contract number of customers and we have been slightly gaining customer on the contract side.  And that's going to be paying off in future quarters. So still mixed sign and improving on the wireless side in Colombia.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Two questions for me. First of all if I can go back to the 2010 guidance, which you've abandoned. Are you also uncomfortable with the stress tests?  I mean you've mentioned that the market was uncomfortable with the black box of assumptions behind it. But are you actually uncomfortable with the, for example the 2.1 EPS that you've put out there as the stress test for 2010?</p>
          <p>Secondly I wonder if we could just dig a bit deeper into the CapEx. The 10% volume CapEx year-on-year, to what extent is that a seasonal adjustment into the second half, to what extent is that an adjustment into 2010 and to what extent have you actually reduced CapEx expectations since the beginning of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Terry, this is Santiago.  Let me elaborate a bit more on the 2010 numbers. We do reconfirm that the stress test 2.1 EPS number is still below us and we think it's still doable despite the challenging conditions that we will be above that number. But because things have not improved from the economic front, although marginally as I said, they have on the currency front, we thought it'd be a good time to talk at length about all those things when we meet with a lot of time ahead of us.</p>
          <p>Let me also say that this as you are probably aware, we've been trying to put the case for the investors, and with limited credibility and we think that the purpose of guidance is to uncore expectations for the future and I have not particularly been successful at that. So we've decided to talk it down.  But it is not an abandonment of the stress case, let me stress that clearly.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is Julio Linares.  Regarding your second question about our CapEx, in the first half of the year, our investment slowed down mainly because last year we had very significant investment in 2G and this year it was not necessary, a big one as the last year.  Also because the commercial activity in that business was smaller than last year. And in addition to that we were able to continue doing a significant effort in all the growth opportunities we see in front of us like mobile broadband, ADSL, basically TV.</p>
          <p>In the second half of the year as we our projects today, the CapEx is going to be higher than in the first half of the year.  And because of that we will be very close to the guidance that we provided initially for the whole year.  Regarding CapEx for next year and the following year, we will provide you more information in our conference in October.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Brian . We've brought from the region slightly more than &#x20AC;500 million if my memory doesn't fail me. Not from Venezuela, where as you know we are not &#x2013; we have not been denied but we have been delayed in getting the cash out.  We have filed &#x2013; we had filed in 2008 for an additional dividend repatriation that is still pending. We continue to do our best efforts and continue to keep the slot open to put it in airport light terms.  So dropping the case is not an option for us, we don't think that's the right thing to do. But we have no unusual report.  Elsewhere in the region there is no particular issue, other than those you are already familiar with of being watchful with taxes and not repatriating more cash than absolutely needed, evaluation of regional costs on those.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. Just on Spain, I think Vodafone have said they're now pushing quite hard on the wireline side and taking share. I know you guys announced a DSL price cut to try and control some of the churn. What is the next step to try and arrest this line loss that you have?  And also are your prices trending down, are you purposefully lowering prices in mobile as well?  And maybe a question for Matthew as well on the U.K. business, just about iPhone exclusivity, if we could get an update of whether we still have good visibility on both the 2G and 3G iPhones and to what extent that can be sustained with the exclusive access to the Palm Pre? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Guillermo. David, I'll try to answer your question in Spain. Regarding competition in wireline, in broadband for example, we have a better quarter than the first one with more net gain market share. We acknowledge that Vodafone is doing very well in this market, it's a new entrant here.  We have continued adapting our offer, adding some features on the entry level, but also improving our quality on the top line. ARPU, overall ARPU in broadband in our case, effective ARPU is down 6.6%, I believe which is almost the same number we have in the first quarter, so we are not in a different trend in terms of prices.</p>
          <p>Regarding the product you mentioned and we have some coverage in the press, this is specific product costs, specific needs and is below the 0.5% of our plan. So is roughly 30,000 clients is a very specific niche product. So we are not into a price war, we continue with the approach of having an offer for each type segments and providing the best quality as possible.</p>
          <p>Regarding bank loans, as you have seen, it has been very stable across the year, almost the same number in the second quarter as in the first quarter. They're roughly 50, 55% of losses are compensated by wholesale lines. And this is more due to regulatory changes and the rest has to do with a market that is not growing, as you know and in some cases some competition from direct accesses like cable operators.</p>
          <p>Regarding price in mobile, if you see our ARPU, our voice ARPU, outgoing voice ARPU is pretty stable. So we are not into a price war, I think all operators, what we're trying to do is to find elasticity in our customer base.  That's the main value lever in order to promote revenues. Also we acknowledge that we have some customers looking for predictability as I mentioned before, so we are &#x2013; all operators are trying to foster this bundles with minutes, so we can get some of predictability on the bills. And also some simplicity in some cases with prepaid or SIM only. But again our other rate per minute is pretty stable and our voice outgoing ARPU is pretty stable. As you know in incoming we have &#x2013; we suffer with the MTR cuts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So again can I just double-check on the fixed side, for a long time you've been sustaining at a premium share of additions with superior service, superior products in fixed.  But that does seem to have significantly deteriorated over the last, say three to four quarters. Are we still not at a stage where we're looking to lower prices?  Is &#x2013; are you still pursuing a strategy of quality of service rather than lowering prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, let me clarify that. Obviously what's going on in Spain in the fixed broadband side is the market is not growing. So basically we are taking share of a smaller market. That's due to two things in my opinion. One is the overall economic environment, which is tougher and also the surge of the mobile broadband, which is exploding and from which we're taking a very good share of that market. As an integrator operator that gain is a positive gain.</p>
          <p>One thing that we're tracking very closely is our churn.  Our churn is pretty stable, very stable in fixed broadband. So we are not much concerned &#x2013; we are concerned that the market is not growing that much.  That means we have to continue allotting our offer with promotions like the one we have right now in the summer, where you can buy a six megabit Duo for 19.90 for one year. So this is basically promotional offer for new customers.  But we will continue along those lines and we are tracking our overall ARPU just not to deteriorate our profitability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi David. Let me pick up your Smartphone question. So just let me remind you for a start that our exclusivity on the iPhone in Spain, U.K. and Ireland and we range in Czech as well. I always answer the same on the iPhone, which is we've got a multi-year exclusive deal in each of those countries with Apple. They're extremely happy with us, and we're extremely happy with them.  To talk about specific terms, we've never gone towards and nor have Apple. The other thing I would say in the U.K., you'll recognize that our net connections in the quarter on postpaid is also significantly driven by our record of a lowest ever churn again.</p>
          <p>On the Palm Pre, yeah you're right. We signed an exclusive on that as well, which we're really pleased about across all of our territories in Europe again. We just think it gives a fantastic customer experience. We'll sell it before Christmas, and fundamentally for us we'll give customers the choice of the best devices on the market, if they come into an O2 store or a Movistar store in Spain, they can choose between the iPhone or the Palm Pre.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you expect to be challenged on the exclusivity of both handsets from a competitive perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think virtually every operator in the world would like to have both the iPhone and the Palm Pre.  The good news is that we are the only ones that have got both devices at this moment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, two questions please. First one, possible back to Matthew again. I was just wondering if you could give us some indication on when you plan to put through the termination rate cut in the U.K.?  I understand you've got a bit of discretion about when you implement that, so could you give us a timing on that and then impact on revenues from that, that would be much appreciated.</p>
          <p>And then second question is just regarding EBITDA performance in Brazil. I've been led to believe in the past that EBITDA trends might improve as we've gone peak losses from rolling out some of your TV products. It looks at the moment that that's not happening, so I was wondering if you could give some indication of how EBITDA will trend from here on? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi James, it's Matthew.  Let me pick up your question on U.K. termination rates. We'll put it through in &#x2013; during quarter three and as a very rough guide it will deflate our half two revenue by about 4%, which would be about 2% full year impact for the U.K.  Recognize also there's a flipside in terms of our cost coming down from our competitors also taking down their termination rates, which will happen in second half as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking the question on the OIBDA margin on Telesp, on the wireline business in Brazil, let me stress the fact that during this first half of the year, we have suffered several impact in terms of quality impact, type B network interruptions and also we have had some incidents on some later vendors and hackers attacks.  So we have been impacted by several processes that have been impacting both our revenues in terms of slowing down some commercial offers and also our cost in terms of giving back some revenues to customers and also some fines to none of them.</p>
          <p>Excluding on the non-recurring items, we do see some stabilization on the margins, but it is too soon to say how much time are we going to be taking to reverse the trend during this year, because remember that Brazil-Anatel imposed a restriction to sell broadband in Sao Paulo until those problems are fixed. We submitted the proposal to Anatel a week ago and we are waiting for the response. So let me remind you that with some unexpected events happen at the end of last year and the beginning of that, we are reversing those trends. We do have a positive expectation on the recent transposing claims from customers and in terms of high claiming Anatel in the consumers' defense association. So we are working on that and we keep being committed on investigating the situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Do you &#x2013; can I just ask a quick follow-up question, on the previous answer you mentioned in Spain that you are beginning to see a bit of impact from mobile broadband on the fixed business. So I mean could you quantify that please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me &#x2013; I think that we did some analysis a few months ago and basically we are trying to identify which cases are cannibalizations and which cases are complementarity. And basically, two-thirds were complimentary cases, meaning customers that are getting both. The in other two-thirds are speaking two, one our customers that are dropping the fixed broadbands and the other one fixed, or the total of our customer that instead of buying a fixed broadband, in our opinion are buying the mobile ones. So it is two-thirds complementarity and one-third you can say not complementarity. Our overall numbers shows that this positive value creation for integrated operator with the customer.  And we are combining offers in all segments in order to get customers to buy and test and use both products, which in our view are for different usages and so they are complementary.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. Two questions. I guess, the first question is really at what point do you think that prudence is going to require you to take write-downs on Venezuela where the growth is really driven by inflation and supported by an artificially pegged currency? And the second question is, with <mark type="inaudible" /> being much more aggressive can you expect to see more revenues to revive or should we expect the same pace of slowdown in revenue growth or indeed an accelerated slowdown in revenue growth going forward in your Brazilian mobile assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is Santiago. Let me take the write-down on Venezuelan assets question. We all know that write-downs must be taken for one of two reasons or maybe a combination. One is that the business is not performing well and so its future value is significantly lower than its accounted book value. This is by far not the case in Venezuela, where our business is performing wonderfully, where growth rates are unheard of elsewhere in our regions and probably in many other places.</p>
          <p>So the second reason that might apply is in realignment of the exchange rate as you very rightly mentioned. To the extent that we continue to be able to show that the repatriation is possible, this is the one question that everyone has in mind. We see no reason, nor do our accountants or auditors to change our view or certainly not to take a write-down. It's easy to make the math of what the impact, overall impact would be of any cumulation or realignment, but we would not be certainly willing or forced to do so unless there is a change in the accounting regime of the country or we have clear indications by the local authorities that the currency might or is going to be realigned. Until that happens, we see no reason nor do our auditors to change that significantly, and what we have been doing so far is warn the investment community that as you very rightly point out the sustainability, very long-term of the exchange rate is not an easy thing to hold.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And with regards to mobile in Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Taking the question on Vivo, let me remind you that Vivo year-on-year has been increasing its customer base by roughly 16%. I think the second quarter we have been accelerating our commercial lift there and we have been able to capture more than 1.2 million customers.  The share of Negada, it's close to 20%, our market share is pretty stable above 29%. Churn rate is slightly increased, but pretty stable at 2.7%. Outgoing ARPU has increased in the second quarter by 5.9%. Revenues up 8%, service revenue close to 10% and OIBDA margins 30% in a very, very competitive market and with a significant competitive pressure mainly in Sao Paulo.</p>
          <p>So basically a strong quarter, a strong first half of the year, very sound commercial positioning, very highly focused on revenues, market share and being leader in efficiency and in profitability. We do recognize this is a highly competitive market, but we also recognize that we have a significant challenge and a significant opportunity on these revenues that does seem to be significantly expanding in Brazil.</p>
          <p>So not many changes, I mean, a solid performance, very high level of commercial activity and Vivo is serving the best quality of network and the best offer. That doesn't mean that we don't need to update our offer and we are doing that. But so far it has been a good first half of the year.</p>

          <p>It's very tough to answer that question today, it depends on when that their two commercial campaigns that are the most important in Vivo. One is modest campaign, already happened.

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. I have to questions, please. First on domestic mobile, the regulator has just approved the July passport technician rates to be $0.04 by April 2012. And that is going to provide further room for the smaller players to cut retail prices further and ultimately to reduce the on-net benefit for the last year players. So the question really is whether you see a faster migration to slight flat rates and bundles strategy to face this, and how could this affect RFPs on returns going forward?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on U.K. termination rates, a kind of clarification.  I might have got it wrong, but I think I understood that the impact from termination rates in the second half is going to be four percentage points. With a 10% cut in termination rate, this would imply that 40% of the revenues are incoming revenues, which look too high to me, so if you could clarify that would be great. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, this is Guillermo. Regarding the guide path that was issue yesterday by the Spanish regulator, but you know this is converging to from $0.07 right now to $0.04 in October '11, is a little bit worse than the part that I was expecting, but not much. One thing to note also is that the difference between the guide path that the major operators has and the fourth operators is producing for a 48 asymmetry, 88% asymmetry 24, so we have covert all &#x2013; decide to converge.</p>
          <p>And among the fourth operator, we are the one that is less dependent on MTR provided that we are integrated operator. So we get savings from the fixed business as well. So we do prefer to have a higher OIBDA measure in it than lower, but we are the one that is less exposed to these swings when you take into account also the fixed business. And we will continue using the on-net strategy selectively because as you well mentioned is <mark type="inaudible" /> with the changes, but it is very strong and we will continue working on as I said before to acknowledge the changing customer behavior and trying to sustain our leadership.</p>

          <p>Luis, hi. It's Matthew here. The cut we've actually got to take is 16% to 4.4 pence a minute by the end of the period. So I'm not sure, I think you said you thought the cut was more like 40%, which isn't a number I recognize.  The cut we think is 16% to 4.4.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. I had a question for the Guillermo regarding your TV strategy.  Martinho is almost not growing and the one million target you have for 2010 seems pretty far. So &#x2013; but if you look at some of the other companies in the sector, some of them are doing really well with TV. Can you link that with your fiber rollout as well?  And then a question on spectrum auctions in Mexico and in some of the other countries, can you give us an update on what you expect to have to invest in the next 12 months and tie that up with the buy back so far? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jesus this is Guillermo. Regarding TV, as you have seen the numbers, we are roughly 600,000 customers. We are back in positive net adds this quarter, but the small positive net adds. So the market &#x2013; the TV market is decreasing in Spain a little bit according to our estimation. So we are getting more share, but since the crisis has started this is a market that is not behaving very well. So despite the fact that <mark type="inaudible" /> is not here tomorrow, it will be tough to get those numbers as you mentioned. We will continue improving our market share, but we will depend a lot on how the overall market consumption and conditions evolves.</p>
          <p>Regarding fiber, we have, I think we've mentioned in the past, we have adapted the rollout to be specific with the new market conditions. So we are still passing homes, we are connecting new customers, we are testing services and we have focused a lot on larger clients rather than smaller clients. So we are investing less than we previously thought, when we &#x2013; before this &#x2013; the overall economic crisis.  But we continue working to develop our product base and offering and improving quality. So we have adapted to this cycle.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jesus . Taking your question on the spectrum, let's say that the important process that we are monitoring right now is the Mexican one, in which we are interested in acquiring part of the spectrum. The rules of the process of the ocean has already been issued, but no major news on that in terms of timing. We don't know when that's going to happen. But we are ready to bid for that and the price of that is always going to be compared to the alternative of investing or reinforcing our &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> our network. But yes, we are interested in the spectrum in Mexico, but we don't have a clear picture of what the timing is.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not much new to report on that front, Jesus . When we meet in October, we will update on the Company's shareholder remuneration policy. Let me just re-emphasize once more that we continue to think of ourselves as a shareholder-oriented, shareholder-friendly company and that the rules that we try and apply are first, to get the cash flow; once the cash flow is there, to take care of its uses. Our current policy is one of increasing dividends. You've just heard that our cash flow has been on-line with expectations and with our plans for the first half of the year. But there is not much room to do much, especially now the data has increased a little bit for all the right reasons, which is that currencies have appreciated relative to euro, and that has a beneficial effect on our P&amp;L but has a small detrimental effect on the size of our debt. More on that and about the Company's financial policy on the Investor Day.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. A couple of questions on Germany. Firstly, obviously, you're still getting some good margins <mark type="inaudible" /> in Germany. Last time, you hit 25%; I think you cautioned a bit on the sustainability of that. I wonder how you feel about the margin outlook at this time, going into the second half.</p>
          <p>And secondly, on service revenues in Germany, obviously you went negative in Q2 and there were some comments from one of your competitors, pointing perhaps to a little bit more competition in macro crushes in recent months. So I wondered if we can still see positive revenue for the full year, or if you think we'll remain negative in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Dave, hi, it's Matthew. When I got asked that question last time, I said there were four key drivers of profitability in Germany, which was largely off the foundations that we built last year:  Telef&#xF3;nica Deutschland, number one, with more throughput moving into profit; higher proportion of direct sales versus indirect sales; lower reliance on T-Mobile, as far as our rolling contract is concerned with them; and fourthly, the new propositions that we were starting to launch around things like O2 o. We're obviously really pleased with our performance from a profitability and a commercial momentum perspective in Q2. What I would say, not on margin percentage but in terms of OIBDA growth, recognize that in quarter four last year, I think we delivered about a 40% year-on-year OIBDA growth. So to maintain the pace of OIBDA growth year-on-year is going to become extremely difficult.</p>
          <p>On our negative revenue growth in the quarter, recognize there was significant mobile termination rate count that impacted in the quarter. Once you back that out, actually, our underlying growth was better than Q1. So in Q1, we reported 0.6; in Q2, our underlying is 1.2. So actually, we're moving in a positive accelerating trend. We won't take any more &#x2013; or any additional termination rate cuts for the back end of the year, and obviously hope to increase our commercial momentum off the back of our new propositions. But as to whether we're going to the positive or negative, I wouldn't want to get drawn on that specifically.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. The question's on Latin America. First, with regards to Telesp, as you mentioned earlier, the regulator is presenting its Stage 2 cell broadband products to new customers, so how much of an impact do you think that could have on your top line trends in Q3?</p>
          <p>And second, a more general question on that. When we look at the CapEx of Telesp, you've been extremely efficient in the past few years, but isn't there a case now that broadband is growing significantly, and given what has happened in terms of quality, but you may to increase more than you thought and substantially more than you thought CapEx at Telesp. And the second question has to do with trends in the quarter in Latin America. Maybe if you could give us a sense if, towards the back end of the quarter and July, you see an improvement versus the beginning of the quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks for the question. Taking the first one on the Anatel restriction of Salina broadband in Sao Paulo causing Prefanita because we are not going to be able to add new customers until this restriction is over and before it will have an impact.  But most of the impact we have also been suffering because of these quality concerns because, in fact, we have been reducing commercial activity and that is why the level of broadband connection has been slower because of those of quality issue.  So we have been preparing the network and we are preparing the network for when this restriction is over to be back on the market with strength.  And therefore, I mean, it's hard to quantify; it's going to be highly depending on how long this restriction is going to last.  They ask us for a plan, they gave us 30 days, we present that in 20 days and we are waiting for the response to the auditor reaction.  So it's going to be directly linked to how long this restriction is going to last.</p>
          <p>In terms of the CapEx, in fact, we have been investing significantly in BOE in Telesp in the last years.  CapEx 2007 increased more than 11% compared with 2006 and 2008 increased by more than 20% compared with 2007 figures.  So we have been investing significantly in Telesp in the last years and in fact, most of the issues, most of the incidents that we have been having have been precisely been producing when we were upgrading our network.  So yes, we will be putting additional efforts on Telesp's network, but the impact in terms of CapEx is not going to be highly significant because most of the effort was already being done, so we should not expect significant pick-ups in CapEx in Telesp.</p>
          <p>And in terms of recent trends, as I was telling before in Brazil, this isn't the same; the second quarter in Brazil has been on the mobile side weaker than the first one.  But in terms of commercial activity on the wireline side, from the market as a whole and the sector as a whole has been pretty strong.  In the other parts of the region, it highly depends.  I mean Mexico has been weaker and the other parts of the region have been stronger, so it's mixed, it's too soon to say what the trend is going to be for the second half of the year.  And it is too soon in July to really tell you what the direction's going to take.  But in terms of macroeconomic trends, what we can tell you is that expectation for growth for 2010 has been revised upwards and that some of the trends on the macroeconomic point of view have been improving recovering in the last month.  So we do expect a better outlook for the region in the next quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could just follow up on the Telesp CapEx, should we then expect CapEx levels to come down as you fix these issues?  I'm talking as a percentage of revenue obviously.  Or do you think you still have to continue to invest to good quality and see your broadband customer grow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll keep investing.  But again, you should not expect significant pick-ups with the levels that we have been having in the last year.  What's happened in Telesp was precisely when we were upgrading the network in the upper part of the network in the most modern part of the network.  So you should not expect CapEx or revenues to pick up significantly in the next year, okay?</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon, gentlemen.  Just a couple of questions, the first one in Spain for Diamno.  I was wondering specifically in the months of June and July, you have seen your share of net adds in the Mobile business and Broadband business improving after, I guess, the interest in retention offers that you launched end of May.  And the second one is on CapEx and general terms, just making a graph set for year 2009.  I was wondering if business conditions were to remain tough 2010, do you think that 2009 CapEx levels are sustainable or really maintaining this CapEx level would affect mid-term growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding June and July activity, in terms of Mobile, yes, we are improving in June and July is a good month.  Then in Broadband, in Fixed Broadband, June was better than the previous two and July is okay.  Fixed Broadband is not booming; we are better than the first quarter, but we are not booming.  The market overall is not growing; it's roughly 50% of the net gain that we have aftermarket in '08, so it's not a booming market.  And the changes we are seeing in our net gain share are positive, but they're small changes.  Regarding Wireless, it's a much elastic market and depends a lot more on the offers and the effort that you put in the market and also on the offers and efforts that the competitors are also placing.  So we're having a good June and a good July and this is a very competitive and dynamic market and we continue doing so.</p>
          <p>Regarding CapEx, roughly in the first half of the year, we are investing 7.5% of our revenues.  As you know, as we mentioned before, this tends to increase along the year because <mark type="inaudible" /> seasonality.  The savings are basically &#x2013; they're coming from different sources.  First is the structural change that we finished some of the GSM investment, so that's something that would remain and we're investing more on 3G.  Second, we obviously, sadly, we are investing less on access in the Fixed business because we're having less new lines on copper lines, broadband lines and also TV, so that's a saving that I hope will revert in the future.  And we are getting better prices, leveraging our scale from the group and that's something that will remain and will continue improving.  So I think these levels are sustainable.  Obviously, we have to see what happens next year.  I hope that we can invest more because the market is improving, but if this not happening, we can continue managing this way now.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well in general, regarding CapEx, first of all, as Guillermo said, we really see that we have some benefits, clear benefits from our scale, so today we are able to manage prices quite well, helping us to reduce CapEx.  Second, you have to take into account that 25% of our CapEx is to maintain our business and this is the area where we are doing a higher effort in order to keep this amount of CapEx and to try to use it as much as possible.  75% of our CapEx is related with growth opportunities or transformation opportunities.  Growth opportunities depend a lot on the demand and of course, we're always trying to compensate with investment with the demand, specifically to cover 2G demand in different countries and ADSL demand.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, we continue doing a significant effort in order to drive, to improve our 3 coverage because we believe that this is really needed for future growth and we are evolving permanently our networks to work for the IP network.  So we are not stopping any investment related with growth or transformation and, taking into account that, I think we could manage our capital levels through the right market conditions.</p>
