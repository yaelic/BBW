          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Q1 2010 Intel Corporation Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shanelle and I'll be your coordinator for today. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Kevin Sellers, VP of Investor Relations. Please proceed sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Shanelle, sounds like we had some background information &#x2013; or background noise. Hopefully that was taken care of. Thank you Shanelle. Welcome, everyone to Intel's First Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. I'm here with Paul Otellini, our President and CEO and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>A few important items before we begin. First, we posted our earnings release, CFO commentary and updated financial statements to our investor website, INTC.com for anyone who still needs access to that information. Also if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references we will post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliation to our website as well. Following brief prepared remarks from both Paul and Stacy, we'll be happy to take questions.</p>
          <p>As we begin let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.</p>
          <p>One final note, we've scheduled our annual Investor Day on May 11th at the Intel Headquarters here in Santa Clara. We look forward to seeing many of you here. If any of you need additional information about that event, please contact Intel Investor Relations directly. So with that, let me now hand it over to Paul.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Kevin. A year ago at this time the industry was in the midst of a sharp correction, with many expecting it to continue for an extended period. We saw signals of a bottoming then, and now a year later the industry is nearly fully recovered. At Intel we focused on expanding our Nehalem architecture, getting our 32-nanometer process technology ready and designing alternatives and derivatives of our new Atom processor for many new market segments.</p>
          <p>As a result of that focus we started this year with the best product lineup we've ever had, with leadership in all segments and categories. Demand for these new products has been incredible and as a result Intel achieved a record first quarter in revenue and in operating income. It was notable this quarter that demand for our higher end PC products was particularly strong, which helped improve margins and profitability.</p>
          <p>Our Mobile business set a new revenue record as demand for notebooks continues to be excellent. We're also seeing signs of corporate demand returning, which we believe will continue to improve, given the age of the corporate PC fleet and the compelling ROI that our new generation of servers presents.</p>
          <p>Looking at the supply chain, we continue to see aggregate inventories operating within normal, healthy ranges. Intel's own inventory remains lean. OEM inventories are flat quarter-on-quarter and downstream channel inventories are also within normal ranges. We watch inventory levels and sell-through activity very carefully and we remain comfortable with the supply chain conditions.</p>
          <p>In our manufacturing environment our factory teams have executed the ramp of our 32-nanometer process superbly. We exceeded output expectations with lower costs than originally anticipated and are currently shipping over 50 SKUs on 32-nanometers. 32-nanometers is our fastest ramping process ever, and I'm pleased to note that we are accelerating the ramp of our third and fourth 32-nanometer factories faster than our original plan, such that by early Q4 we will have 4 factories in production on 32-nanometers.</p>
          <p>Lastly, we are excited about our next generation of processors code named SandyBridge. We began volume sampling in Q1, shipping thousands of samples to a broad range of customers and are planning for volume production later this year.</p>
          <p>As we look forward, we are optimistic about the prospects of our business for the rest of 2010 and beyond. Our product portfolio, combined with our excellent execution and the ongoing benefits from restructuring have us positioned for continued profitable growth. This is a great way to begin 2010 and I look forward to seeing many of you here in May for our investor meeting where we will talk in more detail about how we plan to build on this momentum and further exploit the growth opportunities before us.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn the meeting back over to Stacy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Paul. The strength in our business model can be seen in the first quarter results. Record first quarter revenue of $10.3 billion resulted in record first quarter operating profit of $3.4 billion, and cash flow from operations of approximately $4 billion. These better than expected financials resulted from strong sales of our new products. Microprocessor unit sales declined slightly less than seasonal and average selling prices for microprocessors were up slightly quarter-on-quarter. Supply chain inventory levels appear to be healthy after several quarters of replenishment.</p>
          <p>The Mobile Computing segment was particularly strong with customer demand for our new products leading to an increase in mobile microprocessor average selling prices and record mobile microprocessor revenue. First quarter gross margin of 63.4% was higher than our expectation. The factory network performed well in the first quarter, ramping 32-nanometer process technology, controlling cost and reacting quickly to meet customer demand.</p>
          <p>The first quarter demonstrates the impact of our work in improving our cost structure. Spending was 30% of revenue and operating profit of $3.4 billion was 33% of revenue. The number of employees was approximately flat in the first quarter with revenue per employee of $129,000, the third highest in our history.</p>
          <p>Moving to the balance sheet, total cash investments comprised of cash, short-term investments and trading assets ended the quarter at $16.3 billion, $2.4 billion higher than the fourth quarter. Cash flow from operations was approximately $4 billion. During the first quarter we paid nearly $900 million in dividends and purchased over $900 million in capital assets. We are forecasting a revenue decrease for the second quarter that is slightly less than our average seasonal decline, taking the midpoint of our forecast range to $10.2 billion, a 27% increase from the second quarter of 2009. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to increase 1 point from the first quarter to 64%.</p>
          <p>For 2010 we're now forecasting a record annual gross margin with the midpoint of our annual forecast increasing from 61 to 64%. The investments we are making in leading edge process technology, the strength of our product line, a continued focus on our cost structure and strong worldwide demand led to the record results we saw in the first quarter and the record financial results we're forecasting for the second quarter and the year.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it back to Kevin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. We're now going to move to Q&amp;A. We'd like to limit each of you to one question and then a follow up if you have one. So with that, Shanelle, go ahead and please introduce our first questioner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your first question is from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon, guys, and congratulations. I guess Stacy, my first question, Q2 gross margins and full year gross margins, both being guided to about the same level at 64%, help me understand the puts and takes into the back half of the year that prevent you from getting sort of better margin leverage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Let me start, John, by giving you, as you say, kind of a bit of detail about the puts and takes. So first off, you know, first half gross margin a little bit below 64%. We have 64% for the year. So the math gets you to some modest increase in gross margins in the second half over and above the kind of record gross margin levels that we're achieving in the first half.</p>
          <p>As I think about the second half, let's first focus on the core business. I expect that to be slightly positive to gross margin. I think that we'll see increase in volume; that helps a bit. We're going to see a decrease in cost; that helps a bit. Offset a little bit by a decrease in average selling prices, kind of a less than what you normally see decrease in selling prices. Combination of that makes that slightly positive.</p>
          <p>I also expect in the second half of this year to have a little bit lower startup cost environment. So those two things are positive. And then offsetting some of that is an increase in write-offs. We'll be building, as Paul said, the SandyBridge product. That's the new micro-architecture that lands on 32-nanometers. So in the context of tick-tock, that would be the tock. And as you saw with Westmere, the product that we build prior to qualification for sale will be written off. And so we'll see a little bit of an increase in write-offs in the second half of the year and that offsets some of the positives that I mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I guess, guys, Paul, as my follow-up question, you talked about signs of corporate coming back. Is that just in the server business where you guys have had some strength for a couple quarters now? Are you starting to see it on the client side? Could you give us a little bit more detail there? That would be helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we saw it on &#x2013; this is the first quarter we've seen some real signs of PC purchases, corporate SKUs picking back up again. Some of that was wrapped around our new products, the Arrandale notebook products. But some of that was also just even some of our older SKUs that are just kind of classic running corporate SKUs also picked up. And to me that suggests that the average fleet of notebooks is 4 years old out there. The average fleet of desktops is 5 years old. You're getting to the point where, as CIOs are feeling a bit better about their business, it makes economic sense to swap these out just from an ongoing cost of ownership standpoint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. Shanelle, we'll take the next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question is from the line of Glen Yeung with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Could you address a little bit the supply condition that you face, both front end and back end, particularly as you move back into the back half of the year and demand normally picks up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Intel supply?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well with &#x2013; we're ramping the 32-nanometer factories as fast as we can, and faster than we first expected. In fact in the first quarter we ended up shipping more 32-nanometer microprocessors than we first planned, principally driven by demand for those products and I guess the overall health of the business environment in general, which was not planned a quarter ago. Looking forward we'll use a combination of the four 32-nanometer factories and our existing 45-nanometer factories to be able to satisfy, I think, almost any demand scenario you could imagine out there.</p>
          <p>In terms of other people's supply, which is what I thought you were hinting at, at first, I really don't see any fundamental constraints. If I look at all the pieces, the components that go together in terms of memory and screens and batteries and so forth, that would retard the industry's ability to meet almost any demand scenario.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And as my follow-up question, Stacy, maybe for you, at the cash levels that you're at now, you're not that far off of your records which I think were set back in 2004. You know, particularly with no change in CapEx, any thoughts about &#x2013; and I assume cash is going to keep on growing, any thoughts about uses of cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it &#x2013; you're absolutely right. You know, I've &#x2013; the strength of our business, as Paul said, surprised us. The strength of cash generation was also surprising. What you should take from the fact that we've been doing minimal buy backs over the last year is that we're growing our cash balance.</p>
          <p>Frankly, we're looking at some strategic investments and evaluating those in that context. We're growing the cash balances and we're comfortable with the levels of cash we have. The priority in terms of capital structure in terms of returning cash to the shareholders is the dividend. You saw us increase that in Q4. We've had multiple years where we've increased the dividend without fail and just putting it in context, in 2006 I think our dividend per share was about $0.40 per share. Based on the increase we just did, we're at $0.63 per share, so a nice increase in the dividend over time and that continues to be the priority.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Glen. Shanelle, next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question is from the line of Chris Danely with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks guys, great quarter, by the way. Paul, just a question, I guess, on the end markets and demand trends. It sounds like consumer was very strong in Q4 and then corporate kind of kicked in in Q1. When you talk to your customers, what do you expect? What do they expect in terms of demand trends between corporate versus consumers for the rest of the year? And what will be the implications for your business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you're right. Consumer has been the driver I think throughout this cycle, not just in the fourth quarter of last year but I think I talked last year about China in particular in the early part of last year and then the United States and Europe in the second half of last year. I think the overall shift to mobility is one of the mega trends that's out there both in the consumer standpoint and in the corporate standpoint.</p>
          <p>The first quarter and even our first half numbers I think are buoyed by a combination of things. It's a very healthy China and Chinese New Year scenario. I think the new products we've launched have pretty compelling pull at the end market level; simplified branding, lots of really good features, etcetera. And lastly now you're starting to see some corporate PC purchases re-emerge.</p>
          <p>I'm still not going to go out on a limb and our customers certainly aren't going to go out on a limb and say there's a corporate re-fresh snap back coming. I think what we see in this cycle is much more people are buying things to replace older machines because it's just cheaper. And they're doing that on their budgets as they free up a bit more money here and there. I think they'll also make the tradeoffs between PCs and servers and software as they go forward. And right now hardware seems to be doing pretty well in that trade off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then for my follow up for Stacy; so Stacy, if we plug in the gross margin guidance, it sounds like your gross margin in the second half of this year is going to get back to the peak of last year in Q4. Should we consider that 65% a peak number and if you guys have some more higher write-offs at the end of this year, is that a good thing for next year? Could the write-offs be lower next year in the tick tock model?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two very different questions. So you know, we're &#x2013; in terms of the gross margin forecast for this year at 64%, that's an annual record. You're right. We're likely to have some quarters above that. I think you're really asking does it change my long term view of the kind of gross margin profile of the company? You know, if I &#x2013; if you hearken back to a year ago as Paul says, the depth of the recession when we were down in the mid 40s, I articulated this normal range as being between 50 and 60%. I think we spent one quarter in that normal range and we've been above it every quarter since. And this year it looks like we'll be above it every quarter.</p>
          <p>On that question I think I'll defer answering it until we get to the Investor Meeting. I think that's a much better platform for talking about how we're looking at longer term gross margin trends.</p>
          <p>To the more tactical part of that, there will be lots of puts and takes to the H1 '11 gross margin but yes, you would expect to see that the inventory that we write-off prior to qualification for sale assuming that, that ends up being sellable inventory will be a benefit to gross margin where we get into the subsequent quarters. Now that's one of many elements but that element would likely be positive assuming that that qualification goes as we expect it to and as prior qualifications have gone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chris. Shanelle, next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question is from the line of Tim Luke with Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, congratulations on a strong quarter. Paul, in sort of framing the environment you had several strong quarters, very strong fourth quarters, strong first quarter. You're now guiding for a slightly firmer than seasonal second calendar quarter off of a pretty high base. Could you just give us your sense of your visibility on that sort of slightly better than seasonal guide for the second calendar quarter? And what elements are likely to contribute to that? Is it the PC still leading? Is it the servers? Is it all of the above? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's certainly PC driven, Tim. But I think there's other things that are woven into it. We're still in the very steep part of the ramp on 32-nanometers, bringing that into the product line. There is still, as I said earlier, a lot of pull for that product. We were slightly behind, quite frankly, satisfying all the demand that our customers wanted on 32 in the first quarter even though we were producing much more than we first thought. We expect to catch up to that demand in the second quarter on 32-nanometers over the course of the quarters. So I think part of that is just the excitement around the new products on the PC side, number 1.</p>
          <p>Number 2, the Nehalem-EX product which is our new multi-processor product began shipping in the last 2 weeks of the quarter. I think that will have a full quarter effect. So far there is something like 30 systems that have been announced and the receptivity and the pent up demand for that I think is very good. So you've got a combination of those things all driven by new products that I think will give us that better than seasonality picture that we're painting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may for my follow-up, Paul, as you go into the second half of the year, do you think that you'll be able, given a stronger first half to sustain what you might frame as normal seasonality broadly for the second half of the year or do you think, look it's been so strong at the beginning of the year we should be modeling a slightly lower than seasonal up-tick or not given that it sounds like you think corporate is going to come back? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I kind of thought you'd go there on your third round. [Laughter]. And as you can imagine, I'm going to duck it. I don't think it's &#x2013; I think we won't talk about the second half at this point in time except to say that we're putting in place sufficient capacity to handle, as I said earlier virtually any demand scenario you can imagine. We're assuming continued growth in units over the course of the year. We're going to be ramping 32-nanometers as fast as possible. So the only question that we have from a supply standpoint is how much 45 we keep on and what's our assembly test loading capabilities and we'll put some buffer in those to make sure that we've got sufficient capacity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So better than seasonal possibly, just given your focus on capacity rather than...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The mix was a little less rich than Q4. And I think there's a couple things that are going on there. First is that we saw a pickup in what we call the transactional business. This tends to be uni-processor servers based upon the Nehalem parts that are sold by both the channel and our OEM customers, typically into a small to medium business environment. So I think that's a good sign and we hadn't seen that kind of demand profile before in the transactional volume, at least not in the last half of 2009. The fact that that came back was one of the positive signs and is leading us to the guidance we gave for Q2.</p>
          <p>I think we also &#x2013; I think there was some &#x2013; as people moved towards the transition of the older multi-processing line to the newer multi-processing line they basically thinned down their inventories in anticipation of the launch of the EX and now we'll have a full quarter to ship in Q2 with that product line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. As a follow-up you mentioned that corporate demand coming back on the client side. Do you see that as lagging from the server strength you saw in fourth quarter or are they not related?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know, I'd like to think that people are looking at these things with a clear economic eye. And if you look at it with a clear economic eye, you'd refresh the servers first. That builds your infrastructure up, it gives you the fastest return on investment. You probably can squeak out another quarter or so with your PC fleet. And I also think that the corporations are likely to deploy Win 7 so that people have to qualify that and get the SKUs ready and I think that's what's happening now.</p>
          <p>So I don't think it was really a lag effect. I think it was much &#x2013; I tend to think it was much more of a clear view of what the return on investment was versus the cost savings of replacing the PCs that you're now seeing a bit more latitude on.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. A question on notebook mix: has the netbook dynamic slowed down or saturated as a percentage of total mobile?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it depends on the granularity of the question. If you look in terms of the total year last year and our view for the total year this year, we really don't see a change. I think we suggested that netbooks seem to be settling out at 20% of the mobile form factors and on an annual basis that looks to be about right and I would expect pretty significant year-on-year growth in the netbook business.</p>
          <p>I think that netbooks in general have become &#x2013; they are by definition a consumer purchase. There is no corporate netbook market that we found and it was pretty robust in the fourth quarter. You had a lot of new entrants coming into the marketplace, large companies really coming in for the first time and I think that seasonality plus maybe a bit of the overhang from a number of players coming in in the fourth quarter is what we saw in Q1 where Atom was down a bit more than what we would normally see as seasonal.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And as a follow-up, what's the company position with tablets? It seems to be a big category &#x2013; emerging category. What's your strategy there? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think that, that's a great question, Hans. I think at this point I view tablets much like I viewed netbooks two years ago, which is that was a new category then that was market expansive. I think tablets will also be a new category that will likely be market expansive.</p>
          <p>If I look forward over the course of the year, particularly at COMPUTEX coming up in the first week of June, we have a lot of our customers announcing new tablet form factors around Atom around Moorestown versions of Atom. And there's support for a multitude of operating environments. You'll see products on Android, on Windows 7 and on Migo.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. The client business was flat and I think if you look at at least a couple of the larger North American PC OEMs, it seems like the forecast for their client business is to decline a bit in the first calendar quarter. So I guess, you know, there's different ways to potentially explain that. Maybe they see up side like you guys did, maybe they're building or replenishing inventories or there's another set of OEMs that are perhaps benefiting from the growth dynamics. Can you share with us your thoughts about how we might think about that, that difference in expectations? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't know that I can help you a lot there except to say that we were down. So I mean, I'm not sure that I followed how much their client business is forecasted to be down versus what you guys are doing. But our business was down. It was better than seasonal but down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But on a unit &#x2013; if I can just interject &#x2013; on a unit basis, Mark, it was probably closer to &#x2013; it was slightly better than seasonal but not dramatically better. The benefit we really saw in the first quarter was in the mix and the pricing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Great. Congratulations on a terrific quarter. Thanks so much for taking the question. I guess first question, last quarter you were good enough to break out for us the change in unit inventory versus the change in dollar inventory. I was wondering if you could do that again for us this quarter. You said you wanted to build some inventory but you weren't really able to build much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'll be happy to help there, Jim. Yes, the way you characterized it is the way I see it. Because of the increases we saw over the course of the quarter in demand on the new mobile platform Arrandale I wasn't able to get as much inventory in place as I hoped. If you look at it between dollars and units what you see is units are up a bit more than dollars but you know, still not as much as I'd want as we kind of move into the second quarter and based on the strength that we're seeing and the ramp of these new products.</p>
          <p>If you de-construct the inventory between the processes, what we saw is more than 100% of the increase of inventory and more than 100% of the increase in units was on 32-nanometers, so we got a little bit in place there and everything else was down. And as I think about Q2, you know, my hope is that I can build some inventory into the second quarter, you know, in anticipation of a second half that's higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And for my follow-up, you guys kind of started out the year believing that we were looking at a mid-teens PC kind of year. If I put any kind of close to normal seasonality in your revenue in the back half of the year, you'd be up well into the 20s. It certainly doesn't seem like you're out shipping demand because there's nowhere in the supply chain that's building any inventory. So it safe to say that your expectations then for kind of the full year PC number have just come up a bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think so. Again, everyone still wonders what the shape of this year looks like. And I said earlier when I ducked Tim's question, that I would reserve judgment on that. But I think versus a month ago, I mean, a quarter ago, how could we have not taken our expectations up a bit for the year?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks so much, and congrats on a great quarter again. Just a first question, you talked about accelerating the ramp of the third and fourth 32-nanometer factories. Can you talk a little about the impact on capacity, to your overall capacity there and when we can expect that to be online?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They'll both &#x2013; all four factories will be on line by early Q4. There's a ramp schedule that we're not making public on each specific factory, and we pulled up the schedule a bit on the last two of the network. There's really no change in our spending, our CapEx spending as a result of that. These things were all being planned to be equipped and so forth. What we've done here is, based upon the learnings and the yields we're seeing in the first two factories, have had higher confidence to be able to ramp to high volume faster on the next two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. Okay. No, that's helpful. And then for my follow-up, I just wanted to talk real quick about mix and ASPs here. In the first quarter it looks like that we saw some good news, surprise just on higher ASPs. In the second quarter you're guiding a little bit of a negative impact on lower platform ASPs. Can you talk about what's going on there, and perhaps maybe, factor in the mix of the Core i3, i5, and i7 that we see today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I'll take a shot at it. Yeah, the surprise for us in Q1 was the strength of the new products as we had articulated a quarter ago. The way that we're loading the factories is we're bringing out the high end of the product line first, and so I think what we saw in Q1 was a pretty rich mix and I expect as we go through the year it'll be a more normal mix. But also, you have to keep it against the contextual background of, I'm now expecting 2010 to be a year where ASPs come down some. But less than what the long-term model would suggest. So a fairly benign pricing environment overall, but they'll come down some from where we were in the first quarter is my prediction.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Any, just care to offer any comment in terms of maybe of a mix up in terms of Core i3 and i5 and i7?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in general, as I said earlier, we're seeing great reception to the new Core products. And even within them, the, certainly the first quarter the mix up to Core i5 versus i3 was very solid. Now as we bring on more capacity, you get a more natural mix. I think also you'll see our customers move towards taking those processors into lower price points, price points where you'd see Pentium notebooks today over the course of the year by tweaking the configurations a bit: maybe not using discrete graphics as much, because the graphics on the Arrandale platform are so good; maybe less memory, as Win 7 runs pretty well on 2 gig, etcetera. That will allow them to mix the SKUs, keep the processor mix pretty good and get a higher volume set of price points.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you very much. Stacy, can I just go back to the issue of inventory? I know you say you want to build inventory again in Q2, but earlier in your remarks you described channel inventory as healthy. Is it possible for to you quantify what that means and also put it in a bit of context so that I &#x2013; we can get a handle on what you mean as healthy channel inventory?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, it, let me careful we don't mix the two things. My answer to, I think it was Jim's question, was in regards to our inventory, our component inventory. The channel inventory comments that Paul and I both made were in regards to the inventory that we see downstream from us. It's the inventory held at the multi-nationals, the retailers, the ODMs that manufacturer, yeah, our own distributors.</p>
          <p>So that downstream inventory when we look at it, it looks healthy it looks appropriate to demand levels. Our internal inventories are lower than I'd like, particularly on the new 32-nanometer products. We were tight in Q1. You know, we would normally want to buffer that transition a bit by having some inventory in place, particularly as we're going into a higher selling season in the back half, it's prudent to get some inventory in place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of China, I mean, what I really wanted to know was if there's a way you can quantify that so, in terms of weeks or days? I mean is there any way for us to get a proper handle on that downstream operation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've &#x2013; we don't have insight into everything, which is why you see us hesitating here. In terms of the microprocessor inventories that are in our channel and in our OEM customers that we have visibility into, we see nothing out of line and everything is consistent with the kind of build plans and transition plans over the next couple of quarters. We also monitor the shipping lanes, those kinds of things and what comes out of Taiwan on boats versus air. Again, we don't really see any fundamental shift there, nor do we see anything that's out of line on the assumption that there's growth in units over the course of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. My follow-up question is on service. I wanted to ask you I mean, when I look at service, the one key thing, and if you look at the value you're delivering with Westmere EP, Nehalem EX, and the fact that some CIOs are talking about replacing many of their old servers with one. What is your sense of the size of this market going forward? I mean, you're delivering so much ROI to your customers, do we have a situation where the market itself will shrink and Intel doesn't get enough runway for growth in the business given the value you're delivering to your customers? Any sense of how we can conceptualize?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we haven't even gotten close to finding a fundamental limiter on that. There's a number of things going on. The move to cloud we think is very good. Not everything will go to cloud, but the shift to cloud-based services is good for Intel. The shift to virtualization is good for Intel. If you look, plot out and we'll do this at the analyst meeting in much more detail. But, if you plot out the growth in data traffic and network traffic and the kinds of things that modern servers are doing, that growth curve is faster than the refresh rate for old versus new equipment, and we see a very robust scenario for servers going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just one more on ASPs for the full year. So you've basically cut the ASP impact on gross margins from your previous guidance by about half. I think before it was about 2 to 3 points to the negative, now it's about 1.5 points. Can you give just a little more color on what's driving that differential? I mean, is it just continued uptake of 32-nanometers faster than you thought? Is it more servers, more corporate NAND Flash, less Atom.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, yeah, a quarter ago I was articulating that I expected 2 to 3 points from 2009 to 2010 based on ASPs coming down. Based on the strength we saw in Q1 and the take up of new products, we've cut that impact in half. And it's really those 2 things. It's the strength we saw in Q1 and the take up of the new products has exceeded my expectations and I think some of that strength will continue through the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And for my follow-up, just one quick question on OpEx. I know you took that up a little bit. Looks like you took R&amp;D up about $200 million, SG&amp;A up about $400 million at the midpoint of your guidance. Can you give us a little bit more color on what's driving the increases in both of those, and in particular the greater increase in SG&amp;A versus R&amp;D?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me take a different shot at the explanation. I think it gets you there. If you look at it from the prior forecast, we're up about $600 million cycle on cycle. About half of that is profit and revenue-dependent spending. And what you take from that is, as we've seen the Q1 results have now increased our expectations for the year, I'm expecting more revenue, more profits that's driving &#x2013; that's driving those two line items. The revenue dependent spending is almost all marketing. It's Intel Inside, so it gets categorized as marketing spending and the profit-dependent spending gets split across the different groups of the company.</p>
          <p>Behind that &#x2013; so it's about half the increase. Behind that we have some incremental investments that we're making. Those are predominantly R&amp;D projects. Again as our confidence in the year has gone up, there are some projects that we're launching there.</p>
          <p>And then the third element behind that is, again, an increase to marketing. And we've gone through and redesigned some of our customer programs and in the process of redesigning those programs, they will be categorized going forward as marketing expense. So that's the other element there.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, very much. Paul, for the new product launcher, you brought up Nehalem EX. Are you seeing signs that MP server, chip volumes are picking up. Would you expect these to grow faster than the dual processor does over the next couple of quarters with the Nehalem brand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think so. I think that the value proposition is different in different markets. Right? So I would expect that the dual processor products will continue to be &#x2013; let me say the topography of choice for data center build out for the big internet portal guys. You can imagine who I'm talking about. The MP servers configurations tend to be much more for, I think you'll see that much more prevalent in corporate environment and SAP configurations and people that want to run multiple applications in a virtual mode there. So I really think they're addressing different market segments as they ramp up. But we love both of our children here. And I don't think I see a difference in the curves between the two of them.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. My follow-up question, completely different topic. Intel Capital, you've got an improving overall environment. Should we start to see gains from equity investments over the next couple years? And can you give us an idea of the pipeline of private investments that might be getting ready for IPOs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I &#x2013; for obvious reasons I won't answer the second part of that question. That's their job to tell you when they're thinking about an IPO. But I'd say generally the answer to your question is, yes. I think the improvement we've seen over the last few quarters has really been a decrease in the rate in which investments are being impaired. As I think forward over the next year, yeah, I'd expect to start to see some gains and some exits coming in. Nothing on the radar for Q2, but looking out longer term, that would be my expectation.</p>
          <p>We invest in Intel Capital portfolio companies for two reasons. One is to get strategic benefit to the overall business. The other is to get a return and the expectation is that we're doing both of those things.</p>

          <p>Your next question is from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys, congrats on the strong quarter. Earlier you were kind enough to give us what normal seasonality is in the Data Center business for the first quarter. Can you let us know what it is for the remainder of the year, or just kind of on a normal basis and how Nehalem might impact that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Ross, I don't have that number at my fingertips. So let's put this in the category of just taking a wild-ass guess having run Intel IT &#x2013; so Paul's cringing. I think that you probably see that the way that IT budgets work, you'll likely see spending on server infrastructure that's probably stronger in Q4 than it is any other quarter. You probably see the kind of reduction we saw this quarter where it's down some. It's going to be somewhat back-end loaded. To get the quarter-by-quarter split, I don't have that number at my finger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then shifting gears a little bit over to the inventory side, now that you're manufacturing cycle times are about half of what they were and the hubbed amount of your business is larger than it's been, what impact does that have on the amount of inventory you actually need to have to service demand, and can you frankly just operate leaner than you've ever done in the past?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, keep in mind those two things you've mentioned will move in opposite directions, right? So the hub, what it does is you will tend to see less overall inventory through the supply chain, but more of that inventory on my books because I'm holding that at the customer location. The reduction in cycle times, obviously allows us to operate at leaner levels. So net of those two things, I think you're going to continue to see us like we have been over the last four or five quarters operating at pretty efficient inventory levels.</p>
          <p>I want to caution you though, that won't preclude the need to get inventory in place when we're going through big product transitions or process technology transitions. It's the prudent thing to do to get inventory in place and that's what we tried to do in Q1 and what we'll try again to do in Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

          <p>Your next question is from the line of Sumit Dhanda with Bank of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. A couple of questions. Stacy or Paul, you've done a great job with ASPs the last couple of quarters, but at the same time, you're expecting some kind of a modest decline in the back half of the year. I guess I'm curious as to why you think that will be the case given your comments, Paul, of signs of a corporate recovery, servers should be seasonally strong in the back half of the year. Is it just Core i3 being a bigger part of the mix? Can you help us understand what the thought process there is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's &#x2013; it really is the function of we had a very rich mix in Q4 and Q1 as we were launching the first products on 32-nanometer. I expect that to be a more normal mix as we progress through the year. And again, that's against a backdrop of an ASP that's down some, but less than it's normally down. So it is as simple as that.</p>
          <p>If you zoom way out on this, what we see over time is that Moore's law allows us to bring new features, bring our costs down. We also bring prices down over time. That drives elasticity of demand, you see it in the consumer segment of the market, you see it in emerging markets. It ends up being an important growth driver for the business. So against that backdrop, we're having a pretty benign pricing environment this year based on the strength of our product portfolio is how I'd characterize it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then Stacy, a second follow up for you. Any chance you could take a shot at quantifying the impact of the inventory write-offs you expect ahead of SandyBridge? Is it that same 2, 3 point impact you typically see, for example, when you transitioned to 32-nanometers last year. Is it some different amount we should be thinking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm not &#x2013; I'm not going to get to that level of granularity because we haven't given specific quarter-by-quarter forecasts. It will be &#x2013; I expect it to be a little bit of a negative impact in the back half of this year but frankly none of the elements that I was articulating were in the magnitude of three to four points. So I'm not expecting it to be, you know, that big.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you think it's a Q3 as opposed to a Q4 phenomenon? Or you can't tell us that yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a back half phenomenon. It actually probably will be across both quarters based on where we are in the cycle for that product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sir. And your next question is from the line of Doug Freedman with Broadpoint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks guys for getting me in and I'll see if I can follow instructions here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, Doug.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Stacy, a year ago you talked about the mix of product really being important to margins. Can you talk about Atom and Atom chipset margins compared with Quad Core and if that whole ratio calculation you put up for us, if that's played out the way you expected or if there's been any derivation from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on that one, yeah I'll show you in much more detail next month when we're together for the investor meeting. But yeah, directionally it's played out exactly as I had anticipated. Costs came down; it's a very healthy product margin. I showed a comparison of Atom to the Core &#x2013; existing Core business excluding Atom and to the embedded business and showed that it got into a fairly similar range. That's how it has played out. From a product margin percent standpoint, which I think is how you asked the question, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And then sort of as my follow-up, sticking with Atom as the theme, there is some concern in the market place and it's relevant from your numbers in Q1 that Atom didn't really sell as well in the quarter. Earlier in the call you guys mentioned that it was related to seasonality and the over-exuberance in the marketplace, too many new entrants. Is there something you can do with Atom pricing to reinvigorate those sales? Is that something that you would look to do? Or what is your strategy should Atom not sell as well as expected throughout the balance of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's Atom in netbooks and there's Atom going into other products. And I think your asking a question &#x2013; but Atom going into other products is design cycle and you'll see other kinds of products with Atom in it over the course of this year. Someone asked a question earlier about tablets and you know, there's rumor out there about certain consumer electronics equipment and phones and things like that. That's not really the heart of the question.</p>
          <p>The heart of the question is Netbooks, and as I said earlier, I think there'll still be significant growth in the Netbook business year-over-year. I think that there are &#x2013; rather than pricing, I think we would look to features and integration as the technical knobs we would twist here. The next innovation coming out on Atom is dual core, which comes out in the second quarter. And so that will ramp for the holiday season this year and I think that will be a very attractive product. And then in early Q1 we have another innovation at much lower power, integration at much lower power product coming out that's a derivative of it for fan-less netbook business. So you'll see us use technology to make the platform a bit better each time or to integrate more features and make it cheaper.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, I'll just ask one long question instead of two questions. And if you can give us an update on wireless display, how the adoption has been? I think the current price point is, for the SKUs is 900. Do you see that coming to 600, 7 range by the back to school? And also how the &#x2013; what the comparative response has been from the AMD and NVIDIA on this product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can't comment on the price points as our customers set those price points. What I can say is that the amount of design activity &#x2013; first of all, WiDi product has been very well received. It's selling through the channel nicely at the Best Buy, which is where it really is semi-exclusive right now. Over the course of the year you'll see many more SKUs and many more distribution &#x2013; distributors picking up the product. And I think it will be a must-have feature for holiday timeframe. And it may come down in price a bit. But generally speaking I think it's going to get broader before it gets a lot cheaper.</p>
          <p>In terms of other vendors trying to do similar technology, I'd say good luck. This took us quite a while to be able to develop, to be able to get this done. We have a roadmap with features that will make &#x2013; that will take WiDi better over time, that add more content protection, Blu-ray support, etcetera, etcetera. So this is one where being out early, doing a lot of the work at the platform level, the software level and then having a feature roadmap I think really is what makes it compelling.</p>
