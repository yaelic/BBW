          <p>Good morning. Salam Aleikum. Bonjour, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to MTN Group's Interim Results Presentations for the six months ended June 2010.</p>
          <p>I'm the executive for Group Corporate Affairs, and I'll be the program director this morning. And so my task is to extend a very warm welcome to all of you on behalf of both the Group board and the executive committee. And also to introduce our panelists, who I'm sure you're very familiar with. Mr. Phuthuma Nhleko, our Group President and CEO; Mr. Sifiso Dabengwa, on the other side, who is our Chief Operating Officer; and Mr. Nazir Patel, our Group Finance Director. And I will also try to explain the structure of the morning.</p>
          <p>In the audience, we also welcome some of our shareholders, analysts, members of the media, and members of our board, both from MTN South Africa and the Group. And of course my colleagues at the front here in the executive team who drive the business strategy.</p>
          <p>We'd also like to acknowledge our Senior Vice President, Mr. Christian De Faria who is here. As you know Christian used to be the VP of our WECA region. Our acting VP in the WECA region Mr. Ahmad Farroukh, and Mr. Jamal Ramadan, our VP in the MENA region, will both be watching from various webcasts in their regional bases. And so welcome to them as well.</p>
          <p>And of course, last but not least, ladies and gentlemen, we also welcoming the audience, the management and staff of both MTN Group and MTN South Africa. And a warm greeting to the rest of our staff in the 20 other operations without whose efforts MTN would not be the success that it is. They also will be watching through various electronic media that we've set up.</p>
          <p>The presentation will last approximately one and a half hours, and the agenda, as usual, is quite straightforward. Our Group President and CEO, Mr. Nhleko, will  present the Group's strategic and operational overview. He will be followed by the Group Financial Officer, Mr. Nazir Patel, who will deliver the financials. And Phuthuma will then complete the presentations with some concluding remarks. After the presentation you will be invited to ask questions, if you have any and our staff members will give you roaming microphones to do that.</p>
          <p>And so at this point, I'd like to invite you to please turn off your cell phones or put them on silent. And when we have completed the presentation, of course, as usual, we'd like to invite you for a little snack outside.</p>
          <p>And so without much ado, I'd like to invite our Group President to come and present the results. Phuthuma?</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. And just to echo Nozipho's welcome.</p>
          <p>And it's really an honor always to present to you our results, and of course, to welcome all the MTNers that are on webcast. And hopefully this is a reflection of what they've been doing in the last six months. So thank you very much for the time you've made to come to MTN.</p>
          <p>Let me begin the results by giving just the trading environment certainly as we see it. And I do think it's characterized by a number of issues.</p>
          <p>Firstly, we do believe that, of course, there has been the financial crisis and then the economic slowdown. But we would like to believe that we are at a phase where we're starting to see some stability in that. And hopefully, it will not be a double-dip recession, as other people have predicted. But for now, we seem to have seen the worst.</p>
          <p>We also have a scenario certainly in our footprint where there is fairly intense competition. There have been a lot of new entrants, strong entrants, which obviously brings also some other pressures. But we certainly believe that MTN is well positioned to weather that.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, we have a increasingly tough regulatory environment. I think the regulators are flexing their muscle and showing more teeth. Again, we do believe that we are arranged as a group in a manner that allows us to anticipate and preempt certain actions. And, of course, as we penetrate into the last segments of the markets, we are seeing decline in ARPU, which is what is expected.</p>
          <p>Most probably, the most impactful feature of these results would be the exchange rates, in the sense that we are a rand-based company, notwithstanding over 70% of our earnings in other currencies. Because of rand reporting, we do see that volatility.</p>
          <p>So I think, by and large, that's really the environment in which we find ourselves.</p>
          <p>From time to time, we, of course, do a review and just ensure that the fundamentals that are important &#x2013; or pillars, if you like, to the vision of the Group &#x2013; remain sound. And we've shown this slide I think quite consistently over a number of years, to say that the whole issue of convergence operationally, over time, is something that will be there. We need to look at. We need to continuously leverage the footprint that we have.</p>
          <p>And, of course, this business is in many respect about intellectual capacity, so we guard that fairly jealously. And I've always believed that there is going to be consolidation in this industry. And I think we are starting to see that. I think you just need to look at the last sort of six to nine months, and you'll realize that there is consolidation, as people find out that unless you've got meaningful scale, it becomes fairly, fairly difficult to compete.</p>
          <p>And then I think the blocks at the bottom there are really just saying you've got the pillars, the three pillars, but really what are the cornerstones? And the cornerstones are all those aspects of our business that we constantly review to ensure that we remain fairly competitive.</p>
          <p>Another way of representing this is through what I regard as most probably six fairly important cornerstones. Given the high penetration, increased competition, fairly mature markets, the question is how do we continue to differentiate ourselves from the competition?</p>
          <p>We certainly believe that quality of service &#x2013; and I'm talking first and foremost the network service, network quality &#x2013; is fairly crucial. We've invested significant amount of money over the years to improve that. And I think that is a marked difference in most of our major operations.</p>
          <p>Distribution is certainly going to be a battleground in virtually all of the countries. Again, we've spent a great deal of time and money in this area, in South Africa and Nigeria, in particular, in recent years. We've invested a lot that has ensured that we have a fairly robust and competitive distribution network. And I think that is going to be a fairly important, telling future going forward.</p>
          <p>Segmentation, again, we've spent a great deal of time and money with consultants and ourselves to try and have a far finer way of defining our markets, and therefore ensuring a much higher yield in various segments of the market. And this is really something that's become virtually ingrained in our budgeting process and everything else that we do.</p>
          <p>Fourthly, experienced people. This is at all levels, but most importantly, at customer-interfacing level. We try to ensure that we improve the quality of people there.</p>
          <p>And then the whole issue of innovation is important. MTN, not being part of the larger global groups, has to a lot of homegrown innovation. And I think there is a lot of work that's been done in this area, whether it's roaming, MobileMoney, MTN Zone, and so on. I mean all of these are internally generated products that hopefully will ensure that we are competitive.</p>
          <p>And then last and not least, I think brand defines us in many respects. We recently spent quite an amount of time and effort and money on the FIFA World Cup. We certainly hope that helps to advance our position as a significant global brand and a brand of choice. So in short, all I'm saying is, given the stage and phase where we find ourselves in this industry, this has become central. Not to say that it wasn't important in the past, but this has become a central piece of how we're going to differentiate ourselves.</p>
          <p>And looking at the results, the highlights, again, just to say that the big wind here is always currency. And not to sort of give our view on where the rand should be. I don't think that's our job. Suffice to say that in the last six months, we've had a very, very heavy headwind as opposed to a tailwind.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding that, the subs are up since December by 11.4% to almost 139 million subs. EBITDA margin is up 0.5 to 43.3. I know this is not the 45 that I've always said that we're going to try and target. But nevertheless, we think we're still moving in the right direction. Iran and South Africa contributed quite a lot to helping us push up that margin, and we'll get into that detail a little bit more.</p>
          <p>And of course, adjusted headline earnings per share up over 20% to 438 cents. And some of those things obviously are also impacted by currency exposure and what we have done to try and mitigate that. And I think Nazir will deal with that under the financial section.</p>
          <p>Then we have decided that MTN is now in a position to go into paying an interim dividend, effectively as a continuous policy going forward, which we haven't done in the past. And that interim dividend would be 151 cents per share.</p>
          <p>Of course, we do have the leisure of paying that dividend because &#x2013; and going on to that policy, shall I say &#x2013; because of the much stronger cash flows we're now generating in the Group. And if you look at the free cash flow on a comparative period basis, it's up almost 164% to R6.8 billion.</p>
          <p>And lastly, let me just say, I think if you just take that very wide overview of the Group, with net debts very low &#x2013; I remember a few years ago we stood here after Investcom acquisition, and we said it would be brought down to &#x2013; I think it was 0.4 net debt-to-EBITDA. I mean we're now down to 0.1 or 0.11. So I think at least that does say that the decisions that have been taken in the last few years as far as the capital structure have borne themselves out.</p>
          <p>Getting more into the operational matters, nothing has changed radically as far as the split of the subscribers in a geographic sense of the word. We've always say that we would have liked to have had a third in the SEA region, a third in the MENA region, and a third in the WECA region. But of course I think with very strong performance of Nigeria and Ghana, in particular, we are getting close to 50% of our subs coming from the WECA region.</p>
          <p>Revenue &#x2013; again, because of the currency headwinds, you will see that the contribution of revenue from the operations outside South Africa has been a bit more muted compared to the same period in 2009. Of course, revenue itself on a Group-wide basis is almost flat, precisely because of the currency.</p>
          <p>EBITDA, I think, reflects very much the same sort of pattern, notwithstanding 70% of the earnings being non-South-African or non-rand earnings. And as I indicated earlier, we're very pleased with the margin up-tick that we have seen in the last six months as a result of the strong EBITDA pick-up in South Africa and Iran.</p>
          <p>Nigeria, of course, is now effectively the largest contributor to the Group. We have increased market share in Nigeria to 51%. The distribution reconstruction that took place a number of years ago in Nigeria, where we organized really on a regional basis, with key dealers in those areas, and having the whole incentive structure being revised and reviewed, has certainly borne much fruit. And as I say, with 51% market share, coming up from one stage where I think about 45 or 46, I think is testimony to that.</p>
          <p>Of course, ARPU has declined unexpectedly. I still do think that if you look at Nigeria over the last five years, at a ARPU of I think about $11, it's still much, much stronger than any of us would have anticipated. Marginal ARPU is now down to $7 in Nigeria, and of course, we've had the interconnect decline by a few naira.</p>
          <p>I think all in all, operation has gone very well. SIM registration similar to South Africa. Not as cumbersome, in terms of things that have to be fulfilled. But suffice to say that this SIM registration requirement is something that has taken off in virtually all the operations.</p>
          <p>Coming back to Nigeria, 3G rollouts, we have done almost 300 sites. And I must say the smart phone end in Nigeria has taken off. I don't remember exactly how many BlackBerries now, but I think over 35,000 or something like that. So we're finding that because of the poor fixed-line connectivity, I think in the fullness of time, the 3G roll-out in Nigeria and the take-up in data in the high-end of the market will justify that.</p>
          <p>We continue to provide a lot of self-provide on transmission. We've done almost another 700 kilometers, and we have also launched WiMAX in three states.</p>
          <p>I think the important point here is, as we indicated, we thought 2009 would be the peak year in CapEx for the Group. Nigeria is obviously representative of that, in some respects. And you can see, compared to the comparative period last year, we're almost at half the CapEx. And we certainly believe that we'll maintain that for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>South Africa, we had a very rough patch last six months to December '09. I'm glad to say that things have turned around and things have picked up. Our market share is 36%. We'd be more comfortable with two points above that.</p>
          <p>And of course, RICA, which was a challenge &#x2013; I think it was a learning curve for all of us, but we've certainly got into rhythm on that. We had the town stormers, which is a network that was invested in a few years, and those guys were converted, and they have helped us to RICA people, if you like. And that has really helped, particularly on the prepaid side.</p>
          <p>The postpaid growth has not been strong. We have seen a lot of people utilizing the hybrid packages. In other words, migrating from postpaid into either lower packages of postpaid or the hybrid package. And I think this is really indicative of the fairly pressing economic conditions that are prevalent. And of course, we've also ensured much strict credit policy, just to ensure that our doubtful debts are kept at an acceptable level.</p>
          <p>We did have billing- and IT-related problems in 2009, and I am glad to say that a lot of that has been stabilized, and we've got less challenges there, and so on.</p>
          <p>And the campaigns that we were undertaking were also fairly well targeted, primarily because of the very comprehensive segmentation exercise that all operations now go through. And I think on prepaid, we've had that benefit.</p>
          <p>Once more, we are seeing a decline in ARPU. On the postpaid sides, it's driven by what I mentioned earlier, which is people migrating to lower packages and utilizing more of the hybrid products, based on the affordability. And a lot of bundle usage, as well.</p>
          <p>And of course, we &#x2013; as you know, we've had long discussions with ICASA on the mobile termination rates. We're still going through that Chapter 10 process. We are debating the gradient of that slide path, and hopefully, we'll arrive at some meaningful arrangement on that. But suffice to say that the business has structured itself so as to accommodate the further cuts.</p>
          <p>CapEx in South Africa, same story as Nigeria, and indeed, the entire group, which is we are off our peak and down to R1 billion for the first six months, as opposed to a comparative R3 billion last year. But all of this was not in vain. As I keep on saying, the quality of the network, the capacity, and so on, again, is a benefit that is starting to come through very, very clearly. We've also put up more 3G sites, and we now are almost at 50% &#x2013; 48% of the population is covered with 3G.</p>
          <p>Fiber deployment is something that we continue to do quite extensively. As soon as government allowed us to self-provide, as you know, in the last two year, three years, we've embarked on this with much effort, simply to try and ensure that our transmission costs over time decline. So over 440 kilometers of the long distant line has &#x2013; is being deployed. And the 220-kilometer ring around the Gauteng area, that was completed.</p>
          <p>One big feature of the SA results is the pick-up in data. And again, that would not have been possible without investing more in transmission, and of course, generating the right products. So we're quite happy to say that, in fact, we've surpassed the targets we had set for ourselves. Because you may remember, two, three years back, we had said we wanted to reach 12% or 13% of revenue in South Africa in data. We're now at 18%. We're almost 20%. Quite a lot of operators in far more literate societies and so on are at 25, 30%. So I think we seem to be &#x2013; for the South African profile, we're certainly on the right path in that area.</p>
          <p>Ghana, if we can talk about West Africa a little, Ghana has done exceptionally well. This is really a operation in a five-player market. Has maintained market share of 56%. And it's quite important to say that that would not have happened yet again without significant investment in CapEx, which gave us the capacity, gave us the quality, enabled us therefore to be highly competitive as far as the take-up of subs and the subscribers that &#x2013; the products that we put out there, as well as the number of subscribers we could take.</p>
          <p>Of course, we &#x2013; one big feature of Ghana, as you may recall, was the devaluation of the cedi, the Ghanaian cedi. And we are happy to say that it looks like there is some stability now in that particular area. And hopefully, once Ghana gets into production on oil, hopefully, it will begin to strengthen.</p>
          <p>Again, very much effective distribution. Same strategy we followed in Nigeria was effective in Ghana and has yielded results.</p>
          <p>Ghana is not on its own in demanding SIM registration, and we commenced implementing that on the 1st of July. And I must say, I think, as a group, we've been on the learning curve on this. We had a challenge in Sudan where we were caught unaware, but I think after Iran, South Africa, Cameroon, and so on, we've clearly got into a rhythm in anticipating how we deal with SIM registration. Provided everybody plays by the rules, we think this is a competitive area that we would do well in. Or take advantage of &#x2013; maybe I should put it that way.</p>
          <p>Yeah. Ghana also has managed to roll off some 3G sites. I'm afraid here I can't say that CapEx has come down as much, but one has to put into context that it is a five-player market, and it was crucial that we get ahead of the game. Having started, of course, on what we regard &#x2013; [audio disturbance] &#x2013; I don't know whether that's a message about what I'm saying, so I will ignore it for now.</p>
          <p>Okay, but data usage in Ghana is also fairly significant, and MobileMoney has also taken up, maybe not as well as Uganda and East Africa, but certainly this is something that we intend to pursue. And at 7% of revenue, we think this has done relatively well.</p>
          <p>Iran has been very much a star performer in this group. They have effectively grown the subs by 16%. Significant growth in revenue. And again, I think Nazir will deal this in his section.</p>
          <p>One theme that runs through all these results is that these operations, on a local currency basis, have done exceptionally well. And Iran is not &#x2013; has not been an exception. I think revenue is most probably over 60% on a comparative period. But we have had a lot of promotions that have been target for various seasonal things that happened in Iran, and which is really a feature of that country. And of course, we've now got much wider electronic distribution through a lot of the local banks, and that has helped.</p>
          <p>Even though we believe that this third operator will commence operations by the end of the year, or maybe let's say first quarter of next year, we think that with 44% market share in Iran, we have basically positioned ourselves in almost in an unassailable position. Not to say that we're complacent about it, but I think it does put us in a very strong position to deal with any of the third entrants.</p>
          <p>So I mean there we are. Subscribers, almost 27 million. To put this in context, it's been a very fast growth. South Africa went almost 14, 15 years to get to 17 million subscribers. In Iran, really this has been achieved in 4 years. So I think it just shows you what the opportunity was in terms of the depth of the market and so on.</p>
          <p>The rollout. Again, we continue to deploy quite significantly CapEx in Iran, but this does follow the feature of the Group, in the sense that we haven't invested as much as last year in the first six months. We do have certain challenges when it comes to sites, which has slowed down the rollout somewhat, and particularly in Northern Tehran and Esfahan and some places. Sites are very difficult to come by. I'm very confident that if we were able to get more sites, obviously it would create more capacity, and we'd see a much higher uplift of revenue in Iran. So this is something that we continuously look at doing.</p>
          <p>We have also launched WiMAX. We don't have 3G in Iran. We've also launched WiMAX in certain parts of the country, and we believe that that will go a long way to helping our data revenue in Iran increase even more significantly. The 19% is impressive, but that does include SMS. So it will be significantly lower if you exclude SMS.</p>
          <p>Syria. Syria, as you now is almost like a duopoly of sorts, in the sense that the market is controlled in terms of how fast we can move relative to our competitor. But still 45% market share, which has remained relatively stable. Again, segmentation of products here is a very important feature that has helped us. And also helped us to try and reduce churn by being far more educated about our various segments and what's actually happening in each segment.</p>
          <p>The biggest issue in Syria was the BOT. As you know, it's not a normal license there. I'm happy to say that, in principle, we are on track to resolve this by year-end. We have engaged government, and I think in principle, there's now an acceptance that there will be a conversion. And we're hoping that by year-end, that will be done, and we can come and share with you more comprehensively the details of that. Suffice to say that I do think it's a positive development for that operation, because I do believe that once the BOT is out of the way, we would be far less &#x2013; I wouldn't say restrained &#x2013; but we would be in a position to invest more in capacity there, and therefore increase the penetration in a country whose per capita GDP should have a higher penetration than it has today. So I see that essentially as an opportunity.</p>
          <p>Again, that CapEx reflects a number of things. Partly the issue of the BOT conundrum, in the sense that we couldn't invest significantly until we get clarity as to where we're going forward on all of that. But the quality has remained quite acceptable. We have started very limited 3G service, and of course, are launching a lot of data products. At 10%, we really do think that there is still significant opportunity there.</p>
          <p>So I think, in a nutshell, looking at things operationally and trying to give you a strategic overview, I know there has been perpetual questions about our business model and where we're going. Is the trajectory right, and so on. And of course, people are quite entitled to ask those questions. And I guess it's our task to answer those questions. But I do think that the strategy that we have followed thus far it has worked.</p>
          <p>Let me start off by saying bulk of the growth has been organic growth in this company, notwithstanding some M&amp;A that we've undertaken. But the bulk of the growth has been organic. We then invested significantly in CapEx. I mean, if you recall, starting in 2007, we invested significant amount of CapEx in fairly difficult jurisdictions at 35, R40 billion a year, that was, by any stretch of the imagination, significant CapEx. But what that has really precipitated for us or enabled us to do is to have, as I mentioned earlier, the network and the capacity. So today, with 51% market share in Nigeria, 56% in Ghana, and 66% in Uganda, and so on, is precisely because of the view that we took a few years &#x2013; that we should actually create that capacity.</p>
          <p>And the cost efficiencies, we spoke a lot about the low cost operator. And not to say that's a one-off. That's a process, which we continue. And there are lot of things that we haven't spoken about this morning, because I guess we don't have all the time, that we are doing to further try to ensure that we are on the downward trajectory as far as that cost base is concerned.</p>
          <p>All of that has really resulted in fairly significant cash generation, not to mention the extremely low gearing. And we're able to pay the maiden dividend, that's almost R3 billion, for six months, as a result of having followed that strategy. And for us that is, of course, a way of ensuring that our ultimate task of shareholder returns is achieved.</p>
          <p>Having said all of that, of course, we will continue to look at where opportunities are. I think what we said during the AGM is that, whilst we realize that there are now &#x2013; there are far limited significant opportunities that are out there, we think that we cannot be inactive, because the terrain is changing all the time. I mean I spoke about consolidation, whether it's on a regional basis and so on.</p>
          <p>So that is something that we will continue to do, but we hope to increase the balance in terms of particularly cash generation. Returning that to shareholders to reflect where the company is today.</p>
          <p>So I think in short, that is the formula. That is the framework. And unless something absolutely radical happens, that's what we intend to maintain. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, all. Members of the audience, especially we have to welcome the members of the Group Board, the members of the MTN Executive Committee, and also to members of the South Africa Board, as well. Thank you all for taking the time and the interest to participate in the session.</p>
          <p>It gives me pleasure to present the Group's financial results. And I think Phuthuma's last slide provides an ideal opening for us to discuss the financial performance of the Group.</p>
          <p>I mean to a large extent, we would like to believe that the first six months of this year are characterized by some key elements, which in terms of that particular framework, which we believe is to provide some steps in terms of our success in achieving those objectives. And the cash generation that he talked about is a clearly major step towards that.</p>
          <p>One of the highlights, however, that Phuthuma alluded to earlier in his presentation was the ZAR strength in the first half of this year. If you recall, the first half results in 2009 were characterized by very weak ZAR performance, and the average ZAR rate to the dollar was in the order of just slightly above 9. I have a slide later in this presentation, which some of you might have seen already &#x2013; it will explore that or explain that a bit further. We have seen that in the first six months of this year, the ZAR has been relatively strong against most other currencies, including the dollar, and that has a fairly dampening impact on the Group reported results for the first year.</p>
          <p>What's very pleasing &#x2013; we talked about the higher margins earlier in Phuthuma's presentation from South Africa and Iran, and we'll explain those in a bit more detail as we go through the presentation. But we've also lifted up. Despite the fact it's only five-tenths of a point of margin improvement, from 42.8% to 43.3% on a half-year, half-year basis, we did lift up margins overall for the Group in the last six months, from December '09 to now, by more than a full 2 percentage points.</p>
          <p>So that's been very pleasing to see. I guess it's a challenge to operational management is to ensure that we find a way to keep those margins on that level, even towards the end of the year, as well. I'm looking at my South African friends across in the corner here to make sure they don't disappoint on that front. They have however showed me that they are in a good roll, so let's hope that comes through, as well.</p>
          <p>Functional currency. I think in the past we've talked a lot about this. We've done some capital restructuring in the Group, and hopefully we've taken away some of that pain, but we are still exposed to some ForEx losses, and we'll talk about those as we go forward.</p>
          <p>All of this translates &#x2013; the margin improvement, the lower cap ex spend, a good conservation of cash flow &#x2013; has helped us to drive free cash flow up from 2.6 billion at the end of the first six months in '09 to about 6.8 billion in the first six months in 2010. For purposes of this particular presentation, free cash flow is defined as cash generated by operations, which includes working capital changes, after payment of taxes, dividends, et cetera, and CapEx. So that's the way we tend to define it for this purpose.</p>
          <p>HEPS, as a result, with a strong earnings base, HEPS increased by 20.6%, but keeping in mind, of course, that we did not take some of the big pain, I guess, on the reversing a credit from the put option that we saw in the first six months of 2009.</p>
          <p>Moving on, we talked about fairly stable economic and trading conditions, but we still believe that in some cases, they might be relatively unpredictable. But a key feature, I think, in almost every one of our markets that we're operating in, is a fair amount of competition. And we see a lot of discounting on tariffs, and it's not uncharacteristic to see tariffs go down by 50%, and these are daily calls. We also see a lot of freebies being thrown around &#x2013; bonus recharges, free night calling, et cetera, and we believe this is the order of the day. And I think to that extent, keeping that in mind, the results are actually pretty strong and very positive in terms of the way we performed.</p>
          <p>We've seen strong subscriber growth. As Phuthuma pointed out, we've had a good subscriber intake of just over 11% in the first six months of the year. But we do have to keep in mind that this is now coming at declining marginal ARPUs. And that's something that we need to manage very efficiently. For the core framework that we put out there, the way we get increased margin is slower revenue generation in the future, but increased focus in terms of cost efficiency to generate more cash as we go forward.</p>
          <p>Strong data growth, as has been pointed out, particularly in South Africa, but in the same time, we need to manage declining access pricing as we go forward.</p>
          <p>On the FX side, not to talk too much about those. We've dealt with that and I think in as much detail as we need to.</p>
          <p>However, on the regulatory front, probably a couple of points that are worth mentioning. Subscriber registration, as Phuthuma pointed out, has been initiated in a number of markets. I think we keep a watchful eye out on that. We've seen the impact it's had on South Africa. In Nigeria, we are now registering, as we indicated from the beginning of May, in accordance with &#x2013; in compliance with government or regulatory regulations &#x2013; registration of new subscribers.</p>
          <p>The parameters for the registration of the existing base have not yet been defined. Needless to say, we have started a process of registration, we put a lot of equipment out in the field. We've done &#x2013; trained a lot of people, and we've registered about a million people in Nigeria already. But that's something that we need to watch and keep an eye out going forward, because it have might have an impact on gross connections that we're seeing in other markets.</p>
          <p>We are heavily involved in that process in Ghana. Made very good strides, I believe, in Cameroon, where we registered about 70% of the base. And we are also in process of registering the base in Ivory Coast. So this is something that's here to stay, and I think we'll see almost across the entire footprint.</p>
          <p>From the accounting perspective , a few things that we need to keep in mind when looking at the results. Our Zambian shareholding has been reduced as part of a private placement arrangement, and that was in order to comply with the license conditions.</p>
          <p>We reduced our Afghanistan share holding from 100% to just over 90%, and that's in accordance with a financing agreement in which a minority shareholder has a put option on us. We still account for about 100% of that from a consolidation perspective.</p>
          <p>The put option &#x2013; and this is a put option that most of you are familiar with. If you recall, in the last year, as a result primarily due to the devaluation of the naira against both the dollar and the ZAR, we took a fairly large credit to the income statement. The naira has remained fairly stable over the last six months, so in terms of updating the liability under that put option, we've now taken a slight charge. And that reflects clearly the softening of, I guess, the WAC rates associated with that particular country as well as the stability in terms of the cash flows that are coming through.</p>
          <p>On the tax side, a higher tax charge than we expected. Some of it is related &#x2013; and this is fairly consistent as far as the first three bullets are concerned. The STC on the Group dividends, the withholding tax and education tax &#x2013; those effects that we would have seen in the prior year, as well, in terms of taking the blended statutory rate up to a higher number. But the other impact that we've had this year is as a result of the put option moving from a credit to debit, we have lower taxable income, and therefore a higher effective tax rate, even though the charges matched the overall revenue base or the income base.</p>
          <p>Just to give a bit more color to the movement in exchange rates &#x2013; and these are average exchange rates, and therefore have a fairly big impact on two items. One is in all your income statement based items, and secondly as well on your CapEx, as well. So the two shaded areas are the ones we need to focus on.</p>
          <p>As we mentioned, it's more ZAR strength as opposed to underlying currency weakness in the operating countries that has added impact on the numbers. If you look at each one of the real, the naira, or the cedi, they have remained relatively stable against the dollar. There are slight movements, but not significant.</p>
          <p>However, the rand moving from an average of 9.06 to 7.52 obviously means that the ZAR-reported results have been quite heavily impacted on a translation basis. So the cross-rates effectively against the rand have deteriorated somewhere between 16 to 26%, if you do it on a line-by-line basis. And therein really lies the problem or the headwinds that Phuthuma alluded to earlier.</p>
          <p>On the revenue side, again underlying message was on the bottom right-hand corner, on a local currency basis, all operations seems to be performing relatively well. Nigeria, we see slower growth because of the decline in margin and ARPUs of around just below 15%. If you recall, in the first half of last year, those might have been slightly higher compared to 2008.</p>
          <p>Iran, very, very strong at about 42%, largely associated with the fact that there was a slight uplift in local currency ARPUs, as well as a stable overall ARPUs of the existing base. So about a 42% increase.</p>
          <p>Ghana and Uganda, very pleasing to see the rates that are coming through, despite a significant pressure on ARPUs, coming in much lower than we have seen in the past.</p>
          <p>And Syria, again keeping in mind that this is a managed market, this is a market that we expect to see more from in the future. 12% growth is not reflective of the levels of penetration or the GDP in that particular market. So the entire discussion around converting that into a normalized license, we are hopeful will free up the market much more in terms of competition and allow us to develop the business as a more &#x2013; in normal business terms that we see across most of the footprint.</p>
          <p>As far as currency impacts are concerned, if we look &#x2013; if we just do the constant currency calculation and take 2010 ZAR-reported numbers, and that's the 55.9 billion ZAR &#x2013; restate them at the R9 average exchange rate that we saw in the first half of last year &#x2013; we would have reported revenues which are about 8.7 billion or 12.9% higher. And that's something to keep in mind when looking at these results.</p>
          <p>On the RSA side, we would chat a little bit more about RSA, but principally a lot of the revenue growth &#x2013; very, very pleasing to see the 7% Ghana come through. And as a challenge of the management team put back to us at group level, and we are pleased to see that actually come through. Some of it is based on data, but it also reflects the fact that it's very, very strong prepaid performance. And you saw that in the subscriber numbers that Phuthuma showed earlier.</p>
          <p>So the net 800,000 prepaid subscribers has obviously delivered direct revenue gains, which we are very pleased to see. You saw the ARPU going up from a 100 to 109, and clearly a lot of appetite in the market for various things. And the new value propositions, in the form of the One rate, Quality, 100% Mahala campaign, all backed up by a very strong brand and the Ayoba campaign, as well, which clearly has worked extremely well, and we're hopeful that will continue.</p>
          <p>On the Iran side, again, we talked about the 42%, so we'll not drill too much on that.</p>
          <p>Overall, just looking at the data side, again keep in mind that in looking at these figures, you do have to keep in mind that there are currency impacts in that. But looking at the numbers just purely on a data basis, Phuthuma talked about the 18% in South Africa, where we include data and SMS. But keep in mind you got to exclude from the South Africa revenue, the revenue for the handsets. If you do the same calculations just for pure data, excluding SMS, you'll still get data now &#x2013; excluding SMS and excluding handset sales &#x2013; of about 10% in South Africa, and that's quite pleasing.</p>
          <p>Disappointingly, I think in areas like Nigeria, that particular comparison is as low as 1.1%, I think, in Nigeria, which I think reflects the fact that there is a lot of opportunity out there. We have initiated, as you know, 3G coverage, but in terms of both population and geographic coverage, we're probably still relatively far behind where we need to be to be able to service the market adequately.</p>
          <p>On the Iranian side, we don't have a 3G license so that is a bit of a limitation.</p>
          <p>Another point to actually keep in mind on South Africa is you saw very significant move in terms of the number of packet data users. And in comparing the first half of '09 to the first half of '10, I believe in the order of about 2 million additional users. So a very, very nice improvement.</p>
          <p>On the Ghana side, and this is a country where we have made fairly significant investments on the 3G side, good up-tick on revenue growth on the data side of over 60%. But at the same time, we also see quite a big increase in the number of smartphones in the network, in the order of about 500,000.</p>
          <p>Moving on to MTR, and this is a highly topical discussion. This seems to happen to me each time &#x2013; apologies. MTR changes in Nigeria and RSA. I've talked to the guys. I think they actually set this up this way. It never pops up in Phuthuma's presentation.</p>
          <p>In RSA, we are aware that the peak rate dropped &#x2013; the bundle &#x2013; the peak rate dropped from 125 to 89. And in Nigeria, from 11.4 to 8.2. We've set out the Group level interconnect data here, but just a couple of points to keep in mind.</p>
          <p>On the SA side, whilst we've seen some decline as a result of the rate cut, we've also been able to keep the cost under check. And I talked a lot about the prepaid business. We've had a significant increase in a number of subscribers. But what's more interesting, if you compare first half of '09 to first half of 2010, we've carried a significant amount of traffic &#x2013; of grid traffic on-net, which moved from 52% to 62%. So overall, I think the cost side has remained in check, so we've been able to actually keep the cost under control and overall mitigate the impact of the rate cut.</p>
          <p>On the Nigeria side, about a 25% impact due to that rate change, but not significant overall in terms of the contribution to revenue for the simple reason that we carry the substantial part of our traffic on-net. So net interconnect as a percentage of EBITDA thus far, on a group basis, has declined marginally from 10.8 to 10.6%.</p>
          <p>Looking at EBITDA performance, largely, again, keeping in mind the FX impacts. If we restated current year EBITDA at prior constant-currency rates, we would see about a R4.3 billion improvement on EBITDA or reported EBITDA or about 16.3%.</p>
          <p>What's I think of great importance, though, is the margin uplift that we have seen coming through. And we'll try and unpack that a little bit as we go on.</p>
          <p>Nigeria margins have remained roughly steady at about 61%, despite a surge in fuel costs, which are quite a key driver of their OpEx. But generally, all of the costs have remained under control, so we've been able to deliver economies of scale in the operation.</p>
          <p>On the RSA side, we've been able to keep handset revenues roughly stable, but we've been able to actually decrease the cost of the handsets to offset some of the <mark type="inaudible" /> revenue stabilization. So the overall margin on handsets has contributed to an uplift in the margins for the company overall.</p>
          <p>Connections <mark type="inaudible" /> to the channel, as we reported previously, were sort of rearranged in September '09. That helped us actually drive margins or contributed to the margin uplift. And as you're aware, the basis for actually charging out &#x2013; paying the regulatory fees in South Africa was changed from 5% of OpEx to 1.5% of gross margin. That had about a seven-tenths of a point of uplift in the margin itself as well.</p>
          <p>So all of these items have contributed to the margin uplift. I believe we still have further potential difficulty in managing the cost of the IT outsourcing program, but I know the team is well focused in terms of bringing that down. I don't believe we'll see any short-term improvement in cost, but hopefully <mark type="inaudible" /> will give us some good news in 2011.</p>
          <p>On the rand EBITDA front, extremely impressive margins. To generate margins above 40% in this operation needs to be thought of in the context of the 28% revenue share that this company actually has to pay over to the regulator.</p>
          <p>Now, what's happened between last year and this year, we lifted margins by more than 6 percentage points, is primarily very, very good cost control and a very good and efficient operating business model. Transmission costs have been reduced by more than 6%, although the overall quantum of cost is increased with the increase in the size of the network.</p>
          <p>They've also moved to a single vendor maintenance program, and that to a large extent has helped to actually reduce the cost of the vendor maintenance or network maintenance on a year-on-year basis, despite the fact that we have a significant increase in the number of sites. They've also managed to actually reduce the cost of recharge cards, et cetera through very efficient procurement programs. And the advertising spend between the first half of last year and the first half of this year has also decreased.</p>
          <p>All of that has contributed this &#x2013; to very good cost management, increase in the margin, but at the same time, very strong revenue growth.</p>
          <p>So overall for the Group, the EBITDA margin &#x2013; here we go again. Reconciliation. Not much to speak of. We've talked about the Iran and RSA contributions. Other opco is just to point out something there: Sudan, Ghana and C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire have all declined.</p>
          <p>Sudan, we pointed out to you that we had a fairly strong strategy in terms of fixing distribution, putting in a new management team, rolling out a substantial part of the network, which &#x2013; of coverage, which we believe was lacking based on our prior strategy, and doing a few other things in terms of the brand as well as the price positioning in the market as well. We've made a fair amount of progress in a number of those. I see one of our vendors out here who's actually assisting us in the site rollout program. We've actually not been as quick on the network rollout side as we had anticipated, but we are hopeful that in the balance of this year we will catch up. And the challenge we've given to the management team is to keep the quantum of the EBITDA at the level which we had anticipated in the budget, and they are largely hopeful that due to some cost reengineering, et cetera, they will able to get us there. So from a cash flow perspective, we're hopeful that we will stay where are. But the challenge in the market is to actually develop the revenue base, get a higher revenue share, and get that operation back on track.</p>
          <p>Ghana, the OpEx in Ghana is largely influenced by costs which are actually denominated &#x2013; even though they might be paid in cedi, they're actually denominated in U.S. dollars. So it's denominated in U.S. dollars, payments are made in cedis, and as the U.S. dollar moves, you do find that there is a change in our OpEx year-on-year. There is a slight devaluation between the cedi and the dollar and that reflects in about a two-point margin decline in the Ghana operation.</p>
          <p>C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire for various reasons has been very disappointing. We've seen some significant changes in market in terms of value propositions. We've tried to be competitive. We've gone after subscribers. The subscriber acquisitions has been very positive. But overall, I think it's come at the cost of margin. We've also had some one-off costs in terms of swap-outs in the network, and we hope &#x2013; we are of the opinion those will not recur.</p>
          <p>Moving on very quickly on the interest and tax slide, just to &#x2013; very briefly, in the interest of time. Net interest is roughly static year-on-year. Net ForEx losses &#x2013; this is the line &#x2013; and the 957 includes some of the ForEx losses which are still associated with the capital restructuring program, and that's described in the second bullet there, where Iran loans ceded to Dubai are limited to euro / U.S. dollar exposure.</p>
          <p>On the functional currency side, again, that's the effect of the capital restructuring, so the huge charge that we took in the prior year has now effectively disappeared. The small amount that's left is due to some functional currency adjustments for bank balances in a subsidiary. So overall, a fairly significant reduction of about 1.5 billion in the charge from 3.6 to 2.2.</p>
          <p>On the income tax side, I think we've talked about all. The big change on the deferred tax side is directly related to the functional currency movement on a year-on-year basis.</p>
          <p>On the EPS side, the number to focus on of course is the number after the put option, just to clear that up from the earnings adjustments. And that shows a 20.6% increase year-on-year. So, reflective of the strong operating performance coming through.</p>
          <p>Profit and loss on disposal of assets. You've got a profit coming through from about R138 million, which is the amortized profit that we had on the disposal of the Mednet business, which is a carrier business, to BICS. And that's offset by some impairment that we took on various &#x2013; on disposals we took on some assets.</p>
          <p>Reversal of impairment relates to one of the subsidiaries where we had a higher impairment at the end of last year than we actually required, and following an outsourcing program, we've now released that to income.</p>
          <p>I believe we've dealt with virtually all the elements on the P&amp;L, but I think we'll just pass that on in the interest of time.</p>
          <p>On the balance sheet, a few key things to point out. Net debt has gone down from 12.1 to 5.2, and as Phuthuma indicated, moved on from 0.26 in the end of December to 0.11 at the end of June. And in consideration of the stronger cash position, we've gone out and made an interim dividend of 151 cents. As far as the actual translation on the balance sheet is concerned, keep in mind that we moved from 7.39, which is a closing rate, to 7.67.</p>
          <p>Just one or two key points. I'll unpack the cash and the liabilities in the next few slides. Current assets have increased, but the earlier one actually, the 5.1 reflected a reclassification of some loans from Iran, which we expected would be repaid. Those have now been put back into longer-term liabilities. That's not to suggest that we're actually not active in terms of trying to get cash back from the subsidiary. Just more reflection on an agreement in terms of us taking a view that we'll not call up the loans for reporting purposes in the next 12 months, and something we've discussed with the auditors.</p>
          <p>The analysis of the net debt &#x2013; two key points. We had a restructuring of our finance facilities in Nigeria and the refresh of the DMT and the One program, which most of you are familiar with. Both of those have the effect of smoothing out the repayment profile. And I think what we've unpacked at the bottom of this slide is to show you the position as of the end of June, and the effect of what's been completed post June, and you'll see especially the major change in terms of 2010. And of course, this is something that Debbie keeps an eye on a constant basis, and we'll continue trying to smooth it out as we go out in the future years.</p>
          <p>Just a point to mention, that whilst we paid down a significant portion of the unproductive debt, or in fact, all of it, we still have about 5.2, which relates to the recap of Dubai.</p>
          <p>On the gross inter-company loans, let's &#x2013; why don't we just chat about those on the next slide.</p>
          <p>The resolution of the Ghana's shareholder dispute &#x2013; we're pleased to report &#x2013; as you recall, we've reported in previous meetings, we've had disputes with two of our shareholders in Ghana. Both of those have now have been concluded and all agreements are put into place. And what that translates to is an opportunity in Ghana to upstream cash. So Debbie will be spending a fair a amount of time with the banks in Ghana to figure out a way to bring some good news back to us.</p>
          <p>If we see where the actual debt sits on a ZAR basis, 51% in South Africa, 34% in Nigeria. So very much in terms of the profile we would expect, and about 14%. And  keep in mind, for Iran, we consolidate only 49%. So it will impact the gross numbers that we see for this operation.</p>
          <p>As far as where the cash sits, 38% in Ghana. We talked about Syria. I think something just to chat about. What we are looking at doing is, as I think most of you know, that represents effectively trapped cash, but in spite of the conversion and the payment of the up-front fee, we are hopeful that we can use a substantial portion of that cash to settle the liability for the conversion. And that I think will be an effective way to actually fund it. And it will be funded in local currency.</p>
          <p>Again, we are hopeful. This is all part of the thinking going forward. And also moving forward, we are hopeful that whatever new arrangement we will get into will be one which will allow us to clearly repatriate dividends as we generate cash. The structure of that, also, I think, we believe will be such that the operation will be EBITDA &#x2013; the quantum of EBITDA today, which is roughly in the order of about 21.6%, will increase significantly, by virtue of the fact that the new agreement will reflect a much lower revenue share. Now without going into any details, hopefully we can come back to you when these agreements are concluded.</p>
          <p>On the cash flow side, again, very, very strong cash inflows, roughly in the order of magnitude of last year. Some movements of course reflecting currency exchange rates on reported earnings. The net interest payable of course has been much higher than in the first six months of last year, being the key driver of the net cash position.</p>
          <p>Acquisition of property, plant and equipment &#x2013; the CapEx will, as we said &#x2013; we set out to spend a lot lower CapEx. The run rate reflects the fact that in fact we are slightly behind. We expect to catch up by &#x2013; as we go through the second half of the year. We don't expect the full portion of the CapEx that we've approved for the operations to impact us on a cash basis, as well.</p>
          <p>And then we have the acquisition of intangible assets, which is effectively software across the Group. Other investing activities has moved from 2.6 billion last year. If you recall, we acquired Verizon and we acquired iTalk, and we also had a fairly significant level of prepayments in one of our major subsidiaries &#x2013; I believe it was Nigeria &#x2013; compared to income of 1.2 billion this year, which reflects about R700 million, which is 49% share of repayment of loans, which came through from Iran. The remaining portion, I believe, is related to profit and disposal of certain assets.</p>
          <p>That I believe deals with cash flow.</p>
          <p>The CapEx side &#x2013; again, if you look at the FX element of CapEx, not too much to change. About 200 million impact overall. I think the key message here is we expect the 23.6 billion, which we showed you previously, to come down to about 21.3. We can have further discussions in terms of why the CapEx did deteriorate in discussions outside this forum.</p>
          <p>Again, in the interest of time, just to see how we see CapEx rolling out for the full year. And again, this is our view based on what we told you previously was 23.6. We now believe that number is 21.3.</p>
          <p>And a few points worth our mentioning. The Ghana one looks as being that odd. It's not a change in strategy. What it does reflect is probably an underestimation when we provided you the first level of guidance on roll-over CapEx coming into 2010. It also reflects the fact that there was an environmental ban, which impacted our ability to actually acquire new sites and rollout sites in the first six months of the year. All of those have required a revision of the CapEx number, and we believe the 2.1 for Ghana will in fact &#x2013; most of which will be committed and spent by the end of this particular year. Keeping in mind that we spent 1.4 billion to date, the 700 million is probably realistic in terms of taking out the 2.1.</p>
          <p>For the remaining operations, I think the &#x2013; we expect to come down to roughly 21 in terms of full commitment. Not all of that, again, will hit us on a cash flow basis.</p>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you, Nazir.</p>
          <p>We would now like to go to questions, I believe. Well, before the questions, maybe I need to say one or two things.</p>
          <p>I think looking forward &#x2013; and I think it's on page 71, I believe, of the little pack that you have &#x2013; as I said at the beginning of my presentation, we're going to maintain some of the key themes. We do believe that rolling out the network rapidly, having that capacity, has always been a competitive edge. But of course, as these markets mature and as market share settles, we think that we are in a position now to comfortably and more confidently, shall I say, share infrastructure with others, and therefore reduce our CapEx and OpEx going forward. And of course, we'll always look at what the competitive situation is in each country before we do that, just to ensure that we don't give up any strategic advantage that we have.</p>
          <p>Standardization. This continues to be part of an exercise of reducing our costs. The more standardized the systems and processes are across the Group &#x2013; not always possible, but wherever it is, we find that we start benefiting from the economies of scale, and starts to make far more sense for us.</p>
          <p>Rationalization of suppliers is another area. And of course, all of this is about management and optimization of our cost base.</p>
          <p>The rollout of this year &#x2013; the CapEx that Nazir just spoke about &#x2013; we'll continue to do that, even though some of it may lag into next year. And we will continuously be extremely vigilant in terms of the level of service and quality of service, particularly in the light of some competitive &#x2013; much stronger competitors coming into this market. And ensure that we maintain that advantage and not lose market share or capacity or any of those key features.</p>
          <p>Fiber. I mean as you can see, a lot of the transmission and the optic fiber that has been put in the ground has given us quite an uplift on data services. And as you penetrate low into those markets, replacing some of that revenue with value-added services and really data revenue from more of the high-end customers becomes quite crucial. So we would expect to continue to do that.</p>
          <p>Regulatory is a feature of this industry. We can't always say that we &#x2013; we'll always come out on tops, but we try to anticipate, pre-empt, and engage, with a view of mitigating this regulatory risk in most countries. And I must say, over the years, it's worked very well. I can't think of a single country where we couldn't resolve matters amicably in the end.</p>
          <p>Cash returns. I mean this is part of the theme of that last slide that I showed you, which is saying we're trying to balance shareholder returns now with ensuring that strategically, we don't miss out on opportunities that could undermine our own strategic position, based on where we are today, starting with this interim dividend that we're paying now. And we'll continue to pay that interim dividend going forward. And at the moment, we felt comfortable that a ratio of 40% on EPS would be the right balance for us in having that shareholder return, but also ensuring that we've got capacity to do things, should those opportunities present themselves.</p>
          <p>And then lastly, we have postponed the BEE transaction a number of times because either there was some M&amp;A that we're considering or the market conditions were just not conducive. I'm glad to say that we finally have moved on that, and of course, have got the AGM tomorrow, to vote on that BEE transaction.</p>
          <p>Subscriber guidance. And I guess you need to see this in the context of that CapEx slide that Nazir presented, saying that we hope to get through the R21 billion of CapEx for this year, which is significantly down on last year. But of course it's all to capture subscribers &#x2013; hopefully available subscribers. The guidance was 20 million at the beginning of this year. And we've revised that to 21.1 million, so it's not a big change. And I think we're clearly far more optimistic in South Africa than we were at the beginning of the year, as evidenced by the performance of South Africa in the last six months.</p>
          <p>Ghana, I think a bit of a challenge. I keep on saying it is a 5 or 6 player market, if you will. And we think that it's going to be quite a lot of pressure there. Iran, we maintain the guidance. We think that we are on the track to achieve that. And the rest of the countries contributing about 7 million subs. So we think that's fairly all in order.</p>
          <p>So I think, with that, thank you very much. And we would like you to raise whatever questions or matters of clarification that we can help you with.</p>
          <p>I must say, as far as the BEE transaction is concerned, if you can bear with us and leave that for tomorrow. Because with the AGM tomorrow and all of that, and if there any questions on that, I think we can &#x2013; would prefer to deal with that &#x2013; level of detail on that &#x2013; and really just deal with the results and all the strategic issues that's put into the results.</p>
          <p>So if we can take some questions.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Jonathan Kennedy-Good from Investec. Just a quick question on your cash remittances during the period, from the opcos to SA and Dubai, I guess. Could you give us a sense of what those numbers were?</p>
          <p>And then also in Nigeria, just one &#x2013; could you give us a sense of the population coverage on the 3G? And I'm just curious to know why you're pulling back so much on CapEx in Nigeria given the fact that data as a percentage of revenues are low and you see that as an opportunity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay, maybe let me just take last question first on Nigeria and cash remittance, and I will go back to Nazir to respond.</p>
          <p>I assume you're really talking about the cash that's been upstreamed from the operations, is that what you are asking? Okay, yeah.</p>
          <p>Look, I think firstly, on Nigeria, on CapEx, really if I can just stay on a light-hearted moment, I don't think we can never get it right. Because I remember a few years, sitting here, is why are you spending so much money in Nigeria? And we spend a lot of money. Now why are you spending such little money in Nigeria? So and the answer is that we're trying to find a balance. We have got 51% market share. We have bought VGC that's helping to drive us on data. But we also don't want to run too far ahead on the CapEx in Nigeria that would be data-related without ensuring that the revenues are actually there.</p>
          <p>As I think Nazir indicated in his slide, there is no question that, with low single-digits data revenue in Nigeria, the opportunity seems very, very large. So we're very, very, very conscious of that. But we want to approach it on a broad-based basis, whether it's via wireless, okay, in a manner that is well structured, is well thought through, and ensures that we actually target the right segment, the right sort of SMEs and so on to do that.</p>
          <p>So it's a rather long-winded way of saying to you, it's an opportunity that we're aware of, but we are actively debating really the strategy of how we actually deploy that.</p>
          <p>And in terms of our G coverage in Nigeria, it's still fairly low. It's mainly the cities. I don't know, Sifiso, if you know what is the percentage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just over 20%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it is still relatively low, but I think obviously that's going to increase as we move forward.</p>
          <p>Nazir, do you want to take the question on cash upstreaming, yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Year-to-date we've had dividends coming through from Nigeria, which is fairly consistent with what we've seen in past years. It's in an order of magnitude of about $400 million.</p>
          <p>As far as shareholder loans are concerned, we had a $200 million repayment, which we, I think, had mentioned earlier in the year from Iran. And that covered mostly finance costs and loans which we extended to the operation. We haven't had any capital paid back on that.</p>
          <p>We &#x2013; there has been a more recent dividend declared for Nigeria, which should come through between September and October, roughly of the order of the magnitude that we've seen previously. And, of course, we have a &#x2013; as part of our treasury management program, constant upstreaming of cash from the South African operation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Rhys?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Rhys from Citi. I just had three questions, if I could, please. The first, if I just look at the Nigerian business, your minutes of use look they've gone backwards by about 10%. And I understand that your incremental ARPU is down from about 7.5, I think you said in the first quarter, down to 7. But that's not fully going to account for the 10% decline in usage on your network in Nigeria. So I'm wondering if we're seeing a proliferation of dual SIM cards in the market, or if you're actually losing a bit of revenue share to some of the other operators there? So maybe a bit of color on that would be very helpful.</p>
          <p>And the second question is on South Africa. I think you alluded to the on-air traffic going to 62%, which I think is a remarkable performance. How sustainable is that? Can you expect that to go any higher?</p>
          <p>And then maybe just a third question is on gearing levels. I think your dividend's welcome across the board, but the fact is you still have got tremendously low gearing. So do you have a target on where you're going to be going on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me answer the question on gearing. Then maybe MOU in Nigeria, Sifiso, you want to take that and traffic in South Africa?</p>
          <p>Okay. I think on gearing levels, yes, the gearing is low. And we haven't sort of borrowed to pay dividends, okay. But &#x2013; and I'm not saying we would do that. But I'm just saying &#x2013; because there are other inefficiencies that would be implied in that. But suffice to say that the gearing can go up depending on firstly really what happens in the next two years or so as far as opportunities.</p>
          <p>Now, I think we've been very clear, starting with the announcement we took out during our AGM, to say that we think opportunities that we would regard to be value-accretive are few and far apart, okay? So having said that, we also are not saying we are not going to look for other opportunities, because there could be regional consolidation opportunities that may require us to push that gearing up. So I think that's the first thing that drive us.</p>
          <p>I think the second element of that question was, well, what is a reasonable gearing level that you'd look. It really depends on the opportunities. But I think generally for us &#x2013; and it's always a dangerous thing to say here because you always get quoted down the road &#x2013; but I think if you start looking at net-debt-to-EBITDA that approaches 2, we're saying that is starting to be high. But maybe there won't be opportunities that would actually put us on that sort of level of gearing.</p>
          <p>So I would say it's been a step change, and maybe in a year we may look at an even more value-creating capital structure for us rather than the net debt of 1.1 &#x2013; sorry, 0.1.</p>
          <p>Okay, MOU in Nigeria. And I think you &#x2013; the second question was traffic in South Africa on-net has grown by 62%, is that sustainable? Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just the on-net traffic in South Africa, there's no reason why we should think that that should change. The kinds of products that have been in the market have been very successful and very attractive from an on-net perspective. And then also the fact that the lease costs through to businesses are also &#x2013; they've reduced in terms of the amount of traffic that they will be carrying. So there's no reason to believe that that will come down.</p>
          <p>As far as Nigeria is concerned, yes, there is a lot of double SIMs, because also the market is very &#x2013; the number of promotions from the other operators are very high. So at this stage, in terms of the overall impact on the total minutes is very much under investigation. But there is no reason to believe that there is a gradual reduction in the total minutes offered in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there's just the clarification on that question on the on-net traffic. That changed from 52 to 62 &#x2013; is related to prepaid. I think postpaid went up marginally from 48 to 50. I don't know what the blended number is but you need to keep that in mind.</p>

          <p>Maybe just on the Irancell, are we looking at some dilution going forward in the potential listing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We wouldn't discount that. But for the moment, there is no plans to do that. We have engaged the regulator on that. And it's something that's in discussion, let's put it that way. But suffice to say there is no undertaking from us or plan to us to do that. But there are lot of strategic issues to think about as far as Iran is concerned. So it's something that could eventuate in the future, but I can't say that with any degree of certainty.</p>
          <p>Okay. I think there was a gentleman up here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's John from UBS. Could you just provide a little bit more information on how you're thinking about infrastructure sharing and what the progress is that you're making in that regard? In other words, would you consider it in South Africa or are there specific countries which are more suited than others, or partners that are more suited than others?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's a very difficult question. I mean, let me just say that I think there are most probably two or three elements to that. I think the basic principle is that obviously you're going to get the highest amount of benefit in infrastructure sharing in countries where you've still got a lot of infrastructure to build and a lot of CapEx to spend, all right? Because that's clearly where you're going to find the rationalization. So that most probably is the first box that we'd look at. It's the less mature markets as opposed to the more mature markets.</p>
          <p>The second element of what we would consider is, even in those less mature markets, is really what the strategic play is. If infrastructure sharing there was hugely detrimental to us in terms of market share and strategy and so on, then obviously we may do it or not do it. Or if we do it, we may do it in a measured way, all right?</p>
          <p>So that really is what the position is. In terms of where are we today, I mean, today there is quite a lot of exchanging of swapping. You give me 5 towers here and I give you 5 towers there. That kind of thing. That is happening.</p>
          <p>But I think the paradigm shift or step change will really be when you start looking at tower companies and so on. And that is not something that we would discount, but in looking at it, we'd have to take into consideration that other two elements that I've mentioned.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've got some questions that have come through the electronic media.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>We do have quite a lot of people logged on. Nik Kershaw from Deutsche Bank asks, given the focus on Sudan, why did subs fall 728,000 in the period? Also, why is ARPU down if subs have fallen now? I've been told that you have been fixing the business.</p>
          <p>I've got two other questions but maybe deal with Nik's first and then the others. Do you want to answer Nik's question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Why don't you ask all of them? Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then the other two questions. One question here from JP Davids from Barclays Capital on MobileMoney. Are there any structural reasons why MobileMoney in West Africa should lag East Africa over the longer term?</p>
          <p>And one last question. Bharti in Kenya yesterday &#x2013; this is from Nomura, Martin &#x2013; cut rates very aggressively. What are you anticipating by way of pricing pressure in Nigeria from Bharti?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me take the question on MobileMoney and Bharti and tariff cuts. And then, Sifiso, you'll talk about Sudan, maybe.</p>
          <p>Okay. All right. Look, I think on MobileMoney, the question was, well, why would West Africa lag East Africa? There is no obvious reason other than the fact that, in credit to them, Safaricom started this with M-PESA, mobile money in Kenya. And again, credit to them. Many, many years before a lot of other operators started that. And I think that has taken off very, very well.</p>
          <p>In Kenya, it's very established, and of course, as you know, the East African region is fairly integrated. And I think that has &#x2013; there's quite a lot of movement between Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania and so on. So I think they've seen that benefit. It's a issue of familiarity, where that region is far more comfortable with MobileMoney, have used it used it quite a lot, starting in Kenya.</p>
          <p>And of course, we launched in Uganda &#x2013; let's say before the other countries, right? In our Group, we launched in Uganda way before other countries.</p>
          <p>So that is really &#x2013; for those two reasons, that's really why East Africa has done fairly well. But there is absolutely no reason, once the people feel far more familiar and far more comfortable with the product, why it shouldn't spread in West Africa, as well. I mean, it's like ATMs. When people used to go to ATMs, they'd still rather go into the branch. But today, everybody doesn't want to go into the branch, they just use the ATM. So it's the same sort of mentality.</p>
          <p>The issue of &#x2013; second question was about Bharti and cutting tariffs in Kenya. Well, first of all, we're not in Kenya. That was meant on a serious note. But having said that, I think the feature of the question really is, clearly, are these guys going to start cutting prices? And I think the specific question was, well, what does it mean for Nigeria? And some of you may recall that we had, I think, two very big scares in Nigeria in the past. When we went out with a new product that took down tariffs, because of the high elasticity of that market, we'd then get an enormous growth in traffic. And when you get that enormous growth in the traffic, clearly, you must then have the network and the capacity to do that.</p>
          <p>So it's not for us to comment on other people's strategies and what they will do and what they won't do. But I think my response &#x2013; I'll just leave you with a response that says, if you're going to go and have significant cuts in tariffs, you need the capacity. Particularly in a country like Nigeria, you absolutely need the capacity, because if you don't have the capacity, you'd be in very dire straits as far as the network is concerned.</p>
          <p>So I think that's the first response. Second response is, of course, no tariffs, enormous volumes works; low tariff, not such enormous volumes has got its own challenges on revenue.</p>
          <p>Sifiso, you want to comment on Sudan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on Sudan, we had to, let's say, disconnect 600,000 subscribers that were actually not active. So that had no impact on the revenue at all.</p>
          <p>As far as turning around the business is concerned, we've just had difficulties in relation to getting the rollout in place. And earlier on there was a mention of that, we did have some significant management changes. And I think that we're now on a good note to actually get it going well.</p>

          <p>And from this Group summary, I can see that in the first half of this year, your CapEx compared with last year &#x2013; in the first half of last year you have reduced about 45.2%. And I'm very curious why is this?</p>
          <p>And also I want to know that for the next half of the year, do you have any plan to increase your CapEx? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Christine, if you give us half the prices, we may keep it at where it is.</p>
          <p>Look, I think as we indicated, we really believe that we've most probably accommodated the huge pent-up demand in countries like Nigeria. And therefore, we really need to be far more circumspect in how we spend CapEx. But that can change, in the sense that, as somebody raised the point earlier, once we're absolutely clear on the data proposition in Nigeria and how we need to address that, rolling out 3G and so on, we will have to look at that. I think that's one.</p>
          <p>Secondly, in most markets, MOU does grow, depending on what we're putting out today in terms of products that people actually need. So if the value-added services &#x2013; and which is why we're taking innovation very seriously now with Mr. De Faria here, okay, who is going to generate a lot of new products and value-added services. We're hoping that will stimulate high-end usage and so on, and therefore, you can see that traffic growth. And people, as they settle into the patterns, they will start using the phone more and more.</p>
          <p>I think the third element, which is not always predictable, is that there is new entrants coming to the market all the time. We want to maintain our market share and position and quality of network and capacity. And we'll absolutely ensure that we always stay ahead of the game. Now, to some extent, it also depends what those people do in the market, but I'm saying there could very well be a situation where it may make sense to deploy even more CapEx to increase the capacity even more to ensure that not only do we maintain our market share, but really get even further ahead.</p>
          <p>But those are all strategic decisions that I think we are evaluating. So when we have our next round of price negotiation with you, we will put that on the table.</p>
          <p>Okay. The last question, and -</p>

          <p>Nicky Smith from <mark type="inaudible" />. Just a question <mark type="audio gap" />, the succession plan, you said within a month or two. Is that &#x2013; could you be more clear? Are you saying that within a month or two the Board will announce who the successor is? Or they will have reached a significant point in their process in terms of short-listing? Or what do you actually mean?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can't be more clear, because it was just a manner of speaking. I wasn't saying literally one month or two months. All I'm just saying is to the gentleman that we are aware of the anxiety, that people want clarity. And they will deal with that as explicitly as they can.</p>
          <p>But please don't quote me as saying I said in one month or two month. But it's a matter of urgency, let's put it that way. We do understand that.</p>

          <p>Okay. I was hoping to get a better last question than that from <mark type="inaudible" />. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thanks.</p>
