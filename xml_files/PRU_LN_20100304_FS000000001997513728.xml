        <plist>
          <p>Well good afternoon everybody. I am Harvey McGrath, Chairman of the Pru and it's a pleasure to welcome you all here today on what must rank I think as one of the more significant days in the Prudential's long history. Now clearly we are going to be very focused on the transaction that we have announced today, but I think we also want to acknowledge the full-year unaudited results that as you will have seen, we have also announced this morning.</p>
          <p>I say that because in unprecedented economic circumstances Tidjane and the team have delivered record performance in sales, in profits and in margins. The Prudential has emerged from this financial crisis as one of the strongest insurers in the world and this success truly means that we can look at the opportunity offered by the combination with AIA and be confident that we will deliver value to shareholders.</p>
          <p>That transaction, that combination with AIG's insurance operations in Asia is entirely consistent as you all know with the Group's established strategy. It's consistent with our proven value driven Asian growth story and I don't need to tell you that the deal is truly transformational.</p>
          <p>The combined group will become the leading life insurer in Asia and one of the largest financial services businesses worldwide. The Board is confident that this deal is an attractive one and will create substantial long term shareholder value.</p>
          <p>And with that, let me hand over to Tidjane, who can put some flesh on the bones of the announcement that we have made today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Harvey, and good afternoon. It looks like we are developing a pattern here because we surprise you less here. I think we did our sales this year and I cannot promise anything like that next year. Bur for today we'll start with this. I am delighted to be here to present our results for '09 and talk to you about the acquisition. This transaction offers the rare opportunity to bring together two outstanding companies, creating an ideal opportunity for us to capture the expected growth in the Asian markets and accelerate our strategy. I will talk about that in more detail later.</p>
          <p>There is a lot of information to cover today. As you know we were scheduled to present our results on March 9, so in about eight days from now, but external events have forced us to accelerate our timetables slightly, so things may not be as well organized as they usually are, but we are where we are. So with the numbers you are going to see are unaudited. We will do with figures in sterling as new rule. However going forward, given that our earnings I believe will be dominated by dollar linked currencies, we are likely to report in dollars.</p>
          <p>Before talking about the transaction in more detail, I wanted to reflect on the 2009 unaudited results that we have also released this morning. 2009 frankly was a very good year for Prudential as you can see. I think I said about a year ago, when I was appointed that I would be focused on operational delivery, I believe we've done that. Sales, retail sales on which I have focused have increased by 11%. Total sales are up 1% but that is because we decided not to sell wholesale products and there is <mark type="inaudible" /> contract in the 2008 comparatives.</p>
          <p>New business profit was a record and up 34%. Both EEV and IFRS profits are up strongly. Regarding the capital position during 2009, we have moved the IGD surplus to 3.4 billion up from 1.5 at the end of 2008 after taking significant impairments. And I have talked at previous results about free surplus as a good proxy for cash generation. And I am pleased to see that number moving ahead very strongly in 2009.</p>
          <p>As we have also said previously, we have continued to upstream cash from the businesses to meet our central requirements of paying the dividend in our central costs and we have recommended a full-year dividend increase of 5%.</p>
          <p>Before I hand over to, Nick to talk through the results in more detail, I just want to highlight three carriers, which I have talked to you often. The first one is new business and sales. We haven't done our Q4 results, so I know this is new to you, I think we have had fantastic results. Retail sales are up 11% especially in Q4, which was the highest ever, driven by Asia. Asia is really back and we have achieved good base growth. Q4 sales of course, grew to 25%, Q4 on Q3 in '09 and 31% against Q4 '08. And Asia, which may surprise some commentators is ahead 42% on Q3 and 45% on Q4 '08.</p>
          <p>So as you will see, this was achieved whilst increasing margins and, Nick will go back to that. But on slide &#x2013; on the next slide which is a format you've seen before, I just give you the new business profit and our pattern. In Asia, new business profits are up 12%. We have achieved the commitment made by Mark Tucker in 2010 of doubling by 2009. We have doubled.</p>
          <p>The US has been phenomenal. It is not often that one gets the opportunity to report a three digit growth rate, not in sales but in profit, and this is down to our great success in the <mark type="inaudible" /> market. In the U.K., new business profits are lower, but it is mainly due to our decision not to sell wholesale products. And as you can see, across the Group, the IRRs and the paybacks remain very attractive. The combination of high margins, high IRRs and short paybacks is unique amongst our peer group, I believe.</p>
          <p>Finally, close to my heart is the new business trend, something we have been focusing on. This is a number I said I would manage down. We didn't set a target at that time, but you can see that we have increased new business profits by 34% and at the same time reduced new business trend by 16%. We have delivered strong new business profitability with less capital consumed. With that I will now hand over to, Nick to talk you through our results in more detail.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tidjane. And good morning, everyone &#x2013; or good afternoon. I'm delighted to be addressing you today as the CFO of Prudential, and I can safely say that my first 16 weeks with the Group have been anything but dull, roll on the next 16 weeks. My presentation will cover the financial performance for the year and provide you with an update on the progress that we have made on managing risk and on managing capital.</p>
          <p>We'll move on to the next slide. The results that we are reporting today demonstrate the success of our strategy, which in 2009 saw us adopt a conservative approach to sales focusing on cash and capital generation, which we deployed to the most profitable products in the most attractive geographic markets.</p>
          <p>As a result and against a difficult market backlog, we have delivered a very strong operating performance across all of our operations and achieved many firsts in the process. In addition, we have successfully evolved our business model, which has become a powerful engine for generating growth in the underlying free surplus.</p>
          <p>Our overall performance for the year is summarized on this next slide. In overview, 2009 was a record year for EEV operating profitability up 8% to 3.1billion, a record year for IFRS operating profitability up 10% to 1.4 billion and a record year for new business profits. Our focus on capital preservation produced record levels of underlying free surplus, which nearly tripled to 2.5 billion sterling.</p>
          <p>Our shareholder funds have rebounded strongly from the mid 2009 lows and our central cash resources have been enhanced through a combination of continued high remittances from businesses and subordinated debt raising during the course of 2009. And we have delivered this performance without releasing a single pound of our already strong UK credit default reserves which at 31 December, 2009 stood at 1.6 billion on a Pillar 1 basis.</p>
          <p>Starting with new business on this next slide, I have already indicated that we took a cautious approach to sales in 2009. This meant that we pullback completely from Wholesale business in the US and the UK and pursued the most attractive opportunities from a profitability standpoint. This meant that whilst our total sales were flat. At the retail level sales rose by 11% to 2.9 billion with a strong year-on-year growth reported in our US and Asian businesses with a &#x2013; which more than offset our planned reduction in the UK.</p>
          <p>Looking at the performance by market and starting with Asia, sales grew by 4% to 1,261 billion on the back of the pick up in performance in the fourth quarter that Thiam referred to.</p>
          <p>Within this total, sales from our most profitable markets in Southeast Asia, including Hong Kong rose by 18% to 767 million. The proportion of health and protection sales rose to 29%, whilst the proportion of unit-linked sales fell back to 41%. Agency continues to be the main channel of distribution, accounting for 63% of the total and bancassurance now accounts for a quarter of our total Asian sales.</p>
          <p>Jackson was a major beneficiary in the flight to quality, which accompanied the significant change in the competitive landscape in the US market where several of our competitors scale back their product offerings due to capital constraints, and where financial strength downgrades caused consumers to question the financial stability of certain providers.</p>
          <p>Jackson's advantage position in advise-based distribution, strong reputation or innovation in product design, efficient service and capital strength, so it capture market share and its chosen annuity product lines and deliver a record year in retail sales, 53% higher to 912 million.</p>
          <p>We were successful in capturing an increased share of the VA market, which was stimulated in the second half of the year by the equity market rally. We now rank fourth in this market with a share of 7.3%. Variable annuities in fact, now account for 70% of Jackson's sales.</p>
          <p>The step change in profitability with margins up to 73% was a direct consequence of the shift in product mix, coupled with our disciplined approach to pricing, but more of that in a moment.</p>
          <p>Finally in the UK, our retails sales were down 11% as we continue to prioritize value over volume, focusing on those products where we have market leading positions, namely annuities and in profits. We chose not to write any bulk business in 2009 in order to conserve capital and we adopted a pricing strategy on annuities, which optimize the balance between capital consumption and value creation. The result of this was a three percentage point improvement in our margins.</p>
          <p>When you step back, you clearly see that the majority of our Asian sales are now coming from Southeast Asia, which is highly profitable. The predominant component of our US sales is Vas, which are capital efficient and have a short payback. And in the UK our focused approach is paying dividends. This outcome is very deliberate and represents the right shape of our business.</p>
          <p>In this next slide, I provide a bit more color on the margins for the Asian region. I have already mentioned that we grew our sales in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong. And the importance of this is illustrated by reference to the level of new business margin from these businesses, which increased to 78% in 2009. Our margins in the more mature Northeast Asian markets of Taiwan, Korea and Japan are lower. These markets display profitability characteristics similar to those in the western world. Here we will compete where it is profitable for us to do so, and we are prepared to lose market share with Korea being the case in point.</p>
          <p>The contribution to our new business profitability from China and India remains modest, in part reflecting the fact that we own 50% and 26% of these businesses respectively. Furthermore VAs China represents a profitable place to do business, Foreign JVs access to the market is really restricted. The chart on the right hand side of the slide shows how the overall margin has moved year-on-year. The main components of the improvement are the 2.7 percentage points from the shift in country mix towards Southeast Asia and the 2.4 percentage point increase due to the higher proportion of health and protection.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the US product margins and starting with Vas, margins have improved from 43 to 81% in 2009 due to the following factors. Firstly, given market volatility, customers elected more VA option or benefits. To give you an example, the percentage of policies on which the GMWB option was elected rose from 55% in 2008 to 79% in 2009. At same time Jackson selectively reduced the level of guaranteed benefits offered and the combined effect of these actions contributed to about half of the uplift in the margin.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the higher spread on the fixed option and improved assumptions on the GMWB utilization rate contributed to a quarter of the margin increase and finally the remaining uplift reflects the benefit of higher earned rates on separate account assets.</p>
          <p>Turning to fixed annuities, where margins improved from 37 to 57% in 2009, this reflects the benefit of higher spread assumptions, which we commented on at the interims. As we flagged at that time, the spreads narrowed in the second half of 2009 as markets normalized. The benefit of higher spreads was partly offset by the impact of higher risk discount rates, which now incorporate an additional allowance for short term credit risk of 150 basis points. These same factors also explained a movement on the margins for fixed-index annuities.</p>
          <p>The overall 2009 margin pick up reflects both Jackson's disciplined approach to pricing and the benefits of some exceptional yields achieved in 2009 caused by the dislocation in the fix income market. Margins will trend down over the term of the cycle as markets normalize and the dislocation in the competitive landscape unravels.</p>
          <p>Jackson will continue to leverage its strengths remain disciplined on margins and focused on returns. Our EEV operating profits have increased by 8% to 3.1 billion. This record performance was underpinned by a 13% increase in earnings from our Life operations to 3.2 billion with a broadly equal contribution from new and in-force business.</p>
          <p>Tidjane has already commented on the improvement in new business profits to 1.6 billion. In relation to in-force, it was encouraging to see that against the difficult market backdrop our back-book embedded value has held up well overall with experience variance and assumption changes broadly offsetting for a small positive contribution to profit, more about this on the next slide.</p>
          <p>Our asset management businesses maintained and improved their excellent investment performance record and as a result reported record net inflows in 2009 up 261% to 15.4 billion, notwithstanding these record inflows, profits were down 11% at 348 million due to depressed values of assets under management. Profits did rebounce strongly in the second half of the year as some values recovered.</p>
          <p>Turning to other items, income on central assets were lower as short term interest rates fell. The higher interest costs that you see on the slide stem from the additional subordinated debt issued in May and July. Corporate and Asia regional costs increased principally due to higher project costs.</p>
          <p>On this next slide, I analyze the in-force business profits for each of our life operations. Unwind of discount rate and expected returns are 17% higher up 1.421 billion, partly due to the use of higher risk discount rates and earned rates, particularly in the US, but more importantly reflecting the growing maturity of our back-book, especially in Asia, where this component of profits increased by 20% to 489 million.</p>
          <p>Overall, experience variances and assumption changes made a total positive contribution of 180 million in 2009, lower than the 425 million equivalent figure in 2008, which benefited from the one-off effect of rebalancing the asset portfolio back in <mark type="inaudible" /> liabilities.</p>
          <p>Asia experience variances and assumption changes were overall negative, largely as a result of the persistency related losses in the first half of 2009, which at the time amounted to 107 million, mainly due to premium holidays in Korea and fund withdrawals in India.</p>
          <p>In the second half of the year, lapse losses slowed down to 47 million reflecting the benefit of the action taken to improve customer retention. Other variance and assumption changes including those relating to expense, mortality and morbidity had a net positive contribution to Asian full-year profits of 57 million.</p>
          <p>The US experience variances and assumption changes were overall positive at 225 million in 2009. This includes a 156 million which reflects the beneficial impact on in-force profits &#x2013; on in-force business over the change in the assumption relating to the GMWB utilization rate.</p>
          <p>This assumption was previously based on whether the guarantee was in the money, but our experience during the recent crisis showed that the utilization rate is more strongly correlated to age. Excluding this item, the remaining variances were in line with last year, and include a 40 million expense profit.</p>
          <p>This reflects our success in containing operating expenses in the US notwithstanding the significant increase in business volumes. Finally, the lower UK experience profits reflect a more modest level of portfolio rebalancing activity in 2009.</p>
          <p>On this slide, I summarize the movement on shareholder funds on an EEV basis, at 15.3 billion this is 2% higher in the position at 31% in 2008 and 12% higher in the position of the 2009 mid-point.</p>
          <p>Going from left to right on the chart, you see the 3.1 billion of operating profits. You see a positive short term investment variance of 586 million, reflecting the strong market rebound in the second half of the year, the 235 million one-off IGD hedge cost, taken out early on in 2009 to provide downside protection. A 910 million loss arising from changes to economic assumptions, including a 301 million charge in Jackson for short-term credit risk additional allowance on the in-force business, which I referred to earlier.</p>
          <p>Further down the waterfall, you see the impact of tax dividends and the 750 million of foreign exchange translation loss.</p>
          <p>Turning to our IFRS results, we reported an improved performance up 10% to 1.4 billion, which on an after tax basis covers our full-year dividend 2.2 times. As was the case for EEV, it is the results of our life businesses that underpin this strong performance with an impressive 25% increase to 1,475 billion. What you see coming through this results are the benefits of our approach to cash and capital conservation, combined with our disciplined focus on the back-book.</p>
          <p>This is happening across the business, and this is why we are recording &#x2013; we are reporting year-on-year IFRS operating profit growth in all three regions as shown on the next slide.</p>
          <p>The chart on the left hand side of the page breaks out the contribution to the life operating results by each business. Asia has reported an impressive 77% growth in operating profits to 410 million and now contributes over a quarter of the overall profitability compared to less than say a year ago.</p>
          <p>Included in the Asia result is the one-off benefit of 63 million arising from the change in reserving methodology in Malaysia, which we reported at the entrance. But even without this item, underlying profits are up 50% reflecting the growing maturity of our book. The contribution to life profits from fee-based business is higher by 26 million, and insurance margins are also higher by 55 million. The profit driver analysis, which you can find in the packs, show that profits from insurance margins remain the most significant component of the life results in Asia.</p>
          <p>The IFRS profits of our US business are also higher by 13% to 459 million, benefiting from higher fee income on separate account business, lower back amortization, offset by higher hedging costs. No breakages were experienced in the VA hedging program during the crisis. Over the cumulative 24 month period to the end of 2009, the movement in VA guaranteed benefits and related hedges reported a modest profit.</p>
          <p>The UK also reported an increase in IFRS profitability of 11% to 606 million. There was a reduction in profits attributable to the with-profit business of 114 million due to bonus rate reductions. However, this was more than offset by the superior returns achieved on annuity business, which were 194 higher than 2008. Our sources of earnings remain well diversified, with the insurance component rising at the fastest rate due to the success of our health and protection strategy in Asia.</p>
          <p>Fee-based income is also higher, benefiting from the pick up in US variable annuities in the second half of 2009 and the return of customer appetite for unit-linked business that we saw in the fourth quarter in Asia. We remain confident of our ability to continue to grow IFRS profits -- if we move on to the next slide -- and to diversify the sources of earnings further.</p>
          <p>Our confidence is underpinned by the strong growth in our overall asset and liabilities on which IFRS margins are earned. The growth in policyholder liabilities is depicted on this slide. After allowing for the disposal of Taiwan and foreign exchange, policyholder liabilities increased by 22% or 18 billion in 2009.</p>
          <p>Of this increase some 7 billion was delivered through operational inflows in the US and Asia, which represents the excess of premiums over claims, deaths and surrenders. As you can see on the slide, in 2009, we saw strong inflows in Asia, which are 2.55 billion or equivalent to 25% of opening liabilities.</p>
          <p>Moving on to look at the movement of shareholder funds, on an IFRS basis, at 31 December, 2009 they stood at nearly 6.3 billion, 24% higher than their position a year ago and 34% higher than their midpoint in 2009.</p>
          <p>Going from left to right on the chart you see the 1.4 billion of operating profits, a positive short term investment fluctuation of 271 million, reflecting the strong market rebound in the second half of the year, a loss of 621 million, arising from the sale of Taiwan, which has already been reported, a modest tax charge for the year as the rebound in the market has allowed us to recognize previously unprovided tax losses, a profit of over 1 billion, which arises from the reversal of the unrealized loss position on Jackson's fixed income securities. And then you see the impact of the dividends paid in foreign exchange translation loss.</p>
          <p>I would now like to move onto the evolution of free surplus. It is in this area that you begin to see the transformation in the capital position of the Group. On 31, December 2009, the free surplus held by the Group's life and asset management operations nearly tripled to 2.5 billion, relative to their position at the start of the year. This is due to substantially improved operational free capital flows and the impact of the sale of Taiwan.</p>
          <p>During 2009, the back-book generated underlying free surplus of 2.89 billion, which was 0.5 billion higher than the equivalent figure in 2008, and as I said earlier reflects the growing maturity of our business.</p>
          <p>The back-book surplus constantly covers the investment in new business of 675 million, which was contained in 2009 by our strategy on focusing on high return and short payback products and geographies. Market movements albeit negative were relatively modest. As we indicated at the time of our interims, the sale of Taiwan increased &#x2013; released the 987 million of free surplus, and during 2009 a total of 688 million was remitted to Group.</p>
          <p>You can see on the slide, the proportion of the free surplus that is being held by each business at the end of the year. Some of this will be used to finance cash remittances to the center in 2010. Our approach here is to remit sufficient amounts to allow the center to meet its outgoings with a balance held within each business where it can be deployed more profitably.</p>
          <p>This is an important distinction, and it is for this reason than when that when we look at our ability to cover our central outgoings including the dividend, we use the operational free surplus generated by these businesses rather than actual cash remittances and this is illustrated in the next slide.</p>
          <p>Here, I demonstrate the improved ability &#x2013; our improved ability to support our dividend from the underlying free surplus generated in the Life and Asset Management businesses, after deducting investment in new business and net corporate cash costs.</p>
          <p>At an operating level, in 2009, we extracted higher surpluses from the back-book particularly from Asia and the US and we have lowered the amount of capital invested in writing new business. Net corporate cash costs of 306 million were higher in 2009, due to higher interest payments and lower tax recoveries and 344 million was paid out in dividends.</p>
          <p>After making these deductions, we are left with an underlying free surplus of 764 million, which is 2.5 times higher than the equivalent amount in 2008. Our focus on capital has improved further our ability to support the dividend.</p>
          <p>For completeness, I am also showing the actual central cash movements during 2009. Here, we use actual cash remittances, instead of free surplus. Remember what I said earlier that philosophically we require that businesses remit sufficient cash to allow us to meet our central outgoings. Well this objective was achieved in 2009; net remittances were higher at 688 million, despite the lower dividend from Jackson. However, this was offset by a higher contribution from the UK, which demonstrates the considerable flexibility that we have in the management of cash flows.</p>
          <p>The other items shown in grey relate to the exceptional outflows associated with the sale of Taiwan and the IGD hedge cost, offset by inflows arising from the subordinated debt issuance net of repayments. The chart also highlights the amount of cash that we have at our disposal at the center, which has been accumulated over a number of years and which at the end of 2009, amounted to 1.5 billion sterling.</p>
          <p>You can therefore appreciate, why we manage the central cash flows so that they produce a broadly neutral outcome each year. Our strong preference is to retain surplus capital within the business operations where it can be deployed to attract higher returns.</p>
          <p>Turning to capital, our IGD surplus improved to an estimated 3.4 billion at 31, December, 2009, which is equivalent to a cover of approximately 270%. This is before the 2009 final dividend.</p>
          <p>As you can see, our increased internal capital generation contributed 1.1 billion of the year-on-year increase. You also see the benefits of the proactive steps we have taken during the year to enhance IGD surplus, namely the sale of Taiwan, and the hybrid debt issuance.</p>
          <p>The capital restructuring benefit of 0.9 billion includes a recognition of future with-profit transfers and other internal capital restructuring. This demonstrates the flexibility that we have as a business in managing our overall IGD position.</p>
          <p>My final slide summarizes the credit losses recorded within our IFRS results and update the position on net unrealized losses in the US fixed income book. UK defaults have been minimal in 2009 at 11 million, substantially below our credit default allowance. In line with the approach we adopted at the interims, we have recycled the unused allowance back into our credit default reserves. Impairments on the US fixed income book have continued at a steady run-rate through the year in US dollar terms, amounting to 630 million in 2009.</p>
          <p>Approximately 80% of these relate to the RMBS portfolio, predominately on prime and Alt-A book of structured securities. The net unrealized loss position, reported at the start of 2008, has completely unwound to a net unrealized gain of 4 million at the end of 2009. The threat that this posed to our capital position a year ago has not materialized.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. I'd like to now hand back to Tidjane.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Nic. I hope that the information that, Nic has shown you has left you with a clear picture of the strength of our performance in 2009. I would like now to move on to the acquisition of AIA, the other topic of the day. This is an Asian story and that's where I would like to start because the best way to think about the growth potential in life-insurance in many markets is to start with GDP.</p>
          <p>Forecasting GDP growth in the short-term is an industry and is a very difficult activity, but over longer period of times, we have been able in history to be much more accurate in our forecasts, so these are GDP growths over the next 20 years, and it paints a very interesting picture. For those who doubt the importance, I always that Argentina and the US have the same GDP in 1900, so making the right bet can make a big difference, whether you end up number one in Argentina or in the US. So these things matter over the long-term.</p>
          <p>40% of the increase in the <mark type="inaudible" /> GDP will come from Asia ex-Japan. There is no getting away from it, global economic growth will be driven by emerging Asia and interestingly that's anecdotal, but I wanted to have it on the chart, it takes us back by 2013 to something like 1870, it was interesting. So it's not a state of the world that we haven't known before. As you know, and that's the next slide &#x2013; insurance penetration in these emerging Asia markets is significantly lower than in the West, so you have a double or triple powerful effect of faster GDP growth, high savings rates, compounded by insurance increasing as a share of GDP.</p>
          <p>So if you want meaningful growth in life-insurance, you need to be well positioned in Asia. We have performed some analyses of global profit pools for life-insurance over the next five years. I mean these numbers are familiar to many of you. What you see from this chart is that total profits from Asian life-insurance will be at similar level to the US and Europe by 2014.</p>
          <p>However, growth will be significantly higher on the horizontal axis, and it will also be more profitable on the vertical axis. But one comment I want to make about this is that I think it gives a wrong impression of Asia and that takes us to the next chart. And I put there the cross, which is the center of East Asia bubble and I always emphasize that it's an empty space. So that is not the right way to think about that continent, because it is just a mix of very, very different places.</p>
          <p>So all you get is a mathematical average of that, and it doesn't mean much. For me to get into meaningful comments, you really need to get to a much more granular level and this has been a very powerful tool in the way we drive the margins, the way we drive capital around the Group. The numbers that, Nic communicated earlier, giving you the margins by region in Asia are completely different. It has to drive the capital allocation and the strategy of the Group. If you see the top bubble, they are red. These are the one I want to focus on is southeast Asia, which I define as Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, Hong Kong and Singapore.</p>
          <p>These are the most profitable markets with the highest growth potential, what I call the sweet spot of life-insurance. So let's be clear. I often say to people internally, I am not really in love with Asia, I'm just in love with high growth, high profitability market and there are just a large number of them in Asia and that drives our strategy. So if we go back to AIA, I would just like to remind quickly everybody the key features of the company. And I would like to start by saying what I said to the AIG Board last week a very important presentation, that AIA is an excellent company with strong prospects.</p>
          <p>Those of you who have looked at the company in preparation for its IPO will, I'm sure, have come to the same conclusion. It is a business with seven, top five positions across Asia, around 300,000 agents and over 20 million customers. It is the dominant insurance franchise in Thailand, a leading operator in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Philippines, and you will see the similarity and the overlap with the comments I've just made about the attractiveness of different countries in Asia.</p>
          <p>It is, by any measure, a scale operator, with post-tax IFRS earnings of over 900 million pounds in '09 and AIA is a business with a strong in-force book as we know. I've then addressed &#x2013; given you some more color on the geographics bit, of the company's earnings and embedded value. You will see from this chart, the significant scale and geographic diversity of AIA's earnings and balance sheet.</p>
          <p>You can also see that four markets, including Hong Kong, Thailand and Singapore account for about three-quarters of the business on each measure. So let's try and look now at what the transaction will mean for the combined business. In business, we often use the word transformational and wrongly, but I believe that in this case, we can use it rightly. I'll just use as an indicator of a percentage of a company which is Asian, however, its embedded value, whether it's IFRS earnings or new business profits, this transaction really transforms the profile and the nature of our company.</p>
          <p>We will have an embedded value of over 23 billion pounds, IFRS earnings of over 2.5 billion pre-tax and new business profit post-tax of GBP1.5 billion pounds. The next slide shows you one of the reasons why I think this deal is particularly interesting, is that the companies are a great fit for one another. In the major markets of Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia both businesses have a strong presence and we will increase there our scale advantages for reduced operating costs.</p>
          <p>Secondly, there are markets and that's a characteristic of this acquisition, where one company is significantly larger than the other. We are almost a mirror image of each other, because we've competed so hard, against each other. So AIA in Thailand and the Philippines is several multiples larger than us, and we in Indonesia and Vietnam are significantly larger than them, which also makes integration in both cases relatively easy and I'll come back to that.</p>
          <p>So this range of complementary markets is what will make us the undisputed Pan-Asian insurance company. The combined company will be the largest life insurer in every single southeast Asian markets. Being well positioned in these attractive markets has been a key driver of our recent success, so there is no change in strategy here, so it's a continuation. And this will give us an unrivaled platform to take our performance to the next level.</p>
          <p>Just a word about capital. It is our estimate that post completion, the IGD surplus of the company will be around 2.6 billion, a strong capital position with a solvency ratio we estimate at 188%. The key ratios that rating agencies look at are expected to remain within the single A range or better, and we would expect to move progressively up that band over the next few years, given the earnings power of the new company. It is our intention to retain our current dividend policy, it is important. We are confident that the AIA earnings can support a consistent payout ratio across the enlarged Group.</p>
          <p>The new shares issued will be entitled to the 2010 dividend adjusted for the bonus factor. With that, I would like to hand over to Barry to talk about cost and revenue synergies, because he will have to deliver many of those. So, Barry?</p>
          <p>Barry Stowe, Executive Director</p>
          <p>Thanks, Tidjane. The combination of Prudential and AIA will result in a business, which has lower unit cost and hence higher levels of profitability than either of the companies could have achieved on their own. And I would point out that to date, we have only assessed synergies related to management expenses. We fully anticipate phased cost synergies of US$340 million, approximately three-fifths of these savings will come from eliminating duplication in the two head offices, with the remainder coming from within the local operating units.</p>
          <p>We will act quickly to achieve these synergies with minimum disruption to the front ends of the business. We strongly believe that the dis-synergies from this combination will be minimal. We pride ourselves on being the employer of choice in the region, and we feel the new company will be even more attractive to our employees. I think the best indicator of what you can expect us to accomplish with AIA can be found in the results that we have generated with our own business, where we have been driving a specific program of improvement over the past three years.</p>
          <p>Many of you will recall that we were in this room together for an Asia Investor Day in December of 2006, and during those presentations, we made some specific commitments to you. We made commitments around agency distribution, where we promised to increase the scale and productivity of our agency channel across the region. We made commitments about partnership distribution, where we sought to give you comfort about the durability of our longstanding relationship with Standard Chartered Bank and to emphasize our determination to build new partnerships with other partners.</p>
          <p>We made commitments about health products, where we outlined our intent to significantly increase our focus on these products, which are valuable to customers, lucrative to distributors and because of their ability to drive higher margins, very important for shareholders as well. We made commitments about our customers and we pointed out that while our customer base had grown very quickly, that there was work to be done in terms of further penetrating that customer base with additional products and services.</p>
          <p>And finally, we made commitments about asset management, where we talked about the importance of continually improving performance for customers, be they unit-linked life customers, retail funds customers or institutional customers, both internal and external. I believe it is fair to say, based upon the full-year results you have seen today, that we have delivered on the promises that we made 39 months ago in this room, including, as Tidjane said, or I think as, Nic said actually, as we should all say, honestly, we should talk about this as much as we can, we doubled our new business profit, which I think some of you might not have expected, and we did it in the most difficult environment you could possibly imagine that during a financial disruption that none of us would have envisioned when we were here 39 months ago.</p>
          <p>Our disciplined focused on these commitments has allowed us to emerge from the crisis with a business that is stronger than it has ever been and one that continues to improve, and one that has genuine momentum. This should give you significant confidence that the synergies that we briefly outline on this slide will be relentlessly driven and delivered by our team in Asia. When we were last together at our half-year results, which was in August, we illustrated the momentum building in the business by showing you the quarter-over-quarter improvement in our results in some of our most important and most cash generative markets.</p>
          <p>So it's only right that we provide you with an update on our most current results on that same basis. In Singapore, our fourth quarter was the second best quarter in the history of our company, with sales results that were 55% over the third quarter and 85% over the fourth quarter of 2008. In Indonesia, the fourth quarter of 2009 was the best quarter in the history of our company, with sales that were 44% over the third quarter and 35% over the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>In Malaysia, the fourth quarter was the best quarter in the history of our company with sales that were 95% over the third quarter, and 72% over the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>And finally in Hong Kong, our fourth quarter was the best quarter in the history of our company with sales results that were 61% over the third quarter, and 98% over the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Of paramount importance in any transaction of this kind are strong strategic capabilities and disciplined execution. I believe that our track record over the past three years demonstrates that we are capable and that we are disciplined, but perhaps it would be helpful to share one final example, which might provide you with further confidence, and that's the right slide.</p>
          <p>On January, we signed an SPA for the purchase of UOB Life in Thailand, in Indonesia, and of course, Singapore. We also singed bancassurance agreements for each of those markets with UOB on that same day. By January 31, we had received the necessary approvals by regulators in each market. The next day on February 1, we launched an entire range of products in all 417 UOB branches in these markets. All of this was accomplished in the space of three weeks.</p>
          <p>You will understand that our first quarter results are not on the agenda today, so I'm not able to provide specifics on the sales levels we have achieved since launch in UOB. But I can tell you that the results exceed the sales levels that we assumed in the business plan used to justify the transaction.</p>
          <p>It has been my view for sometime that the combination of AIA and Prudential would create the best insurance company in the world, one with unparallel prospects for future success. This view is routed in a very strong strategic and financial case, but it is also heavily informed by my own unique perspective, having been a part of both organizations and having a depth of insight into both organizations.</p>
          <p>While Prudential and AIA had been strong competitors for over a decade, the similarities of the two organizations far outnumber the differences. I have no doubt that the task ahead of us is challenging. All transactions of this type present great challenges.</p>
          <p>Equally, I had absolutely no doubt that we will once again deliver on our commitments. Thanks very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to bring this one up again, because there are two things I couldn't do today, one was stopping Barry from presenting this. I don't think I've ever seen him more upset than when it was suggested that we move Q4 because he was embarrassed by his Asia results and was really upset. And two, to getting not to say anything about Q1, we weren't supposed to say, but there you go anyway. So you've got Barry's view now on Q1.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to integration, Barry has just talked to you about some of the cost synergies and revenue opportunities, and I'd like now to talk about the integration of the two businesses at a relatively general level at this point, and just to enunciate a few principles.</p>
          <p>The first point and the key point of our integration approach is to ensure but we continue to focus on maintaining the momentum, by that I mean the commercial momentum in both businesses, because we're all very aware that in a fast growing region, I have in my carrier very often seen mergers and integration that's an opportunity to gain market share. Having done it others, I don't want it done to us. So we will ruthlessly continue to drive the commercial performance forward as we have done from Prudential with the results that you've just seen. We continue to do the same thing with AIA, so an absolute focus on commercial momentum.</p>
          <p>We understand also clearly the need to retain and motivate the agency force and all the employees and critically to maintain the strong customer relationships and partnership relationship that we're buying here. I took a chance, my HR Director, I feel he left Saturday, thinking that we would sign between now and &#x2013; and so today she is in Asia, she has joined Bob Benmosche, they are meeting people at AIA as I speak.</p>
          <p>I'll relieve myself tomorrow evening and I will tour the countries with Bob Benmosche, I will go everywhere and hold tangible meetings and talk to people and explain why we believe in this product, why we think it's positive, why we think it's going to be successful, and we are absolutely ready to hit the ground and running on that level.</p>
          <p>So this will remain on top of the agenda &#x2013; sorry, during the whole period. We'll be pragmatic in our decision making. For example, we have decided to run a multi-brand approach, Prudential is already a multi-brand company. We have Jackson National Life in the US from MNG, organizer of the Chelsea Flower Show in the UK. We are very comfortable living with old well-established valuable brands. We think AIA is a very good brand in Asia. We have over market research on the brand, we like it and we're going to continue to manage it.</p>
          <p>We will try to generate efficiencies through middle and back office integration, not by trying to give our sales proceeds, which is a famously difficult exercise. Every percentage point of growth in Asia is a fully valuable and that will be our primarily focus.</p>
          <p>There are four comments on the integration. First, the Hong Kong headquarters. This is a classic merger of overlapping headquarter activities. The way we manage this will be critical to setting the tone for the whole integration, and we are, I think, well underway of getting that challenge.</p>
          <p>Then you have three markets, and I said that earlier Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia were the two companies have about the same size, this market represents huge opportunities, huge embedded value, are critical in Asia, and we must build there very high performing businesses. They are also competitive, for instance, in Malaysia we have two types of full businesses, so we effectively have to merge four companies.</p>
          <p>In many of our markets, as I said earlier, we have one player, which is larger than the other, significantly larger. And there we'll work to make sure that we add the two together to reinforce selling positions in each of those key markets.</p>
          <p>And finally in China and India, we have different legal and JV positions. In this large important market, we will tailor our approaches to maximize our positions going forward. Another big area of focus for us is the area, of course, of regulation and competition, and I distinguish the two deliberately. We have regulatory approvals and we have antitrust approvals and the two are separate issues.</p>
          <p>We have looked extremely carefully at this. I completed last year a three-month study. I hired a lawyer from in each of these markets, which gave us legal opinions on the challenges of each of regulatory approval and antitrust. We've refreshed this very significantly, invested another two months in it this year. So this is something we'll understand and we are very conscious of as I speak and Barry gave me the feedback.</p>
          <p>All our CEOs have been brought inside in each country. They have met with the regulator in each country, so I now have the feedback from the regulator in each and every country in Asia by noon of day one. So we are undergoing, we are going to deal with this issue. We are well positioned in all those countries, well regarded, well connected, so is AIG. And one thing about Bob Benmosche and I will do from Wednesday on is we will seek together regulator in each of those countries, so we are very confident that this is something we can manage. It's been very well discussed and very well rehearsed and we will manage it.</p>
          <p>The UOB, the UOB acquisition we're quite proud of, because there was regulatory approval and we did sign January 6th and we did sell the first policy at February 4th. I think that gives you an indication, a concrete one, of what we're able to achieve in those markets, in those countries.</p>
          <p>So, moving on to valuation; we'll talk about a number of metrics. These slide shows you how the combined Group would be valuated compared to our listed Asian insurers based on Friday's closing price of our shares and the price we are paying for AIA. Or maybe sums up reasonably well what we are offering to shareholders today, elite company with a fantastic Asian franchise still trading at Europe multiples.</p>
          <p>If we move on to new business profit, and this is an important point. I'd like to spend sometime in this. This slide also tells you the story of the opportunity for our shareholders, because this is a business at an inflection point. It's a very interesting point to debate. It is an excellent business with strong franchises, but its performance in 2009 was weak. And frankly, Barry has something to do with that.</p>
          <p>New business volumes were affected both by the financial crisis and by the insolvency of AIG. First quarter 2009 volumes were down 40% year-on-year and the new business margin fell by referred.</p>
          <p>Despite a strong recovery in volumes towards the end of the year, new business profit for the year fell 41% to 563 million. This growing number for key metric provided us with an opportunity. It can look like a high multiple, if you look at it in a way, but it has made the IPO of a business more challenging. And if there is new business franchise that performed as well as ours during 2009, we would not be in this position today. So we are at an inflection point, and I'm confident that we can restore AIA's engine to good levels very quickly for two reasons.</p>
          <p>Firstly, this is already happening. We met last week in New York with the CEO and the CFO. So, sales thus far this year, remember that their financial year begins in November, so we have their Q1, so December, January, February, have been running at significantly higher levels than previous year and at better margins.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we believe that we are the most productive agency force in the region, as Barry has described. So putting all that together, we think that we'll come back to a reasonable level at 770, which is not that demanding, because the last number before the restructuring was 962, so the run rate is significantly higher than this. So we're comfortable with the multiples there.</p>
          <p>The deal itself values AIA at 35.5 billion. This represents a price through 2009 year-end embedded value of 169 times, a number which is almost identical to recurrent consensus some of the past valuation of our own Asian business. We think this is a fair price for a great company. We look potential for significant value creation in combining the two businesses.</p>
          <p>In terms of IFRS earnings, the multiple is 24.7 in 2009 or 21.1, including cost synergies. As I said already, the cost synergies are important and we will deliver them and I'm confident that we will exceed them. We are not, however, what we see as the main source of value creation from this deal.</p>
          <p>In addition to these cost synergies, we estimate that revenue synergies, and I know they're generally discounted, but this is a story in the fastest growth area in the world, so I believe revenue synergies really matter. After allowing for dis-synergies, because we think there will be dis-synergies in the short-term will be $700 million per annum pre-tax.</p>
          <p>The new business value multiple is 25.4 '09, but as I have already explained, we believe very significant scope to increase that NVP and that the '09 data point is in that duration.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, there is a lot of information on structure and funding, so let me pick up the main points. The acquisition will be executed from a creation of a new top cost structure which will act as the holding company and acquire both Prudential and AIA. It will be funded through a combination of the rights issue, an equity consideration of shares in Prudential, mandatory convertible securities, preferred securities and senior debt.</p>
          <p>The rights issue component will be for a net total of 20 billion or &#xA3;30.1 billion, which is fully underwritten as you know by now by Credit Suisse, JPMorgan and HSBC. The final terms of a rights issue are expected to be set at the time of a publication of the prospectus.</p>
          <p>The mandatory convertible will be for $3 billion or &#xA3;2 billion and will be priced by reference to the closing price on Friday, February 26, so that's agreed adjusted for the estimated full year dividend and the rights issue size.</p>
          <p>It will have 375 coupon with the lowest strike of 100% of a reference price and an upper strike of 125% of a reference price. It will have a three-year maturity with no reserve rates, and a two-year effective lock-up. You can do an NPV calculation, but this tells you that 35.5 is actually the lower number in terms of NPV.</p>
          <p>Preferred securities will be for US$2 billion or &#xA3;1.3 billion and will pay a 6.25 coupon, but it's tax deductible. It will be perpetual, non-callable with a ten-year effective maturity and a 1% coupon step up in year '10. The security will be marketable after 12 months.</p>
          <p>The senior debt component will be for a net total of 5 billion or &#xA3;3.3 billion that will be fully underwritten by Credit Suisse, JPMorgan and HSBC. The bond will be of five and ten year old maturity. And the transaction of course, is subject to a number of agreed-upon conditions, including regulatory and anti-trust and shareholder approvals.</p>
          <p>In terms of our anticipated time table to completion, we expect to publish the prospectus and circular in late April or early May. We intend to hold the shareholder meetings to approve the rights issue and the acquisition in May. The rights issue trading period is due to commence the day after shareholder approval is gained with the rights issue trading period closing in early June. It is currently anticipated that we will have &#x2013; gain regulatory approval and we will complete the transaction during the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Fully in completion, the proceeds and vendor consideration will be released to AIG and Prudential Plc will be delisted at the same time as new Prudential is listed and admitted to trading on the NSE.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion, this is a rare opportunity to bring together two outstanding franchises. I firmly believe that combing Prudential and AIA will allow us to create an organization whose potential outstrips the already significant prospects with two companies that had as a standalone business. We are starting on the fantastic journey together and today is just a beginning.</p>
          <p>With that, I thank you for your patience, and now we will take your questions. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Good morning, everyone. It's Jon Hocking from Morgan Stanley. Two questions, if I may. Firstly, on due diligence, it's obviously paralyzed business very well, but how much time and opportunity we have to do detailed work on that point?</p>
          <p>And then second, I realize this is about creating a growth business at a low multiple, but can you comment a little bit about how you think the administration work, what year do you think this deal will be accretive to earnings both on EEV and IFRS this year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's been really a two-step story. We invested, I think, it's well known now a lot of time and effort in this asset last year in the first quarter. With the full due diligence, we have access to all the reports. We ended up with a different conclusion at the time, relative size, relative valuation, the valuation of the asset, the expectation of the vendor that we couldn't agree, but a lot of work on the regulation and anti-trust of the asset was <mark type="inaudible" />, and also frankly we had some issues with the EEV that's a big part of the discussion then. Since then, we've done a very good job in preparing the asset for the IPO.</p>
          <p>We have been working on this for, I can say, three months. We have had a lot of contacts at CEO levels with the company &#x2013; we have had access to large amount of data. We are very comfortable with EEV. I think that before we have had to take a big haircut on it. We are comfortable with the EEV. We've run it under our assumptions and we end up with very similar results. So we are comfortable with where we are. We think that we've had really a good look at the asset.</p>
          <p>And also the benefit of a transaction they work for us. Well, I think we are in a unique position as we know these businesses very well, because we compete with them so closely. Barry could tell you exactly country-by-country what we sell, what they've done, we have done, who runs them, how, and having been at AIG himself, and a number of our people running PCA being in the same position. So there is a familiarity there, which is I think unique in M&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Accretion, we think that neutrality in 2012 is achievable. We believe we're very confident that with the numbers we've seen we can achieve that. As we get more access to inside AIA, we will be able to update you I think with more detail and more granularity, but we're very confident that we can be neutral by 2012.</p>

          <p>Oliver Steel, Deutsche Bank. Just one question. The first question was accretion date. It Iooks as if you may have to sell the Chinese business of AIA, probably the Indian one as well, and you're also talking about a Hong Kong listing after completion, which suggests to me you're getting extra money in first date of completion on top of the 35.5 billion that you are actively raising for the acquisition, so is that right that you are looking towards extra money on top of the purchase price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with China. As you know, you all know that the AIA has an unique position in China with 100% owned business. It's the only foreign company in that position. Our view there is that we are going to talk to CRIC, to a regulator, first of all and understand what their thinking is there. If in the end we have to dispose off a business, we will. It will not mean for us an exit from China. In any case, we're very happy we spoke to Chairman Don this morning. He's the Chairman of CTIC, our partner in China, very complimentary on the transaction, very impressed, very positive and we like our business in China. We would keep it under any scenario. If we have to sell the Chinese business of AIG, given the kind of multiples, Chinese business is attractive, we don't think that it will be a challenge if we have to sell it. So it's something that needs to be resolved in the coming weeks.</p>
          <p>In India, there is, I think the historic position of our regulator has been that, a foreign player is not allowed to have two separate ventures. You know the longer as the ICICI Prudential is world performing, it got 12, 13% market share. It's fair to say that TATA AIG has not known the same degree of success, and that is something we're going to have to resolve in talking to TATA and with AIG, but I don't anticipate any particular difficulty. On the listing, Nic, do you want to say a word on local listing?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean, I think we committed today in the announcement that we made that we will pursue at your listing in Hong Kong. At this stage, there is no intention to raise additional equity at the time that we do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, can I come back on that. I mean, to get liquidity in Hong Kong that you are listing, you will need to assure extra equity. It seems to me as you sell in China, you will get extra money in <mark type="inaudible" /> (1:11:26.1) India. So I don't understand why you need a $20 billion rights issue plus then expect to get proceeds from those three issues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if we issue it will be really a marginal amount. I mean try to think about the new company and what its status is going to be as a stock. If we're talking about a very different, a very different entity here and a must hold stock frankly. We've a huge Asian <mark type="inaudible" />. We may have to issue something, but it will be in the context of the new group, not the kind of issuance that we make <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>People generally in Hong Kong tell you that between 500 and &#xA3;1 billion you got to create enough liquidity for trading, so far that new company that would be a relatively immaterial amount of capital raising. Greig?</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> Three questions as usual. Nic, you've got a general account at US fixed annuity general accounting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My understanding is as a US fixed annuity strong general accounting, and if you just talk about the asset quality within that account, it's not necessarily invested in US. Retail mortgage-backed securities or something like that.</p>
          <p>And the second thing is, Tidjane, you made some comments a month ago about South Korea sort of pulling the foot off the accelerator there, does that mean you'll probably combine the two groups and they sell the South Korean operations, if you will, what sort of money do you think you could raise there?</p>
          <p>And as a third point, I know in India you have a particular problem versus your peer groups and if you don't have a fixed formula to increase your stake from 26 to 49, do you know has your due diligence discovered whether that Tata has a fixed formula, therefore it doesn't have an option against <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, <mark type="inaudible" /> in the asset portfolio, I should have mentioned that in my comments because that was also a concern when we looked at the asset a year ago. We know that Blackrock has done an enormous amount of work on the asset portfolio, and we've got every assurance that it's high quality.</p>
          <p>And looking at David Belsham here, it's more akin to our asset portfolio in the UK in terms of rating and quality of the paper than what we have in Jackson. So it's not a source of concern, again it's been really scrubbed clean, and it's been transferred back to AIG, so we're getting something of very high quality. So, one of the many benefits of the <mark type="inaudible" /> for us very, very beneficial.</p>
          <p>South Korea, just a word, because we have a turnaround program in South Korea, which is going well, Barry, you want to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The South Korea is a complicated market, but it's not a market that we think we cannot make money in. We just need to be very diligent and disciplined about how you approach the market. Obviously in most markets where we're present, we love the macroeconomic environment, the regulatory environment, all elements in the market work from our perspective and we drive for growth. And being number one is better than being number two and number three. That is not the case in Korea because of the complexity of the market.</p>
          <p>There are elements of distribution there that are very difficult from our perspective as we view everything through this value of a volume lens, so bank distribution honestly is quite complicated in Korea, just by nature of the regulatory environment and how it works. Independent distribution there, non-tied agency is complicated, because sort of the custom in the market is to advance commissions on sales. So that creates not just financial stress on products, but it creates opportunities for fraud and it's not a good dynamic. It's not a good sustainable way to build agency-based business.</p>
          <p>Tied agency, however, does work there if you do it properly and is disciplined, and in fact, average case sizes in the market are high and you can sell protection in the market. So, there is latitude in the market to build a good business. So, what we really say about Korea is that we're focused on the things that make economic sense. We are not focused on market share because it's more than perhaps any place else in the region, market share for its own sake will just lead you down the path to destruction.</p>
          <p>And in terms of combining the two businesses and then selling them off, I think we need to get our hands around what we're doing in our business would impact the AIA franchise there and then take it forward. There are some very good people in the AIA business in Korea, including the guy that runs it, the guy named Seung Lee, and so we've got some work to do. But we wouldn't completely write-off Korea, you just have to take a disciplined approach.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And of course <mark type="inaudible" /> we don't know the nature of the agreement between Tata and AIG, but it will be something we will find out about in the future, but fundamentally we don't anticipate any difficulty. There are already conversations as far as we know between the two parties about the separation, so that shouldn't be very difficult.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andy Hughes, ICAP. Couple of questions, if I may. One, first of all, on the asset split from what Greig was talking about, is it true to say that AIG has a lot more traditional non-linked products in its portfolio, and therefore takes on a lot more credit risk not just in the sort of US fixed annuity board, but across most of the product types? And how comfortable are you with that, particularly in the uncertain outlook for market growth for the credit that we're in today.</p>
          <p>And the second question is on the sort of investment-linked lapses that you've seen within your own portfolio. Clearly you've made a charge in the year, which is equivalent to the experience variance, and obviously they aren't very long-term contracts, so how confident are you that you won't have to make another very large experience variance relating to the adjustment you've made this year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Andy. On the credit risk, as I said, the portfolio is really of very high quality. We've had a lot of credit migration, and when you look at where they were in November, it's really mostly AA, A, vary for memory just a few percent of BBB, maybe 8 or 9%. It's a really high quality portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. Does it take away capacity for credit risk elsewhere in the group or can you still continue to sell the UK annuities and US fixed annuities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's good question, no, it doesn't. My CRO is here, but we look at it relatively closely &#x2013; I mean, what you have is a mismatch, and so you have a maturity gap there that needs to be managed proactively because of the nature of the products we have sold. But from <mark type="inaudible" /> it's not going to limit us elsewhere in the group, we don't think. And on the investment-linked lapses, I mean, they're mostly in Korea as we're communicating, but Nick do you want to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, yeah, we've looked at the both experience and the need to change the assumptions. Actually experience that we saw in the second half of the year confirmed the position that we took in the first part of the year, particularly in places like Korea. We were a quite prudent in the establishment of those assumption changes. We assume that once a particular policy goes into premium holiday that is effectively popped, it won't be restored.</p>
          <p>And we looked &#x2013; we took the opportunity to make one or two changes elsewhere. I'm confident on the basis of what I've seen and I've looked at this for the first time that we are in a strong position.</p>
          <p>You have to also bear in mind that you're talking, at the end of the day, relatively small numbers in the context of an embedded value in Asia. There is about 5 billion, so less than 1%, I believe the embedded value is robust.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Nick Holmes, Nomura. I just wanted to go back to the EPS neutrality aim. This is obviously very, very important, and I wondered if &#x2013; sorry, I apologize for my voice. I wondered if you could help us to understand a little bit better the scale of the challenge that you have by &#x2013; perhaps telling us what level of EPS dilution, for example, might be acceptable to you in 2011. I don't know if that's relevant way of approaching this subject, but some sort of idea that the scale of the challenge that you feel lies with you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what you need if you want a number, you're going to need something like you're about 450 million away pre-tax from EPS neutrality. So what you're trying to do is to add 450 million over '10, '11 and '12 as a whole US. So that gives you a sense of the numbers we're talking about here. We announced 340 pre-tax which you can convert into 250 and you got another 200 to find over the next few years. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Three questions. Raghu Hariharan from Citi. The first one is around the change in stance between today and '08, obviously you looked at the business in '08 and you made a decision this time around. I'm just wondering, what is the change in terms of what you've seen. It doesn't seem to be valuation, but correct me if I'm wrong, s what really made you made up your mind?</p>
          <p>The second one was around AIA's earnings. I know you showed a slide showing the amount of slack that is there is new business profits, do you see any similar slack in their earnings that you can work your magic on?</p>
          <p>And lastly was on rating, you said your aim for the A rating or higher-end of the A rating, I was wondering how does that affect Jackson's business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the trend versus '08. I think the change is in both sides, on the AIG side and on our side. If you look at AIG, I'm sure many of you saw the report; the estimated EV was 25 to 40 billion US, and that was an EV, if I remember correctly, at August 31, 2008. So, it was an EV <mark type="inaudible" /> with no roll forward.</p>
          <p>Okay, so part of a plan that everybody were trying to price, the asset had was that you just didn't have the information to do that, because when you were in January '09, we all knew what happened between August '08 and January '09. And you just had no visibility, you didn't know. And I think we got the road forward something like in late February 2009. That was the first difficulty.</p>
          <p>And I think the expectation of a seller explicitly, because we don't wish to have a multiple of more than one of that EV. If I remember correctly, I think that AXA was worth $20-something billion at the time. So there was just no match between supply and demand. We were worth &#xA3;6 billion, I remember, vividly. And so the other thing that happened is that it more than doubled. We were more than doubled. If you look at the EEV, it's 21.054 billion in dollars. So, we've got 5 billion below the bottom end of the rent that they indicated then. So that point moved and we moved up too. So the conjunction of the two plus, the big change occurring, I think, Greig, I assume you mentioning <mark type="inaudible" /> is in this deal, okay? So that's a big difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How much must we add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How much must we add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can give you some numbers later, but it's also been cleaned, because it used to have a negative drift when we looked at it. They changed the assumptions, and when you go around business-by-business, because we have the old report. We've corrected most of the problems that were in the underlying books, so we're selling really a clean asset. So that gives us somewhat better numbers, cleaner assets and a better valuation for us and the ability to acquire it. <mark type="inaudible" /> season, but to the earnings power, we think it's very, very strong.</p>
          <p>What we said about the productivity is real. We think &#x2013; and actually AIA believes that too, when I talked to Bob Benmosche. One reason why we're going to hold 11% of the new company, that's not an insignificant amount, they actually truly believe that there is more value in this preposition running in the IPO. The Board would not have made the decision or otherwise.</p>
          <p>So we're coming in thinking that yes, we can absolutely generate, they know how it's competitive. Again, two very good companies, but the differences between the aging populations are significant. Some of you have come to Jakarta and seen how we train people, the quality of our training, the investment we make in educating the sales force. So that's the reality, and I don't know if it's Barry's magic, but I think it's going to produce some impact in the quarters that come and we'll show you that performance quarter after quarter. Rob, if you want to add something on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, I would just reemphasize the agency productivity, because we've always felt intuitively. I mean, we thought there's a lot of evidence that our agent productivity was materially higher than theirs. But we're not getting real detailed numbers, it's difficult to say. And during the course of this process, we were able to get information which allowed us to do some benchmarking and it showed that in every market, say for Thailand, and in fact, we are materially more productive and efficient in our agency force than they are, so some real value to be created there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And this is not a negative comment about <mark type="inaudible" /> it's all very friendly, but I think it's just the fact that two companies are different ages, and the population of agents is different and they behave differently, so that translates into the numbers directly <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on ratings. I think part of the reason that we have &#x2013; and we have structured the financing of the deal in a fairly conservative way. And back of our mind, we wanted to make sure that we remained under right side of the line in terms of some of the rating agency constraints on leverage and fixed charge cover. And of course, as we deliver some of the synergies and as the operational performance of the asset picks up later, then we will create some headroom within that.</p>
          <p>As to the impact on &#x2013; now how the rating agencies will evaluate it? Of course it's not just on the metrics, it's on the number of other factors and conversations happening as we speak. In relation to the impact for Jackson, the degree of that would be judged by reference to the overall rating position of the group, but also down to its own capital position.</p>
          <p>Jackson finishes the year with an RBC ratio of 417% with only a very modest reliance in that 417% permitted practices. We've got permitted practice only in relation to the SAP 86 derivative item contributed around 19 percentage points. So Jackson's position is strong on a standalone basis.</p>
          <p>In terms of the element of the business that is rating sensitive is only the <mark type="inaudible" /> business, and we've already said that we have little appetite for that type of business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But to your question I should also mention that you can expect some multiple expansion as the growth materializes, and we show our ability to grow and that will help too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. And with new holding company being set up, does that open up &#x2013; and we've obviously seen <mark type="inaudible" /> on the horizon, is that just the group's wider legal restructuring with a view toward moving blocks of business elsewhere, may be outside of the scope of Solvency II?</p>
          <p>Secondly on the other situation that we can be assuring as part of the financing package, are they going to be issued as of the new holding company, obviously the 9D convertible and <mark type="inaudible" /> and Tier 1 security as well?</p>
          <p>And finally, all your existing securities got issued at PLC, are there any plans to move those up to the new Topco to ensure that in relationship to shareholders and fixing investors &#x2013; is maintained under the new growth group structure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the holding company and Solvency II, may be a word on Solvency II, it's always an interesting topic. Our view remains what I said at previous results that really is a moving target of discussion. We don't really know where it is going to land. We are extremely, extremely, extremely active in the lobbying and all the debates on the various items. We will see where it lands. But clearly what you said is an option, so it gives us optionality that we possibility didn't have before. So it's something to keep in mind.</p>
          <p>On the securities and the hold-co question, I think that will be issued at the whole group and after creation of a company we should move the <mark type="inaudible" /> at the same level. I'm sorry, what is your third question? Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. <mark type="inaudible" />. Couple of questions. Could you give us a bit more detail about the cash generation of AIA? What's coming off the back-book? How much being reinvested in new business IRRs and paybacks?</p>
          <p>And secondly, this is with regard to the question, you're issuing paper at one times to buy a company on 1.7 times, and the company which you're clearly outperforming in its end market, and what's the rationalization for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. The cash generation, you see the kind disclosures, we have given that so I hope that we will be able to give you more granularity. Based on the numbers we've seen, the business is upstream about US$1 billion every year, but that is not the cash generation. We know that there are a number of regulatory issues that are such that the cash is trapped in a number of places. And that is something interestingly which is linked to the regulatory question, because we think that if there is a normalization of a status of a company in a number of geographies, there will be opportunities to upstream the capital that's locked in. And a very good reason to believe that <mark type="inaudible" /> significant amount. So that's another upside of this deal.</p>
          <p>Honestly, I don't have the answer on the black-book and reinvestment, but we can look at that and come back to you. On the <mark type="inaudible" /> question, I talk about optionality and we talked about solvency too. And for me that's the key aspect of this deal. It opens offers that we didn't have before. In terms of the Group, we haven't put that in our case, but we believe that there will be a re-rating. We believe that the franchise, the brand is very valuable that we are acquiring, and are applying Barry's magic to that franchise will generate a very, very good result. Not really, because they have a great footprint, they have great distribution, it's very, very attractive to us.</p>
          <p>Another area where there will be gains is asset management. We have a good asset management operation in Asia, <mark type="inaudible" />. We have an extraordinary track record of out- performance. And we believe strategically that asset management in Asia is the new frontier and something we have been working on internally. And that's also going to allow us to accelerate our development. The market of high networks in Asia is there, our programs growing very fast. So, there are many, many options in here that we can pursue, which I think will drive value.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Johnny Vo from Goldman Sachs. I have just couple of questions. Just in terms of the target IRR on this investment, can you provide one? The second thing, you just historically proved, operated on a three pillar basis, and clearly the way you do business in Asia now, where do you stand in relation to that strategy and how committed are you to the other two businesses? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the IRR, let's call it high-teens. And this is without any re-rating, any multiple expansion, so we think it's attractive. This is really based on conservative assumptions. It's very unique opportunity. And again, a lot of that is first linked to the nature of the two things you are bringing together as a complimentary. It's a perfect fit. You can merge the number one, number two in insurance in Asia. It's just a fantastic opportunity.</p>
          <p>The Group is going to look quite different. We're going to get a lot of IFRS earnings that we don't have today, coming out of Asia. We're going to get cash, and even more so once we resolve all the capital fungibility issues et cetera. After that, look &#x2013; the UK, we have always said that it was &#x2013; well, I have always said it was a source of capital in cash, and that is supported our rating. I think the first two remain true and the third one to a certain extent. So that doesn't really change.</p>
          <p>And the US is a very good business. That is doing really very well. So, at least in the short term, I don't think there is a change to our approach to those geographies and our need to be present.</p>

Just going back to the anti-trust issue, can you just say if you anticipate being forced to make any disposals in any geography or product line, because I think the point you made about India or China and any comment s you also made. Do you anticipate any disposals of geographies or product lines?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on agent retention, are you anticipating any increase in agents leaving as a result of this deal, maybe for that context of when you actually start to merge the operating entities, and perhaps you could give more detail about what you're planning there because you seem to imply you're going to keep them as separate businesses? And thirdly rather techy, the 5 billion of debt was sort of interest cost should be born, because I realized it's five to 10 years with 7, 8% of the <mark type="inaudible" /> figure? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thanks. Thanks Marcus. Anti-trust, as I said, the only two countries where there is an explicit anti-trust approval are Vietnam and Korea. In Vietnam, the regulatory trajectory are relatively good in <mark type="inaudible" /> questions. Hey, they don't just look at market share, they look at the intensity of the competition, they look at whether there is growth or not, and if there is a lot of growth, a regulator will be, if you wish, less sensitive to market share because he can convince himself or usually there is actually a competition.</p>
          <p>They look at barriers to entry. There have been quiet a few new entrants in Vietnam recently. They have done very well. So the general analysis of the environment indicates that the regulator should be relatively not bothered by the high market share. We already had 40% in Vietnam, and that has never created any issue, because then we also look at it by product category and then the numbers are different.</p>
          <p>In Korea, really given the positions we have that's a trend we would like to have, but we don't have. The addition of the two businesses, the number 12 and the number 16, I don't know if that's exactly a threat in the Korean market. In the other countries, as I said, we have good relationships are going to look. Singapore is very sophisticated. They really, really look at kind of position product by product, and we think that overall we should be okay. So, really this kind of &#x2013; we have had and that's something we discussed intensively with AIG, hasn't showed any hot spots.</p>
          <p>Other than India and China that we have already discussed and that leads to the situation, but not to us. <mark type="inaudible" /></p>

          <p>Well, I think reality is that we will actually be able to improve agent retention because one of the big issues that the AIA agency force has been facing is the uncertainty around their parent company and the sort of effect that has had on consumers' perspective of their products.</p>
          <p>There has never been anything wrong with AIA. We talk about the latitude to improve efficiency and so forth. That's all real. But the reality is they have one the largest and one of the best agency distribution platforms in the region. They've always been very successful. The big issue that has been holding them back are issues that &#x2013; in a lot of respects are beyond the agent's control. This transaction brings closure and certainty. It makes them once again part of a very large and financially stable and well-respected global financial services group. So the reality is, there is lots of upside.</p>
          <p>The intent again &#x2013; the disruption that would be caused by trying to slam two sales forces together in the same office on day one, I mean, we absolutely had no intention of doing that. The brands, both have value, so in most instances we'll be running both brands.</p>
          <p>So from the agents' perspective not that much will change other than we think we can probably do things over a relatively short period of time to improve overall our ability to select agents, recruit new agents, train them, better manage the agents we have to higher productivity. That's good for those agents because they make more money. That's not something that will drive them away. That's something that will drive them further in.</p>
          <p>So my view is, there is a lot of latitude to improve the situation that AIA has been struggling with over the last 15 months.</p>

          <p>Can I have the previous slide? Thank you very much. I know we took you a bit by surprise today, so sorry for the short notice, but the topic warranted it. Again, we are really delighted with the results we've had. We think that if M&amp;A is a right I think we've earned that right for our delivery in 2009. We want to be driving our results. We are thrilled to have the opportunity to acquire AIA. We are convinced that we will generate superior shareholder values. So we will see you again in this room in the coming quarters and half year and years to update you on our company. Thank you very much.</p>
