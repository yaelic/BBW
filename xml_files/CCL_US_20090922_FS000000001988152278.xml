          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Carnival third quarter earnings conference call. The presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we'll conduct a question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, September 22, 2009. I would like now to turn the conference over to Mr. Howard Frank, Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. This is Howard Frank speaking. In Miami with me is David Bernstein, our Senior VP of Finance and the Chief Financial Officer of Carnival Corporation; and Beth Roberts, our Vice President of Investor Relations. Micky Arison has called in. Micky is in Italy, fresh from the delivery of the new Carnival Dream, which will spend the next several weeks in Europe, sailing in Europe, and then returns to New York in November for a couple of days and then will come back down to Port Canaveral for its port sailings.</p>
          <p>I will comment later on the booking picture and how things are looking booking wise. And I'm going to turn it over to David right now to give you the color on the third quarter. David?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Howard. I'll begin the call by reading the forward-looking statement. During this conference call, we will make certain forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, which may cause the actual results, performance, or achievements of Carnival to be materially different from any future results, performances, or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For further information, please see Carnival's earnings press release and its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
          <p>For the third quarter, our earnings per share was $1.33 versus $1.65 in the prior year. During the third quarter, our earnings came in above the midpoint of our June guidance by $0.16. This was driven by better-than-expected net revenue yields, which benefited us to the tune of $0.12. Better pricing on close-in bookings worldwide during the seasonally strong summer period was worth $0.10, while onboard and other revenue contributed $0.02. Overall yields were only down 12.3%, almost 3 points better than the midpoint of our June guidance. In addition, a variety of cost-saving measures benefited us to the tune of $0.03 and resulted in net cruise costs excluding fuel being 1.6 points better than guidance.</p>
          <p>Looking at our third quarter operating results versus the prior year, our capacity increased 5.5% for the third quarter of 2009, with the majority of the increase once again going to our European brands. Our European brands grew 7.5%, while our North American brands grew 3.6%. Also during the third quarter, Costa Asia more than doubled in size as Costa Classica joined Costa Allegra in Asia.</p>
          <p>As I previously mentioned, overall net revenue yields in local currency declined 12% in the third quarter versus the prior year. Now let's look at the two components of net revenue yields. For net ticket revenue, we saw a yield decline of 14% in local currency. Our North American brands were down 20%, driven by declines in all itineraries. Our European brands held up very well, as they experienced only 6% lower local currency ticket yields on higher capacity. For net onboard and other yields, we reported a yield decline of 6.5% in local currency. We saw declines in most of our brands around the world, a trend which we anticipated. Net onboard and other yields in our European brands were down less than our North American brands, similar to our experience in net ticket revenue yields. Net onboard yields for all of the major categories were once again down in the third quarter versus the prior year, but they were down less than they were in the second quarter. In summary, given the economic environment and the impact of the flu virus, which was worth about 1.4 points on third quarter yields, we were very pleased with our yield performance this quarter.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, our cruise costs per available lower berth day, excluding fuel and in local currency, was down 0.7%. However, it should be noted that during the third quarter last year, we received a $26 million insurance settlement. Excluding the settlement, net cruise costs were actually down 2.4%. However, the best measure of cruise cost changes are on an annualized basis, which I will touch on in a moment. Fuel prices this quarter were 39% lower, saving us $211 million, or $0.26 per share. While currency movements reduced our costs to the third quarter, overall currency was a negative drag on earnings of approximately $80 million, or $0.10 per share, as the dollar strengthened versus the euro and the sterling.</p>
          <p>Before I turn to the outlook, let me say a few words about liquidity. At the end of the third quarter, our liquidity was $6.2 billion. This includes 2.6 billion available on our revolvers, almost 700 million of cash excluding cash on hand, and $3 billion of committed financing. Since the June conference call, we've completed three financings worth approximately $800 million. Back in March, we laid out a financing plan for the remainder of 2009 and fiscal 2010, which I indicated would take us six months to complete. I'm happy to report that we fully executed our plans, and we are well positioned through the end of 2010. However, we may still opportunistically increase our liquidity over the next year.</p>
          <p>Turning to our 2009 outlook. I will skip the net revenue yield outlook, as Howard will discuss that in a few moments. Cruise costs per available lower berth day for the full year, excluding fuel and in local currency, are projected to be flat with the prior year. Our operating companies continue to do an excellent job managing their costs. Year to date since the December guidance, our cost savings now total $160 million. Based on the current spot price for fuel, fuel prices for the full year are projected to be $365 per metric ton for 2009 versus $558 per metric ton in 2008, saving us $616 million.</p>
          <p>In addition, we are projecting a $90 million savings in 2009 from reduced fuel consumption. Fuel consumption per ALBD is expected to decline almost 5% this year. As a result of numerous fuel conservation measures, we have been seeing 2 to 3% fuel efficiencies per year for a number of years. The stepped-up focus in this area has benefited us this year with larger declines in fuel consumption. Furthermore, the dollar has strengthened versus the euro and the sterling. So in the end, fuel and currency are driving our costs down. And therefore in current dollars, including fuel, our costs are expected to be down 12%.</p>
          <p>At this point, I will turn the call back over to Howard.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David. Now, for &#x2013; I'll give you an update on the booking picture.</p>
          <p>Throughout the summer, booking volumes have continued to be quite strong, which has enabled us to achieve higher last-minute prices on close-in sailings throughout the fleet. And we actually saw the impact of that in the third quarter as well, as yields came in better than we anticipated, as David indicated.</p>
          <p>As we indicated in the press release, during the last 12 weeks, bookings for the next three quarters have been running 19% ahead, year-on-year. More importantly, as a result of the strong volumes and adjusting for increased capacity, we are now only moderately behind last year's booking levels for the next three quarters. So the gap in occupancies was significantly closed, and the booking curve continues to lengthen. Currently on an overall basis, pricing continues to be stable, and for a limited number of itineraries, where the booking window has pushed further out, we have been able to move prices up.</p>
          <p>Trying to crystal-ball yields for 2010 with any degree of precision is quite difficult at this time, as there are many factors at play, including the degree we are able to raise prices more broadly as the booking curve extends. It was mid-September last year that began the meltdown in the financial markets and at the same time caused our cruise bookings to come to a virtual standstill. So booking volume comparisons will become even more easier in this quarter. And if the current booking trends continue, we should be able to quickly close the remaining occupancy gap, and pricing comparisons should also become easier.</p>
          <p>Because a large part of our first quarter 2010 business has already been sold at lower prices, at this point, it will be difficult to gain enough pricing momentum to catch up with the first quarter yields we experienced in 2009. As a consequence, we expect local currency revenue yields for the first quarter of 2010 to be lower than 2009. Having said that, based on current currency exchange rates, we do expect current dollar revenue yields to be neutral to slightly higher in the first quarter. As the remainder of the year 2010 plays out, if the strong booking volumes continue at this pace, we should start to see a positive local currency yield impact and a gradual year-over-year revenue yield improvement.</p>
          <p>Now turning to new ship deliveries in 2010. We are currently projecting a 7.7% fleetwide increase, 3.6% in North America and 12% in Europe. We have a record six ships scheduled for delivery in 2010. The Costa Deliziosa will be delivered in late January, the AIDAblue in early February, the P&amp;O Azura in late March, the Seabourn Sojourn in late May, Holland America's Nieuw Amsterdam in late June, and Cunard's Queen Elizabeth, the replacement ship for the QE2, in late September.</p>
          <p>So of the six new ships, four ships are for our European brands, which is a continuation of our strategy to expand our business in the less-penetrated European market. As part of this strategy, we're also moving out older ships from the European fleet. The Costa Europa has been charted out to a European tour operator and will leave the fleet in April of 2010. And just recently P&amp;O's Artemis has been sold to another European tour operator for delivery in spring of 2011.</p>
          <p>Now a little bit of color by quarter, and I'll start with the current quarter. We're in the fourth quarter of 2009. Capacity increase for the fourth quarter will be 7.7%: 5.7% in North America, 9.6% in Europe. Overall, at this point in time, occupancy at the North America and Europe brands are approximately at the same levels as in Q4 of last year, so we have caught up considerably. And pricing is lower, but given the strength of late bookings, we do not expect further price deterioration for the quarter. There is very little inventory left to be sold.</p>
          <p>In North America for North American brands, they will have 45% of their capacity in the Caribbean, up from 42% last year. 10% of their capacity is in Europe, just slightly down from 11% last year. And 10% of the capacity will be in the Mexican Riviera cruises out of Southern California. And the balance in Alaska and long and exotic cruises, all of which are individually under 10%.</p>
          <p>Pricing for North American brands in the fourth quarter is lower in all itineraries, with moderately lower pricing in Caribbean and Europe and more significantly lower pricing for Alaska, Mexican Riviera, and long and exotic cruises. This follows a similar pattern we have had throughout the year with higher-priced cruise products suffering more significant declines in yields versus our lower-price products. Mexican Riviera pricing has also been a challenge because of the significant economic slowdown in Southern California, the largest market for these cruises. We expect North American brand pricing to be down in the mid-teens range for the fourth quarter, which is a slight improvement from the third quarter yield deterioration.</p>
          <p>Let me comment about the situation in Alaska. While the cruise industry has held off filing suit to allow the governor of Alaska a chance to reconsider the imposition of the Alaska head tax, the industry has now actually filed the suit. It appears that the proponents of the head tax &#x2013; the original proponents of the head tax &#x2013; have been able to convince the political leaders in Alaska that the global economic crisis is the reason for declining passenger numbers in 2009. This is obviously an incorrect conclusion. Despite the global economic crisis, virtually all cruising areas &#x2013; the Caribbean, Europe, Asia, Australia and South America &#x2013; will see increases in volumes, passenger volumes, in 2010.</p>
          <p>The reason for the rapidly declining numbers in Alaska is the cost of operating cruise ships in Alaska, which have been dramatically risen, together with the higher price our customers pay from the imposition of the head tax resulting from the original initiative. When we compare Alaska to other premium cruise markets during the peak summer months, it is now far less profitable than it has been in the past. Despite significant decreases in Alaska capacity in 2010, early booking trends are still not positive, and our brands are now starting further decreases beyond 2010. This downward spiral is likely to continue until these cost issues are addressed.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to Europe in the fourth quarter of 2009. Europe brands have 78% of their capacity in Europe in the fourth quarter, about the same as last year. The balance of their capacity is in various other itineraries, including trans-Atlantics and the Caribbean. Pricing for Europe brand itineraries is moderately lower across most itineraries, and we expect a modest decline in local currency pricing for Europe brands in the fourth quarter. As we indicated in the press release, we expect overall fourth quarter local currency yields to be lower, in the 11 to 13% range year over year, and earnings to come in in a range of 0.16 to $0.20, which is slightly lower than the implied fourth quarter earnings guidance we gave at the last call, which is a result simply of just forecasting higher fuel costs for the quarter net of a currency benefit.</p>
          <p>Now looking to 2010, first a little bit of color on the first quarter, fleetwide capacity for our business is expected to be higher by 9.9%. 5.3% of that will be for our North American brands, and 15% for our European brand. Occupancies on overall basis at this time are moderately lower year over year for both North America and European brands. However, the stronger booking patterns over the last several months have significantly closed the first quarter occupancy gap.</p>
          <p>Looking now at North American brands in the first quarter. North American brands are 62% in the Caribbean, which is about the same as it was last year; 11% in Mexican Riviera cruises, which is down from 13% last year; and the balance in various other itineraries, including our long and exotic cruises, which we do quite a bit of in the winter &#x2013; in the late fall and winter months. Currently pricing for Caribbean cruises is moderately lower than last year, with pricing for Mexican Riviera cruises down more significantly. Pricing for long and more exotic cruises are also lower.</p>
          <p>As booking volumes continue to strengthen, we have been able to increase pricing for certain itineraries in the first quarter. Although current pricing is lower versus pricing at the same time last year, pricing is still higher than where 2009 first quarter pricing ended. However, as mentioned above, or mentioned before, with such a large part of the inventory already sold for the first quarter, we expect North American brand yields to be moderately lower than last year. Although the yield deterioration will be significantly less than in the fourth quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Europe in the first quarter of 2010. Europe brands are 29% in the Caribbean, down from 32% last year; 27% in Europe, up from 25% last year; 11% in South America, which is about the same year on year; and 11% in Asia versus 12% the prior year, with the balance in various other itineraries. Pricing for European itineraries at the present time is holding up well versus 2009, with pricing in most other itineraries moderately down versus last year. However, yields are more significantly lower in South America because of the challenging economic environment in Brazil and a significant increase in Brazilian cruise capacity this winter.</p>
          <p>While overall European brand pricing at the present time is modestly lower, as in North America, pricing is still ahead of where Europe pricing closed in the first quarter of last year. But by the time the first quarter closes, we expect that European first quarter local currency pricing will be down slightly compared to last year, and the yield deterioration significantly less than in the fourth quarter of 2009, which is the same pattern as in North America.</p>
          <p>Now, from an overall fleetwide standpoint for the first quarter, we expect local currency yields to be moderately lower than a year ago. And based on the latest currency exchange rates, current dollar yields are expected to be neutral to slightly higher. This is our best estimate of first quarter yield direction at the present time. However, given the very different booking pattern we are experiencing this year versus last, we caution that this is just an estimate on yields, and it could change on the next update, which we will give you in mid-December.</p>
          <p>Turning to the second quarter of 2010, where we have much less booking information available, capacity to the second quarter is expected to increase by 9%. 4% of that will be for our North American brands and 15.2% for our European brands. Second quarter data is still in its early stages, so I caution not to read too much into this information. Having said that, overall occupancies are moderately down year over year in North America and Europe. In terms of the North American brand capacity, it's 57% in the Caribbean in the second quarter versus 52% last year; 10% Mexican Riviera, down from 11% last year; with the balance in various other itineraries, including Alaska and Europe's shoulder seasons, Asia, and the Panama Canal.</p>
          <p>Pricing at the current time for North American brands is lower than this time last year but slightly better than the pricing comparisons in Q1. However, current second quarter pricing is well ahead of where the second quarter closed last year. Given the strength of current bookings, we expect the current pricing gap to significantly close, as last year's second quarter yield dramatically declined beginning with the September meltdown in the financial markets.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Europe. Europe brands in the second quarter are 57% in Europe, which is about the same as last year; 10% in trans-Atlantic, so also about the same; with the balance in various other itineraries, all under 10%. At the present time, European local currency pricing is lower versus last year, but the pricing is still significantly higher than where the second quarter closed last year. Also because of the strength of European booking volumes, we expect the current pricing gap in Europe to close in a similar pattern to our North American brand.</p>
          <p>So that's the early picture for 2010 second quarter. We will be able to provide you with more color on the first and second quarter 2010 revenue picture on our next call in December. So with that, operator, I will turn it back to you so we can open up the lines for questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, guys. So, Howard, you gave actually, as usual, a very good overview and actually an encouraging outlook. And so it seems, based on what you said, the data's definitely getting incrementally more positive. And I'm just looking back to the data in the last downturn, where it took about three years to get back to prior peak. And I know this is clearly hypothetical and you don't have a whole lot of visibility, but just based on what you know and based on your experience, I'm wondering if you think that this &#x2013; the recovery is going to be steeper, at a steeper slope, or a similar slope to what you've seen before? I mean, clearly the downturn is more significant, but the supply situation is better, so I just wanted to hear your view on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is my personal view, and I think the experience we're having here in North America right now is very different than the experiences we've had in past years in terms of the economy. And we haven't experienced a downturn as dramatically as this in our yields. I would tell you that given the economic data that I read and the fact that unemployment is closing in on 10% and probably will go over 10%, that I would view the recovery as being slower.</p>
          <p>I think it's clear that we've kind of stabilized here, and that we've been able to tweak pricing up at a price point that people find very attractive. We've been able to create tremendous volumes and tremendous demand for our various products. But I do think it's not going to be &#x2013; we're not going to see dramatic increases. I think it'll be a slow, emerging yield environment for us and it'll take several years, I think, in my mind, to recover.</p>
          <p>Now, I could be wrong. If sometime mid-2010 all the sudden the world changes, then the 2011 picture will look much better. But right now, the 2010 picture, I would say, is stable and should get better as the year unfolds, but there are just so many factors out there in the economy. There's still the housing issue. There's unemployment. I just think it's going to be a fairly stable environment, maybe slightly improving, but nothing more than that.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We continue to look at it, but at this point in time, we have indicated that it's just something we continue to look at and an option we have, but we haven't implemented anything to date.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. You made comments in the release about the extension of the booking window. I wonder if you can quantify that at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's &#x2013; you know, the booking window is for nine different brands, and it will vary by brand. Some brands have really pushed it out further than other brands, but I think overall, 15 to 30 days, has been the range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>15 to 30 days, something like that, Rick. I mean, I think it will vary. And we don't do a combined overall forecast &#x2013; or we don't look at it from an overall standpoint. We look at it brand by brand. And each brand seems to have been able to extend out their window in varying degrees. But it's somewhere in the range of 15 to 30 days. But &#x2013; it's just &#x2013; you really now are just starting to see it happen. It's really starting to margin.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rick, it's a mixed picture, and I don't think we can see a clear trend. It really is very brand dependent, and some up, some not, so it's a mixed bag at this point.</p>

          <p>Hi. Could you just talk a little bit about your focus on or desire to build new ships, given commodities, FX, shipyards maybe adding some discounts and just your appetite for maybe putting in some orders in the next couple of months for the out years?</p>

          <p>I think I said on the last call that pricing in euros have come back down to reality and are pretty much in that '03, '04 level where we did order before. Unfortunately in the last 30, 60 days, the dollar's weakened dramatically, which has again made it tougher for the U.S. brands. And I did publicly say we'd like to build for Princess. With the situation right now, I would venture to say it is unlikely that a contract could be signed before the end of the year, which would make deliveries by '12 less likely, which will leave us with pretty significant free cash flow for '12. I mean, we do intend over time to continue to grow our brands, but with what's happened over the last 12 months, clearly we're being cautious.</p>

          <p>And Micky, which brands, then, would you &#x2013; if not the U.S. brands, I'm assuming, then, it's the European brands that you would be the most focused on. Or are there -?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>As I said three months ago, clearly, we'd like to build for Princess. We have a lot already in the pipeline for our European brands, so we have no urgency to do anything for the European brands right now. We can wait a couple of years for the European brands. They have a lot in the pipeline. Princess, I think, would be our first priority. But again, with the weaker dollar, we're going to proceed cautiously.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Maybe a different way to ask two of the prior questions: How would you compare what you're seeing right now of a re-tradeup effect from the lower-value brands and people returning to trading up the ladder within your brand pyramid? And I guess maybe another way to look at that is also, are you seeing the higher-end brands, their booking window, extending faster than they are at the more entry-level brands?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we are, Tim, seeing more volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They contracted more, and they're expanding more. So yeah, anecdotally, what you just described, Tim, is correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The higher-end brands are extending the window out. I'm not sure more or less, but they are performing better right now from a volume and booking standpoint, yes. We're starting to see that come back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Gentlemen, is that recovery &#x2013; is the trade-up recovery &#x2013; is that &#x2013; would you term it a similar pace to what we saw in the last downturn, or coming out of the last downturn, or slower &#x2013; ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Everybody is trying to focus on the last downturn. You know, we were two brands in the last downturn and a very different company, and we weren't global. We weren't getting business from everywhere in the world. So it's very hard to compare to the last downturn.</p>
          <p>I mean, we're encouraged with what we're seeing. We've now reported two quarters of very, very strong booking volumes. We're now reporting for the first time that the booking curve is extending. But to continue to compare it to the last downturn when the industry is quite different, far more global, and our brand portfolio is so different, with very booking curves, it's very hard for us to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, Micky, you had said when you &#x2013; when the Board very astutely suspended the dividend, that that would be reassessed basically coming up here towards year-end or early in the calendar 2010. What's your thinking at this point? Again, your comment, looking out even into '12 that you should generate substantial free cash flow by then, but obviously '10 is not '12.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. There's a number of issues that the Board &#x2013; I don't want to pre-empt the Board. But there's a number of issues. One is our liquidity situation. As David reported, it's extremely good, which was not the case 12 months ago. Second is that the overall business tone is improving, and that obviously is the case. And the third is that we wanted to protect our rating, which we notched down in one agency during this period. So we'd like to get that rating to A-minus. So based on those three things, principally those three things, we'll make recommendations to the Board, and the Board will make a decision. But clearly, we're heading in the right direction.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, guys. I guess when you look at the cost structure, I mean, you guys have done a great job in terms of removing costs. And I don't know, Howard, if you could use a baseball analogy in terms of what inning you think you guys are or how much more there's to be removed at this point, and which areas do you think there are more chances to remove costs at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What inning would that be? Let's see. You know, it's hard to say. You know, we've been very successful in getting our operating guys to focus on their costs, and they have taken out on a lot of costs on the shore side area, and have really re-examined processes and the way we function as an organization. We've consolidated some things. We've consolidated a large part of our Alaska operation between Princess and Holland America, taken a considerable amount of costs out. I think that there's a lot of costs that I think we've already taken out, and I would say we're probably &#x2013; I still think there's plenty of opportunity.</p>
          <p>So if I &#x2013; to use the analogy, we're probably in the &#x2013; probably in the fifth inning, sixth inning. I think between the fifth inning and the ninth inning, though, I think some the remaining costs to be taken out could involve some more restructuring of certain aspects of the business. And that's tougher to do, but I do think there are opportunities there to do and take some more costs out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, I think, though &#x2013; the only thing I'd like to add to that is that our operating companies are working closer &#x2013; more closely together today than they ever have before. And that, in and of itself, has created a lot of opportunity for us and will continue to do so as we move forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I also think that one of the continuing big opportunities is fuel conservation, and I think we're only in the middle innings on fuel conservation. I mean, both between technology and investments that we are ongoing making to reduce consumption and reduce our footprint, we've got a long way to go. And this year is a good example. Last year, people were saying how much more can you do? And this year, we've done a whole lot more, and we'll be projecting more next year as well. So there's still opportunities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Got you. Then one more if I could real quick. I mean, all the press right now is all over Oasis in terms of how well that's booking, but when you look at Dream, that's obviously your largest ship at this point. Maybe give an indication of how bookings look for that so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bookings for Dream are terrific. It's getting a very significant premium. I should say the same is true of Seabourn Odyssey. Bookings are terrific, and it is getting a very significant yield premium &#x2013; both are. And as far as Oasis, the more successful Oasis is, the better it is for us. The higher prices they can get, the more demand they can get, the better it is for the industry in total, and the more exposure that they bring to the industry will be positive as well. So more power to them.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just sort of touching on those three things again, I mean, you talk about significant CapEx and the free cash flow in 2012. But you're not paying a dividend yet, and you haven't ordered any ships past 2012. What are the alternatives for that cash if you don't start building ships? And then secondly, I think David referred earlier to recovering the pricing in the last downturn over two years. Now, I take the point it's a different industry, a different company. Do you think a three-year cycle this time could be reasonable to recover the pricing you've lost this year? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I have no clue on the second part of your question. Obviously, we're going to try to recuperate as quickly as we can. That's the job of our marketing and our yield management people. And we would expect them to do their job and recuperate it as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p>As far as capital expenditures, as I said, I do expect that eventually we will be building more ships in the future for our various brands. We do intend to grow them. And if we have significant cash flow, the alternatives are basically stock buybacks and dividends.</p>

          <p>Thank you. And our next question comes the line of from Assia Georgieva from Infiniti Research. Please go right ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. This is Assia. Good job on Q3 in terms of close-in bookings. And I had a question on Q4 and Q1. Those are obviously difficult quarters seasonally, just the nature of the industry. And ignoring year-on-year comparisons, because they are so different when we look at the year-ago periods, what would be a normal curve from here on out for Q4 and especially Q1? If we took today's pricing, should we expect it to remain pretty stable for the rest of the booking period, especially for Q1, or it is difficult to call?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we're saying that pricing essentially now is stable. In terms of where the actual yield comes in, it's a little bit harder to predict because you need to know brand by brand and itinerary by itinerary and cabin by cabin, what kind of inventory are you actually selling, because the price will vary based on that. And we don't have that data. But I would say from an overall standpoint, pricing is stable. And as we're able to catch up on occupancies because the yield curve is moving further out, we've been able to tweak pricing up on certain itineraries where we've seen this stronger demand. But I would think it's probably stable to slightly up, and that's how we'd characterize both the fourth quarter and the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Having said that, that assumes continuation of these very, very strong booking volumes. Because, you can very clearly see when we chartered out that as we take pricing down, volumes go up, and as we take pricing up, volumes will start to come off a little bit. So it's a little bit of a balancing game as you go forward, in terms of yield managing this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You also have to remember that we're always talking in comparison versus the prior-year quarter, and sometimes there are issues in that prior-year quarter that isn't obvious. I mean...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...a quick question is why aren't we seeing sequential improvement fourth quarter versus third like we are first and second? And the reason is that last year we had the ending cruises of the QE2, and believe it or not, that had a very, very significant positive impact on our yields last year that won't be repeated this fall. So you get these kinds of anomalies when you just look at quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Micky, I agree. That's why I was trying to ignore for a moment the year-ago periods and just gauge a little bit more what your guidance is expecting to happen from current pricing on. And I think Howard helped answer that and was saying that it's basically an expectation of flat to slightly up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as long as volumes are significantly above our capacity increases, then the only variable then becomes yield and pricing increases to bring the volume down, because at the end, we can only sail full.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right. Well, thank you so much. And a quick question for David. There seemed to be about $0.05 tax benefit in the quarter. Would you be able to be more specific as to what this related to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It was two things. In the prior year, we had about a penny a share, which was related to that insurance settlement that I talked about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the remaining portion really essentially has to do with the accounting and FIN 48 in the prior year. As we footnoted in the press release, in the prior year, we had put up some reserves, and this year, we had the reversal of the tax benefit from taking down a couple of reserves. Remember, these are very small numbers, and because they're on both sides of the zero point, it looks like a big swing, but it was really &#x2013; I think we &#x2013; it was about a $16 million swing in the reserves overall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I know on an annual basis it seems like a small number, but when it hits in a specific quarter, it can seem a little bit chunkier. Thank you very much, gentlemen, for answering all the questions I had.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I did mention that in the third quarter we saw decline in most of the categories, and I had also indicated that the declines in the third quarter were not as great as the declines in the second quarter. I think I said it was about a 6.5 percentage point decline in the third quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, versus &#x2013; it was probably like 9.5% in the second quarter. So there has been some improvement in that area.</p>

          <p>Also, David, staying with the income statement for a moment, your passenger ticket number is down roughly 15.12%. Your commission and transportation and other expense is down almost 22%. Where did that huge differential come from?</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, some of it &#x2013; customer deposits, David. Customer deposits, a large part of the decline is pricing related. And also depending on what you're doing from &#x2013; what are you measuring from, which period to which period? Because it all seems like it's seasonal. Seasonal decline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Howard, I was using the third quarter numbers for commissions, transportation, and other, which is the first expense item.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I compared that, which was a 22% decline, to the passenger ticket line for the same quarter, which showed only a 15.12% decline.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Okay. We'll have to get back to you on that one.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Not a problem. Lastly, you mentioned you'll have two ships out on lease. How is the accounting treatment for leases done, David? And does that imply you might have higher earnings for those two vessels because they're out on lease than when you own them? When you own and operate, excuse me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One's a lease, and one was a purchase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but let me just clarify. The lease, the charter, is a long-term charter. Essentially should cover the remaining life of that ship, which is the Costa Europa.</p>
          <p>The other transaction's an outright sale of a ship, that gets delivered actually &#x2013; and it's the Artemis, which is in the P&amp;O fleet, which will continue in the P&amp;O fleet until it's redelivered in spring of 2011. So we've selled it. We get the proceeds, and the proceeds will be in the form of cash and seller financing, but a very, very major piece of it's in cash. And then we charter it or charter it back until it's actually redelivered to the buyer until spring of '11.</p>
          <p>So essentially it's meant to be &#x2013; both transactions &#x2013; neither of those transactions result in a loss. In fact, on the sale of the Artemis, there will be a profit on the sale of that ship.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to circle back to the -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's fair to say that they're both purchases. The term lease is just the way that the purchase is financed, in effect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>So then on &#x2013; there will not really be a comparative number there. What we're looking at is one is going to be straight to the top line versus last year's numbers that had to flow through the entire income statement? Or going to the pre-tax line, excuse me, versus when you own and operate going to the full income statement?</p>

          <p>Yeah. Once the ships are delivered to the third party, to the third-party tour operators, it'll come out of the fleet. Now, remember that both of those companies, P&amp;O and Costa, still have &#x2013; the P&amp;O has the Azura coming in this year, and Costa had three more ships scheduled for delivery. So there'll be replacement tonnage for these ships.</p>

          <p>I'm going to just comment briefly on your question on commissions, transportation, and other. The reduction is coming from a combination of a lower air-sea mix in that there were less passengers that booked air through us in the quarter, in addition to a lower average airfare cost per passenger.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I wonder if you could comment on pricing relative to Carnival and Seabourn, particularly as you add Carnival Dream and Seabourn Odyssey, you're getting significant premiums, as we might expect from these great new ships. What's going on with the rest of the Carnival brand and the Seabourn brand and the older ships relative to pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can &#x2013; basically what I'll tell you about Carnival &#x2013; and I'll tell you about each of them separately because they're very different stories. But Carnival, throughout this period, I think, has probably performed quite well as a brand. And it does have more of a mass market appeal, price points are lower, ships are closer to the home ports in which people live. So throughout this period, Carnival has performed quite well as a brand. I think the &#x2013; I think we've been very pleased with the pricing on the Dream, and occupancies obviously are very strong on the Dream. And because it's positioned in a very different market than the other ships, it shouldn't have much effect on other Carnival ship pricing.</p>
          <p>The Seabourn Odyssey has performed extremely well. There's been tremendous demand for the ship. The other three ships are much smaller ships, and they've been positioned in more exotic locations. We have another Seabourn ship, the Sojourn, which gets delivered next May and those ships are considerably more &#x2013; priced at a much higher price point than the existing three ships. So we've tried to position them differently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, got it. If I could ask one more follow-up question, in Alaska, you talked a little bit about your frustrations and challenges there. At the same point, Disney's talking about opening new cruises in that area. Does the fact that they're going into the market as you have reduced some capacity mean that it'll be hard to get any of your slots back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No, not at all. Disney has only announced one year, and Disney has historically &#x2013; by the way, Crystal has done the same thing &#x2013; historically cherry-picked markets. So they've had the two ships in Port Canaveral and have occasionally moved them. Like one to L.A., '03 and '04, to Europe, now they're going back to Europe. So they tend to cherry-pick their past-passenger base, so they may do this one year and not come back for three, four, five years. I mean, the basic Canada business &#x2013; the Alaska business &#x2013; will be declining. I mean, you will get this occasional either Crystal or Disney or maybe even a Seabourn doing Alaska, but the overall trend in Alaska will be down. And as far as I know, Disney has only booked the one year, so they haven't taken any berths beyond the one year.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Yeah, you covered a lot already on the issue of sort of new ship orders and your free cash flow. Just &#x2013; be curious to hearing a little bit more. You mentioned by year-end you don't think it's likely to order a new ship. And I guess it's surprising that the yard, having not had an order in so long, didn't seem to be more flexible about things and may be willing to take an order in dollars and have the yard take the currency risk. And I don't know why the U.S. has done something like that, but I wonder if you could talk about why &#x2013; I'm assuming that they don't want to do that, but would they be closing yards down temporarily instead of taking orders?</p>
          <p>And if it does change, <mark type="inaudible" /> if you come to some agreement and do order a new ship, I don't think you said this explicitly, but is it &#x2013; it's fair to assume you that would feel comfortable in terms of your free cash flow that you could still reinstate your dividend at some level and order new ships, that there's nothing mutually exclusive there about ordering something for Princess in the next year and still reinstating part of your dividend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I talked about three things as far as reinstating the dividend. New ships wasn't one of the three. The three things was liquidity, a turn in business, and maintaining our ratings. I think we can do those three things and build new ships.</p>
          <p>The reality is, in the past, yards have done what you described. Whether they'll do that now or not, we'll see. But generally speaking, yards are hard-pressed to build below their cost. They're not really in a position to do that. And I think for the most part, as I said, from a euro point of view, they have come down to reasonable prices, but because of at least the recent weakness in the dollar, it's just made it tougher.</p>
          <p>That's not to say deals won't eventually get done as time moves on. I was just guessing that the likelihood &#x2013; we're in September already and we're not writing specifications, so the likelihood is that a contract won't get done before the end of the year, which will make it difficult for '12. Not impossible, but quite difficult. And we've only got, I believe &#x2013; David, correct me if I'm wrong &#x2013; two ships for '12.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks, just a couple of questions on yields, please. Just on the third quarter yields, which are down 12.3%, your guidance for Q2 stage was down 14 to down 16%. And normally at that stage, you've sold pretty well most of the quarter you're in, 90% or so. So mathematically that would imply that prices for the bookings that haven't been sold yet must have been up pretty substantially, 20% or so, if my math is correct. Were you surprised by that last-minute strength, or were you just conservative in your guidance, or is my math wrong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your math is not wrong. I mean, it was just that these were &#x2013; as we said, the pricing came in better than we had expected during that period of time. We typically start the quarter, as we've always indicated, with 85 to 95% of the next quarter's bookings on the books. And the remaining bookings that came in, like we had previously said, came in better than we expected as a result of the volumes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Onboard revenues also came in $0.02 better than we had anticipated as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think July-August are a pretty unique period, in that our brands &#x2013; we're looking at the booking pattern and anticipating having to discount a certain amount to get it done, and July-August is a period where people are going to just take their vacations. And demand wound up much stronger in virtually, right across the board, all brands, than they had anticipated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it's fair to say that the demand pattern is so different than the last couple of years that these guys weren't able to anticipate the strength of it &#x2013; the last-minute strength of it. And we basically...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think based on what happened in the prior nine months, they were too little &#x2013; to some degree gun shy, too. It's been a tough period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And just on 2010 yields, just on the guidance there, for Q1, you're saying yields modestly lower, constant FX, which is pretty clear. Just so I understand correctly, did you say that you expect Q2 to be positive with momentum building from there? Is that correct, so I can understand that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I think I said was that for the remainder of the year, we expect the yield picture to continue to improve from yield one. I didn't give any specific guidance on the second quarter other than the data points that we had. And I would expect &#x2013; we expect the situation to sequentially, each quarter, get better in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you go so far as saying you'd expect yields to actually turn positive as early as the second quarter, knowing what you know?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't say that. All I said was that we expect it to get sequentially better quarter over quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you rightly pointed out, we didn't do a very good job just in the third quarter which was right on top of us. So it's harder to predict now than it's been. So -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And to be fair, I said that this is such a different demand pattern that this could change. You know, when we give the December update, when we have the fourth quarter earnings call, we'll be in a much better position to have a sense of what the yield's going to be for the first half of the year and for the full year, but it's really &#x2013; and we haven't even started the budget review process yet. So things &#x2013; and things do change as we go through the fall. So we'll be in a much better position. But clearly, signs are positive. Volumes are strong, and we've been able to start to tweak pricing up here and there. So it's a good picture.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jamie, there's no doubt that comparisons do get easier as the year progresses quarter by quarter as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, what I said was that current pricing where it stands today, both in North America and Europe, are well ahead of where the second quarter closed last year. And the reason the second quarter closed &#x2013; what happened is that the second quarter dramatically &#x2013; and pricing dramatically moved down last year when the credit markets froze and when we had the &#x2013; beginning in September. So &#x2013; as bookings just dropped dramatically. So we're still quite a bit ahead of where the second quarter closed.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Absolutely, no, that's very helpful. And just also, on onboard spend, saw some improvements there. I mean, how discretionary are you finding that to be versus ticket prices? And then also just have you noticed any types of purchases on board that have changed since maybe before the downturn versus at the downturn and then kind of currently right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that there has been different behaviors in the various categories of onboard revenue. For instance, art auctions and the casino areas are down more so than many of the other areas. And so to that extent, you might say that perhaps those were more discretionary than things like shore excursions and bar revenue. And so we have seen a small change in the overall mix of our total onboard spend at this point in time.</p>

          <p>Okay, can we just have two more questions, please? We are running out of time.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly. And our next question is another follow-up question, the line of Rick Lyall of John W. Bristol. Please go right ahead.</p>

          <p>Hi, I suspect you look at returns on a brand basis. When you look at returns on a geographic basis, how do you think about Alaska on a longer-term basis? Historically, it's been a premium market, with Holland and Princess primarily exposed there. Even if you adjust capacity and restructure your costs, can that return to the levels of profitability or returns on capital that it achieved historically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't look at our itineraries based on that. The way we look at an itinerary is if the ship is in Alaska, how much money is she going to make? If she's in Europe during that peak summer, how much money is she going to make? If she's in the Caribbean, or if she's Australia, et cetera. And the brand will decide to put the ship on where it's the best return and the most profitable returns.</p>
          <p>Now, they have to put it in the context that they already have seven ships in Europe or they already have two ships in Australia, so it's got to be &#x2013; they've got to understand those. But they will model it out, and if it pays to pull a ship from Alaska and put it in Europe or pull a ship from Alaska and put it in the Far East, they will do that, and that's exactly what they did in '10. And we're going through those reviews right now, and it's likely we're going to do more of it in '11 because you're talking the peak July and August period where we can make a lot of money in a lot of different itineraries, and we can't make a lot of money in Alaska because of this initiative.</p>
          <p>It's all the parts of the initiative, the gaming tax, environmental, it's the &#x2013; on and &#x2013; the rangers. I mean, the amount of costs that they've put onto the industry during this short season is astronomical, and it will continue to negatively impact Alaska.</p>
