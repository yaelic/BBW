          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2009 Praxair Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Josh and I'll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the presentation over to our host for today's call, the Executive Vice President and CFO, Jim Sawyer, you may proceed.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thank you for attending our third quarter earnings call webcast. Matt White, Vice President and Controller, and Liz Hirsch, Director of Investor Relations, are with me this morning. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at www.praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two and note that it applies to all statements made during the teleconference.</p>
          <p>I'm going to start off this morning by explaining a couple of special items we had this quarter, which are reflected in our GAAP reported results. The reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP results is included in the appendix to the slide presentation and as an attachment to this morning's press release. Today I'll describe for you the general business trends we saw in our major end markets in the quarter as compared to last quarter. Liz will then review in more detail our third quarter results excluding the special items. Afterwards we'll be available to answer questions.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide three in the presentation. In July, the Brazilian government instituted a new voluntary amnesty program called the Refis program, which allows Brazilian companies to settle certain federal tax disputes at significantly reduced amounts. As we previously disclosed, Praxair has numerous outstanding federal tax disputes, most of which date back to the 1980s and 1990s and are primarily related to non-income tax matters, which are reflected in operating profit not in income tax expense.</p>
          <p>The new program allows companies to use existing net operating loss carryforwards for part of the payment for settled disputes. Praxair has significant existing income tax loss carryforwards, which have previously been unutilized. We determined it is economically beneficial to participate in this program and settle disputes at substantial discounts. The $306 million charge this quarter primarily reflects the settlement of a number of non-income tax disputes. In addition, it includes reserves taken from Brazilian government receivables, a state tax matter and a charge related to restructuring our natural gas cylinder business in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Offsetting this charge to operating profit is a $313 million income tax benefit, primarily coming from the participation in the Brazil Refis program and the use of our net operating loss carryforwards, which had previously been fully reserved. These items together resulted in a $7 million benefit to net income and $0.02 of earnings per share this quarter.</p>
          <p>As you see in our press release and our slides, we've excluded this net benefit from our non-GAAP earnings of $318 million or $1.02 of earnings per share. There was no cash impact in the third quarter from these items. However, we expect he settlement under the Refis program to result in a one-time cash payment by the company of up to $90 million, most likely in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now please turn to slide four, which highlights our global end-market trends. The slide shows both year-over-year and sequential trends in organic sales and excludes the effect of currency, acquisitions and feedstock pass-through pricing changes. The year-over-year comparison is a good reference point to see how much volume we have lost since last year and how much upside we have when the volume comes back. But the sequential trends give a better picture of what we're seeing right now, which end markets are slowing and which have stabilized and which are improving.</p>
          <p>You can see that the strongest sequential sales growth came from electronics, chemicals and metals customers. These are the three end markets which were hardest hit in the recession and the ones where we saw our volumes fall the most. These customers significantly cut back their production last fall in order to reduce inventories in line with falling demand and falling commodity prices. The production cutbacks lasted until inventories were depleted.</p>
          <p>De-stocking in semiconductors ended in the first quarter, in chemicals, it ended in the second quarter, and in steel it ended in the third quarter. So in each case, we saw a bump in production levels in Q3, as apparent demand met real demand. But because final end market demand is not growing fast, we expect sequential growth rates to decelerate next quarter rather than to accelerate next quarter.</p>
          <p>Electronics reached its trough in about February and has since shown the most recovery. Our sales this quarter were up 16% from second quarter and are now 7% below last year. Our electronic sales have recovered nicely in all regions, with the highest growth in Asia.</p>
          <p>Sales to chemical customers grew 8% from the second quarter. We saw growth in all geographic regions, led by US producers on the Gulf Coast, which currently have a feedstock advantage due to low natural gas prices. Our pipeline volumes in Germany increased as well as our sales in China.</p>
          <p>Metals markets have been slower to recover. This is the first quarter since the downturn began that we have had any sequential improvement in oxygen volumes to steel customers. Volumes have picked up in North and South America, in Germany and Spain and in China and India. Demand was to some extent due to inventory restocking, as service center inventories had reached historic lows. In the US, we believe that auto plant restarts and the Cash for Clunkers program stimulated demand. So our volumes have improved, but it remains to be seen whether we will reach a plateau and at what level that will be. But since we're generally forecasting a slow economic recovery, we're not expecting our volumes in the US and Europe to return to early 2008 levels in the near term.</p>
          <p>In energy markets, we continue to see good growth in refinery hydrogen from existing and new customers. This growth is offset to some extent by significantly lower sales of liquid nitrogen and carbon dioxide for oil and gas well fracturing in North America. This is primarily a result of low natural gas prices during the summer, and these volumes will recover with higher natural gas prices.</p>
          <p>Healthcare and food and beverage are steady, modest growers around the world, and for the most part are non-cyclical. Aerospace is largely related to our Surface Technologies business. Our jet engine coatings improved this quarter from the disappointing volumes we have seen in the last few quarters due to the global downturn in air traffic and the Boeing strike. The Boeing strike caused production delays and therefore a lower volume of parts to be coated. We expect this business now to continue to improve.</p>
          <p>Manufacturing is our largest end market and it remains the weakest. You can see that overall sales to this market are still 20% below the prior year, and they declined 4% sequentially, which is a normal seasonal pattern, as factories, especially in Europe, take time off during the summer. Other than the seasonal pattern, it appears that manufacturing orders have stabilized currently at a level about 20% lower than a year ago.</p>
          <p>These sales are primarily packaged gas and merchant liquid, and are where we have the most operating leverage to changing volumes. This is because as volumes have fallen, we still have to drive trucks to almost all the same customers, just delivering less product volume per trip. Therefore we've not been able to close facilities or take many trucks off the road. So when volumes come back, we will not need to add back much cost and we'll have strong earnings leverage.</p>
          <p>In Asia and Brazil, where economic recovery has been more robust due to government stimulus program, sales increased sequentially.</p>
          <p>And now, I'll turn this over to Liz to review our third quarter results in more detail.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim. Please turn to slide five. We had solid results this quarter. Sales and earnings were above the second quarter, primarily due to modest sequential volume growth. The comparisons to the prior year are difficult, because the third quarter of 2008 was a record quarter. Excluding the benefit to earnings from the special items, which Jim described, earnings per share were $1.02, $0.06 above second quarter and $0.02 above the top end of our previous guidance range.</p>
          <p>Sales were 2.3 billion, 20% below prior year. The combined effects of negative currency translation and lower cost pass-through reduced sales by 11%. Underlying sales were 9% lower due to 11% lower volumes partially offset by 2% higher pricing. Sales grew 7% from the second quarter. 3% of this increase came from currency translation, resulting primarily from the strengthening of the Brazilian real and the euro relative to the US dollar. Sales grew 3% from higher overall volumes, and the Sermatech acquisition, which we closed in July, contributed 1% sales growth.</p>
          <p>Adjusted operating profit was 480 million, 12% below last year. The impact of lower volumes reduced operating profit by $147 million. We offset almost all of this impact with cost reductions and higher pricing. Currency impacts reduced operating profit by $59 million or 11%. Operating margin was 21% this quarter compared to 19% in the year-ago period. The improvement was primarily due to lower costs and higher pricing.</p>
          <p>Interest expense in the quarter was $32 million as compared to 50 million in the prior year despite slightly higher debt levels, as a result of lower interest rates on commercial paper and bank borrowings. This quarter we did two long-term debt issues, which reduced our outstanding bank debt and commercial paper. We secured very attractive long-term interest rates of 4.5% and 3.25%, but as a result, interest expense will increase by about $8 million per quarter going forward, since we have been paying less than 1% in the commercial paper market.</p>
          <p>Adjusted net income of 318 million was 10% below the prior year, primarily reflecting 11% lower volumes and a 6% currency headwind, partially offset by the benefit of cost reductions and pricing.</p>
          <p>We generated strong cash flow from operations of 547 million, primarily from net income and depreciation. Operating cash flow includes a $114 million contribution we made to our US pension plan this quarter. Capital expenditures were 334 million, largely for construction of on-site plants around the world. We invested $117 million in acquisitions, which was primarily PST's purchase of Sermatech International, which closed in July. We paid $122 million of dividends and repurchased about 30 million of stock net of issuances, which resulted in a small increase in debt. Excluding the pension contribution from our operating cash flow, we had free cash flow after CapEx of $327 million available to fund acquisitions, dividends and share buybacks.</p>
          <p>Please look at slide six and seven for our results in North America. Sales in North America were 1.2 billion, 12% below prior year excluding currency effects and lower cost pass-through, primarily lower natural gas prices. Volumes were 13% lower and pricing was 1% higher. Sales were below prior year in all major end markets except energy.</p>
          <p>As Jim mentioned earlier, the growth in energy is due to refinery hydrogen, mitigated by lower liquid volumes to oil well services. Sequentially, overall sales rose 4%, primarily due to higher on-site volumes. Sales in Mexico also rose 6% sequentially, ex-currency, as the manufacturing economy there is beginning to show slight signs of improvement.</p>
          <p>On-site sales were 35% below prior year, ex-currency. Lower cost pass-through, primarily natural gas, accounted for 32% of this decrease. On-site volumes were 3% below prior year. However, last year's quarter includes the impact of the US Gulf Coast hurricanes, making for an easier comparison. Excluding the hurricane impact, on-site volumes are 6% below prior year, due to lower demand for oxygen and nitrogen from steel and chemical customers. This quarter volumes did begin to recover from the low levels we experienced due to the significant inventory de-stocking in these end markets as well as in electronics. Total on-site volumes increased 10% from second quarter.</p>
          <p>Merchant liquid sales were 13% below the prior year, ex-currency, as 16% lower volumes were partially offset by higher pricing. Overall volumes increased moderately from the second quarter. Sequential pricing trends are stable. We are seeing some new business activity in food, wastewater and combustion. However, customers are very still cautious about making purchase and capital commitments.</p>
          <p>Packaged gas volumes are stable sequentially, but have yet to turn up, reflecting the continuing weak manufacturing environment. Overall, sales were 18% below prior year, excluding currency effects, due to lower volumes. In PDI, our US and Canadian business, same-store sales were 20% below prior year, driven by 35% lower hardgoods. Gas rent same-store sales were off 10%.</p>
          <p>These year-over-year numbers look a bit worse than in the second quarter, but this is due to the comparison with last year, when sales grew from the second to the third quarter. Our sales per day have been relatively flat with second quarter. Due to significant cost reduction, PDI's operating margin has increased to 16%, despite the low level of demand from customers, so we expect to see positive operating leverage when volumes start to pick up.</p>
          <p>Overall operating profit in North America was $263 million, and operating margin was almost 23% compared to about 18% in the prior year. This is due mostly to the significant cost reduction. OP is about flat with the second quarter despite the volume improvement. This is largely because we are climbing our way above minimum take-or-pay thresholds with some of our large customers.</p>
          <p>When volumes increase and take-or-pay revenue decreases, it is dilutive to margins because volumes come with variable costs. However, this quarter we received only a minimal amount of take-or-pay revenue, so we expect that future volume increases will come with good OP leverage.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide eight for our results in Europe. Sales in Europe were $323 million, down 8% ex-currency compared to prior year, primarily due to lower volumes. Overall volumes stabilized sequentially. Higher volumes to chemicals, metals and healthcare customers offset continued sequential sales declines to manufacturing customers. Compared to second quarter, on-site and merchant liquid volumes improved slightly and packaged gases weakened further. By country, pipeline and merchant volumes in Germany are picking up. We are seeing some improvement in Spain, but Italy remains very weak.</p>
          <p>Operating profit of $68 million compared to 96 million last year, but last year's OP included a $9 million net FX hedge gain. Sequentially, OP improved slightly, reflecting cost reductions and productivity gains.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide nine for South America. Sales in South America were 436 million. Underlying sales were 7% below the 2008 quarter from 12% lower volumes partially offset by 5% higher pricing. Sequentially, sales grew 10%, largely due to currency appreciation. But our base business volumes also grew from the second quarter. On-site volumes showed the strongest growth, up 22%, mostly due to increased production by chemicals and metals customers. This is an impressive increase, but off a low base, as volumes are still about 15% below prior year.</p>
          <p>Merchant and packaged gas volumes were about even with the second quarter. We expect these to pick up in conjunction with the continuing recovery in industrial production in Brazil. Offsetting overall gases volumes to some extent was lower sales of the cylinders we manufacture in Brazil for conversion of automobiles to natural gas fuel. There are currently structural disincentives in the market for these conversions, due to more attractively priced alternative fuels like ethanol. Therefore demand has turned down, and we have decided to close one of our cylinder manufacturing plants. This is equipment manufacturing, and so it has lower margin impact than gases.</p>
          <p>Operating profit of 94 million was 12% below the prior year and was 16% above last quarter, excluding the impact of net income hedges. Ex-currency effects, operating profit increased sequentially from higher volumes, higher pricing and cost reduction.</p>
          <p>Slide 10 shows our Asia results. Our results in Asia reflect broad-based growth across the region in most industrial end markets and in electronics. China is showing solid signs of recovery, and India's growth continues to improve. Sales of 232 million were 3% above prior year ex-currency and 15% above second quarter ex-currency. Sequential volume growth was driven by higher on-site volumes in China, India and Korea from existing customers and plant startups. Merchant volumes are also higher compared to last year and last quarter from new business and improving demand from current customers. Pricing in the region is a bit of a mix. Generally, merchant liquid pricing is stable, however, our reported average price is weighed down by lower electronics specialty gas pricing.</p>
          <p>Operating profit of 37 million was relatively flat with the year ago quarter, as was our operating margin of 15.9%. Operating profit grew versus second quarter, but the margin fell slightly. This reflects higher depreciation due to new plant starts at the end of the quarter, lower average pricing and higher cost pass-through in the quarter.</p>
          <p>We expect sequential growth to continue in China and in India next quarter and in 2010. These emerging economies are benefiting from government stimulus to create jobs and fuel consumer demand. Infrastructure spending, the construction of new manufacturing facilities by our customers and refinery expansions will all create demand for industrial gases. About a third of the 42 projects in our backlog are in Asia, and we are continuing to evaluate a number of new proposals.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 11 for Surface Technologies. PST had sales of 135 million this quarter. Organic sales excluding currency and acquisition effects were down 17% from prior year and down 8% from second quarter. Jet engine coatings improved from last quarter, but this was offset by a decline in coatings for industrial gas turbines and oilfield gate valve components.</p>
          <p>We closed the acquisition of Sermatech in July. Sermatech is a global supplier of coatings used on aviation and jet engine turbines. The acquisition contributed 22 million in sales this quarter, with minimal operating profit, net of integration costs. The consolidation of the acquisition therefore reduced overall operating margin by almost 200 basis points, which we expected.</p>
          <p>We will continue to incur and expense integration and business restructure costs for the next several quarters, which will offset any meaningful profit contribution from the acquisition. But there are substantial synergies between the businesses. and as we told you last quarter, our objective is to drive operating margins for PST up to the 20% range.</p>
          <p>Now I will turn this back over to Jim to discuss our fourth quarter earnings guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Liz. For the fourth quarter, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.10. This guidance assumes modest sequential volume growth, which should give us some operating leverage on our lower cost structure. It also reflects some currency benefit from the stronger Brazilian reais and euro. But note that it's 5 to 10% above what we earned in the prior fourth quarter on an adjusted basis. So we expect next quarter to be lapping the negative effects of the recession.</p>
          <p>This therefore brings our EPS guidance for the full year of 2009 on an adjusted basis to a range of 3.96 to 4.01 as compared to the $4.20 we earned in 2008. It's only a 5% to 6% decline in earnings year-over-year when the severe global recession and currency impact reduced our sales by about 17%. This demonstrates the value of our business model and the discipline we've showed in quick and decisive cost reduction. We are still expecting 2009 full-year sales to be about $9 billion and full-year CapEx to be about $1.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we will be giving specific earnings guidance for 2010 in January in conjunction with our fourth quarter results. We don't know how strong an economic recovery we will see in 2010, but we're assuming it will be relatively modest in the U.S. and Europe. However, we expect that we will be able to deliver organic sales growth 5% to 8% above the growth in industrial production and double-digit earnings growth over the long-term. This will come from starting up new projects that are currently in our strong project backlog and from numerous application technologies, many of which are focused on producing environmental or energy efficiency benefits for our customers.</p>
          <p>We currently have 42 projects in our large project backlog. Towards the end of the third quarter we started up three plants and we added three new plants to the backlog. We expect that our current backlog of new plant startups will add about 5% earnings growth for each of the next two years. In addition to this, we expect to realize positive operating leverage as our base business volumes recover. As we do not plan to add back a lot of the cost we've taken out and because we're currently operating many large plants at inefficient production levels, our incremental margins on base business volume increases should be in the 30 to 40% range.</p>
          <p>In any case, while we're not giving specific guidance for 2010 right now, it is certain to be a record year for Praxair. Because our earnings fell by only 5% in 2009, in spite of significant volume declines, it will take us less than a year to grow our earnings out of this recession and begin delivering record quarters again in early 2010.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to open the call to questions. Josh?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And our first question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citi. P.J., you may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, good morning. The real has appreciated significantly against the dollar recently, and that should be a benefit on the translation impact, but maybe Brazilian export growth slows down. Can you talk about those pluses and minuses and how are you hedged against the real?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. The reais has strengthened pretty much back to where it was at a tie roughly a year ago. And that will give us &#x2013; has given us some boost on translation this quarter. And if it stays at this level, will give us some boost next quarter and in 2010. But so far we haven't seen that that has hurt the competitiveness of the reais in terms of its domestic business or its export business. And in fact, what we're really seeing in Brazil right now is a very significant increase in GDP economic activity, which is pretty much consumer-led. And the auto production in Brazil reached an all-time high a couple of months ago. So it's very different than what we're seeing in the United States.</p>
          <p>Secondly, there's an election coming up in the end of 2010 and the administration has got on an accelerated growth initiative underway to stimulate the economy. And also they've lowered interest rates from about 18% to 8%. And now they've won the 2016 Olympics. So I think there is going to be a lot of sort of domestic enthusiasm going on in Brazil and domestic growth in Brazil. Therefore, the strength of reais right now I don't see as impacting the economy negatively.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you for that. And just quickly you mentioned, Jim, that some of your onsite customers are still on take-or-pay. Can you just tell us what percent of your customers are on take-or-pay? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Yeah. There is very little that are left that are on take-or-pay. Right now just about $2 million of revenue and operating profit in this quarter are coming from take-or-pay, and that's actually coming in Germany.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from the line of Don Carson from UBS. Don, you may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Jim, can you talk a bit about the quality of the backlog? I mean you &#x2013; I know initially you thought that it might fall off, because of reduced energy activity. But you seem to have maintained that at a fairly constant level. Are the returns in the backlog as attractive as they were a year ago, or how would you characterize them, especially with some of these new hydrogen projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well, the backlog is essentially unchanged versus the last couple of quarters and the year-ago. We're seeing some delays in &#x2013; caused by our customers in starting up new projects, so the rate of startups hasn't been as fast as it normally would be. But we expect about a half a dozen startups in the fourth quarter, most of them being in Asia. And then secondly, we got a delay in the project in the start-up of our single largest project, which is the Chevron Refinery project. And that delay is caused by some environmental issues that Chevron is facing. So that project would have been starting up right about now, but it looks like it won't start up until a year from now. So that's kind of the negative side of it.</p>
          <p>On the other side, we are winning new projects. We recently won an enhanced oil recovery project in the United States, a gasification project in China and another copper mining project in South America, a refinery modernization project in North America and a couple other projects in China. So we are winning the new projects and I'm quite optimistic that while the total number of projects in the backlog will probably go down, the level of construction spending, and therefore the level of earnings, which will come out of it, will stay about the same. And that's about $2 billion of construction in the backlog. So if we continue to win some of these more interesting oil and gas projects, I think we'll be able to keep the backlog about the same level it is right now.</p>
          <p>Now as you mentioned, on the quality of earnings in the backlog, that will be going down some, and not so much because the world is more competitive, but generally speaking, the smallest projects, we get the highest internal rate of return on, because they're usually projects where we're connecting a new customer to an existing pipeline or something like that. So the smallest projects have the higher IRR. The largest projects like the big Chevron and BP hydrogen projects tend to have a lower IRR. And so as the mix changes more into larger projects, we'll see a little bit of reduction in the total IRR, and we're now looking at a number like 14% of the average project in the backlog in terms of its IRR.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jim, I was wondering if you could comment on what kind of visibility you're seeing on Q4 shutdowns from your customers in the metal and chemicals businesses in particular, but really any areas, manufacturing as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean people have been talking about that in general as a risk to the fourth quarter. Clearly, there will be some shutdowns around the Christmas time period and so forth. I think that's one of the things that people didn't get about last year. We were warning people that there would be shutdowns in the fourth quarter, and that would hurt the fourth quarter. So I think there is an increased sensitivity to it. But my expectation is that steel production levels overall will stay pretty much flat with where they are right now, and the same thing with chemical production. And then you'll probably see some decline in the fourth quarter in semiconductor production, which is typically a seasonal effect on the semis. But the part that we're looking for is really where we have the most leverage is the overall manufacturing, both gases and packaged gases and so forth. And I don't have any real visibility over any shutdowns, and I think that's just going to continue to rise, but on a gradual basis.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Pricing in PDI continues to be positive, both on a year-over-year basis and a sequential basis. And we are going to be looking at some price increases in the near future. So I don't think that's anything for anybody to be concerned about.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Hi, Jim. When you mentioned earlier that sequential growth rates will decelerate not accelerate, were you referring to overall, or was that relative to specific end markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I thought that comment might be a little bit confusing. I was really referring to the chemical and steel and semiconductor sequential growth rates, which were 16%, 8% and 12%. I think we will continue to see sequential growth rates in those end markets, but I think at a &#x2013; not at a 12, 8, 16% kind of rate.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And then as it relates to the backlog, you've talked about the tone of it right now. Could you compare the pace that it's filling or the activity level today versus maybe three or six months ago, would you say that has improved?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's definitely improved versus three to six months ago. I think six months ago, when we were at the beginning of this depression, and there was a lot of uncertainty out there and very little credit out there, people were really unwilling to commit to new projects and to new take-or-pay contracts. I think the general mood is a lot more stability, and so the signings on new contracts is definitely increasing versus what it was six months ago.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jim, could you comment on hydrogen for the base business here? It seems like it's holding up very well, given where refinery margins are these days. Do you think that growth is -- or sort of the performance is sustainable here at these levels for the next couple quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do, and in fact, I think it will continue to go up. Hydrogen consumption in the refinery is really not a function of either the refinery output per se, refinery output is 5 or 10% below what it was a year ago, nor it is a function of refinery margins. In a lot of cases they're actually using more hydrogen to get better margins in the refineries. So it's really a function of the way that they run the refineries, and once they get the refineries stabilized on a certain level of crude feedstock and certain types of end-use products, that's really what determines the hydrogen demand.</p>
          <p>So I think that will keep growing. We're continuing to sign new customers that we can supply from our existing production capacity. And I think we'll continue to see incremental growth in hydrogen without any new projects coming on stream, and then when we see bigger projects coming on stream, there will be a more step-change in growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And switching gears, in terms of merchant, could you give us sort of an update on where your operating rates are and there's some, one of your major competitors raised prices recently in anticipation of higher costs. Do you see the need to raise prices in merchant going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. First of all, I'll tell you, our overall operating rates in the United States are in the mid-70s, and that's up from the low-70s as an average. Part of what's hit those operating rates is a significant decline that we had in the oil fracking business. When natural gas went down to $2, the people doing oil fracking in the Western United States and Canada pretty much just shut down. And that oil fracking was using primarily nitro &#x2013; merchant nitrogen and merchant CO2. So that hurt not only the volume in the merchant business, but it also hurt the margin in the merchant business, because some of that was the most expensive merchant product that we sold. Because of the need to be able to deliver it to a remote location in a rapid period of time, we could get some very nice pricing for that. I think the merchant market is, certain segments of it are still ripe for price increases. There are still a lot of customers who are below reinvestment economics. In other words, their contract might be five-years old and still below current pricing. So I am optimistic that we will be seeing positive pricing in the merchant market.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning, Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Ed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Interest expense. Did I hear you right; it's going to be up 8 million per quarter to around 40 million or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I think some people have been confused a little bit about interest expense, because basically we went into this year and our debt hasn't gone up that much or down that much. But we had a number of bond maturities 12 months ago with coupons of five, six, 7%. And when we got into the sort of financial crisis, the cost of going out and refinancing those, replacing a five-year note with another five-year note, would have been a 400 spread over Treasury or something like that. So we elected to stay short, and for most of this year, we've been issuing commercial paper for less than 0.25%, okay, and well below the banks' cost of commercial paper.</p>
          <p>That has benefited our interest expense tremendously this year. But what you try to do when interest rates come down is to stay short for awhile and take advantage of the short rates and pocket the money you can save on the short rates, you try to stay short for awhile and take advantage of that. But then before rates go up you want to go ahead and issue some long-term bonds, so that you can lock in the low rate environment before it goes up. And so in the third quarter, we found some great opportunities where we issued a 10-year note at 4.25, and a six-year note at about 3.25. And over the full life of history, those are going to be great locked-in interest rates. But those two issues alone will increase interest expense by about eight to $10 million a quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in your volume disclosure for South America, volumes were down 12% year-over-year. And that was actually worse than the second quarter, when volumes were down 10%. So I'd like to understand that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And that relates to the business that we had in cylinder manufacturing. And we have had a business down there where we make our own high-pressure cylinders. And we also, about eight years ago, got into the business of making high-pressure cylinders that we were used on automobiles, so the automobiles can convert from burning either gasoline or ethanol to burning compressed natural gas. So the sales in that business had gone up to about $100 million a year.</p>
          <p>But two things happened over the past several years, which have made it now unprofitable. One of them is that, when the Bolivian government changed, most of the natural gas in Brazil is piped down from Bolivia, and the new Bolivian government reneged on the contract, and Brazil ended up renegotiating to pay significantly more for natural gas from Bolivia. So that meant the cost of natural gas was higher, which meant the natural gas at the pump, or compressed natural gas at the pump, was no longer competitive with gasoline.</p>
          <p>And at the same time, there is almost a lake of ethanol in South America, because there's a huge amount of cane-produced ethanol production. And the U.S. has a huge tariff preventing the entry of that ethanol into the U.S. So at this point in time, ethanol is the choice of fuel for burning in cars. And therefore we're not making as many of these cylinders, and that alone caused our actual volume to decline significantly. But our gas volumes are actually up.</p>

          <p>Hi.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the tax issue, Jim, historically one of the sources of your low tax rate overall was the tax advantage you had in Brazil. So, should we look for an increase in your tax rate going forward now that you've settled and it seems like things are more normalized there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, in fact the &#x2013; there are really two kinds of taxes in Brazil, which raises more money from what are called transactional taxes, where it's accounted for as operating profit like VAT taxes and taxes on bank transactions and so forth. And they've always done that, because it was easier for them to collect money on a transaction rather than to go out to somebody and say, give me your income tax return and pay me some taxes. So, they've had a very high reliance of transactional taxes. The tax cases that we settled go way, way back in time and have more dispute over what the inflation rate and imputed interest rate would be on those taxes going forward. So consequently, what we're really doing is wiping out some pretty significant potential exposures on the operating profit line and are not going to have any impact on the net income tax line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So could you boil that down then to a tax rate outlook for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I expect it to be right about the same, around 28%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Secondly, with respect to the delay in the hydrogen plant out there in California, I also remember that in Whiting for BP, there were a lot of environmental concerns. Any chance that the environmentalists may possibly go after that refinery upgrade in your hydrogen plant, just like they did in California?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, they have and that's &#x2013; that went through and got finally resolved and going forward. The particular case that Chevron that faces in California is a very bizarre case. It was judged by a small town judge in Contra Costa County, and it doesn't really make any sense. So, any of these projects could be challenged with environmental delays, but I don't think that one leads to the other.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then you can list for us some key plant startups for next year, either geographically or by industry? It does sound like your backlog is going to decrease with the six startups in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well, the key startups are the two hydrogen projects. One about six months from now, that would be Chicago. Then the next one about a year from now, which would be the Chevron project. Then we have the SOPO coal gasification project, which is starting up next month. And then the Anhui coal gasification project, which will start up about a year later, then we've got some steel startups and actually more copper mining startups going on in South America. Next year, a startup for Samsung, which is taking place next quarter, and so, it's pretty well diversified by end market and also pretty well diversified by geography.</p>
          <p>But the thing I would say generally is directionally, with the exception of the U.S hydrogen projects, we're going to be investing more in emerging markets countries, in Mexico and South America and China and India, because that's where the demand growth is. There's just not that much demand growth going on in North America and Europe. And then also directionally, to the extent there is demand growth in North America and Europe, it's going to tend to be more environmental-related or and so forth. So, for example, working on some offtake fuel gas projects and so forth to save some of our customers some air emissions.</p>

          <p>And our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy, Banc of America Merrill Lynch. Kevin, you may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, Jim. In your closing remarks, you mentioned that you'd anticipate incremental margins of 30 to 40%. Given the cost reduction actions you've undertaken, I was wondering if you could compare that level to what Praxair would have experienced emerging from prior recessions, say following the 2001 recession, for example?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've never had volumes down this far before, okay? And in the on-site business, the incremental margin, as volume starts to pick up, you don't really get much incremental margin until you break through the threshold level of the take-or-pay contract. Then you'll get some higher incremental margins.</p>
          <p>In the merchant and packaged businesses, that's typically where you see the same kind of operating leverage, when volumes decline, so you can't shut the plant down. Okay? And so we have to run all the same plants and the same &#x2013; not quite all the same number of trucks, but mostly the same number of trucks. And so, as those volumes pick up, I think we'll be getting 30 to 40% incremental margin on them. But the only thing I would say about that is probably at the same time we're going to see natural gas prices go up. And that, on a margin percentage basis -</p>
          <p>I'm not talking about earnings basis, but on margin percentage basis &#x2013; that will probably tend to push down the operating margin percentage. We'll get higher sales from higher natural gas prices, but the same amount of operating profit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. And then shifting gears to packaged gases, as you look at the monthly volume results for September and October, do you see any nascent signs of an early cyclical pick-up here? Or would it be premature to say that at this juncture?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is definitely some momentum in the right direction in packaged gas volumes. But it's not extraordinary or remarkable. It's definitely bottomed and stabilized, and it's definitely picking up. But generally the leading indicator in that business is your hardgood sales, and particularly your sales of laser cutters and welding equipment, which is, job shops have to buy those things when they run out of capacity in their job shop. And they're not buying those things right now. And I think for the most part those shops have more than enough excess capacity given the volume that they are seeing, that it will be sort of a slow march up in volume in packaged gases.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you commented earlier on pricing in PDI and you've also mentioned a particular pricing issue in Asia with the increase in electronics mix. Can you give us a little more color on pricing in the other geographic regions, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pricing is stable pretty much across the board. It's certainly stable in Europe, it's certainly going up in Mexico and South America and to some extent in the US. India and China, if you look at the traditional gases, the merchant oxygen, merchant liquid and argon and so forth, it's stable. It's just that a year ago we had really premium prices in argon, certain electronic gases and helium, and because there's no longer a supply squeeze in those products, those product prices have come down a little bit. But I don't think that's indicative of anything else in the industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then also with respect to your &#x2013; you've got pretty strong margins in South America now. To what extent is that sustainable, and you mentioned you got this compressed gas issue going on there, is that playing a part in it and what can we expect from that in the next few quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, I think the South American margin is definitely sustainable and could be climbing higher. That equipment business that we had was a very low margin business, so we're shutting one of those plants down and sort of phasing that out. So the mix effect should move to higher margins there. And as you know, we try to operate our business model with a high density of production plants, distribution vehicles and customers. And the more density of that that we have, the higher operating margin we can get. And consequently, South America, where we have that very high density, we should be earning a low 20s operating margin percentage.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just wanted to get your impression on whether acquisition multiples have started to come down and either directly in the regional players in the packaged gas and merchant gas markets around the world or on the adjacent markets for PST?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. In the packaged gases, I haven't seen acquisition multiples come down. I think it all has to do specifically with who the seller is. For the most part, the sellers are independently wealthy, family-owned businesses, and they're not in any hurry to sell their business. In the PST business, we were able to take advantage of a business that was owned by a distressed financial buyer, who absolutely had to sell that business, and get it at a very good price. But I don't see much change really in the marketplace there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can you give an update on the mix that you have in Brazil in terms of distribution channels and ancillary businesses? And how you expect that to evolve over the next two to three years, given how strong the economy is there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. The mix we have in Brazil is not dissimilar from the mix that we have on a consolidated basis &#x2013; roughly 25% on-site, and then about a third and a third of cylinder gases and merchant business. The capital investment's going into the on-site, so that's where all the capital growth is going. But the other two distribution segments really use the by-product from the on-site. So I don't see the mix between on-site bulk and packaged changing very much.</p>
          <p>As far as the end market mix, we have a stronger end market mix in food and beverage and healthcare in South America. They represent almost 40% of our total sales in South America. But the growth is really taking place more in the mining and metals and industrial production. So you might see that shift a little bit, but not very much.</p>

        <plist>

          <p>And our next question comes from line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Jeff, you may proceed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, Jim. Sort of just one nested question, of the 90 million in cash outflows stemming from the pre-tax charge you took, how much of the 90 is for restructuring charge and what's for other matters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. None of the 90 is restructuring charge. When we settle up the &#x2013; do the settlements with the government, we'll be paying the majority of what we owe on a discounted basis out of the net operating losses. So we'll be just getting credit for net operating losses that we couldn't use anyway. We'll also be paying some with some deposits that we put down on those cases. And then the net difference will be up to 90 million, depending on how much of the deposits that we have on those cases we actually get back. In terms of the restructuring, we basically just have this cylinder manufacturing plant, which we stopped operating a year ago, and expected we would start it up again, and we still haven't started up again. So we're just impairing that asset.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So in your footnotes in the K, you estimated the liability in Brazil at 380 and you said that, and in the K it also says that you had reserved 210. So in general, why wasn't the charge something like 170 rather than 306?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because the &#x2013; first of all, we added more cases than we had in liabilities in the first place. And then secondly, the NOL was used to satisfy a bigger piece of it. We can &#x2013; I can explain that to you on the phone a little bit more directly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much, Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>And our last question comes from the line of Chris Shaw from Ticonderoga Securities. Chris, you may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. Quickly, I think you've already alluded to the answer on this question, that South America, just if you look at the sequential profit growth versus sequential sales growth, suggests that incremental margins are like 60%. Is that just mostly because you are exiting that business and that was lower margin and that's the difference, or is there a lot of currency in there as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, there's two things in there. If you look at the second quarter 2009 segment operating profit is shown as 70 million. But we actually had, if you may recall, in the second quarter an $11 currency hedging loss, and that's footnoted down on the right side here. So ex that, we would have had $81 million of operating profit in the second quarter. And so you're seeing $81 million go over to $94 million, which is pretty consistent in terms of mark, and it actually goes from 20.6 to 21.6.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And was there a hedging loss in 3Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there was about 2 million hedging loss in 3Q.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>I'll now pass the call back to Jim Sawyer. You may proceed, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, again, thank you all for attending the call. And there's really just one last point that I'd like to make, which I think some people will be interested in focusing on, which is really free cash flow. We are now expecting that we will be able to continue our project backlog in the range of $2 billion of new projects going forward. That obviously depends, six months, a year or two years from now, on which of the projects that we're focusing on end up materializing. But even at that level, we do expect that we will soon grow into generating about $1 billion a year of free cash flow. And I define that really as net income plus depreciation minus capital spending, but before dividends and share buybacks and acquisitions. And so I think, when you look at the cash flow of this business, we're investing a lot of cash flow in new growth. But we're still throwing off a lot of free cash flow for our shareholders. So with that I'd like to thank you for attending the call and look forward to talking with you soon.</p>
