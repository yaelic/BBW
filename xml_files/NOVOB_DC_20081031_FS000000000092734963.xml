          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon and welcome to Deutsche Bank. For those of you who don't know me, my name is Brian Modoff, I am one of the analysts on the pharmaceuticals team here. With me, alongside my colleagues Mark Purcell and Michael <mark type="inaudible" />. It's a great pleasure to welcome you here to Deutsche Bank this afternoon, and also a great pleasure to host Novo Nordisk to receive the presentation following the nine months results.</p>
          <p>So without further ado, I will hand over to Jesper Brandgaard, Jesper, welcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I probably should warn you that this presentation is being webcast live, so &#x2013; and it will be made available to our investors worldwide after this presentation. We are here in London with our nine months results. Of course this includes guidance, not only guidance for 2008, but also guidance for 2009. And when you make predictions about the future in these volatile markets one has to be careful in noting the challenges involved in making forward-looking statements and these have clearly been described on slide number two. So please carefully review that slide and the limitations linked to making forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>In terms of the agenda for this presentation, I will take the responsibility for reviewing the highlights and strategies. K&#xE5;re Schultz will then give a global update on sales. And the specific part that covers the high growth area of international operations, that is the markets outside North America, Europe and Japan, Oceania, the Senior Vice President responsible for that. Mr. H&#xF8;iland will take care of that part of the presentation. Then Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, our Chief Science Officer, will give you an update on research and development. And then I will end off the presentation with a review of the financials.</p>
          <p>In terms of highlights for the first nine months, we've had a steady and positive development in our sales, growing in local currencies 13% but having been faced with the significant negative currency impact of minus 6% the first nine months of this year. As I get back to later, that currency impact will now begin to change and actually be positive for Novo Nordisk based on the rates that we see as of today.</p>
          <p>In terms of the growth of our sales, it's coming from the portfolio of modern insulin. Know that Novo Nordisk is the only company with a full portfolio of modern insulin, and we saw a growth of 29% in local currencies the first nine month. The two other key strategic products for Novo Nordisk, NovoSeven and Norditropin grow &#x2013; grew by 13 and 14% respectively.</p>
          <p>In terms of the geographies, the two key areas for growth is North America, with almost half of our growth and international operation, which accounts for almost 30% of the growth. And North America grew 18% and international operation grew 21%.</p>
          <p>In terms of research and development, I think the key highlight and the key news that we came out with in this release was that we have now obtained clinical proof-of-concept for our two next generation insulins, what we refer to here as NN1250, a new basal insulin, and NN5401, a new combination insulin, with very encouraging results. And it gives Novo Nordisk the opportunity of doing yet another upgrade of our insulin portfolio and it's also a testament to the dedication Novo Nordisk continues to have in the area of R&amp;D, in terms of improving on the molecule insulin and making it better and more convenient for our patients. And we look very much forward to bring this into the clinics next year, and Mads will elaborate significantly on those results.</p>
          <p>And then, we also highlight that we have had very encouraging result with Victoza, which is our brand name within diabetes for liraglutide with the extension of the LEAD 6 study. And where we show that if patients will move from previous treatment of exenatide and moving them to Victoza, then we were able to specifically significant improve their blood sugar control, improve the weight, lower the weight by approximately a kilogram, and also have an improved blood pressure, a lower blood pressure.</p>
          <p>And then finally, within RV, we decided to discontinue our Phase III study because it basically wasn't possible for us in an efficient way to recruit patients. And we were looking at a study delay of around two years, so we have decided to discontinue that study.</p>
          <p>Within financials as I said, 7% reported sales growth, 13% in local currency. We continue to see an improvement in our gross margins. In reported terms, it has only improved by 30 basis points, but it has been impacted by 90 basis points negative impact from currencies, when we will go forward if the full improvement we're making in our gross econo &#x2013; gross margin will flow through the P&amp;L, and you would see, expected next year an improvement of 5,200 basis points in local currency terms. This year we expect local currency terms around 150 basis point improvement, offset probably by 40, 50 basis point of currency impact made this year.</p>
          <p>In terms of operating profit, we have delivered 15% in reported growth and if you adjust for the currency impact, you're looking at 25% or more than 25% underlying growth. We've raised our guidance for operating profit growth primarily because of the moment in currencies but also because of the lower underlying spending pattern. And we've been able to more efficiently close down the pulmonary insulin activities we had. So we raised the guidance by 10 percentage points to now 32 to 35%.</p>
          <p>We have also, and I think I found that highly challenging, we've also provided some guidance for 2009, of course in an organic growing company like Novo Nordisk, it is reasonable or it's relatively easy to provide organic growth numbers in terms of local currencies. It is in these markets much more challenging to provide guidance in terms of reported growth.</p>
          <p>Do note that we've actually, in this already changed announcement, included a new attachment where you can see what precise exchange rates we have used for the guidance and we've also disclosed what currency sensitivity Novo Nordisk have on operating profits both for 2008 and 2009. So as and when currencies move, you will be able to adjust your estimates for Novo Nordisk reported operating profit based on that review of the sensitivities.</p>
          <p>In terms of the corporate strategy, it's unchanged. We continued to have the prime focus on diabetes with two proteins, insulins and GLP-1. We have the skills with devices of top delivery and protein expertise to really expand our leadership within this area and we have a global commercial infrastructure to be able to pursue the opportunities not only of insulin, but also of our exciting new molecule, the GLP-1, Victoza. Within obesity we hope that liraglutide can take &#x2013; or Victoza can take Novo Nordisk into the area of obesity, We have very promising Phase II data and we anticipate, or plan to start at a large Phase III trial with 5,000 patients within the area of GLP-1, and hopefully that molecule can pave Novo Nordisk's way into the area of obesity to pursue the opportunities inherent in a world where there is a rising level of obesity globally.</p>
          <p>In term of hemophilia, we have a strategy based on our original recombinant molecule NovoSeven to expand from niche player for inhibitor hemophilia, to become more broad-based within hemophilia treatment, moving towards both sector eight and sector nine market, and hopefully also making long-acting versions of these molecules to expand the hemophilia franchise. And within growth hormone we are currently pursuing to make a longer acting version of growth hormone and also, note Novo Nordisk's dedication in actually getting all the possible indication for our growth hormone, pursuing even this indication to continue to be able to grow our growth hormone franchise.</p>
          <p>The menopausal symptoms and hormones, the HRT franchise, is more for Novo Nordisk a cash cow where we seek to maximize the value of that franchise and then we have a new venture into inflammation where we, in the summer of this year, have brought the two first molecules into clinical development and hopefully over time can build a presence within that area.</p>
          <p>In terms of the Novo Nordisk franchise, you see an insulin markets world leader, with 52% market share based on market leadership in all of our four sales regions, as illustrated on this slide and note that we have now grown our North American market share to 42%.</p>
          <p>In terms of our core franchise insulin, we continue to guide the market with a growth within the insulin franchise of at least 10% year-by-year. And on this slide, we have, to the left, illustrated how this has performed looking back the last five years, looking what the numbers were on a moving annual total back in August 2003, and what they are with the latest data we have from August 2008.</p>
          <p>As you can see from this chart, we've had a growth in volume terms of the insulin market of 6.3% and on top of that we have measured in Danish kroner had a growth of an additional value pick-up of 5%, and that of course have been significantly impacted by the decline in currencies like the US dollar. So if we had measured it from a US dollar prospective &#x2013; you had looked at a growth in the markets, not taking into account the market share gains Novo Nordisk have achieved in that period, you would be looking at a growth in US dollar terms of almost 20%. And of course all this growth in terms of volume is based on an ever increasing number of people with diabetes. There we've taken the latest numbers from the International Diabetes Federation predicting that there was around 250 million people with diabetes in 2007 and expecting it to grow by three to 4% towards 2025, reaching almost 400 million people by 2025.</p>
          <p>In addition to the insulin franchise, of course GLP-1 offers great opportunity for Novo Nordisk. We've tried to illustrate this on this slide. Today diabetes care treatment really consists of three key segments. You have the tablet treatment, the oral anti-diabetic agents, you have the insulins, and then as the new and emerging segment, you have the GLP-1, which today is a approximately US$800 million, in market size; 90% of that value today is in the US. So you can say that GLP-1 segment is not really yet evolved into becoming a global segment. Hopefully with the launch of Victoza, we can really grow that segment and making it become a global segment. But as you can also see from this slide, it is really within the area of insulin treatment and protein-based treatment of diabetes where the growth is, whereas the old segment is gradually declining. And it will probably not be long before the protein part of diabetes care treatment will overtake the tablet-based treatment. And with those comments I will hand over to K&#xE5;re for an update on sales.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jesper. Ladies and gentlemen, it's a pleasure to be here. My name is K&#xE5;re Schultz. I'm the Chief Operating Officer and I will look forward to presenting some strong sales numbers for you in the coming minutes. If we start by looking at the overall sales &#x2013; and Jesper had just commented on the total growth in both local currencies and its report. If we look at the composition of the growth, then you can see that three quarters is coming from the diabetes care area and the whole growth there is coming from modern insulins; that is, the three modern insulins we talked about before that are driving our business. If we then took to the biopharm area, then the majority of the growth there comes from two products, Norditropin and NovoSeven, both doing very nice and adding up to the total picture of double-digit local currency growth.</p>
          <p>The three insulins, which means that we have a full portfolio, are NovoRapid, the fast acting, NovoMix, the premixed insulin, and Levemir the long acting insulin. Here you can see the penetration curves of the world market. And it's clear that NovoRapid has the highest penetration, that is simply a fact stemming from the fact that it was launched earlier than the other products. NovoMix was the next one we launched, and Levemir was only launched some years ago. And you can see that all three products have a steady increasing market share, which is a reflection of the strong competitive position they have in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>If you look at these current sales, then the total sales are split with a majority being on NovoRapid, again due to the fact it was launched earlier. If you go in and analyze the growth of these three products, you will see that each of the three products are actually growing roughly a third of the total growth. That of course means that percentage wise, the growth of Levemir is 50% reported, 60% underlying because it's the latest launched product, whereas for NovoRapid, you are talking 14% reported and above 20% in local currency.</p>
          <p>We are in the middle of a conversion of a generation change in insulin. Those of you who have followed us for some years would know that this is probably the fourth or the fifth generation since the 1920s, depending on how you look at it. The sales have actually being growing between 12 and 15% over the last 80 years every year and it has been driven by a constant upgrade to new generations of insulin.</p>
          <p>The modern insulins, or the insulin analogues, which are modified versions of human insulin which gives more convenience, better action profiles, now constitute 56% of volume and they are growing steadily at the tune of around 6 percentage points per year.</p>
          <p>In this space we've been competing with our old competitors, Eli Lilly and Hoechst, becoming Aventis, becoming Sanofi-Aventis &#x2013; so going from German to French. And what you can see is that Lilly has been losing out steadily and the dynamics are reducing somewhat. They are losing at a slower pace. Sanofi has been gaining and have leveled off. We have been gaining strongly, but the dynamics are coming slowly down to a lower level. The reason why the dynamics are decreasing for all three players is basically that we've come further in the launch phase of all the new products.</p>
          <p>If then we turn to NovoSeven, then NovoSeven showing a very strong performance here in the first nine months of 2008, and we have to admit, we're slightly positively surprised by this. Our guidance at the end of last year was more sort of &#x2013; slightly below 10%. And we are seeing strong double-digit growth in local currency.</p>
          <p>What has happened is that we've come out with some improved products; we've done our lifecycle management work. So we now launched a room temperature stable version on NovoSeven, which means you can take NovoSeven with you. You don't need to keep in the fridge. For boys who have hemophilia, this can actually matter because it means you can have it in your school bag, so to speak, so if you get a bleed at school, for instance, you can inject immediately, which is a big improvement in therapy, whereas you would otherwise have to have it in the fridge of the school nurse or at home and so on. So it has added flexibility to the way that NovoSeven can be used in hemophilia. And this is probably one part of the stronger than expected pattern. Another part is probably that the negative effect we were fearing to see from the fact that we stopped our trauma trial &#x2013; we have not really seen that. It doesn't seem that the &#x2013; investigative use of NovoSeven is really sort of diminishing over time as we speak. So all in all, a very positive situation for NovoSeven.</p>
          <p>If we look at Norditropin, our growth hormone, where we have the NordiFlex product which is a liquid formulation of growth hormone in the world's easiest and most convenient to use device. There we have also seen a strong continued growth with 13% in local currencies. This is despite the fact that there are probably niche markets between five and eight different suppliers of growth hormone as a drug product. So this is a case for analyzing prior similar competition and seeing what really happens in a marketplace where five to eight players have the same molecule, but in different formulations and in different versions.</p>
          <p>We're seeing that North America is the main contributor to growth, with a share of 40% of the growth the first nine months and we're also seeing a worldwide volume market share now of around 24 and the US coming up toward that level.</p>
          <p>We do have an ambition in a couple of years to see if we can become number one. We've had a long standing fight with Pharmacia, now Pfizer, to try to become number one in growth hormone, and we hope that that's within reach within a few years.</p>
          <p>If we go to the regional perspective, then we have very different regional dynamics. And I will try to go through that briefly. International regions, I'll not talk so much about because my colleague, Jesper H&#xF8;iland, who's in charge of that area, will come very shortly and talk about that. But you can see here, growth above 20%. That's really based on demographics, as he will explain.</p>
          <p>North America: a growth of 18%, that's really based on both good market dynamics, but also us taking share in the total pharmaceuticals space. Our products, in general, do not have the same market share in North America as they have in the rest of the world. Insulin market share is below the rest of the world and growing. Growth hormone market shares, below the rest of the world and growing.</p>
          <p>Europe: single digit growth. That's also what we expect going forward. Lots of price reform and mature market, we have a very high market share, and that's how we see that develop. Japan, Oceania: low single-digit growth. That is how we see it without any new launches because we have price cuts every second year. So it would say the trigger for more dynamics in Europe and Japan will definitely be the launch of Victoza, which is something that you will hear more about later.</p>
          <p>So that's the overall pattern, and you could speculate on the dynamics of the composition. I won't talk so much about that. But it's clear that right now Europe is still the biggest part of our sales. That is all here done in reported currencies, with the dollar changing very rapidly. It could be soon that you will see North America being bigger than Europe.</p>
          <p>In the space of modern insulins, we have the three key products, and I'll give a few comments to Levemir. If you look at Levemir, then you can see here that it has been growing very steadily since the launch in 2006, and we are now at a level where we have sort of roughly 25% of the long-acting modern insulin segment in Europe. Of course, our ambition is to be a market leader in this segment, like in all other insulin segments. So we're in there for the long haul. And you can also see, it's going to take us a few years, we are convinced we'll get there, but it's a long game we are playing here.</p>
          <p>And if you look at the share of total modern insulins &#x2013; so all the three types of modern insulins: the fast-acting, premix and long-acting &#x2013; then we are the clear leader in Europe, but again here, we would like to continue to further build our leadership position.</p>
          <p>If we then go in at &#x2013; look in the US market and look at this from a different perspective where we look at the volume, then you can see here that we are having sort of the 40 plus percent that we talked about before. And what's really going to drive us forward is a continued strong penetration of the long-acting modern insulin segment in the US. This is the single biggest insulin segment in the world and it's the segment where we are behind because it's dominated by Lantus from Sanofi-Aventis. That is annoying in one in sense, in another sense it's good, because it means that there is a huge potential to keep on growing in this segment. Of course, we have very good dynamics, which is why Levemir is growing 60% in local currency for the first nine months.</p>
          <p>Now we are getting to some of the demographics and this is where it comes very interesting to look at international operations.</p>
          <p>And I would like introduce Jesper H&#xF8;iland, Senior Vice President International Operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. K&#xE5;re, and let me start up by saying I'm extremely excited being here. Normally I travel &#x2013; do I have to stand here? Because I am on a microphone, okay. Normally I travel 150 days a year and it's certainly not to places like London. It is to what we refer to in many companies as the rest of the world. International operations consists of roughly of 150 countries in the world.</p>
          <p>International operations is the abbreviations or the arm, that we are using for the part that basically represents 20% of Novo Nordisk, but as Jesper also alluded to, it's about 30% of the growth and when one is looking at these numbers, it's not that surprising. If one is looking at international operations at other pharma companies, one will often hear the terms "miscellaneous," "rest of the world," and the reason for that is that part of the world that I'm representing is a relatively small terms part of the big pharma companies, because they are not that well represented in the rest of the world or in international operations. They are focusing energy and resources on Europe, North America and Japan.</p>
          <p>If we're looking at the numbers for diabetes, it of course looks very different. If you are looking up at the graph up here you will notice that if you add North America, Europe and Japan, they would basically have the same amount of diabetics as we are having in India. And that's of course stunning. Of course, we then should say, "then we should sell much more," but of course there is also something called cost levels and salary levels and tax levels, but those are the things that we are tackling with on a day-to-day basis.</p>
          <p>If we are looking at diabetes as such, we are talking about a pandemic. Basically, we will be seeing a number of diabetics, over the next 20 years, growing, with some 120 million more patients. And in particular we have broken up big countries. India is very, very hard hit by diabetes, and one of the reasons is that India is undergoing huge changes as we are speaking. Lots of people both in &#x2013; basically in Asia &#x2013; are moving from the rural areas to the cities. Consequences of that is that they spend less time on hard physical work.</p>
          <p>Another phenomena that we have noticed when we're looking at diabetes is you become diabetic in Asia or much more earlier, you could say, or in comparison to the Caucasians, you will get diabetes at around a BMI around 22, 23. That's what we in the western world will call lean, whereas that would become quite normal in the Asian population. And as a consequence of that we're seeing staggering numbers when we are looking at the number of patients coming in the years to come.</p>
          <p>Another parameter for the changes that you're seeing is the growth of GDP. One of the things that is happening in today's world is more than 50% of the world's GDP is taking place in international operations. And that's of course, has a spiral effect, people are moving to the city, occupying jobs such as in the western world, so to speak, but also in the lifestyle of the western world and the phenotypes of the Asians in particular will develop diabetes much, much more rapidly. So the growth numbers that we're seeing is stunning and something that we will, in Novo Nordisk, have to do something about it.</p>
          <p>If we then are looking at how we're performing sales-wise, we are proud to say that we are growing at double-digit growth, 20% plus. It's basically what we have done in the last five years and if we should give a guidance for the future that will also be the number that we'd be looking for in local currencies. I have to say, because I guess we've also said, it's very difficult to direct on the basis of currencies, in particularly also in the currencies that we have representing in 150 countries in the world.</p>
          <p>If we're looking at how are we then faring when it comes to market shares? Novo Nordisk, one could say, is the marker leader, certainly, the market share close to 60%. One of the interesting things is &#x2013; if you're looking up at this slide is &#x2013; if you add up Sanofi-Aventis leading, and in particular Novo Nordisk, they are having in terms of total volume market share. We're talking about 97%. That leaves 3%, 4% to what we call biosimilars. And it's something that we are spending a lot time talking about. However, the real world is that they having a relatively small space within the markets that we're covering.</p>
          <p>I do realize that we're only covering 13 markets on this slide. However, I think it's fairly representative. This is a volume slide. If you're looking at it from a value point of view, it even looks better for Novo Nordisk, meaning we are having a higher value market share than we're having a volume market share. That's why we see the biggest changes, because Sanofi-Aventis and Lilly will be strongly competing with each other if we are adding in the value perspective.</p>
          <p>That's the market &#x2013; the share of Novo Nordisk that we are representing. We have been steadily growing. One of the things that we have done within international operations is we have made ourselves less dependent on what we call tender business, meaning markets where they have to hand in an envelope with a price and then we get the selling for the next period of time.</p>
          <p>In the past, international operations was highly dependent on this sort of sales, with more than 20% of our total business being in tenders. Today we have reduced it to 10 to 12% of our business. We have done that by purpose, because we are focusing on what we refer to as the private market. And if one will understand what is the private market is all about, it's basically the market that we are knowing in the western world in terms of pricing, the only difference is, to many of the markets that we know is, it's out of pocket, meaning that the patients will be paying for themselves. That can, of course, happen because many of these markets will have populations that are equal &#x2013; if we take India and China combined they will have a population equal to that of Europe in terms of middle class that are capable of paying for the products.</p>
          <p>If we then looking at the penetration in the modern insulins, the strategy of Novo Nordisk is of course operating our products to the best products to improve the quality of life for our patients and there modern insulins comes into play. You will see a relatively modest start with 3% only but that also refers to that many, many of the markets that <mark type="inaudible" /> are representing, getting later on to introduce that we have seen in the past, both in North America and Europe being first to introduce the new modern insulins. We are typically 2 to 3 years later getting into the market, but we are seeing a steady performance of around 7% market share gains per year for the modern insulins. So one we'll say we are then relatively well and of course, we have still ahead an opportunity for value op of 65% being the residual of how we have done so far.</p>
          <p>If we are looking at diabetes as such, it's not really, as <mark type="inaudible" /> started out by saying, known that much in the rural areas. One of the reasons is many of the doctors are not that well trained to diagnose diabetes, and as a consequence of that, it's not that well known. Novo Nordisk has spent huge resources and efforts in lifting the educational levels of the doctors.</p>
          <p>If you take a look at the numbers that we have represented in our annual report, basically the last 3 to 4 years we have educated more than a 160,000 healthcare professionals in China, and that's of course the consequences of seeing improved diagnostics &#x2013; or diagnosis of diabetes.</p>
          <p>One of the things that is happening as we are speaking in China, about 2 million people are every month migrating to the big cities. And when we are looking at diabetes from that point of view, diabetes is the same problem as we are knowing it in the more, I would say modern cities such as Singapore or Hong Kong. It's about 10% of the Chinese that will get diabetes as we will also be seeing in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai.</p>
          <p>If you're looking at Novo Nordisk and talking China, one of the huge differences is, we are really focusing in on all the cities that are more than a million inhabitants. And if you're coming from Denmark, you will know that 1 million city, that's the capital of the country, whereas if you're talking Asia, we're talking 150 cities. That's where we're focusing our resources. Many of the big pharma companies are only focusing on the top tier &#x2013; three-tier cities, and that's about 21 cities that they're focusing their resources on.</p>
          <p>Of course, one of the problems that we are having, or one of the challenges that we are having on our shoulders and the burdens, that is that we need to improve the number of patients that are using insulin. Today, it is only about 5% of all patients with diabetes that are using it. It should be in a ballpark figure between 8 and 10% using insulin, if you are making it to the comparison of the western world. So there is certainly a volume up, if you will, opportunity in international operations. And that's part of where we're seeing the growth is coming from.</p>
          <p>If we then are looking at this slide, you might notice the slide that Jesper showed a little earlier there that talked about 6.3% volume growth. In China, we are looking at the volume growth of 23%. So it's a really a huge number of patients that are added onto the market. If you then are looking at it, how are we're faring when it comes to VRAB, which is closely related to the US dollar, we're basically looking at a growth rate of more than 30%, and that's basically also the guidance that we are giving and how we will be performing in this part of world.</p>
          <p>Modern insulins is still not that big in China. Unfortunately we have not been able to introduce our long-acting Levemir into the Chinese market, but we do anticipate that to happen during the next year, and then of course we will give Sanofi-Aventis a run for their money, because we are having a significantly better product with our Levemir, and I'm sure that Mads can elaborate on that. And if not, I would certainly be happy <mark type="inaudible" /> to tell in this respect.</p>
          <p>37% growth rate over the year, of course, as I'm saying &#x2013; 37% here, but if you're looking at, the base is also getting bigger and bigger. So our 30% is a good guiding for what they are doing. If you then are looking at the market shares, and as well as the interesting things when we're seeing our quality in the industry speaking up about market share in, in particular, China &#x2013; and if you added up their market share, what they are claiming to have, and the actual figures that are out there, you will look at a market share closer to 200% and not 100%.</p>
          <p>The fact of the matter is that Novo Nordisk is the biggest diabetes care company in China and are having to the tune of 62% of the market. And as I said, are even high market share when it comes to revenue. So Novo Nordisk, being market leader, whereas also as you see here, many competitors &#x2013; also local competitors are heading at very small places of the market. That leaves me out of the picture and calls for you, Mads. It's all about live in the environment, we should use that.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jesper. But before I actually dwell on the R&amp;D pipeline of new knowledge, I'll give our view on two important external events that have taken place since we met last at the half year result. One relates to the study to end all studies regarding the question does glucose control matter? And that is the UKPDS, obviously conducted here in the UK, which actually are now to be 10 year follow-up results to the UKPDS trial.</p>
          <p>And important to notice here is that these patients who discontinued their literally randomized treatment just before the Barcelona meeting in 1998. They, as you recall, some of you had a difference in that glucose achievement of 4.9% hemoglobin A1c. But that was more than 10 years ago. So after the file came to an end in the late 90s, the patients were treated alike and they have the same glucose levels. However, 10 years later, when the UKPDS did their follow-up analysis, the group that originally had, more than a decade ago, a 0.9% improvement in hemoglobin A1c suddenly had highly significantly reductions of 13% overall metallurgy, 15% myocardial infarctions, 17% diabetes related deaths and 24% macrovascular complications. All in all, implying is so-called legacy effect, meaning that a person who has been in good glucose control more than a decade ago will re-benefit on his or her health decades later, just based on a difference of 0.9%, i.e. glucose control does matter. We have known it all along, now we can prove it, it is a conclusive study.</p>
          <p>The other thing that I would like to hint at is the so-called consensus guidelines that have emerged from the ADA and the European organization EASD in last week's diabetes care and <mark type="inaudible" /> (34.54) journals. And important here to notice is that there has actually been an upgrade that is highly favorable to the patients because it will imply better glucose control, as we've just heard about, but also highly favorable to Novo Nordisk because we now have a position where insulin is considered one of the two well-delegated second line therapies just after metformin failure, whereas there has been an upgrade in that GLP-1 has been included as the so-called less well validated, but still an offering for second line therapy, in contrast to a broadcast such as DPV4 inhibitors, the <mark type="inaudible" /> inhibitors and so on.</p>
          <p>So with those two important comments that I think are favorable for the patients &#x2013; or to the patients, but also to the Novo Nordisk's Corporation, I will then begin to the real R&amp;D update. What we have up here is the diabetes care pipeline of the company. And maybe I should &#x2013; first I should just give a quick statement on the regulatory process for liraglutide, also known as Victoza, and that is really that we are in the process right now of starting to address these questions that we've just received from the European Medicines Agency, and that will take us a couple of months. Whereas, vis-&#xE0;-vis the US situation, we are preparing ourselves for the Advisory Committee Meeting that you are pretty much aware will take place on March the 2 next year.</p>
          <p>Japan, we are, as K&#xE5;re alluded to in the situation that we actually would also like to get a Victoza early to market. It's a ideal drug for the Asian population as we have shown in page three, and we had a very constructive dialogue and are also receiving questions from the PFPA agency there. Now Jesper hinted at the two new generation insulins, the NN1250 and 5401, as being significant value drivers, we hope, of the future company decades into the future.</p>
          <p>Now a quick word about them. It is, indeed, a further refinement of the so-called isolation technology where Novo Nordisk is able to obtain and make fatty acids to design the profile of the drug in terms of duration affection, flatness of profile, et cetera. And what we have done here is actually developed throughout Phase II both the single agent known as NN1250 and the dual acting analog progression known as NN5401.</p>
          <p>And headline data were just achieved &#x2013; or received &#x2013; in our offices very, very recently and hence could make it for this company announcement, and they are related to the notion that in the NN5401 project, we saw some rather unprecedented outcomes in that patients all the way from the one half up to two-thirds of the patients we're able to achieve ADA target of going below 7% in the absence any hypoglycemia the preceding four weeks.</p>
          <p>These data are indeed highly compelling and make us optimistic for the start of Phase III for this project, which will take place in the second half of next year. The agent, or agents, I should say was indeed also a self &#x2013; safe and were well-tolerated from a local injection site and systemic <mark type="inaudible" /> perspective. The other one, called NN1250, is a super basal analog, you can say. The situation is that we have been able to prove not only good glucose control with about half of the patients getting A1c in the ADA target of below seven without hypoglycemia, but also to the extent that having done some co-metrics simulations and assessing that this agent was so long acting that we may indeed provide it to the patient on a Monday, Wednesday, Friday regimen giving the patient a holiday off the drug at the weekend and henceforth only needing blood glucose measurements also three times a week. This was compared up again insulin glargine, given once daily, and we saw exactly the same degree of target achievement in terms of getting patients Hb1c down. Which we consider highly innovative and value-adding to future patients if we can replicate such data in Phase III. Again, I should mention that general safety, both locally and systemically, was as we hoped for and expected and we will initiate a major Phase III program in the second half of next year and it's all in the preliminary budget.</p>
          <p>If we then look at Victoza, we have a situation where we did announce to the Canadian Society the 26-week results up against exenatide and so-called LEAD 6 program. But what has happened is essentially that after those 26 weeks, we thought it was impeding for the patients, they should all be offered the <mark type="inaudible" /> part of Victoza as it was the planned in the protocol. And indeed, they did &#x2013; basically all of them, minus a couple &#x2013; switch to liraglutide and were then followed for a further 14 week inspection trial in non-re-randomized fashion. And what we saw as already seen <mark type="inaudible" /> was an HbA1c drop of 0.3 percentage points, down to the level of the original Victoza group, and importantly and statistically significantly, we also saw a close to one millimolar drop in fasting glucose, a body weight reduction of approximately a kilogram, and its systolic blood pressure decreased from the exenatide treatment period of close to 4 mm mercury in the systolic blood pressure clinically. Also very meaningful and the tolerability profile of Victoza was confirmed.</p>
          <p>And talking about tolerability, we have actually the nausea data here. What you're seeing is the notion that liraglutide can give tension and mild nausea in a subset of patients maybe to the tune of a total of 20% or so depending on which studies we are looking at, but the big difference between liraglutide and exenatide in this regard is simply the observation that with liraglutide, with the smooth <mark type="inaudible" /> profile, what happens is that the body gets accustomed to this drug and over time &#x2013; typically two to three months &#x2013; the reporting on a weekly basis of nausea in patients that are treated with Victoza drops to a baseline level of just a few percentage points. Which confronts with exenatide that has a continuous week to weekly reporting in the ballpark of 10% patients reporting nausea.</p>
          <p>So again, we feel that we are in a good clinical shape to take up the challenge of expanding the GOP1 market once we have approval in the various markets. Now homeostasis, or I should be almost say hemophilia, here NovoSeven in trauma has been taken out and that is due to the notion that the interim analysis that we conducted earlier this year showed that it would be futile with the trial size population that we had, to prove the point that there could be a mortality reduction due to a lower than expected overall mortality in treatment population. And this also means that the data we just received very recently, they showed no significant difference in mortality. What did they did show, importantly, was, as we hoped for and expected, that NovoSeven is indeed a effective hemostatic agent in as much as there were significant reductions in red blood cell transfusions, in fresh frozen plasma transfusions and in transfusions of allogeneic blood. And the safety profile, as we know today, was also confirmed.</p>
          <p>Now regarding the remaining pipeline: the effect of 13 molecules in the competent factor XIII has interface being within the contingencies deficiency and we have now completed the Phase I study for the long-acting prophylactic analogue, the NN7128 long-acting factor VIIa derivative.</p>
          <p>Based on that, I will shift to my last slide, which is Other Biofunction <mark type="inaudible" /> and here the update is, as already mentioned in the first talk by Jesper, that the low serum albumin in dialysis, or the so called APCD project as we've previously called it, has been discontinued and the causation here is that the recruitment time was at least two years extended compared to original. This means that you dilute out the signal that you looking for, because you certainly have to go to minimal sites, some of them will be research-na&#xEF;ve and &#x2013; which is a disadvantage to this kind, obviously, of trial &#x2013; and at same time we've had to go into territories where this standard of care is very much different from that based upon which the trial was originally designed.</p>
          <p>Finally, my last word is the notion that we have now entered the first two protein-based anti-inflammatory projects into the pipeline and they are the anti-IL-20 body and the Anti-C5aR antibody, both based on partnering within the biotech arena. And with that over to you, Jesper.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mads. And then finishing off with the financials: look at the results for the first nine months, as I said, a reported sales growth of 7% and also a growth in our gross profit of just over 7%, as you can see the gross margin expanding by 30 basis points. I'll just get back to that on the next slide.</p>
          <p>Our sales and distribution costs was lower compared to last year, and also note last year we had a one-time charge related to a anti-dumping case in Brazil. The guidance we've given for this year's sales and distribution cost is &#x2013; sales and distribution cost in the ballpark of 29%. Research and development cost includes 325 million through the close down of pulmonary diabetes projects which have been completed now. And we expect we &#x2013; cost in these areas to be around 17%.</p>
          <p>Admin expenses continue to grow less than sales and we now are below the 6% mark at 5.7. And we should also be below 6% for the full year, in term[s] of admin expenses. As you can see from this, growing our operating profit 15%, a significant decline in net financial is a reflection of the divestment we did last year of our share of the Danish cancer diagnostic company, Dako, which was divested at a profit of 1.5 billion, so that's why you see a decline. The income this year is related to hedging gains the first nine months of the year. Note that we will have losses in the final three months because of the movement in currencies, and our guidance there is in the ballpark of 350 million for the full year.</p>
          <p>In terms of tax rate, expect also 24% for the full year, and the low tax rate last year was late to the non-recurring &#x2013; or the non-taxable nature of the income related to Dako, and also a lowering of the Danish corporate tax, which had an impact on our deferred taxes, a once-off item. <mark type="inaudible" /> we actually have slightly lowered our recurring tax rate. It's now 24, and the net profit hence is in a slight decline after nine months.</p>
          <p>In terms of the gross margin development, as you can see from this one, a credit &#x2013; a gradual improvement in our gross margin, or the gross margin improvement in the local currency terms have been through the tune of 120 basis points. We expect for full year around 150 basis points local currency. We had in the first nine month approximately 90 basis point negative impact. The key driver is productivity gains within the area of insulin manufacturing, especially in relation to the production of the bulk substance, the insulin crystals and &#x2013; but there is also a slight positive pricing impact from the US.</p>
          <p>In terms of the currency development, this is why we have such challenges in providing guidance, especially for 2009, because of this significant change in the currencies and the extreme volatile currency environment. I think it's apparent from this chart that a company like a Novo Nordisk &#x2013; which, to a large degree, manufacturers and researchers vary significantly based in the Euro-zone and sell our products globally &#x2013; we will benefit significant from this movement because of a substantially higher US dollar and also a substantially higher Japanese yen.</p>
          <p>As you can see from this chart, we've also giving you the sensitivity for the individual currencies, so that you are able to predict what the operating profit will develop, given a certain level for the various currencies. But also note that, from a hedging perspective, next year will be impacted negative by hitting losses as we have hit the three main currencies towards the end of next year. When we get into 2010 and assuming that we have stable currencies, then it will actually flow all the way down to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>In terms of our outlook, we continue to guide this year for a growth between 11 to 13% in local currencies. Now we are saying we will only have 3% negative currency impact. After six months we actually had predicted that we would have 6% negative currency impact. So that says something about the shift we're seeing now in the currencies.</p>
          <p>Underlying growth of now more than 25% and reported operating profit &#x2013; if profit growth -increased by 10% in guidance, so we now expect growth while operating profit reported to be in the ballpark of 32 to 35% because primarily of the currencies. And you can see on this slide, you can see what was the current rate &#x2013; that was the official rate from the Danish National Bank on Wednesday and they are &#x2013; at least as we went to this meeting, fairly representative of the current level for exchange rates as &#x2013; versus to the Danish kroner.</p>
          <p>In terms of the tax rate, as I said, still expected to be 24. Capital expenditure lower, to around 1.5 billion in expectation and as consequence, free cash flow operated was 1 billion to now 9.5 billion. And we've also provided with you &#x2013; with some ballpark numbers for the growth in 2009, is showing that we will have a sales growth in the ballpark of 10% and also a similar level for operating profit growth in local currencies. And using the rates &#x2013; the current rates stated on this chart, this would, if you calculate that through, then you will have approximately 8% higher growth in terms of sales and the impact of operating profit would be around double, or at least 15 percentage point higher. So with that, we'll end the presentation.</p>
          <p>Just to state, Novo Nordisk strategic precision as the world leader in the global insulin market. We are number one also in the modern insulin segment. We're number one in the global inhibitor segment in &#x2013; within hemophilia. We're number two in the growth hormone market, and we are the world's leading producer of injection devices.</p>
          <p> With our leadership position within diabetes care based on the full portfolio of modern insulin, which are later going to be supplemented with the new generation of insulin as Mads descried. We have a very promising GLP-1 compound in Victoza, we have a premium growth hormone product with a liquid in a disposable device, the NordiFlex product, and we have &#x2013; we continue to expand our presence in North America and growth opportunities are significant in the international operations, as described by Jesper H&#xF8;iland, driven primarily by China and overall, we are actually bringing our portfolio on patent moving from human insulin, which are all patent and then to the modern insulin portfolio being non-patent.</p>
          <p>And with those comments, Brian, I think we'll do Q&amp;A session. We have approximately 20 minutes.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Question first for Mads just on the next generation insulin, modern insulins, firstly do you see, how important do you think the dosing convenience of a longer-acting formulation might be? And secondly just on the safety side, conceptually, are there any safety issues with a longer-acting insulin? And I'm specifically thinking about how you treat any observed episodes of hypoglycemia bearing in mind that we have seen a low incidence but are there any conceptual issues? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Brian, those are absolutely excellent questions and I'll address them one by one. Vis-&#xE0;-vis, let's say the, longevity or how long a basal analogue works, there are several benefits of making it significantly more than 24 hours. Let me mention a few. One of them relates to the notion that studies in the US have shown that the compliance with insulin injection therapy in type 2 diabetes is only around 75-76%. This means that every fourth injection is not being taken. Now since we have proven we can dose Monday, Wednesday and Friday and give the patients the same degree of control in a treat-to-target a study as does insulin glargine, then I think we've also proven the point that even relative non-compliance will have less deleterious effects for this compound than for any other base mentioned.</p>
          <p>Let me also mention the notion that in the &#x2013; some of these studies &#x2013; or one of these studies here &#x2013; it's a fact that patients come in with type 1 diabetes entering our trial. They were basing not all of them taking insulin glargine on a &#x2013; or insulin demelir for that matter &#x2013; on a once-daily basis but on a twice-daily basis, a very significant proportion. Henceforth, we are also proving here that we have indeed the first true more than a 24-hour active compound, which is also reflected in the planned studies that you have seen, a little hint at the capital markets day. Then I would furthermore add that the new paradigm of Monday, Wednesday, Friday is obviously something that, for those who are needle-phobic and really hate the idea every time they have to take off their shirt and inject themselves in the belly or in the thigh, for them this is a very pertinent offering.</p>
          <p>We are not saying that everybody is going on to a three time a week regime, but we are a company that has never been a one-stop shop like saying one size fits all, rather a portfolio-based approach, where different people with different mindset, motivational levels and fears and whatnot have different offerings based on our &#x2013; the totality of our portfolio. So I think these are very interesting data.</p>
          <p>The other question was about safety and there the situation is that when you get a hypoglycemia, also if you're taking insulin glargine or impaged insulin then the hypo is a problem, here and now, that has to be reverted ASAP otherwise you can go into, as you know, a convulsive state and die from it. Now that is an acute problem and it doesn't really change whether you have 17 hours of insulin left in your body or whether you have 37 hours of insulin left in your body. You just have to address the issue. And I'm happy to note that because this profile is more peak-less than Lantus and Levemir are, then the notion is that the peak-to-valley fluctuation that we're witnessing for the compound, even when given in the three times weekly regime, is not significantly larger than the peak-to-valley fluctuation that you're seeing on a daily basis for insulin glargine. So from that perspective it should be applied also. But we'll see. We haven't done Phase III yet.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, it's Andrew Baum, Morgan Stanley. A question for Jesper, could you just talk about the marketing plans for Lera in terms of how you're going to structure the sales force, whether there's a separate sales force particularly in the US for Lera? What kind of size is it? What happens in the event that delay occurs? Does this same sales force get allocated to your existing insulin analogues? Give us some of the indication of those things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll give you a few comments and maybe K&#xE5;re can also add a few comments. But I think the broad communication we have is actually stated in our expectations for 2009, which is that we expect not to expand our operating margin, looking at it in local currency terms, because we'll grow our operating profit in line with our sales growth and hence we expect the expansion that we will make in our gross margin will help to fund a increased level of selling and distribution cost relative to sales.</p>
          <p>We have also taken the stance, in terms of the detailed strategies, for the launch of liraglutide, not to communicate specifically on the number of reps that we're going to add; the only thing we have said is that we're going to add reps and we will add reps both in North America and we'll do that in Europe as we bring this product into the market. What the precise timing is going to be we're not going to be specific about, either. It is our assessment that it would be an advantage for us to keep this as company confidential information. But you have a clear guidance that you should expect our selling and distribution ratio to increase. And K&#xE5;re, whether you want to elaborate on that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can give you just a little more tactical guidance. And that is that you should see it this way &#x2013; that our existing diabetes sales force would be ideal for the launch of Victoza. So the issue we have is not so much the sales push you need to launch Victoza, the issue is how much sales force do you need after the launch of Victoza to keep pushing all the modern insulins and keeping Victoza on the launch plan or the launch trajectory that you see in the beginning.</p>
          <p>And we all know that you set, sort of the basic penetration, you set that the first six months, and that means that once you go for it, you've got to go full blast. And the flexibility you're then going to end up having on the cost and the sales side in 2010 is actually that you will then be able to see market-by-market, so to speak, how well you do on trading with Victoza. And based on that, you can then make an analysis. What sales and promotion push do you want on Victoza? What do you want in modern insulin? Then make a sales and marketing plan that matches on a cost basis, the future sales outlook.</p>
          <p>So therefore from a profitability management point of view, it looks pretty solid. How, then, the end result will be of course remains to be seen. That will, of course, depend on the penetration speed of Victoza.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then probably the final comment on Victoza is that the numbers you're going to see next year is going to be somewhat limited and significantly related to the initial pipeline build that you have in connection with the launch and it will probably be slightly bigger than what you've seen in connection with the launch of Levemir, where there was a pipeline built just around 100 million Danish kroner in connection with US launch. Okay? Next question.</p>

          <p>John Murphy at Goldman. Mads, to come back to you on the two insulin analogues. 1250 &#x2013; is there any other obvious advantage apart from three times a week? The 5401, what are the key advantages you see potentially for that and what you mean by dual-acting? And finally, in an ideal world, how would you think about constructing the phase III studies? You've clearly thought them through. What can you share with us with regard to their trial design?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I will try to remember all the questions. Regarding benefits of having a very flat and very extended profile, that as I mentioned about the peak and valley fluctuation, means that you have less variability within the patient from day-to-day and from hour-to-hour. And that is perceived to be beneficial, in particular so as you drive the patients towards the ADA target of getting below 7% HbA1c, because this is where you really start seeing an almost exponential relationship between further A1c lowering and recurrence of hypoglycemic episodes.</p>
          <p>So what we are striving for in Phase III, apart from this more convenience driven thing about the three times a week concept, is really showing, demonstrating hypoglycemia benefits, which is fully aligned with what the FDA is guiding us to do. Because the FDA wrote in their guidance document, which is really the new cookbook for how to make drugs in diabetes, that came out in February. They're specifically stating, go for achieving the same degree of glycemic control between your insulin compound vis-a-insulins. Between your insulin and your insulin comparator and prove other benefits, and then they mention hypoglycemia.</p>
          <p>In terms of the other one, the dual-acting, that is because it is essentially two analogues, okay? So this is not a premix of the same one. So when you do NovoMix 30 administration of 50 or 70, you first have to rock and roll the pen in order to re-suspend the crystals that are in there, so that you don't have huge day-to-day variability in the dose you're administering. This is not needed yet because here we have two soluble, neutral and stable analogues brought together in a way that doesn't interfere significantly with their individual drug profile, i.e. very fast and very slow or very long. So that's the notion behind that one. And the kind of data that we saw, I think, were intriguing because if you look into the literature, you will not find many interim studies, if any at all, where two thirds of the patients were actually able to drive down to the ADA target in the absence of hypoglycemia. So we are intrigued by that.</p>
          <p>I think it's also at this point, for competitive and other reasons, not upon me to give details of the Phase III program other than say that here we have the situation where we have many strong and good opportunities, both within well-known paradigms and within new paradigms. And that we will seek to maximize these by statistically powering the study so that the groups that are needed to prove some of the benefits I just mentioned will be adequate in size. And also such that the comparison drugs are the obvious ones that we need to be able to go out and make the health economic claims that are upon us to prove to society and health technology assessors as we launch the products. And also this will mean that we have to take into account the new ADA guidelines vis-&#xE0;-vis how many patients are to be treated for how long. So expect trials of up to 18 months duration and expect very large numbers.</p>
          <p>And then the final one &#x2013; nope, that was the final one.</p>

          <p>Another question here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Just staying with the new &#x2013; it's Ben Yeoh at Dresdner Kleinwort, sorry &#x2013; just staying with those modern insulins, Sanofi actually dropped its SGL T2 today and one of the reasons it gave was a sort of concern on the regulatory environment and the FDA. I was just wondering for these types of drugs do you think there's going to be a higher regulatory hurdle? And what are you expecting for this? I know you're sort of planning the safe sea, but it's just in terms of the regulatory &#x2013; or do you think this is really only applying to the oral anti-diabetic and there's going to be a less of a concern for the insulin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I have one generic comment before I go into the details. A company that has a promising product within diabetes care will never drop it only because the FDA is getting tougher. Okay, but that was a little bit generic.</p>
          <p>Vis-&#xE0;-vis the distinction between how the FDA treats insulins versus non-insulins &#x2013; I could give you my perspective, but we haven't had the end of Phase II meeting yet. The end of Phase II meeting, which we are calling for right now, is obviously our opportunity to liaise with the agency and we are knowing each other pretty well because we've had many insulins before these ones. So we know who to talk to and have a very good atmosphere in that regard. But it is them telling us whether for instance the cardiovascular discussions that were on July 1 and 2 in the US of this committee meeting, whether they have any relationship to insulin, because our argument is that what was being discussed there was diabetes drugs as such and not insulins. Because insulin is known to be good for the heart; we have just seen that with the 15% reduction in myocardial infarctions in the UKPDS. So essentially, my take of the cardiovascular discussion is that this is not an insulin applicable phenomenon, but it is for all non-insulins, including those that have just entered the market.</p>
          <p>However, when I look at other things, we will need &#x2013; this is a new molecule, we will need exactly the same safety database and showing that we don't have antibody formation problems that we don't have this, that and the other. Just like we have done historically, but even more so because they are getting tougher and tougher. But believe me, it is easier to develop in insulin. Because insulin is insulin, it hits only on one receptor and does only one thing, namely lower blood glucose. So it is a slightly different story in our favor, I would argue.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to confirm, FDA haven't yet come back and had that discussion on the sort of CV in insulins yet but that's just your view of what -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was my personal, subjective view, so that's all you could use it for, but we will get back to you with the Phase III design and with an update on how does the FDA see this because it's important to us and to our investors as soon as we are in a position to do so.</p>

      <speaker id="12">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Maril. And just to kick off with some more questions on insulin analogues, perhaps. And the first one, I think you had comparator arms in the phase II study. Can you just comment on what the efficacy &#x2013; hypoglycemia wasn't as comparator and you haven't disclosed that. And whether you had any statistical differences, I appreciate it was a small Phase II.</p>
          <p>And then just &#x2013; you're obviously focusing on efficacy, hypoglycemia. Just give us some color on what physician feedback you get to how much of a problem they view hypoglycemia with insulins. And I guess also the payer environment you'll be entering in three or four year's time. Is that enough of an advance to meet that hurdle?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is for Jesper. The last time we met here, Lars Rebien kind of talked about &#x2013; very briefly about a 10-year plan and gave us a couple of stats. Is there any chance of you showing us more thoughts on that at some point in the near future? Any company I think that gives details beyond about three weeks at the moment has a real premium. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sachin, the Phase II was designed in such a way that you're absolutely correct. The groups were small, we're talking around 50, 60 patients per group. In total 700 patients with among four different Q3 files or studies and with several arms in some of them. Now the comparator &#x2013; and that means that there is a limit to how many times you see the statistical significant differences, which you will see pan out in Phase III. But you want to see the right trends and occasionally you would also definitely like to see statistical small stars or asterisks on top denoting key values of below 0.05 and they are, indeed there, on several occasions.</p>
          <p>What you really looked at was using insulin glargine as the base insulin comparator in studies where such was relevant and biphasic insulin asparg or better known as NovoMix 30, as the premix insulin in those studies with the NN5401 where that was relevant. And yes, we have seen without going in details for competitive reasons, we have seen in the total program benefits in significant terms, on hypoglycemia, on fasting glucose. Whereas the HbA1c decrements, there you are striving towards having the same HbA1c difference as also guided by the FDA guideline.</p>
          <p>But to tease out the real benefits for instance on hypoglycemia up against a basal insulin, that is something that you really power for and design in the optimal way so that you get the full efficacy and safety of the molecule enlightened in a Phase III program. Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that on the pharmacoeconomic -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pharmacoeconomically, first of all, we are operating much with the so called "more" model, where hypoglycemia and a number of other things, hospitalization, what not, are in the equation. That is, we hope, being updated now with the latest UKPDS data because that will be helpful to us developing these products. But we have a global health economic outcome plan for the study that was designed already pre-Phase II, so that we knew which measurements to make in Phase II in order to be more prepared when we start designing Phase III, for how to get them in there.</p>
          <p>Obviously, I think it's maybe more for K&#xE5;re to comment on, but health technology assessors, they for instance go in and look at what is the price of the quality adjusted life here, so called Quali and so on. I would still bring the arguments to the table that since the big problem with diabetes is that people get HbA1c not low enough, and they get too much hypoglycemia, then if we can show these are highly efficacious and also safe insulins, we will be out there with some good arguments. But I don't, K&#xE5;re, if you have anything further to add.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just very briefly, that convenience equals compliance and compliance equals good outcomes. And therefore, three times a week, or the weekend three, that's not just sort of the nice to have concept. That means you can get people on insulin, let's say, six months earlier, 12 months earlier in the progression of type 2 diabetes, then you will significantly lower the risk of long-term complications, and also of cardiovascular death and so on, at least if you look at the UKPDS and extrapolate from that. So therefore you can actually say that a very convenient way of starting would then return into benefits for the very early stage patient. And then with the other product, you will see a significant beta control if Phase III works out, and that means once-daily insulin, giving significant beta control, again, pushing the control up to a higher level earlier in the treatment cascade. So I think we can &#x2013; if everything works out well make some very strong health economic arguments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then moving to guidance over and beyond 2009, I thought we were pretty courageous in actually giving guidance for 2009. We have &#x2013; it also looks with the guidance that we have given that we will actually exceed the long-term financial targets that we've set for the company with the results for 2008. And hence you should anticipate that we in our annual report for 2008, which is to be released end of January, we will come with an update on what are the long-term &#x2013; new long-terms targets for Novo Nordisk, which typically would be given in a five-year horizon or so. And there you will get some insight into what development you'd see for Novo Nordisk and you should probably anticipate that we would work with similar ratios as what we've been working with. So far they seem to guide the financial performance of the company pretty well, in terms of actually having focus on the right items.</p>
          <p>In terms of the longer term outlook, I recall that the reason why Lars Rebien made comments on a ten year outlook was just to make sure that our investors understood the significance of our insulin franchise, even on a 10-year horizon, and noting that it would still remain a very, very substantial part of our franchise. And he was probably there forecasting that Mads would deliver or the R&amp;D organization would deliver the anticipated results on the next generation insulin. So it will remain a very, very significant part.</p>
          <p>Of course it's going to be exciting to see also short-term by an emerging GLP-1 franchise, enabling us to go earlier into type two treatment, but of course still insulin will remain a very, very significant part of our franchise. Apart from that we don't have any plans of actually disclosing outlook over and beyond five year and I think that's rather enough in the current circumstances.</p>
          <p>So with those comments, I thank you all for your interest in Nordisk and I wish you a good weekend. Thank you.</p>
