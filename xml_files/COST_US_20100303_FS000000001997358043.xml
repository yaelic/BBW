        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My name is Tina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the second quarter and year-to-date results and February sales release conference call. <mark type="Operator instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO. Mr. Galanti, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tina, good morning to everyone. This morning's press release reviews both our second quarter fiscal year 2010 operating results for 12 weeks ended February 14 and our four-week sales results for the month of February which ended this past Sunday, February 28.</p>
          <p>As with every call, let me start by stating that the discussions we are having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC.</p>
          <p>To begin with, our 12-week second quarter operating results. For the quarter, reported EPS came in at $0.67, up 22% from last year's second quarter of 55. As noted in this morning's release, a $22 million pre-tax charge or $0.03 a share was recorded in the quarter related to a change in the company's employee benefits whereby certain unused time off will now be paid annually to the employee. Excluding this non-recurring charge, second quarter EPS would have been $0.70 or a 27% increase over last year's results.</p>
          <p>As we will discuss in more detail in a moment, our second quarter results and the comparison of these results with last year's second quarter include several other items of note. They include the following. First, you recall that last year in Q2, we took some very aggressive pricing markdowns on a variety of commodity items estimated around $0.04 a share, items like milk, cheese, butter, rotisserie chickens, in order to drive sales. No similar events occurred this year in Q2; so that helped the comparison year over year.</p>
          <p>Second, we had a positive year-over-year swing in our gasoline profits. Last year in the second quarter we lost a little money. This year we made some money.</p>
          <p>Third, LIFO; LIFO is one that actually went the other way. Last year in Q2, we had a $7 million LIFO credit or about a $0.01 a share pickup. And despite recent levels of deflation, there is no corresponding pickup this year in the second quarter as our cumulative LIFO balance is in a net credit position, and you can't go below zero.</p>
          <p>Fourth, in the last couple years we talked about FX headwinds. We're now talking about FX tailwinds. Our foreign earnings results when converted or recorded in US dollars helped us this year in the second quarter by a little over 20 million pre-tax or $0.03 a share. That is assuming FX exchange rates were flat year over year, this year's foreign operating results in Q2 would have been lower by that amount.</p>
          <p>Lastly, on the expense side, while we have made improvement from Q1, a variety of our employee related benefits costs, notably healthcare costs and accruals for both workers' compensation expense and bonuses were higher year over year in Q2.</p>
          <p>Healthcare costs continue to be a challenge, but we are currently anniversarying when they began increasing in a big way last year in Q3. If you recall, last year there were two issues. One is that there is ongoing healthcare cost inflation. A double whammy for us over the last 12 to 15 months had been that as we have lowered the number of openings and existing employees weren't &#x2013; while the turnover has always been low, it got even lower over the past year in the quarter with the economy as it is; that we saw the number of covered employees jump from the low 80s as a percent of our total workforce in America to the low 90s. That certainly has anniversaried now as well.</p>
          <p>In terms of sales for the 12-week quarter, reported total sales were up 11.3%, and our 12 weeks reported comp sales figure was up 9%. For the quarter, both total sales and comp sales were impacted by both gasoline price inflation and by the strengthening foreign currencies relative to the US dollar year over year.</p>
          <p>On a comp basis, this is for the quarter, the 5% US sales increase in Q2 excluding gas inflation would have been plus 2%. And the reported 26% international comp sales increase figure assuming flat year-over-year FX rates would have been plus 10%, still a very good number but not the 26. Total company comps, as you saw, for the quarter we reported a plus 9% comp. Excluding both gas inflation and FX changes, that would have been plus 3% for the company.</p>
          <p>In terms of sales for the four-week month just ended, it's similar to the quarter. Excluding gas inflation, the 5% reported US comp would be plus 2%. Excluding FX, the 26% international figure would have been 10%. And excluding both gas and FX, February's total company reported comp of plus nine would have been a plus four.</p>
          <p>Other topics of interest I'll review this morning, our opening activities; after opening six new locations in Q1, we opened two new locations this year in Q2, one in Hayward, California and a relocation of our Warrenton, Oregon facility. Since second end two weeks ago, we did not open any new locations, but tomorrow morning we will open a new Costco in Los Angeles in Pacoima. It will be our 117th California location, and our plans for the remainder of the fiscal year are to open up to eight more locations, probably seven or eight.</p>
          <p>Also this morning, I'll review with you our online results, our membership trends, a little bit more discussion about margins and SG&amp;A in the quarter. I won't go through the balance sheet because as you'll notice, that was attached to the press release I'm happy to report. And I'll give you a couple of other quick comments including the recent appointment of Craig Jelinek to the title of</p>
          <p>President.</p>
          <p>So I'll start with the income statement here. Again, on our quarterly results, sales for this year's second quarter were up 11% from 16.5 billion last year up to 18.4 billion this fiscal quarter. On a reported comp basis, second quarter comps were up 9%. Now the 9% second quarter comp figure was essentially comprised of a nine in December, an eight in January, and a nine in February. Recognize that our quarter started the last week in November and ended in mid-February. This nine, eight, nine, if you will for December, January, February excluding the gas and FX would have been a four, two, and four, so a pretty good showing, particularly in the most recent month of February.</p>
          <p>The 9% reported comp figure was positively impacted by a little more than 3% due to the strengthening of foreign currencies. As I mentioned earlier, our international comp which was reported at 26% was actually plus 10. The same thing with gas; the 5% reported in the US would have been a plus two without gas inflation.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, our 9% reported comp figure is comprised of an average transaction increase of a little over 4% and an average frequency increase of a little over 4%. I might add that the frequency trends during the past three months of December, January, and February were a plus five, a plus 3.5, and about four. This is now going over a year of seeing pretty good frequency numbers on top of pretty good frequency numbers a year ago.</p>
          <p>January &#x2013; February of course was a little negatively impacted as a result of both the heavy rains in California and the unusual amounts of snow in the Northeast, Midwest, and Southeast. And for February of course, there was also the impact of the snows in the Northeast.</p>
          <p>For the February reporting month, much like the quarterly comps, again our 9% reported number, taking the gas and FX, that was a plus four. Within the nine for the month of February, that is comprised of an average transaction increase of about 5%, and again an average frequency increase of around four. Again, that transaction increase of five is pretty much FX of three and gas benefit of two, a little over two. So net of those two, the average transactions increase was about flat.</p>
          <p>Cannibalization pretty much consistent with what it has been of late, a little bit over 0.5%.</p>
          <p>In terms of sales comparisons by geographic region, for the quarter, the Midwest and the Southeast were the strongest, followed by a pretty good showing in the Northwest. California was actually a bit improved also. And the weakest US region was the Northeast. Of course they are impacted by the record setting snow season.</p>
          <p>Internationally in local currencies, doing quite well; as you saw from that plus ten despite economic turmoil everywhere; Canada is up in the mid-teens in local currency in the quarter. And the rest of the country is averaging up in the high single digit comps.</p>
          <p>A little more color on February sales as we are reporting these figures today as well instead of tomorrow; in addition to the benefit from gas inflation and FX, we also benefited a little bit from the calendar shift of the Super Bowl. As you recall from Bob Nelson's call in January, we estimated that the way the Super Bowl hit the calendar this year, we estimated that January had been negatively impacted by 50 to 100 basis points. Correspondingly, February would have benefited from that. We also went through and talked to our operators and looked at how the weather, both in California as well as the significant snows throughout parts of the country, particularly in the Northeast. And the estimate there is that was about 1 to 1.5%. Probably the net of those two is a slight detriment to February, but it's a guess at that.</p>
          <p>On a regional and country basis, the U.S. regions with the strongest. February results were the Midwest and Southeast, again followed by a good showing in the Northwest. Again, California continued to improve a little bit relatively speaking. The weakest U.S. region was the Northeast, again greatly impacted by the record setting snow season. Internationally, Canada for the month was up in the high single digits in local currency, and the rest of the country is averaging in the mid-teen comp figures in February.</p>
          <p>As reported in January overall, deflation in the food and sundries category appears to finally be abating such that year-over-year unit pricing decreases that had been running down 1 to 3% &#x2013; down minus one to minus 3% during recent months were essentially flat year over year in February.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, March sales, which is a five-week reporting month, will have 34 days, selling days this year compared to 35 last year. This has to do with the timing of the Easter holiday, which is one week earlier on the calendar, relative to last year. The March reporting period will end Sunday, April 4, which is Easter, and will be reporting that Thursday, April 8.</p>
          <p>In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, within food and sundries, the average sale per category was positive in Q2, ranging from a plus three to a plus 10. Within the hardlines comp, the strongest subcategories were sporting goods, hardware, health and beauty aids, and lawn and garden, and both office and majors being small positives.</p>
          <p>Within the mid-teen softlines comp, most every category was strong, ranging from a five to a 25. Some of what I'll call house related smaller ticket items like housewares, domestics, and things like that, or small electrics, domestics, home furnishings, were standouts within the softlines category.</p>
          <p>And fresh foods, much like food and sundries, was positive with all sub-fresh food categories positive as well, in the mid-low single to mid-high single-digit range.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the line items on the income statement, I'll start with membership fees. Reported membership fees were up 8.5% or $30 million to $385.8 million, which was 2.10%. That's down six basis points. Excluding FX, since this includes the benefit of the strengthening foreign currencies when we convert it into US dollars that 8.5% dollar increase would have been 5% or a $19 million increase on a flat FX.</p>
          <p>I'll also mention that when we talk about both membership margin and SG&amp;A, the gasoline inflation, if you assume again flat gas prices, that minus six basis point number, needless to say the higher gas inflation makes the sales denominator and all these calculations higher, making the actual numbers lower. And that six basis point negative would have been flat year over year, excluding gas inflation. So we think a pretty good showing overall.</p>
          <p>In terms of membership, continued strong renewal rates, continued good penetration of the Executive Membership; and despite only one net new opening this year in the quarter, our new membership signups in Q2 were actually the best they have been in a while, up 5% year over year in the fiscal quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of the number of members at Q2 end, we had a little over 22 million Gold Star, about 5.8 million &#x2013; 5.7 to 5.8 million Primary Business, a little over 3.4 million add-ons; a little over 31.1 million total primary, and just under 57 million including spouse cards. That by the way number is just under 60 million if you include Mexico, which of course we don't realize those numbers on our income statement.</p>
          <p>At quarter end, February 14, our paid Executive Member base was 9.6 million, an increase of 340,000 or 4% in just the 12 weeks since Q1 end. So between new signups, signing up as an Executive Member as well as some pretty successful conversion programs out there, averaging 28,000 a week increase in the quarter, one of our higher results in the last few quarters.</p>
          <p>In terms of membership renewal rates, again continuing strong at Q1 end; and at Q2 end, business renewals were at 92%, 92.0%. Gold Star at Q1 end was 86.0. It was actually 86.1 at Q2 end, and all told 87.3 for the company at Q1 end, and it tweaked up to 87.4. It has been generally running in the 87.2 to 87.5 range quarter in quarter out for the last couple of years on a quarterly basis.</p>
          <p>Going down to the gross margin, gross margin in the second quarter was higher year over year by 26 basis points. It came in from a 10.42 last year to a 10.68. Jot down the following numbers and we can go through it. We'll have three columns: Q4 '09, Q1 '10, and Q2 '10. And the line items would be core merchandising. The second line would be ancillary businesses. The third line item would be 2% Reward. The fourth line item would be LIFO, and last item would be total.</p>
          <p>Going across, core merchandising, up 48 basis points in Q4 of '09 on a year-over-year basis, up 15 in Q1 '10, and up 15 in Q2 '10. Ancillary, minus three in Q4 '09, minus 20 in Q1 '10; you'll recall the minus 20 it was a year ago Q1 '09 when we had outsized gasoline profits; and then in Q2 '10, a plus 16. 2% Reward, a minus nine, minus three, and minus one; again a minus here indicating that increased sales penetration to those Executive Members. LIFO, plus 22 in Q4, minus one in Q1, and minus four in Q2; and total was a plus 56 in Q4 '09, a minus nine in Q1 2010, and a plus 26 in Q2 2010.</p>
          <p>With these numbers in front of us, as you can see our overall reported gross margin was higher year over year by the 26. Now within this 26 basis point figure, our core merchandising gross margin contributed 15 basis points of the total, and ancillary gross business gross margins, principally gas, contributed 16 basis points. These plus 15 and plus 16 basis point figures are actually a little more impressive when you consider that the sales penetration of our higher margin core business was down 2% in Q2 year over year, again related to the fact that gasoline inflation caused the gas sales to be a lot higher whereas the sales penetration of our ancillary businesses, again mostly gas sales which is a lower margin business, was up 2%.</p>
          <p>The sales penetration of our core merchandising business being down so while gross margins of our core merchandising business, and recall core merchandising business is in the high 80s as a percent of total sales, is comprised of food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods. They were higher year over year in the quarter. Those departmental sales &#x2013; margins on those departmental sales year over year in Q2, the margins were higher by 54 basis points. But that translates into plus 15 when you account principally for the gasoline inflation.</p>
          <p>The respective merchandise category gross margins, again that 54 represented ranges from 26 to 75 basis points, with the low end being I believe food and sundries. But you'll recall &#x2013; I'm sorry, the high end being food and sundries, but you recall that's because we had those aggressive pricing last year on a lot of commodity items. Lastly, keep in mind as we've discussed that in terms of this aggressive pricing on some commodity items, if you exclude the aggressive pricing markdowns, food and sundries gross margins were still up 13 basis points year over year on &#x2013; food and sundry margins divided by food and sundry sales.</p>
          <p>The impact from increasing penetration of the Executive Membership was one basis point. And LIFO, as I mentioned, we had a $7 million LIFO credit last year versus zero this year. That would be a detriment to this year's margin on a year-over-year comparison of four basis points.</p>
          <p>Before I go on to SG&amp;A, again looking at these numbers, the way I looked at it was we start with that core of 15. The sales mix of gas was 24. That would bring the 15 up to 39. Then taking out the aggressive pricing was 17 because that's an unfair comparison since we did that last year and not this year. So you get something in the low 20s. This is not an exact science, but I think the merchandising core up plus 15 is representative of what really happened in the quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of moving on to SG&amp;A, SG&amp;A percentage in Q2 over Q2 was higher or worse by nine basis points, coming in at a 10.20 compared to a 10.11 last year. The $22.5 million non-recurring charge related to the change in employee benefits represented an attachment of 12 basis points, so really that minus nine you might look at as a plus three excluding that charge. As a result, an improved result from Q1 nonetheless, and again there's a little bit of further elaboration in SG&amp;A given the fact that SG&amp;A benefited by 24 basis points because of the gas sales inflation.</p>
          <p>So again, we'll write down some numbers and I'll try to give you an explanation here. Again, three columns, Q4 '09 and then Q1 fiscal '10 and Q2 fiscal '10; the line items are operations, central, stock compensation, quarterly adjustments, total. And going across, operations, minus 61 in Q4 '09, now minus being higher or worse; Q1 '10 minus 16; and Q2 '10 zero. Central, minus eight, minus three, and plus two; so again as a percent of sales central was a little better year over year. Stock compensation, minus one, minus three, and plus one; quarterly adjustments, plus seven, plus 18, and minus 12; and again the minus 12 is the item we mentioned in the quarterly earnings release; for a total of minus 63, minus four, and minus nine.</p>
          <p>Now again, a little editorial here; operations again, the core operations was flat year over year in Q2. But again it's mostly about sales mix change just like with gross margin percentages where increased gasoline sales penetration hurt us and correspondingly helped us in SG&amp;A by a little more than 20 basis points. However, the combined negative impact of benefits costs, including healthcare, workers comp, and bonuses was a negative 24, and I'll go through that in a second. So excluding those higher costs, those are real costs but excluding those, the rest of the operations actually improved a little bit, payroll and various other direct controllable expenses. Our central expense again was lower or better year over year by two basis points, and I mentioned the stock compensation better by one basis point.</p>
          <p>Overall not a bad performance, but again the way I look at it we start with a minus nine for SG&amp;A. We add back the 12 for the non-recurring quarterly charge to get to plus three. The gas mix although helped that by a little over 20 &#x2013; 21 to 24; so you get something about a minus 20 in terms of what it looks like. Now that roughly 20 basis point detriment is more than that in health, workers comp, and bonus. Health we've talked about, and as I mentioned we're anniversarying some of the big increases from a year ago. We are hopeful that that number on its own is going to come down because we've now transitioned to the higher percentage piece under the plan, and I don't think that's going to go a lot higher now.</p>
          <p>On workers comp, that has as much to do with actuarial adjustments to the number each quarter. Last year, I think it's just a little bit more of how the moons lined up this quarter versus a year ago. A year ago &#x2013; the underlying workers comp expense for the quarter in terms of incidence is not a big change year over year, a couple million dollars difference. The bigger difference is last year in Q2 we had a benefit, a reduction in our accrual.</p>
          <p>If you recall for workers comp it's not just your incidence this year. It's the balance you have for previously accrued expenses for any expenses that might have a two to six-year tail on it. And again the actuaries come in and look at that. We had a pickup last year in that number and a detriment this year or an increase in the accrual. My guess, and this is just a guess, is that some of that relates to the fact the same reason that healthcare costs are up over the last year with everything that's going on in the economy and what have you.</p>
          <p>The last piece of that, bonus accrual; in the last couple years we haven't &#x2013; we start with a bonus accrual. And by midyear, we set our standards so they're achievable but not easy. And in the last couple years we haven't hit it and have taken back a little in Q2. In this case we're not because we are still hitting the numbers, and that's good. But we typically haven't talked about it for a couple years because we haven't hit it. Again, that was about six or seven basis points to the detriment.</p>
          <p>So all told looking at it all, SG&amp;A was higher year over year on a real basis given all these expenses. I think some of them are going to start becoming &#x2013; not being as big of a negative to us. Hopefully we'll see some positive sales as well.</p>
          <p>Next on the income statement is pre-opening expense. Pre-opening last year in the quarter was a little over $7 million, this year 3.2 million, so a pickup of 4 million year over year, two basis points better, no real surprises here. Last year's number even though we didn't have any openings in Q2 there was quite a bit of pre-opening related to several post-Q2 openings notably as well as some of the ones internationally which are a little higher openings and the pre-opening starts a little sooner in the life of some of those.</p>
          <p>In terms of provision for impaired assets and closing costs, not a big deal either way. Last year we had a charge of 1.2 million in the quarter, this year under $200,000.</p>
          <p>All told, operating income in Q2 was up 18% year over year from 399 million to 470 million, or an increase of 71 million. Excluding the $22 million charge, the 71 million would have been up 93 million.</p>
          <p>Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was slightly higher year over year, with Q2 '10 coming in at 26 million, up about 800,000 from the 25.2 million in last year's Q2, small change. That small change really relates more to the change in capitalized interest year over year which the higher capitalized interest lowers the interest expense number.</p>
          <p>The interest income year over year was up by 18 million, and it's really the other, as I'll explain in a minute. Last year in the quarter, interest income and other was up 11.6 million. This year in the quarter it was 29.8 million. Interest income was actually lower by 3 million, a reflection of lower short-term interest rates. While other income which was up dramatically, that's both principally a combination of earnings from Mexico as well as profits from FX contracts used in our business. A portion of that profit in FX contracts historically had been up in operations in the margin, and is now down below, so actually we hurt our reported margin this quarter. It's not enough to talk about but that's where it will appear in the future.</p>
          <p>So overall, pre-tax income was up 23% versus last year's Q2 and up 29%, excluding the $22 million charge in the press release.</p>
          <p>Tax rate, we benefited a little bit, coming in at 35.6% versus 36.9% last year in Q2. I believe it's a combination of a couple of discrete items that went our way as well as increasing profitability of some of the foreign operations, which have a lower tax rate.</p>
          <p>Now for a quick rundown of other topics; one I won't go over is the detail of the balance sheet. You have that in the press release. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was 185 million and 369 year to date. The balance sheet, as you'll see in the press release, continues to be strong. One of the ratios we always look at is what we call our AP ratio, which is simply accounts payable divided by inventory. On a reported balance sheet basis, it's up four percentage points, from 100 a year ago to 104%, meaning that more than all of the inventories are being funded with receivables.</p>
          <p>If you take out &#x2013; some of those receivables are construction receivables. So in fairness, it's still up 4% from 83% a year ago to 87%. I'm sorry, I said receivables, payables I mean; 87% of our inventories were funded with trade payables as of Q2 and up from 83% a year ago. And again I think that's simply a reflection of slightly higher sales and therefore slightly higher turns.</p>
          <p>Average inventory per warehouse was at Q2 end was 10.046 million or up 421,000 or 4% from a year ago. If you take out FX that up 421,000 is up only 128,000 per location, no inventory concerns. We came out of Christmas clean and felt pretty good about getting through that with getting rid of seasonal items in a good fashion.</p>
          <p>In terms of CapEx Q2 '09, it was a shade under 300 million. And then Q2 '10, it was a shade under 200 million. Year to date, it's a little under 500 million. I'd estimate that our fiscal year 2010 CapEx will be slightly lower than last year's figure, probably in the 1.0 to $1.2 billion range but probably closer to 1.0 given fact that a couple things have been delayed.</p>
          <p>The next topic, Costco online; both Costco.com and Costco.ca in Canada continue to be profitable and growing. For Q2 and Q2 year to date, sales and profit of these operations were up over last year. And while our average ticket had still come down a little bit, recall our average ticket is in the mid to high 300s. It had been in the low 400s before the economy got hammered. And in Q2 year over year, our traffic was up 8%.</p>
          <p>In terms of expansion, as I mentioned, as we mentioned previously in Q1, we opened six new locations with no relos, so a net of six. In Q2 we opened two including a relocation, so a net of one. We'll open tomorrow in Pacoima, California, and that will be it for Q3, and in Q4 up to 8. With bad luck it could be five. With likely possibilities it's probably six or seven and we're pushing for eight. They all will be under construction. It's a matter of did something fall from August into September. So our best guess at this point is 17 new. Less the relo it would be 16 net, maybe 15 or 14, but we'll see.</p>
          <p>In fiscal '10 assuming the 16, that would be 3% unit growth and about 3.5% square footage growth. And numbers that some of you like to know, at Q2 end, total square footage stood at 76.032 million square feet.</p>
          <p>Lastly just making a brief comment about stock repurchases, as you know we began buying back in June of '05 and pretty much ceased in September of '08 as the economy and ultimately the market was getting hammered. We bought &#x2013; we spent a total of about $4.8 billion during that time. We bought a little bit in the middle of calendar '09, and I mean a little bit, I think one or two days worth of purchases. We did during the week of February 8 got back into the market, purchasing an aggregate over the five business days of 250,000 shares that week. Since that week, we have not bought leading up to the earnings release and we'll look to see what we want to do after that. But we did buy a little in that week of February 8.</p>
          <p>The last comment I'll make before I turn it back over to Tina is, as you know, a few weeks ago we made an announcement that Craig Jelinek was named President and Chief Operating Officer effective at the time of the press release in early February. Craig has been around Costco and frankly around many of the people that started Costco since the very late '60s, as he told me. Craig is 57. He started at FedMart in '69. He spent 12 years at FedMart and then three years in the late '70s through the early '80s &#x2013; in late 1981 to '84 at Lucky Stores, and joined Costco shortly thereafter in 1984, originally I believe as a warehouse manager, and has been at Costco for the past 26 years.</p>
          <p>He has been for most of that time through 2004, he was in operations, most recently at that time in 2004 as one of the EVPs and COOs of &#x2013; Executive VPs of Operations, and basically in charge of about a third of North America operations. At that time in 2004, he and Doug Schutt &#x2013; Doug at the time had been in charge of non-food merchandising, basically switched jobs. And for the last six years, Craig has been in charge of merchandising until this recent announcement in early February.</p>
          <p>Doug, who is in his early 50s, I think 51, started his career pre-Price Club on the sales side with Wilson's Sporting Goods selling to Price Club, and joined them before the merger in 1993 with Costco. At the time of the merger, Doug became head of non-foods merchandising for the combined company, and so most of his career had been spent in merchandising up until 2004 at which time Jim had asked Doug and Craig to basically switch jobs a week from that Monday, which they have done, so Doug will take over head of all merchandising. Replacing Doug is John McKay, who was one of the two Senior VPs of Operations reporting up to Doug when he was running the Northern division.</p>
          <p>That's basically it on that. As we said in the press release also that Jim plans to be around for at least a few more years, and so don't get too excited about not seeing him here.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll just mention that the typical supplemental information packet will be posted on the Costco Investor Relations site later this morning.</p>
          <p>And with that I'll turn it over to Tina for any questions. Thank you.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citigroup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Richard, you addressed it briefly, but can you walk us through your share repurchase expectations and how we should think about that going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's like earnings guidance. We're not going to give specific guidance. I think history has shown that for nearly three and a half years on a pretty much regular basis, we bought stock. When we stopped, it was as much the decline in the economy and concerns about what was going to happen. But probably more importantly, the whole issue of liquidity when various types of money market funds including a little over $1 billion of the ones we were invested in were locked up for three to six months, and that was a little scary.</p>
          <p>I think certainly we feel comfortable long term about our business. I don't see us trying to pick a price or pick an event in time where we're going to &#x2013; I wouldn't expect to see us announce that we did some big accelerated repurchase. Historically what we did, when we were buying, when the stock was moving up a little, we bought a little less that day. When it was moving down, we bought a little more, but generally feeling that the underlying value going forward is appropriate.</p>
          <p>Again, I don't want to be cute about it, but I think what we said in the past is that we will probably be a buyer of our stock over the long term. You probably won't talk about it again until the next quarterly earnings release. But I think the indication that we've started a process here is viewed that we are buying, not not buying at this point. But again since that week, we haven't bought and again I'm not really poised to say what we're going to do in the future other than historically we've shown that we do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then as you're aware I'm sure, BJ's reported earnings this morning, and they talked about seeing an increasingly competitive environment. Can you maybe just discuss what you're seeing from a competitive standpoint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think when you talk about competition, there are two things that we're always asked about. One is all the supermarket chains over the last many months have talked about a much more promotional and increased competitive market, on top of the fact that there had been deflation in a lot of those categories that supermarkets are selling during those many months.</p>
          <p>Our position hasn't really changed. While certainly the food buyers look at the weekly ads on ground beef and soda pop and the like, but those are items that are probably lower than average margin items to begin with for us. We really don't feel a great impact from that. We don't generally price to that. Within the big box stores, both the direct competitors, Sam's and BJ's, as well as the indirect ones like Target and Walmart and to some extent Home Depot and Lowe's and the even office product superstores, we have not seen any increase in the bar of competition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then can you maybe discuss the initial performance of spring seasonal since holiday was obviously quite strong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I think if you look at components of February's comps on the softline side particularly, we had some numbers that are very strong. Recognize part of that is it was very weak a year ago. But it seemed like starting in September in some of these categories we saw some fives and eights and tens and threes on the positive side. I think this past month is the first time we've seen more than a couple of those sub-departments in high teens to mid-20s. I think apparel was more in the mid-singles, but it's more of those small electric, housewares, domestics, what I'll call mid-priced stuff for the home that is selling pretty darn well.</p>
          <p>Now maybe a little of that has to do if you look at our coupon booklets, we recognize there's a limit of how many big ticket items are going to sell during the tough economy over the last year. And you have seen probably a little bit more marketing effort or merchandising effort towards some of those items. So I think more of it has to do with just what's going on in the industry and a little of it has to do with what we've done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and the last question, we actually had the pleasure of visiting your Danville club out in California, which you shared to me had the highest membership renewal rates in the country. You also mentioned that member signups were strong in the quarter. Can you talk about what you're seeing there specifically, and is there anything you're doing differently to drive that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The renewal rates are pretty constant. Again, they've been in that mid-87.3 &#x2013; 87.4 range for a while now. On the signups, in talking to Paul Latham yesterday, who is VP of Marketing, it's a lot of just blocking and tackling. What I find frankly is what we call our marketing people in the warehouse, which are a combination of that membership renewal desk and the membership desk as well as a refund desk, some months or weeks they're doing &#x2013; they're focusing on Executive Membership. Sometimes they're going out and talking to small businesses and medium-sized businesses about new member initiatives. So my guess is a little bit has to do with the fact that where did we place our bets this quarter. But overall, I've got to believe a little of it is just the press that clubs are getting in general and that we get as it relates to this is a good place to save. There's nothing magic that we're doing other than blocking and tackling.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you find that as a follow-up to that, do you find that the new member signups have been disproportionally Executive Members, or is it pretty representative of what the base already looks like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's disproportionate but not majority. If you go back a couple of years ago, for every new member that signed up whether it was in a new warehouse in the US or an existing warehouse, our success rate of getting them to initially sign up as an Executive Member was something in the low tens, 10 to 12, I believe. In the last year I believe it has gone up to the low 20s. And if you again talk to Paul and his people, a lot of it has to do with what I'll call 'duh'. They're doing more stuff in the warehouse at the desk and getting our message down a little bit better, recognizing that we have just regular hourly employees out there. We don't have trained marketing people. But I think we've done a little better job of communicating to our member why they should.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Richard. I don't ever recall so much concern about earnings guidance for you guys in the past, but I was wondering relative to your initial expectations, how did the quarter wind up coming in? Was it better, in line, or did you miss what you thought you had originally set out to do?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hold on, I'm looking at our in-house counsel. If you look at our original budget for the beginning of the year, keep in mind this is last August, I think we are pretty darned close to where we thought we were going to be. We're satisfied with the number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. And then on the margins, the 54 bps, can you walk through the four key categories just by category for us, how it actually broke out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They were all &#x2013; again, I already mentioned the food and sundries one, which again it is the biggest but then you take out the &#x2013; hold on a second. If you look at &#x2013; food and sundries was above 50. Hardlines was around a quarter. Softlines was around 0.75%, and fresh foods was about 50. You add all those up, prorated weighted average based on sales and you get to that mid-50 number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to follow up to that, the gas mix to get down to the 15 is the plug, so it's 39 basis points. Is that right? You just gave a lot of numbers. I was just trying to make sure I got it right, or was it 24?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 24 is the gas mix. There are other things. There's the ancillary, there are the other ancillary business margins. There's the hit which wasn't a lot of basis points from Executive Membership. There's the hit year-over-year comparison to LIFO which was four. So there are a few other things as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I know you don't want to talk about the next couple of quarters but can you give us a little bit of sense for what you're thinking on gross profit and SG&amp;A given that every basis point tends to move the needle a lot?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd love to but I can't. I'm not trying to be coy. Again, I think that the trend at least from the last few months has been promising. The fact that there is less deflation on the food and sundries side, virtually about flat, no inflation no deflation for the first time in a while for February; we still have deflation on the electronics side and the like. The fact that the dollar is weaker helps our &#x2013; I think again, I'm not a predictor of currency rates, but if they stayed where they are now, we're still being helped by that each quarter. We don't have the freebie of the big aggressive pricing we did last year versus now. I think we lost a little in gas last year in the quarter, and then made in Q4 last year. So again, that's going to be a help and then a challenge. Depending on what happens, it's so hard to predict what gas profits are week to week. But I think at the end of the day, I'm cautiously optimistic but we'll have to wait and see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my last question is regards to Sam's closing their 10 stores. Have you guys done an analysis what you think that can do to your profitability as they close those stores?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think those 10 locations, I think seven or eight of them were directly near Costco locations. I believe it's eight. And I believe those eight impacted 12 Costcos. In some cases, in a few cases there's one on both sides of that Sam's.</p>
          <p>The big effect is margin, and that effect is as you might guess with Jim at the helm here is not going to change immediately overnight. But historically when we look at what I'll call competitive locations in the U.S. versus non-competitive, you could see as much as one to two percentage points of gross margin difference, which all falls down to the bottom line, so it could be meaningful in those locations.</p>
          <p>We don't expect a big sales pickup. As you might expect, the ones they're closing aren't their best units. They're the lowest volume we presume. Based on our analysis of them, they're the lowest volume units. We'll get a little pickup in sales, a gradual pickup, and probably not the whole amount in margin because that's not what we do. But as someone said once, it's like chicken soup, it can't hurt, and it probably helps you a little bit over the next 18 months, as did the six closures in Canada that Sam's did helped us for 12 to 18 months. My guess is at the end of that we get 75% of what you and I might get.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with William Blair.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. As the SG&amp;A hits become smaller negatives, and also I know you've done some work on sustainability, which might be helping on the cost side, what do you think that does to the underlying comp sales leverage point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, it's a guess. I remember a few guesses based on some things that everybody is doing, including us, and trying to be a little tougher on ourselves. And excluding healthcare, that may be the breaking point, had gone from a 4.5 guesstimate to a 3.5. Who knows, but we'll have to see. I'll probably stick to that. We haven't done any type of regression analysis on it of late.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you talk about when you started the new employee wage contract and should we think about that being a factor going forward, I guess some thinking with deflation, maybe that's potentially better terms?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's effective March 2010 for the upcoming three years. The big item typically is what happens &#x2013; there are three new columns, if you will, for hourly progression. It really doesn't impact new employees until they hit top of scale. About 55% of our U.S. hourly employees are top of scale. And there's not a big difference between what they're going to get each year going forward for the next three years versus what they had gotten in the past three years. We looked and discussed it around and around at a couple of different offsite meetings. And at the end of the day, there's not a big change. The view is that this is the time, particularly the first year of it, is the time that our employees need it the most. And as you would expect, that's what we did.</p>
          <p>Again, I think that the challenges of some of the comps that we've had over the last year and a half have started to abate, both the economy, not that it's getting better tomorrow, but we've certainly seen some benefit, and the whole issue of deflation and inflation. So the feeling is we'll be able to take care of that; so not a big change in terms of any major savings there other than savings with sales growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My other question is if you can give us your updated thoughts on potential membership fee increase, and I'm sure you're going to be looking at renewals, which look healthy, but if you could maybe talk about the main things we should be watching to see when the fee might be coming up. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are no plans yet. History has shown that about every five or so years we've done it on the base fee, from 25 incrementally $5 each time up to 50 now. One of the issues is over 35% of our U.S. operation is California. In California, the statute says that membership fees are not sales taxable as long as the fee is de minimis. De minimis is currently defined at $50. In their statutes, they calibrate it every fifth year and that calibration calculation, subject to change &#x2013; I mean, the State of California can do anything to change the current law, but the current way it works would be is in January of '11, that number would be reset based on the prior de minimis amount plus the California CPI over that next five-year period ending in January of '11.</p>
          <p>Now in January of '06 when it was calibrated from 45 up to 50, we did not the next day go out and raise it. I believe we didn't raise it until May or June of that year. My guess, we've never shown a shyness to increasing the fee as we feel that we've got more than that $5 increase in value to our members. That's our conviction. And I guess the good news is that the economy went in a tailspin a year and a quarter ago. I'm glad that this calibration didn't occur then because I don't think anybody had an appetite, even if we felt confident we could.</p>
          <p>I can't say when it will be. Will we raise it again? My guess would be yes. Would it assume that there's this calibration change in California? My assumption would be yes. Would it be in January right after that? My assumption would be no. Will it be sometime over the next year? That's a probability. But again, we have not discussed it, nor have we discussed what we would do with the $100 Executive Membership number. In the past two $5 increases from 40 to 45 and 45 to 50, we've chosen to leave the 100 alone. I think that's why you see this &#x2013; that's one of the reasons you see this strong continuing conversion and increased penetration of those members because that breakeven has gotten smaller each time when the delta was $60, then 55 and now 50. But I think again, we would look at that as well. And again, I'm not trying to be coy. History has shown that we do and at some point we probably will.</p>
          <p>We've been asked I know; we've all been asked as often what's the impact of one of our competitors. It would be a bigger difference without them. Not to be arrogant about it but we've never really looked at that difference. In the face of a higher delta between our fee and our competitors, we've done it in the past successfully. I don't see that as a big concern.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Adrianne Shapira with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Richard, maybe just stepping back, you clearly had a lot of headwinds last year that seem to be turning into tailwinds, whether FX, deflation, gas. Maybe just share thoughts in terms of the slope of these lifts, where they were and how steep you thought they were at the start of the year, where you think they are now. Clearly they're all positive, but share in terms of the degrees of positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From eight degrees to 40 degrees &#x2013; just kidding. I would guess an offsetting slope to me clearly is healthcare. Again, I'm hopeful that part of that increase, which had to do with just increased penetration and number of employees covered, has peaked and is not going to impact us additionally.</p>
          <p>I guess so much of it depends on what is going to be the rate of underlying real comp sales growth ex-FX and ex-gasoline inflation and deflation. The trend over the last four or five months has been good. The fact that in February we essentially saw no inflation or deflation compared to some deflation in the prior months on the food and sundries side is a positive. I think if Jim were here, he would say margins aren't the issue. We've shown an ability to improve margins. And I think we'll continue to be able to do that in a controlled way. If Jim were here I would say in a very controlled way.</p>
          <p>On the expense side, frankly I think we've done a decent job on payroll and on central and on everything but the second biggest nut and that's healthcare. The bonus thing, it's really a midyear deal and I'm not concerned about that. Hopefully we'll always accrue that every year and it will be a flat comparison year over year, but this is the quarter that it hit us. And the same thing, I think the workers comp was a little bit of an increase and a bigger piece which was just the luck of the actuarial draw of being a bring-back in Q2 last year and a positive this year. And frankly any bring-backs last year, the quarter was so crappy we didn't talk about a lot of little things.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. Just drilling down then on the deflation, as you said, Jim says margins aren't the issue. It sounds like deflation abating and as you describe it a pretty rational competitive environment. I think we all know philosophically you guys are the first to lower. Is the flip also true that you're the last to raise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. Now last to raise is sometimes three days or a week. If the cost of an item is going up and it's a high volume item, toilet paper, whatever, first of all, it's really the commodities because even on things like paper goods, big volume or water, we run into 6 and 12 and 24-month deals with these vendors. And they've locked in certain pricing too to be able to commit to us, so some of it is going to happen over time. But it really gets down to a lot of commodities and fresh foods of course, which change daily and weekly. We're not going to &#x2013; if the price of something goes up, we reflect it pretty quickly. Quickly might be two weeks instead of one week later.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, just a question on the SG&amp;A again. Not to beat a dead horse, but if we look at first quarter, you really didn't have a big FX hit there. And your SG&amp;A growth was probably just &#x2013; I think it was just under 8%, recognizing that in any given quarter there may be some one-off items as there may have been this quarter. I guess it sounds like you're not expecting much in terms of one-off items in the next couple of quarters. So does that mean the SG&amp;A dollar growth should look more similar to Q1 excluding FX?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, last year wasn't the greatest year. In Q3 last year, we also had a bonus bring-back. I'm hopeful this year we won't, so that will be a slight negative. I don't think it will be as big of a negative as this year. I don't think again if you look at the luck of the actuarial draw, more to the tune of historical prior-year stuff instead of current year, my guess is that's not likely to happen. It could but I'm not guessing that's going to happen. The healthcare, it's not going to be as big of an increase but it's not going to be wonderful either. Every month when we see the statistics in terms of number of incidents or number of high cost incidents, just when you're starting to feel a little better one month, the next month it's a little higher. But again it was last year in the second half of the year when healthcare costs were up in the low to mid-20s versus when it had been up in the 10 to 12 range or whatever before that, or 10 to 15. So I'm thinking &#x2013; and I know we're not seeing the big increase in employees covered. That we've anniversaried now. So yes, the answer is, is it better? Yes. Is it wonderful? No.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then in the electronics business, a separate topic, I think one or two calls ago, you were thinking that deflation in electronics might start to ease. We've heard from Walmart recently that they thought it was easing a bit. I guess just in terms of your outlook at this point, can you update us on what you're thinking for TVs and electronics broadly from a deflation standpoint and how you think that may impact you this year or the remainder of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, yes. I was looking &#x2013; I'll talk while I look. In the month of February, TV sales, TV unit sales were down very slightly and dollar sales were down a little more than that, so still a little deflation but less than 5% deflation. What we're seeing on the TV side, a little of that was shortages. All of a sudden there's a pickup in world demand and I think last month was the first month ever that more TVs were sold in China than in America ever. And between Europe, flat screen demand in Europe, and in China &#x2013; our head merchant in electronics, Tim Farmer, who was at a budget meeting last week, was talking about the fact that &#x2013; I forget what size it was, but the underlying cost of the panel itself in the US gets something like $125 and then Europe and China is getting $200. So there are some big differences, so more stuff is going that way. So we actually had a couple of supplier shortages that I believe are in the process of fixing themselves.</p>
          <p>Last year, the other thing was, and this is to when I talked earlier about the couponing, it was about a year ago that we saw we were very strong in some of the multi-vendor mailers. Over the last year, the success of some of those items have come down as: A), everybody has televisions; and B), the price points have come down. And what has been successful is look at the MVMs; getting people into the door is basic items. So I think in terms of &#x2013; we think that there's still plenty of demand in unit sales. We think that the price points have pretty much flattened out. But we're still comparing against the craziness of near the tail end of that year, year and a half period where we were seeing 30, 40, and 50% unit increases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, got you. On the couponing booklets, as you look out over the next quarter or two, whether it's for TVs or just broadly, the coupon books that you send out, are they from a promotional standpoint or a product discount savings, is it a similar posture as a year ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the posture on our MVMs going forward is similar to a year ago. I think the motivation is to get more non-food and bigger ticket items in there. And bigger ticket means going from medium to a little bit bigger than medium but not all giant like it was during the gravy days.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, Richard. I've got two questions for you. The first one is, can you just give us an update on the private label penetration, and I guess the lateral piece of that is any reads that you feel into the consumer that you guys are seeing? And then the second question I was wondering is if you could give us any early learnings or perspective from the Manhattan store and how that's going?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What was the first question? You said Manhattan. Oh, private label. I think the trends continue. We're approaching 20. I'm not sure if we're at 20 yet. We are at 20 yet now. So it's growing. The big delta year over year in sales penetration that we saw is continuing, not as dramatic as it was six to nine months ago but still increasing penetration. We have several items on the food and sundries side that will be coming out this fall, which I can't talk about yet. Again, nothing earth shattering that's going to take the 20% number to 25, but it's all additive. Basically, there's not a whole lot out there that's sacrosanct; we want to sell both the best brands and the best Kirkland Signature alternatives.</p>
          <p>On Manhattan, at the end of the day we're doing fine. We're probably doing 80 to 90% of what we originally thought sales-wise. What we're finding is that during the week, we get a lot of local neighborhood traffic. What you don't find is people on their way home from work saying let's go drive over to Costco on the way home from work. They don't do that. We see a big Upper East Side and even Upper West Side traffic on weekends. We get a lot of grief for the parking lot because it costs $4. It's not our parking lot, by the way, but it is what it is.</p>
          <p>But overall I think we got a little press locally in Manhattan because of the layoffs that happened after Christmas. And we always have seasonal layoffs afterwards. In addition having opened this on November 11, we probably &#x2013; we over-expected and then came in a little under, and so the layoffs were a little bit bigger than normal, but nothing that was as newsworthy as it appeared in the local papers there. We want to get as many people back to work and as quickly as possible but it's continuing to grow. We're seeing the Bodega, the small business business improve. And again, I think it's going to be a great location. And I think we've got a lot of questions about it because of the local news of 160 layoffs or whatever.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a cumulative charge that will grow as the company grows. This is rough numbers, but if the company was 10% bigger in people, incrementally over that two-year period, there would be another 2 or $3 million charge to it, hit to the P&amp;L but not a $20 million charge.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The timing had more to do with the fact that we already did it this way in certain states based on certain state laws, and we thought it was the right thing to do. And it's tied in to the March 10 New Employee Agreement. We had a lot of questions on it from employees. As we go through really a one-year process leading up to the New Employee Agreement, you get all kinds of requests from open toed shoes and wearing shorts to how different holidays are handled. And we were getting questions on it. And we looked at it and said you know what, what happens is you get employees that have moved and one state they got it and another state they didn't. And it was just the right thing to do.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Come back to gross margin here this may be an odd way of thinking about it, but if the core gross margins are up I think you said 54 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In the prior year, core margins were down 57 basis points because obviously of the markdowns and the sharp pricing. So you didn't quite get back all the margin you lost last year, versus in the first quarter I think the core margins were up 11. The prior year they were down two. So you had a net positive. If I go back a few quarters, you've been seeing that core piece of the merchandise margin growing and up. And adjusting for the easy compare last year maybe it was just down slightly. I would have thought with mix and some of the better softline category numbers, the mix would have been a little bit more positive. Is there anything else going on there that maybe those core merchandise margins weren't up as much as I thought they should have been?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are a couple things. First of all, last year you had &#x2013; whereas this year gas helped &#x2013; helped your margin &#x2013; hurt your margin, last year it helped your margins. Last year is when you had huge deflation in gas.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I got that in. So we have 50 basis points of positive benefit on gas but you still had 57 basis points of core ex-gas, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have to look at that, but I believe that 57 includes the benefit that we actually got last year because of the deflation in gas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll have to look. When we looked at the numbers we felt it was still a positive. But let us look at it and we'll be happy to discuss it. There are no secrets here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The other way you can look at that is obviously the subcategories and you went through it by each of the subcategories. Did you feel that you got back all of the lost markdown pressure from last year at the subcategory level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, because virtually all of that &#x2013; virtually all of the aggressive pricing that I talked about was commodity related in the food and sundries side. And that number without that roughly $30 million of markdowns was still plus 13 on like sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just bringing the horse out to kick him once more in SG&amp;A, have you disclosed or could you disclose what percentage of the SG&amp;A is healthcare so that if we adjust the growth rate for that as you're anniversarying it, we could see what the ex-currency growth rate on SG&amp;A might do?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's good data that we can do a little math on it. And then just finally on the FX contracts, is that just currency swaps and you're saying it had been in the operations line of SG&amp;A. Was that ever particularly material?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It actually is in the margin line. It has to do &#x2013; as an example, let's use Canada as an example. Canada buys some of their goods in the U.S. with U.S. dollars. And there are payment terms on those that could be 10 days, seven days, or it could be 60 days. Based on their weighted average of daily expectations of U.S. dollars out, they convert some of their Canadian sales receipts into U.S. dollars, and all it is when you mark that to market at the end of a month or end of a fiscal period. We tend to err &#x2013; subject to giant changes in currencies, we tend historically to err to our benefit a little bit, and so there's always a few million pickup frankly. Historically, that has been in margin. And now because of some accountants smarter than me, the new rules are it's down in interest income and other. I'm sure there's some FASB or APB or some other acronym out there that's making you do it this way. But rather than reclassify stuff from prior years, it is what it is. It's a handful of millions, not a heck of a lot.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Hey, Richard, if we look to the core average ticket, excluding gas and FX, it was down about 1.5% in the second quarter, but you said it was flat I think in February. As we look to the back half of the year, is that something that we should expect to be positive year over year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends. The trend is good and we're hopeful, but your guess is as good as mine. Clearly from a merchandising standpoint, we're aggressive. We're out there. The buyers are buying and they're told to be aggressive on getting stuff and being aggressive on &#x2013; don't be meek on bringing in bigger ticket items. But our model allows us to be a little more aggressive, arguably. So yes, hopefully yes, but you never know until it's there.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter, I'm hopeful that with some of this price deflation abating that that will help as well. The FX and the gas is going to be what it will be, but for it to improve a little bit barring the same traffic levels, we're going to have to see a little bit of improvement there in the core comp for that to happen.</p>

          <p>It's actually doing pretty good. Hold on a second. The trend in California, again if I look at the last three or four months, it has been gradually improving.</p>

          <p>Is it positive excluding gas or still slightly negative?</p>

          <p>I believe it's positive, but I'll let you know. Hold on; slightly positive in February.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Just quickly, why did you make the change that cost us 12 basis points in SG&amp;A in the quarter, the change in benefits? What was the driver of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The driver was that for about 30% of our employees in the U.S. in certain states, it was something that upon termination they would get paid up to three days, some fraction of three days' pay. And for the other 70% they weren't; and we were getting questions on it. We had always done it that way. But as each state changed some rules, we just felt it was the right thing to do.</p>

          <p>With the employee agreement, so it was a good time to tie it in.</p>

          <p>Hi, Richard. Most of my questions have been asked but I'll ask about real estate, just what you're seeing in terms of opportunities there and how you think about the pipeline of opportunities going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are more opportunities. We're now getting back into it. Again it was about a year ago when we halted anything that wasn't signed to renegotiate. I know we're talking &#x2013; continuing to talk to the shopping center operators as well as banks in the case of some foreclosed properties. We are ramping up some of our international a little bit. And we think there's &#x2013; our success in Asia is an example, and Australia recognizing we have one unit for a few months there. But ramping up doesn't mean we're going to go from one in Australia to ten in two years. It means instead of doing three in three years total, we'll do hopefully five or six.</p>
          <p>I would say we're active. The hope is that we did a net of 16 last year and something around that number this year. This fiscal year, that that number would get back in the low 20s in '11 and '12 and the high 20s in '13 and '14. We've been wrong before, but we do have a lot of irons in the fire there. We've got two coming in your state.</p>
