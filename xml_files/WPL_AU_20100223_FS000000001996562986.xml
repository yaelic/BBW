          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Woodside Full-Year Results 2010 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a presentation followed by a question-and-answer session <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I must advise you that this conference is being recorded today, the 24th of February, 2010.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Don Voelte. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We appreciate everyone tuning in today and your continuing interest in Woodside. I'll move right onto slide number two and this is our normal disclaimer. It's not changed from the several times you've seen it before.</p>
          <p>Going to slide three, those are our financial headlines. Our reported net profit after tax of 1.82 billion with an underlying net profit of 1.91 billion is up year-on-year two and 4%, respectively. Our revenue of 4.35 billion and cash flow of 1.86 billion were down significantly as revenues moderated from peak prices that we experienced in 2008. We earned $2.59 per share, allowing a half-year dividend of $0.55 and resulting in a full year dividend of $1.10. Our return on equity remains healthy at 18.5%, and gearing at the end of the year was 30%, similar to last year.</p>
          <p>Forward to slide four, our operational headlines. Our production volume finished at 80.9 million barrels equivalent resulting in sales volume of 80.7 million, both about even with last year. Something we're really proud of is our safety where in 2009 recorded the lowest frequency of injuries at a 3.3 ratio, much improved from 4.3 last year. We worked a record of number of hours to boot.</p>
          <p>Staff turnover on a rolling 12-month average has continued trending down to 5.2%. That's a satisfying result and it's directly due to some initiatives that we've undertaken. We really like our 3,200 person workforce at Woodside and we aim to keep them.</p>
          <p>At the bottom of our slide, our future is bright and we have 16 years of proved reserves as compared to our current production. When you add probable reserves, it totals 21 years. And just for good measure, by adding contingent resource you get a whopping 44 years. Of course, most of this is Browse and Sunrise.</p>
          <p>Slide five, at our November 2009 investor briefing, we showed you this slide, which indicates our goal of building up to 20 million tonnes per annum of equity LNG before the end of this decade. We showed you our foundation equity position via five trains at North West Shelf and the Pluto Train 1 coming on to drive over six million tonnes per annum. Building on that is Pluto 2 and 3 shown with an assumed placeholder equity. We also displayed our single Sunrise train and our three Browse trains, driving us right up there to that 20 million tonne equity mark.</p>
          <p>We want to show you how we've progressed in this plan, so on to slide number six. It's an understatement to say that we've made significant progress, in fact, very significant progress over the past six months. I reckon we've progressed further in our four LNG projects than any other six-month period ever in the history of Woodside.</p>
          <p>I'm extremely proud of our workforce and our management team and what they've done forwarding our projects at Pluto foundation, Pluto expansion, Browse, Sunrise and winding out our North West Shelf assets to a smooth day-to-day operation.</p>
          <p>Pluto Train 1 is anticipating gas at the end of this year, and LNG early 2011. Now, we're going to need our construction workers to work with us to achieve that outcome. In a few minutes, we'll report great progress on the exploration front for Pluto's Trains 2 and 3. As you probably know, our base plan is to build Pluto expansions from organic exploration sources. Although, we're not counting on it, several parties are discussing with us bringing their gas to Pluto.</p>
          <p>I can say, in my opinion, a Train 2 FID should not be stalled by a lack of gas. Sunrise, even though it's about three months late against a self-imposed schedule, is getting to a unanimous decision and still very timely with robust economics.</p>
          <p>And the biggest news of course is all about Browse. Browse is an extremely robust economic project with high liquids content in a fairly conventional development. The news over the last couple of months that the joint venture has decided to come along at James Price Point and build three trains onshore with a complementary offshore facility and to do it in a timeframe proscribed by the government is a phenomenal achievement.</p>
          <p>Now on basis of design, with FEED to follow and an FI decision by mid-2012, the stars have aligned in this next world scale project. So we think that the slide title is absolutely correct, all of our LNG plans are all coming together.</p>
          <p>When this current management team was put together, starting back in 2004/'05, it was to build and develop our LNG portfolio, to create value for shareholders. In early 2004, we had three smaller trains at North West Shelf. We've more than doubled that capacity.</p>
          <p>Our Pluto foundation project with Train 1 is looking good with two new Pluto trains being progressed and a further two possible. Browse is now having its day in the sun that is lined up and has a clear glide path to success. Almost the same with Sunrise, kind of a parallel track, a little bit smaller, but still a very high liquid content and economically robust. We see at least six trains coming down the road in addition to our six existing trains.</p>
          <p>Slide seven, I'd like to digress for the next six slides and tell you why we're so confident in our capability to grow Woodside with strong, robust economic projects which produce a product that our customers desire, and why we're comfortable to build on our reputation as a safe and reliable deliverer, on time, on specification LNG? We've got a great reputation, and not everyone does, and it matters.</p>
          <p>I'd like to explain why we see such a strong future for LNG, even with North American shale, cutter gas, <mark type="inaudible" />, coal-bed methane, and all the other supposed threats to Western Australia conventional gas. We feel very strongly that our gas will compete just fine, that we will successfully get all of our projects off the ground and their economics should deliver to shareholders for years to come.</p>
          <p>So slide seven shows this global growth of all forms of energy sources, indicating that in 2010 over 12,000 million tonnes of oil equivalent will be consumed. The data indicates that from 2010 to 2020 about 140 million additional tonnes of LNG will be required, or on an annual basis 14 million tonnes of growth is required every year, that's every year, over the next decade.</p>
          <p>Now when you figure in the natural decline of some existing LNG production, we believe conservatively 15 to 20 million tonnes per annum of new LNG is going to be required to meet demand. Now that's the equivalent of a new Gorgon and Pluto every year coming on-stream. Now hold that thought for three slides, and let's move over to slide number eight.</p>
          <p>So let's take a closer look at LNG supply and demand. Now, as you can see here, this Wood Mack chart identifies contracted supply versus global LNG demand. As we can attest via interest in our small volume of available Pluto LNG, there's unsatisfied demand from 2011 to 2014. Attempts to bridge that gap may come from voluntary diversion, but that will come at a price. This gap of uncontracted demand then widens from 2015.</p>
          <p>If you look at the second color segment up from the bottom, the light blue, that represents Australia. You do see expansion of contracted LNG in the 2014 to 2016 time period, representing the major new projects coming on-stream like Gorgon, which is already calculated in the chart.</p>
          <p>As mentioned earlier, even with the new suite of announced LNG projects, the global LNG industry is not contracted for more than 250 million tonnes per annum of LNG into the future. People just don't seem to realize the drop off in older plants around the world.</p>
          <p>At Woodside our marketers continue to see very strong interest in all of our projects. There has not been a let up in conversations, discussions or negotiations in contracting our gas for our potential customers.</p>
          <p>Over to slide nine, so now that we've established demand let's look at LNG receiving infrastructure. Is there enough? Well there's a very quick answer to that. As you can see, Asia Pacific has more than two times the required receiving and gasification facilities. Clearly not a constraint. And take it from us, there's ample shipping available well into the future, so much so we didn't even bother with the slide.</p>
          <p>Over to slide 10, this to me is the most interesting slide so far. I'd ask you take some time to study it later. It takes a little while to figure it out. We've built a case for strong demand for LNG, for plenty of shipping, and receiving terminals, now it's down to supply.</p>
          <p>I'm not going to harp on how hard it is to build liquefaction facilities, or the many challenges it takes for an FID decision, because this graph tells you the story. First let me set up the graph. Starting from the left, the light blue bars are the initial year of commissioned LNG plants by tonnage. The dark blue bars are the plants that are under construction, and the black line is the tonnage of LNG per year taking FID to final investment decision.</p>
          <p>Therefore, for example, you can see the very large blue bar in 2009, represents the cutter plants coming on-stream. You can also see where they were FID. Using this four to five year lag from FID to commissioning, you can see from 2006 a very low total of FID projects until last year. This will guarantee low volumes of new LNG coming on-stream through to 2014. And as we saw a few slides ago, it'll partly serve to offset LNG, other LNG decline.</p>
          <p>Although we anticipate more FIDs taking place in 2010, the really important line here is the horizontal red arrow that indicates the FID level required annually to satisfy 2020 demand. Looking at the chart, past history demonstrates that this level of LNG, final investment decisions and capacity builds has been very difficult to achieve.</p>
          <p>Slide 11, more important for Woodside, how we're going to continue against some of the non-traditional, non-conventional gas sources. Let me preface this by saying that we're in the catbird seat, having five North West trains already built, providing steady cash flow now and into the future, and a Pluto greenfield almost built. Building ground fields of course are much easier and much less complexity.</p>
          <p>So we're really feeling good that we have a strong position now for Pluto 2 and 3, potentially 4 and 5. And now with a firm schedule for Browse, and good progress for Sunrise, what is most important is how we compete against some of these other projects safety, security, confidence in the eyes of customers and economically in the eyes of our shareholders.</p>
          <p>As to shale gas in North America and Eastern Europe, which may provide adequate supply to local markets, then the only question becomes how does our gas stack up economically versus others when you land LNG in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, other markets that have no indigenous supply?</p>
          <p>Looking at this chart, as I've mentioned, brownfields is a distinct advantage. And if you have to build a greenfield, let it be a world scale Browse. Shared infrastructure is a synergistic advantage. We have it at North West Shelf. We'll have it with the additional Pluto Trains. And we should have it between Pluto and North West Shelf. And if we go to DLNG at Sunrise, we'll have it there too.</p>
          <p>And of course, vital importance is rich liquids content. I'll dive into that in the next slide, but you should note that gas price is influenced by the quality of the gas and the calorific value. Something that LNG operators know all about is the deliverability of gas required for start ups and restarts. It's amazing the instantaneous volumes required. We count on our huge producing wells that we can instantly turn on and have gas on demand.</p>
          <p>Few people realize you need more than twice the capacity you normally have running through your plant for start-ups and restarts, and another differentiator is proven technology. We've built these plants. Woodside knows what they're doing. They know how to operate them.</p>
          <p>Now on to slide 12. On this slide I'd like to remind our shareholders the importance of rich liquids, especially in a lower oil price environment. We've updated a schematic that we last showed you in 2008 with 2009 data. With 2009 being lower oil price environment, it's important to note that our liquids received 56% higher prices per BOE than LNG versus 32% higher in 2008.</p>
          <p>In other words, in a high price world, in other words a high oil price world, no worries. In a low oil price world, you need the liquids to make these projects sing. It costs a little bit more capital to build the fractionation and stabilization plants, but it is for high value products and it radically improves the economics.</p>
          <p>Speaking of that, I'd like to talk a little bit about economics. We're often asked how do you evaluate LNG projects? But we've not taken the time ever to say more than just about trust us. Let me say, a lot of other companies don't talk about economics either, except to alibi their excuses.</p>
          <p>I'd like to discuss what I see as desired LNG economics. Know it's what our Board looks at when we approve a project. I've listed some of the economic parameters that are important to me. First off is net present value, a more clearly discounted net present value. We use several different discount rates in stressing the project. At our normal P50 Ks we use discounts of seven to 10% higher rates to see how strong our project might be.</p>
          <p>The net present value has to be material at Woodside on a company equity basis. We like to see a net present value of anywhere upwards of 20% of the original capital investment on a discounted basis on a P50 expectation. For internal rate of return, or IRRs, I've got it listed there. LNG projects have always been known to be low rate of return projects because of the intense capital requirements coupled with construction time lag. But even so, we still look at projects target near the 15% level. When getting to the second or third train with shared infrastructure, we don't expect higher or right at that 15% or thereabouts.</p>
          <p>Now we do go below that number, below 15%, for a greenfield knowing that subsequent trains will improve the overall economics of this facility. We recognize that it's lower compared to what are much higher requirements for declining resource projects where capital efficiency is much more important than capital effectiveness.</p>
          <p>So for profit investment ratio, or PIR or VIR in some people's vocabulary, is also a very important parameter for LNG. Now this parameter is basically the number of dollars returned on a discounted basis over and above the dollars invested. It recognizes the size or the effectiveness of the project and the life of the project versus the efficiency of the project.</p>
          <p>I look at PIRs even more than I look at IRRs. It's a more controlling in a greenfield project, and I like to see a one-train project meet 0.25 hurdle. You like to see 0.35 or higher PIRs for multi-train development. And payback's really important. How fast can you get investment back and why is schedule so important for LNG projects? We like to see payback somewhere in the six to eight year timeframe. And margins, extremely important as you know and that's why we talk so much about liquid.</p>
          <p>When you look at break-even barrels, I would just say that North West Shelf is probably the best and always will be the best that Australia will ever see, for the reasons we've talked about for the last few minutes.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we project our Pluto margins to just get better as we add train. More importantly, our margin projections for our Browse and Sunrise projects are closer to the high margin North West Shelf than the other extreme coalbed methane. Very strong liquid content enhances LNG margins and it's even more important in a possible low price world going forward. I imagine the boards of coal seam LNG projects will be losing sleep figuring out what oil price assumptions to use for their final investment decision.</p>
          <p>Finally, the best economic component for big, long LNG projects is cash flow. Even though LNG requires tremendous running capital investment, they spit out huge amounts of cash over time. But you have to expect them to. And these projects involve huge capital and operational risk. So you expect huge benefits if you know what you're doing. I look for cumulative cash flows over the first 20 years to be twice the investment. A good long robust project gives three or four times the ultimate cash flow over the life of the project.</p>
          <p>Now with these generic parameter discussion, our point is that amongst LNG projects you should expect to see projects that benefit from high liquids content, or brownfield development and operating synergies were better on all of these metrics versus projects that are either greenfields or lack strong liquids content. Bottom line for us, Browse, Sunrise and expansions of Pluto, can be expected to yield robust economics, particularly in comparison to other projects which lack their advantages.</p>
          <p>Now even though it took some time I thought it was important to have this talk with investors. I don't plan to do it again. And I apologize if it went a bit long. Let's move over to slide 13. And in the interests of time, let me just say I've been listening in the past couple of weeks during the earnings season to the various observation of other CEOs. I guess I might be a bit of a contrarian, but for what Woodside does and the customers we serve, I think we're very well placed geographically, logistically and have low cost operations.</p>
          <p>We expect the Asia Pacific economy to grow 5% per annum over the decade with better than acceptable prices for our commodities. We do not expect a double-dip recession in the key economies. I think in our Woodside world, we see conditions a little bit better or maybe even a lot better than others. For a really strong future, I guess it gets down to one thing, that American consumers have to come through for our Asian economies to really expand. And at the end of the day, Americans are tough bastards. I bet they come through.</p>
          <p>Now, speaking to another one, over to Mark Chatterji, our CFO.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Don. Hello, everybody. I'm going to run through our financial results for 2009 and then talk a bit about 2010 before handing the presentation back over to Don to finish our briefing.</p>
          <p>On slide number 15, Woodside benefits from substantial and long-life reserves. As you can see on the chart, Woodside has a 21-year reserve to production ratio. That's at the 2P level. And our three-year reserve to placement ratio was 132%. That's also 2P level. Now, of course, contingent resources primarily associated with our Browse and Sunrise projects has a potential to more than double our reserves in the next few years as these projects are progressed towards sanction.</p>
          <p>On slide 16, we noted a few years ago that we would see a plateau in our production, while Pluto 1 was under construction. 2009 production finished at 80.9 million barrels of oil equivalent. That's less than 1% lower than 2008. 2010 production would have also remained around this level, but the Company decided to monetize its interest in Otway, resulting in our current forecast for 2010 in the range of 70 to 75 million barrels of oil equivalent.</p>
          <p>Slide number 17, revenue in 2009 finished at $4.352 billion, that's $53.93 per boe of sales volume. Now that 27% decline on year-on-year revenue was somewhat less than the 33% decline in the Australian dollar oil price during the same period.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 18. Gas lifting costs declined around 15% to $3.35 per boe. This was primarily due to the outstanding performance in North West Shelf, which managed to keep a good hold on costs even while expanding their production. Oil lifting costs rose 10% to $8.53 per boe, driven by both natural field decline and the cost of Vincent repair work. For information, if you exclude the extra Vincent cost, the oil lifting cost would be $7.24 per boe.</p>
          <p>Slide 19, operating cash flow for the full year 2009 was $1.859 billion. Most of the year-on-year change versus 2008 is attributable to the decrease in revenue discussed previously. Other than that, an increase in interest paid and a reduction in payable was partially offset by a decrease in tax paid.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 20. As we noted in the annual report released today, the impact of lower commodity prices and the revaluation of our U.S. dollar debt had opposing but material outcomes on our 2009 financial results, as you can see in the chart. However, even when you exclude the debt revaluation, getting a 28% profit margin in a year of substantially lower pricing I think speaks well to the quality of Woodside's asset base.</p>
          <p>Slide 21. Woodside's underlying NPAT of $1.906 billion was $82 million higher than our reported NPAT of $1.824 billion. Now the main significant item this year was the write-off of the balance of our investment in Libya. The exit from that country will be completed soon.</p>
          <p>Slide 22. The directors have declared $0.55 final dividend for 2009, which brings dividend for the full year 2009 to $1.10. I might add that the directors have elected to not underwrite the dividend reinvestment plan for this current dividend. That's consistent with the intention that we had announced in December at the launch of the rights offering.</p>
          <p>Slide 23. Capital and exploration expenditure for the full year 2010 is forecast at $4.7 billion. The difference between this figure and our forecast presented at the November Investment Day is primarily driven by Pluto 1. The figures on this chart reflect the potential for 10% increase in the overall cost of Pluto 1, which we had previously announced to the marketplace. The chart also contains updated phasing of spending on Pluto 1 between 2009 and 2010.</p>
          <p>Finally, I want to flag that given the progress towards Pluto expansion that Don is going to discuss, we're considering keeping ownership of Gap Ridge village and other housing in Karratha as opposed to selling those assets off, which was our original assumption at the time of Pluto FID. Now this money has already been spent, but obviously if we opt to keep the accommodation on our books our capital budget for 2010 will increase to reflect that change.</p>
          <p>Slide 24. Earlier in February, Woodside completed the retail component of its accelerated renounceable rights offering. 93% of eligible institutional investors and 58% of retail investors took up their rights, which was a great result. We believe that our existing debt capacity, this equity offering, and the Otway sales proceeds to be received position the Company's balance sheet for a rapid transition into the next round of LNG growth post Pluto 1.</p>
          <p>Slide 25. As a final note on funding, you'll see that we have no significant refinancings until after the start-up of our Pluto 1 project.</p>
          <p>Thanks for listening and I'm going to turn the presentation back over to Don.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark. Now over to slide 27. Let's start our project review with North West Shelf. In our plan, our goals this past year were to finish construction of stabilizer six, fix a few design issues with our new Train 5, and progress maintenance and integrity to new levels. Now, we finished construction of stabilizer six and have improved Train 5 to design output.</p>
          <p>We now have a world scale plan including five trains with 16.3 million tonnes capacity, six condensate stabilizers, three LPG fractionation columns and two pipeline gas trains. We produced a record amount of LNG last year and have had strong and steady operations since our last major shut down. There's one more very important detail that has not received much public notice or much notice here, that's the results of the Alinta pipeline gas arbitration. Now the exact settlement is to remain confidential, so I can just say that we've been pleased that we made our case and that the ruling compares favorably with recent WA gas sales agreement.</p>
          <p>Now this is a huge new revenue exposure for North West Shelf and Woodside. My expectation is that when other new or existing contracts come up for extension or review there'll be now a new price foundation to work from and this is big for us.</p>
          <p>Slide 28. Just a note on the future of North West Shelf. We're progressing projects to ensure future supply. Over the next year, we're replacing our Cossack Pioneer FPSO with the Okha FPSO. As important we'll be replacing virtually the entire subsea infrastructure.</p>
          <p>The four fields served by this FPSO have been truly amazing, producing a multiple of FID expectation and now we're building for another 20 years of reservoir life. On gas supply, we're on schedule and on budget with the NRB sister compressor platform to our North Rankin A facility. A tremendous amount of construction work is underway at this time in various fabrication yards as well as our A platform. All is going well.</p>
          <p>Now, slide 29, over to our foundation greenfield and Train 1 project at Pluto. We're currently 85% complete. We are on schedule for first gas on Pluto late last year and LNG early next. This is contingent on a productive industrial relations environment.</p>
          <p>As you all know, we recently experienced two illegal wildcat strikes on two occasions, although over the same issue. We don't believe these strikes could or would have occurred without the instigation and coordination of the construction unions. About one-half of the workforce participated and we believe that those that were on strike, the overwhelming majority, really wanted to come back to work.</p>
          <p>We believe it wasn't a strike against Woodside as much as a testing of the boundaries of the new IR laws. We hope and believe that this early testing of wills will give way to a calming of the waters and productive work will ensue.</p>
          <p>Let me finish this little vignette by saying that we respect our Australian skilled crafts people and want to provide a safe workplace, great accommodations and appropriate compensation. But just in case, we've put a mitigation plan in place, which if required ensures customer LNG delivery obligations are met. This innovative program not only protects our customers, it actually provides low or no cost protection for Woodside. Finally for this slide, our cost projections for the Pluto foundation project remain within the guidance that we provided you last November.</p>
          <p>Slide 30. We're continuing at peak construction both onshore and offshore Pluto. We achieved our H&amp;S or health and safety targets for 2009, and have set more demanding goals for the remainder of the project construction phase.</p>
          <p>Onshore, we have just about all the physical assets in place. We are out of the ground and mechanically, we are hanging in the air. We have initiated commissioning of certain systems and are ramping up our operations team.</p>
          <p>Offshore, the same story. All the physical assets, pipeline, flow lines, manifolds, wells and platforms are in place. We are heading into the mechanical hook ups and finalizing our well completions.</p>
          <p>Over on slide 31, here you can see the transition of coming out of the ground and hanging in the air. Slide 32, the same thing offshore. You can see our Pluto platform just prior to the lifting and setting of a temporary accommodation unit. Just for fun, you might want to note the tremendous number of bolted connections on that living unit structure there on the left. That is to facilitate the breakdown and demobilization of this unit by the smaller Pluto platform on-board crane that you can see after all the heavy lift equipment has left the area, and we're just at that point of having all the large construction vessels depart our project.</p>
          <p>Slide 33, and to give you some milestones to monitor our progress, I will just let you read through the list on this slide. Slide 34, now, importantly onto our Pluto expansion plan. At the end of the day, we've had a terrific six months of progress on all fronts. We entered front-end engineering and design or FEED for sister Trains 2 and 3. We contracted dual FEEDs to ensure the most competitive outcome. So far, so good, all ticks.</p>
          <p>We continue to target Train 2 final investment decision or FID at the end of this year. This would facilitate construction and hook-up about 12 months before the same crafts are required at the Gorgon project. First gas will be targeted for late 2013 or early 2014.</p>
          <p>As we might have mentioned in the investor briefing in November, the absolute ultimate achievement would be accelerating Train 3 FID to Train 2 FID timing since building the two trains next to each other at the same time, would facilitate the most efficient and effective build.</p>
          <p>A lot of things would have to fall in place for this to occur, but it would be a coup d'&#xE9;tat if accomplished. Suffice it to say at this time our base plan is for Train 3 FID and first gas 12 months after Train 2. To attest my earlier observation, I can confirm the early timing of the potential Train 2 and Train 3 LNG is driving strong market interest for the LNG.</p>
          <p>Now let's talk about our exploration. We have experienced excellent results with four of our first five wells in this space hitting gas. This success rate is helping build our discovered gas volumes. The one prospect that didn't work out for us, Pelion, where the mid-Triassic exploration target was wet, still gave us a positive result in that it found the southern Pluto field to be high to our assumptions.</p>
          <p>We told you about Eris last November, but now we can confirm that the two sister locations to our Martell discovery have both found gas. The Noblige No. 1 intersected several sands including a high net to gross 300 metre interval, and our Larsen 1 prospect struck high pressure gas above the primary target, but unfortunately we could not control the well bore sufficiently to drill deeper to the main target level. We are going to defer re-drilling the Larsen in the near term as we are now very confident that this deeper target will contain the gas that we were looking for.</p>
          <p>We told our engineers to assume success and plan on pre-drill volumes. In fact, we're now pretty certain that the entire southern half of WA-404 has received gas charge and we are making our plans on that assumption, and did I forget to mention? Our liquid test at Martell was very similar to the North West Shelf. Good stuff. Last November when we talked about our Phase 1 exploration program, we told you that negative results in drilled wells may condemn other prospects thus reducing our drillable portfolio. Happily, we can report that our drill results to-date and have actually increased the number of our prospective targets.</p>
          <p>Slide 35. That being a good summary, let's drill a little bit deeper in the Pluto expansion plan via exploration. We continue to actively explore the six prospect hubs as shown on this slide and help is on the way. The Ocean America rig arrives in May for a two-year stay to complement the discovery, which we have on a three-year contract.</p>
          <p>Slide 36. Since I just summarized the drill results to-date of Martell, Noblige and Larsen, the remaining take-away from this slide is, six plus drill-ready exploration prospects in our Central Hub. You can see the location of the prospects in the upper right hand map. We will next move to test Hine and establish migration patterns in the block.</p>
          <p>Slide 37. Our drilling has taught us many lessons about the geology and produced new prospects &#x2013; and has produced new prospects. Not only have we proved that the mid-Triassic is gas productive, but we've also drilled enough holes to calibrate the seismic amplitude to proven gas. This has assisted us identify a new deep target below the Martell field and another new prospect south of the Noblige gas discovery. The seismic amplitude map on the left of this slide shows these two prospects as bright yellow amplitudes, which we interpret as potential gas and reservoir sands.</p>
          <p>Slide 38, and due to time constraints, I will skip discussion on the Cazadores Hubs for the day until we drill our big test at Dalia South prior to visiting with you again in August at our half-year results. But I do want to brag a little bit about the capability of the Woodside staff and the results they are bringing home.</p>
          <p>The Claudius Hub or WA-434 was awarded just six months ago. We bid based on some 2D lines that we own. We liked what we saw, but we didn't have enough data to progress any drill-ready prospects. So we immediately contracted a seismic boat and have now acquired 3,710 square kilometers of 3D seismic. Now here you can see the quality of the data. It literally sends shivers down my back. In a few months, we're going to test this area with a drill bit, fingers crossed for gas. These are big targets with multiple repeats, if successful.</p>
          <p>Onto slide 39. The early exploration success has required adjustment to our rig sequencing. I hope you remember that we told you that this would most likely be the case, and it's a problem that we're happy to have. We're also going to try and mix in some appraisal work along the way. With the success of Southern WA-404, we are most interested in the early test in Northern WA-44, Cazadores prospect and our Claudius concept.</p>
          <p>As you can also see, we plan to drill a number of near-Pluto prospects at the end of the year. These prospects are considered easy to develop and could provide early year production to a three train option, backed by large finds or finds for later development. More on that in a few slides; so hold onto that thought.</p>
          <p>Slide 40. Up to this point in our presentation, we've been very silent on other resource owners or ORO gas we refer to it. Let me reiterate that our base plan does not count on it. In fact, our base plan assumes just Woodside exploration gas, but I can tell you the discussions are ongoing with third parties to bring their gas through Pluto.</p>
          <p>Slide 41. Our expansion plans for Pluto are progressing well. Exploration has had a great start to the Pluto campaign with four of the five wells finding gas. The 404 finds are clustered, which will assist development. In November, we showed you that we had more gas for Pluto 1 than required for contract. That access for potential acceleration gas from Pluto 1 gave us a head start on Pluto 2 prior to starting our Phase 1 exploration program. Currently, we are filling up our Train 2 with gas found by our initial exploration drilling. As I said earlier, in my opinion, a Train 2 FID should not be stalled by lack of gas.</p>
          <p>Now, I just want to mention that all this slide doesn't assume any ORO opportunities and none of that is included in the slides in the three schemes that we've got. I'd like to point out the bottom left is a stretch aspiration. It's probably my stretch aspiration. It is to find enough gas close to the Pluto platform to give us enough time to build Trains 2 and 3 together and produce LNG, until we can build and deliver more distant gas discoveries &#x2013; let me repeat, gas discoveries or gas &#x2013; found gas.</p>
          <p>In other words, I'm watching the volumes that are able to produce early on while we build and deliver discovered, but unable to commence by late 2013 or 2014. An example would be that we would have enough gas shown in black to produce three trains until say oh &#x2013; let's just say 2020, and by that time have developed and delivered the unable to commence in 2014 gas to fill the capacity shown in red. As I say, it's an aspiration, but it' is a good one to have.</p>
          <p>Just finishing this slide, a reminder. Our front-end engineering design studies for Pluto 2 and 3 are on track for completion later this year. They are going just fine.</p>
          <p>Onto slide 42, it's time to wrap up Pluto. I wish we could talk all day about it, but don't have the time. Key messages are listed. Foundation project on track for world-class outcome. Early success on our exploration expansion plans. Discussions ongoing to other resource owners, but we're not relying on success, and four, strong LNG market interest in the timing of our expansion.</p>
          <p>And onto slide 43, onto Browse. Wow, it's great to see our faith rewarded with some concrete action. Browse in our view is a world-class high-equity economically robust potential development. If you break down the development of the components, you will see that each segment is either conventional technology or an application has been tried, and successfully endeavored elsewhere in the industry. The thing is with Browse, it's just big.</p>
          <p>Arguably, Woodside has experience in all aspects of the potential development except deepwater gas structures. It's important to note that Woodside has hired numerous experienced personnel. In addition, one of our partners has offered considerable help to supplement our deepwater gas facility capability and other factors have improved at Browse. The CO2 at just over 10% is less than our pre-appraisal expectation.</p>
          <p>The P90 resources have dramatically improved the appraisal, and although the P50 resources have decreased the appraisal, they're still world-class. But interesting, the liquids have increased dramatically. In fact the liquids-to-gas ratio has increased over 40% during the appraisal period versus the assumptions we were carrying just two to three years ago.</p>
          <p>Slide 44. This timeline of 2009 activities and the prescriptive government 2010 to 2012 milestones are shown here. Tremendous preparatory work was completed by Woodside in building the onshore option on behalf of our partners. Now that all partners have accepted the conditions of the retention leases and the concept selection of James Price Point as the onshore locations of Browse, we're off to the races.</p>
          <p>Woodside as operators prepared for the selection of James Price Point and pre-contracting two APC contractors to enter basis of design or BOD as we call it in order to meet this schedule. Now that's been completed. You can see the major milestones before taking FID &#x2013; first, an indigenous land use agreement with the KLC on behalf of the traditional landowner, two, LNG Precinct environmental approvals; three, FEED contracts; and four, commencing pioneer works and possibly committing to long lead time items.</p>
          <p>Therefore since the retention lease work program culminates in a mid 2012 FID, I feel very certain, say 85 to 90%, that this project will proceed. Since the only other option as I see it is feeding back the leases.</p>
          <p>Slide 45. The next three slides are new to the Investment Committee and form the basis of our design concept. Starting with this slide, we're showing the reservoir subsea convention that we plan to use. Currently, our thoughts are to develop Calliance and Brecknock reservoirs first, followed by Torosa some eight to 10 years later.</p>
          <p>We want to go with dry-tree units complete with liquid removal at the reservoir site, thus using tension-leg or spar platforms. Each would be equipped with a modular rig. There would be an estimated 900 kilometres of inter-field and infield pipelines to the central processing unit.</p>
          <p>And then on slide 46, we show the close-up of the central processing facility located in the shelf in 100 metres of water, which in our business is shallow water. The CPF or the central processing facility will consist of two jacket structures supporting a production facility and a utilities accommodation facility. Present plans are to float over the deck.</p>
          <p>On the previous slide, you can see that CPF will be connected to JPP or James Price Point via 42-inch diameter gas pipeline, an oil condensate pipeline and a MEG pipeline for gas dehydration. Over on slide 47, you can get an idea for what we're looking at for James Price Point. We are initially targeting 12 million tonnes via three processing liquefaction trains. Our site can expand to 25 million tonnes per annum.</p>
          <p>A key change from Pluto will be the advancement of modular technology. Since the elevation delta at JPP is much less than Pluto, we are able to go to the next generation of modular design at Browse. Now I've got to leave something for next time, so I won't go into details, stay tuned.</p>
          <p>Slide 48, we do not believe Browse will be a standalone development, although other proponents are discussing Darwin and other schemes, we believe James Price Point, will over time, attract other users. Woodside wants to be one of those other users. We're building our exploration portfolio around the Browse Basin and we're going to start our drilling program later this year.</p>
          <p>On this map you can see our exploration holdings. Please note the Argus field and the Omar prospect before you turn the page here.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 49, the Argus field was discovered in 2000. It's a gas condensate field. We farmed into the retention lease at a 60% interest and took over operator-ship. Our plan is to drill the Argus II appraisal well later this year. We believe this field has multi-Tcf potential.</p>
          <p>Slide 50, you'll see the reservoir depiction of our Omar-B prospect. It's a deep wildcat with multi-Tcf potential. It's on trend with the three Browse reservoirs. Woodside owns 50% of this prospect and is the operator. It seems like we operate everything in Australia, don't we?</p>
          <p>Woodside owns 50% of the prospect. We plan to drill later this year. So enough on Browse for now suffice it to say we're on exhilarating glide path to develop the three appraised reservoirs Calliance, Brecknock, Torosa and Woodside is building and testing our Browse exploration portfolio.</p>
          <p>Over to slide 51, Sunrise. The Sunrise development is tracking a few months behind the Browse development. Like Browse the appraisal is completed and there's a joint venture agreement to a 5.1 Tcf contingent resources and a very rich 226 million standard barrels of condensate.</p>
          <p>After an exhaustive review of floating LNG, or FLNG as we call it &#x2013; Darwin LNG, DLNG, and Timor-Leste LNG or TLNG, Woodside has completed its internal concept selection and we've presented it to the joint venture participants. Our drive for a unanimous agreement, not a break of three-to-one or two-to-two, we want four-to-zero, which caused our process to delay by about three months until the end of this quarter. We plan to submit a field development plan to both governments, Timor-Este and Australia after concept select has been made. We anticipate this to be another economically robust development.</p>
          <p>Slide 52, clearly we're busy at Woodside. We have to be worried about burning out our people. We have to worry about the hours they work. We worry about their career development, we worry about their continuing education, we worry about a lot of things. But I sleep well knowing that we have built a very capable broad and deep management leadership team. They watch over me, they watch over our 3,200 employees and our thousands of contractors in extremely professional manner.</p>
          <p>On slide 53 we give you some of the key parameters of our continuing sustainable performance. We've dramatically changed the Company over the past five years, and we think for the much better.</p>
          <p>Slide 53, just to emphasize three areas of improved performance, you can see from these three trend charts, first, the improved employee retention; second, higher graduate intake and training; and three, increased indigenous participation. These are just three indicators of dozens that we track.</p>
          <p>Slide 54, last slide. We believe we're following through on our promise to create value for our shareholders. Now I mentioned we've been on a journey the last five to six years. This chart continues to show that Woodside shareholders have huge leverage to LNG. When Pluto Train 1 comes onstream, a large share of that orange bar for Woodside is realized, putting our company into the most leveraged position in the industry, based on the equity to market capitalization.</p>
          <p>In fact, the data would show that at that point in time when Pluto comes on, no other company will be that leveraged to LNG through the end of this coming decade. We know it will be successful. We just have to execute &#x2013; execute and execute some more.</p>
          <p>Thank you today for your attention. We'll open it up for questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much for that presentation, Don, a lot of detail which we all appreciate. Just a couple of questions from me, first of all, just with respect to your comment about Pluto Train 2 will not be stalled by lack of gas. Can you give us a feel as to how much gas you will need to commit and perhaps what you might have so far in the Martell, Noblige and Larsen?</p>

          <p>Yeah. First off, I think if the FID stalls, it would stall for other reasons at this time and that's based on what we have found today and what we think we have based on that finding and future prospects and just looking at our exploration portfolio. As I preface that, it was my opinion.</p>
          <p>We have stated earlier that in addition to our Pluto gas Train 1 that we would need about 3.8 to 4 Tcf of additional gas. We've made that comment in several presentations in the past. That has not -</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we heard you guys go blank, so I don't know, but I &#x2013; I'd say the answer is a pretty vanilla one, so I don't think it should have blown anything up here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean you basically answered it. You said 3.8 to four Tcf.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe it would be best if I just restate, because I don't know where I got cut off at. But let me just say I heard your question and we have stated in the past, 3.8 to four Tcf depending where and how. We &#x2013; in our drilling at this point we are in a multi Tcf complex in 404. We have found other gas of course around the Pluto platform.</p>
          <p>What we have seen from our experience and with the prospects we have in 404, what we want to go drill in the other basins out there &#x2013; not basins, but the other hubs that we have.</p>
          <p>That's why I say, in my opinion it won't be stalled. The biggest issue for us now is to cleverly put together the different clusters of gas and how to best economically get it to the plant site. So we're kind of one phase away now from, you know, from just worrying about gas.</p>
          <p>How much have we found so far? We're holding that commercially confidential because we are in discussions, as I said, with third parties and also we have joint venture &#x2013; or joint ventures people that have some concerns about their rights in the block.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just one other question just on the CapEx side and this is directed to Mark. Just on the increase in CapEx forecast for 2010, and specifically with Pluto, it looks like the gain is about 1.26 billion above the guidance back in November '09. I know at the time you said that excluded the six to 10% cost increase which we estimated to be somewhere between 670 and 1.1 billion. So what this implies from our viewpoint is that the cost increase at Pluto is at that 10%, or if not a little bit higher. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Gordon, if you take the November chart and you compare it with the February chart, you &#x2013; for 2010, you'll get a difference of 1257. Now what that 1257 is, is actually I guess three elements. There is, number one, if you look at the 2009 estimates. So in November we said 2009 capital for Pluto 1 ought to be about 4631 and we ended up at 4247. So that was about $400 million difference, it's just phasing, right. So in 2009, money that we &#x2013; sorry, money we expected to spend in 2009 got pushed into 2010. You've got that plus you've got 10% cost increase and we talked about that earlier.</p>
          <p>We still don't know whether it's 6% or 10%, but we have to put in some number. We didn't put it in November. We decided we'll put in the full 10% in terms of the 2010 view and then go from there. Also you've got some incremental expenditure that's been pushed from 2010 to 2011. So when you look at those three elements, two move it up and one move it back, the net effect is 1257. So there's no change to the 6 to 10% guidance that we released back in November.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good day, Don. My question is regarding Browse. Previously you referred to this project as being marginal if Australia ever had a CPRS because the economics really didn't take it across the line or were just break-even. And today you refer to it as an extremely robust project, I'm assuming economically. What's changed in the project that has changed the sentiment towards it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think I ever said that CO2 was going &#x2013; or our carbon price was going to make it a marginal project. What I said was it would reduce because of the CO2 fairly dramatically the robust economics as we saw them. But there's been some offsetting factors as we see it at this point. I listed those today. I said our CO2 that actually are in the reservoirs less than what we thought pre-appraisal. Number two is that the liquid content of our appraisal program has increased dramatically and that our P90s are very strong now along with our P50 being confirmed. Also because we have the James Price Point option more defined and also the effects of reduction of some of the other issues around timing of the environmental permits, et cetera.</p>
          <p>When you go back in and take a look at all those different factors combined, it really enhances the margins over a long period of time. We're also not assuming that the carbon cost and the carbon worlds is coming as fast as what people may at one time thought. Copenhagen was pretty much a disaster. And as we see, the Mexico round coming up, yeah, you can put a carbon tax on. But I would just say, I think we've done a very good job educating our government about how exposed our industries are and how much careful. We saw the opposition mount a pretty good position on that. I would just say, I think there's going to be an awful lot more care with the exposed trade industries by both sides of the aisle in the government these days. Never talking quite as much as they were when they first came out right after the election.</p>

          <p>Good morning. I just wondered the quality of the line was a little bad at the beginning. I did pick up that you were discussing, Don, some of the financial and economic metrics which Woodside addresses. If you'd be kind enough just to perhaps quickly run through some of those again. I think you mentioned IRR plus a couple of other ones, but I couldn't make them out.</p>
          <p>And secondly, just on the exploration campaign thus far, can you elaborate on what sort of testing and down-hole measurements that you've been keeping through the WA-404 well so far, just to give us a sense of what level of confidence we might or might not have against the gas resource which you've highlighted is a multi-Tcf complex.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, first off, thanks, Mark. Let me just say that I appreciate your question. I think I probably bored half of the audience to death with the economic parameters. I believe we'll be coming by to see you and I don't want to repeat to everybody what I've already said here. So we'll take care of that on a follow up with you.</p>
          <p>As to what kind of testing, we have not had a long flare test of a production test. We basically know what these types of sands will produce for us based on our experience in the Carnarvon Basin. We do do the sampling while we drill type test. We will have an appraisal program follow up with this to do the more extensive testing that we'll need to further understand the extent of the reservoir and the limits of reservoir.</p>
          <p>I will tell you this that from the work we've done in correlation of the logs back to the seismic and the quality of the seismic, we think we have a pretty good understanding of the structure and the structure sizes.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have taken gas samples of all the wells that we've drilled, with the exception I can't say of Larsen. We got ourselves in trouble there pretty early on. So I would say it's a good trouble to get in. But I would just say that I can't verify that we sampled Larsen, but, boy, we got hit with gas there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that explains, Don, the comment around getting the well under control in the presentation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're plugging and abandoning them as we speak. We lost a well. We got in a situation I didn't want to take any chances. We're very concerned about our reputation at Woodside and how we manage our business here. So we'll re-drill that one later on. Peter Moore, our Exploration Manager, clearly is very confident of what he found out there and he just told me let's just drill it later on down the road. We want to go out and take a look at some other stuff out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. One very final small matter. You did mention, Don, that the observations on liquids content at Martell were sort of compatible with the North West Shelf. Would it be fair to extend that analysis over the other WA-404 discoveries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I probably got in trouble with my Exploration Manager even with saying what I said, but I will just say again that we're trying to make a point here today is, is that what kind of gas do we have out here? And there is an awful lot of &#x2013; we've been reading a lot and we've been seeing how the view of our company has been impacted by North American shale, the Eastern Europe shale and all this stuff. Well, we just go back and run the economics. And on the one page where we have the red tick marks, I guess you'd say, the check marks to some of the other people, what we're saying is we're finding liquids, good liquid content in this area and we expect to find good liquid content throughout most of the areas that we'll be exploring.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Stuart Baker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, gentlemen. Just a couple of questions for Mark really, just trying to nail down what that cost was for the Vincent repair there in dollar terms because your cash production costs year-on-year were fairly flat. So I just wanted to get that figure so I didn't capitalize it going forward if I could.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Stu, your question was just what's the actual dollar amount for the Vincent repair work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hang on. We'll look that up while you go to your next one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, second question is just looking at the business segments in the Annual Report, a fairly big increase in DD&amp;A for the Australian business between '08 and '09, 507 to 595. Where did that come from, what was driving that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sorry, so on your first one, Stu, we're catching up with you. The Vincent cost in just dollar amounts, which I think was your question, is about $31 million for our share. That's a net number, not a gross number, for Woodside.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And your second question was just what's moving the DD&amp;A up for the OZ BU?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And so it's generally, Stu, a lot of this is being driven by production, full year production and the increased full year production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In other words it's &#x2013; let me just add to that a little bit &#x2013; these are declining oil fields and even though you've got a vessel out there that some of them are under lease, et cetera, so you do have a certain amount of fixed cost with reducing production amount. But if you take a look at the overall DD&amp;A on a per barrel basis with even the oil prices we see now, these are still very productive fields for us and we expect them to last quite a while in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And so, Stu, on the point on production rise in 2008 we had about a half year contribution from Vincent versus a full year contribution in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And so you've got an increase in DD&amp;A as you get more Vincent barrels out of the ground. And you've have also got Laminaria as well, the same sort of thing. You remember we're were doing repair work in 2008 vis-&#xE0;-vis 2009 so you've got an increase in that as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. A question if I could around your reference to risk mitigation for Pluto customers. Just wondering if you can give us perhaps a little bit more information as to whether that is a reference to cash compensation, or whether you would look to source LNG from other places to meet those contractual obligations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Look I think the way &#x2013; it's Mark Chatterji &#x2013; I'll characterize it. We've actually talked with our customers about what do we need to do to cover off their needs, in case we have delays at Pluto and then the issue has come up obviously kind of sourcing cargo, so it's not cash compensation; it's just finding other LNG cargos. We have relationships with a variety of other suppliers around the Asia-Pacific and in fact beyond the Asia-Pacific in terms of sourcing cargos, and so we're confident, as Don said that even if there is mitigation required, we will be able to put that mitigation in place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. What's normal in this industry is that you get sister plants and the fact of the matter is, is that people go down for a long maintenance. We know one LNG plant is going to be changing out their turbines, so some people have coverage needs at opposite time that we may have coverage needs. And basically you just build up a little bit of an account.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Just a follow-up question on the quality of the gas from 404, just wondering if you're able to give us an indication on CO2 levels at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yeah, CO2, we're not in that Gorgon narrow-vein out there. We're clearly away from that in almost all of our exploration. We don't expect to find high CO2 in any of it. You know it's just probably a little bit more of an issue for Pluto, than North West Shelf it is minor stuff. CO2 is clearly very high quality gas all the way through that region.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. One final question then if I could. Just looking at your reserve statements in the annual report, I note that the best estimate contingent resource for Browse has dropped by about 6% and note that there's a comment saying that it reflects the results of concept selective studies. Just wondering if you could give us a little more information around the reason behind that decline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The contingent resources dropped off based on drilling. I think one of the issues is that we want to do a little bit more appraisal on Torosa. We'll have to get back to you on a better answer than that. Maybe we'll get it before the end of this phone call.</p>
          <p>I think, yeah, I'll tell you what they're helping me out a little bit here. It's basically the fuel and flare content of the James Price Point versus other options that we might have had in earlier cases or we just got around to including it because we knew where the option is. I suspect it's more of that case and now that we have a more better definition of what the turbines look like, what the pipelines are, what the offshore needs are for fuel that we've probably just got a more accurate estimate of it. 6% at this point in the study is a number that will probably change in the future actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a couple of questions, if I may. First of all obviously at the moment 404 would appear to be the centre of your exploration at this Pluto 2. Can you just shed some light on how you intend to deal with Hess, 50% stake in discoveries that are made there? Would they &#x2013; would Hess prefer equity in Pluto 2 or would you be buying the gas or tolling their share of the gas? How do you envisage that relationship working?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe we've got a good relationship. I've known the Hess folks for quite a while. Look, their management, John and Greg and the gang were down here. They toured Pluto and stuff. They're going to do the right thing for their company. I can't talk for them at this point. There is contract &#x2013; I would just tell you who are going to bring our gas, which we are, to Pluto and operator I suspect that they'll make up their mind what's best for them. I'm not going to talk for them but if I'm in their shoes I know what I want to do, I want probably talk a little tough but I know where I'm going.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But would you go further to have equity in the project or sell gas to you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I really don't care one way or the other. If there's some other arrangements than what we have, Hess is a big oil company like the rest of us. We all like our equity, and I'm sure that they're going to want to carry equity through. I would be shocked if they didn't. And that would make us just happy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then you talk a lot about accelerating the initial Pluto production to feed a second and perhaps even a third train. Can you talk a little bit about what your current partners in Pluto 1 feel about that given that that gas is contracted to them and do you have to offer them cheap equity in those additional trains so that they keep an exposure to that gas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we've already got our deal with our partners and what their expectations in trains two and three might be and other trains there. We have a good relationship with them.</p>
          <p>As to the acceleration, yes, we've been in discussions with them. We wouldn't tell you that was an option unless we had discussed with them. And I would just say that it's not like we have to give them anything back for that. We clearly have to pay that back but they're going to have an economic uptick by doing that. And they understand that. So it's good business proposition for them. It's a great business proposition for both parties Woodside and our partners.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, and just finally you spent quite a bit of time talking through your fairly bullish outlook for LNG demand. I just wonder it looks versus the guidance that you gave back in May last year that you've actually cut your 2020 demand forecast for LNG by about 10% to 360 million tonnes per year. Can you just talk through the thinking there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We have along with everybody else in the industry and it's basically the lag effect of what the global financial crisis did to the economies in Japan and in Korea. Is basically what I did was &#x2013; it put a hiatus of somewhere between 18 to 24 months in the growth profile. So if you can imagine our continuing growth profile that plateaus a bit and then basically reaccelerates and we're seeing that reacceleration at this time from a bit lower base and what we really thought we were. That will carry through to 2020.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good day, Don. I just have a question on the timing for the Pluto 2 FID. Now I recognized Woodside has been very fast historically but it does seem an aggressive schedule given that you're still in exploration. So I was wondering whether you could break down some of the milestones required to achieve the FID target to help us understand how you might achieve that.</p>
          <p>For example, how long would it take to appraise the discoveries made to date? When do you think you'll have sufficient reserves definition to market the gas to customers and when do you think you'll have that reserves definition in order to start the upstream design in preparation for an FID?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you, Mark. First off, congratulations to you and your new job, good stuff. We look forward actually to working with you at your new company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As to the pace of it, yeah, some people could say that. Looking &#x2013; I would just tell you that people said that about Pluto 1 and Pluto 1 was a greenfield and it was a lot more difficult than a brownfield.</p>
          <p>Let me just say that there is a bit of a stress here. We do want to get in prior to Gorgon if we can. I don't want to go same skill sets versus same skill sets versus Gorgon because there's just not that many skills in Australia. In other words, I don't want to be using civils at the same time Gorgon is. I don't want to be using welders at the same time, et cetera. If we can do that fine, if we can't well that's just the option.</p>
          <p>Different milestones we have to reach are really around the issues of what do we have around Pluto platform, what do we have as excess Pluto 1 gas and what acceleration capabilities we have to allow, it's finding the gas. It's not developing it. In other case, if we can delay Train 2, Train 2, Train 3 of having to have the gas to the platform or to the Burrup, while we develop, properly appraise and develop the fields. That's what's key with those slides I showed you. I think I was on page 41 is that it's very easy now to put incremental gas into a Train 2 or Train 3 to our Pluto platform.</p>
          <p>If we have to build another structure, a TLP out on 404 or out in the other places where we find gas, we aren't absolutely required to have that gas when we start up Train 2. It's really key about how many years out into the future. We can basically stretch Pluto 1, new finds around Pluto 1 or Pluto platform and acceleration gas to allow us to bring it in.</p>
          <p>I doubt if we'd ever build a train on spec. I've said that a thousand times to everybody. But if we find the gas and we know we have multi Tcfs sitting out there that we can develop and bring in at a later date, if we get it in there in 2016, 2017, 2018 then we're just fine and dandy. So that takes a lot of pressure off.</p>
          <p>As to building trains onshore, we're pretty good at building incremental trains. Building a Train 2 or 3 onshore at Pluto will just be like building a Train 4 and 5 at North West Shelf. We've done it. We've done it a lot of times. We've built so much pre-existing infrastructure that Train 2 and 3 are virtually very simple onshore.</p>
          <p>The key thing will be cut off on Train 3 for a new pipeline and new facilities as well as the offshore structures and just drilling the wells. We'll have to find an over abundance of gas, if we don't have it properly appraised. We'll have to have the security that we've got plenty of gas out there that the appraisals will turn up positive. Therefore, the P90s will be important for us to get.</p>
          <p>As to marketing the gas that will come as we take it and that's something that with Woodside when we knock on the doors and say we've got gas and we've got gas in the Carnarvon Basin. I suspect it will be gobbled up pretty fast and we know how to do that pretty well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just one other question if I could. For Pluto Train 2 is the capacity of the pipeline existing or that's being built at the moment to shore, sufficient to take Trains 1, Trains 2 as well as your domestic obligation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, number one is the domestic obligation comes quite a bit later based on the agreement we have with the state of Western Australia. So that's not a consideration at this point. It is a future consideration when we do a pipeline, when we twin a pipeline or build a bigger pipeline coming in for a Train 3, et cetera. We believe that the pipeline we have built out there is very sufficient for the first two trains and that we'll need additional infrastructure past Train 2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and one last one if I could. I appreciate your presentation on the competitive environment in LNG. You did mention you anticipate several LNG FIDs in 2010, but indicated that you'd be losing some sleep if you were managing one of the coal seam projects. Do you anticipate that the coal seam projects will achieve FID this year?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>I just think that they're going to get them up one way or the other. There just seems to be a drive. What we've said all along is that we're pretty happy with our gas out here and we just know how it competes going into Japan and to Korea, et cetera. Liquids, synergies, it's all about basically what price. Anybody can put any price they want on what they assume the future commodities are going give.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Paul Garvey from The Financial Review. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, Don. I just wanted to ask some questions about the new line which has gone to the Pluto timeline today about the schedule being contingent on productive industrial relations environment. Do you think that the IR changes we've seen, especially in the last year or so, has directly contributed to the problems that have been going on at Pluto lately? And what do you make of the government response to the situation up there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First off and let me just say this that we don't have any problems with Australian workers. We rather like them. They're our neighbors next door out here in Perth.</p>
          <p>When we walk around the plant, there's no issues up there. It's just issues. I've said it and I've said it a couple of times, I'm being a little careful here. We aren't 100% sure but we certainly think it was probably organized.</p>
          <p>We also think that, yeah, the IR laws did change. That was a fact of life. It was a mandate from the electorate that work choices be reversed. The question is when you do that, what gaps do you leave? What holes do you leave? What changes? And frankly there is a lot of grey areas, and frankly I would just say, I don't think Woodside got struck. I think it's basically some folks testing the new laws and seeing where and what they could get away with. I have talked to quite a few people that were involved in the strike, and I will tell you, the vast majority of people either went to work &#x2013; about half of them &#x2013; or wanted to go to work.</p>
          <p>And how is the government responding? We are in communication with the government, we're working with them. I would just say that they're going to have to judge on their own what steps they might take. We can sit and suggest a few changes, but you know, we don't make laws and we don't change them here at Woodside. We make suggestions. We're working constructively with them. We're working constructively with all parties, and I would just say that it's like a pendulum. We probably swung it too far one way with work choices. We're concerned maybe we've swung it a little too far the other way. What we need to find is that happy neutral balance out there where everybody is happy.</p>
          <p>Let me just say, we want our worksite safe. We have wonderful accommodations for our folks up there. Let me tell you, I would &#x2013; if I'm renting a room at a hotel, I would like to rent a room like what we give them. And I would just say, the food, almost on call up there; high quality; everything is fine; transportation is best. We care about them. And I would just say that we compensate them very adequately, and I would just say that we expect calming waters. Let me just finally say that you know what's in the past is in the past and we look positively and constructively forward, and we're going to get there.</p>
          <p>You know Pluto, what's going on up there when you take a look at how much we've gotten finished, it's not a high percentage of the work &#x2013; lost time or anything like that. It's just issues we've got to get over. We're looking for a fast construction over the next eight to 10 months to get where we need to get to stay on our timelines, but we did have to indicate to the market we believe that we recognize that there is IR issues floating around Australia right now, and it would be irresponsible for us to have our head in the sand and not acknowledge those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So how sensitive is that schedule? I mean what kind of disruption would push things over the edge on the current timelines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we said is that &#x2013; what we said is we're okay right now, if we have a productive future relationship, which we expect. That's our plan. That's what we said in there that we still are on schedule. But obviously we didn't &#x2013; we lost the eight days, and frankly our productivity during that eight days wasn't what it was if we had a full complement of people.</p>
          <p>But, I've got to tell you, we have a group of people, you would not believe the detail they go into and the different options and scenarios that they offer management to look at the different things that might happen. It's not just IR. There's lots of other issues up there, up in the projects to get done. LNG plants are very complex, and they're hard to build. And, we're pretty good at it, and we've been through this before, and we'll get through it again. We've got a great group of managers here that have been working to, like I said, calm the waters.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Don. It's Di. Just in regards to the Noblige and the Larsen-1, you talked about the pre-drill estimates. Are you able to give us what the pre-drill estimates were for the reserve there?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just say that we do hold those commercially confidential at this time, because not only are there commercial negotiations underway, there's additional open concessions out there and there will be more bidding for concessions out in the area. So, we think we have very competitive information, what we found out there, and our competitive seismic signature and some other things. So what we're doing out there we think is extremely beneficial to Woodside in the future in the Carnarvon Basin and other areas out in Western Australia. So we're very, very loath to give away any of our competitive advantage.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in regards to Pelion, and I know it was only one well out of five that was dry, but was there any particular reason why that was though?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, look, these amplitude bodies that you drill when you're well calibrated, as we are around Martell and Noblige, and Larson now. Most of the time you can pick them, but there's always the occasion where you get a particularly unusual sand or shale over the top of it, that'll give you an odd response. And that was the case at Pelion. We weren't particularly well calibrated there. It looked bright. It looked like it had a reasonable chance of having hydrocarbons, but just occasionally that happens, and that's the exploration business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Coming back to another subject, looking at the LNG price, the average price received for last year it was US$36 a barrel of energy equivalent. If we take out the low priced Chinese contract, you have circa what, the rest of the volumes sold may have achieved?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't split it up like that. But I think as you are well aware the pricing on the China contract is substantially lower than the pricing on the rest of the portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And China itself is accounting for about three million tonnes or so per annum out of North West Shelf's output. So on terms of an average pricing basis, there's no doubt it's a pretty big drag on what would otherwise be quite an upload.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you be able to talk about what sort of indexation you're getting on the remaining contracts that you sell based on the JCC?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, we've got to respect customer confidentiality. We I think have put out some guidance with respect to have the pricing outside the range. Negotiations would uplift those series of contracts, but we are not at liberty to go into anything else.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning and thanks for hosting the call. I've got a couple of questions, firstly of the foundation. Just wondering when the peak construction phase will be completed and when the testing and commissioning will commence? Secondly, in terms of your funding plans for 2010, I'm just wondering what sort of plans you have in terms of asset disposal or debt &#x2013; or equity issuance in preparation for 2011 CapEx? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, first off Mark will handle the second part of the question, I will handle the first. We are in peak construction as we speak at in Karratha on Pluto at this time. We expect that peak construction to continue into the mid-year. We are already starting commissioning in certain issues already. We have over 1,000 systems to commission that don't let everybody be scared to death, some of these systems are pretty small, some are large. It is a Greenfield, so there will be a mixture as we ramp down construction, we will be ramping up commissioning and go to that. As to the 2010 budget, I will turn it over to Mark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's fair to say that if you like at slide 24, it probably says it all. I mean we just got done doing a $2.5 billion rights offering. If you take that, the other two are undrawn facilities which sit almost at a $1.5 billion of their own right. We've got Otway, we're going to get over $700 million in that neighborhood when it closes. So we're sitting quite good. Unfortunately that can effect, we talked about the reason for launching our installment offer back in December as once the governments conditions on Browse became known, we really felt like it was necessary to de-leverage the balance sheet and get ready to go on Browse. So we are happy to say that we are in a position to have done that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will take a couple more questions, but I do have a few announcements to make before we get off the call and I will need to do that at the end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, if I can just jump in and ask a follow-up question. Just wondering in terms of your preparation for 2011 CapEx, what funding plans do you have in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yeah, I mean just to repeat, we are actually sitting on quite a lot of cash and undrawn capacity right now. So that's probably fair to say it's a pretty minor concern out of the list of things that we are worried about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Your next question comes from Matt Chambers from The Australian. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Don. You mentioned you would probably want to see the IR laws toughened up. I'm just wondering what sort of changes you might be suggesting when you go to the government on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, look, I don't want to say too much about it. I'd just say that we understand and we accept the changes in the new laws for IR. We got a good hearing with Julia Gillard, the Deputy Prime Minister; I might just say that she listened. I have a lot of time for her. We had like seven three-hour meetings and normally the Minister will shuffle you off to their staff. She sat in every one of those meetings all the way through them. And we got our say.</p>
          <p>Now am I completely aligned with the way the government thinks about IR? No, clearly not. But I don't think many people in business would be. But we live with what we have. And I would just say it's not the issue of collective bargaining and industrial action doing collective bargaining. We understand that, we accept that.</p>
          <p>But here's the issue, when you've got an agreement, when you've done everything right and you're following the laws of business, we expect the unions to follow the law, too. And we expect that when they have an agreement they come to work. And we had agreements. And these were deemed by the Fair Work Australia to be illegal, by the Federal Courts to be illegal and Julia Gillard put out a statement saying she thought they were illegal. So the point is, gee, it took us eight days to get people back to work in an illegal strike. The area we would like to focus on is, hey, once it's declared illegal, get back to work. These projects are big, big projects and they're massive and they cost a lot of money.</p>
          <p>And so it's kind of like a situation where, gee, it's like a two-year torturous battle to go through courts to pay fines, I guess you would say, for being illegal. It should be a bit different we believe. Look, we play by the rules. We respect the workers. Like I said, we want to adequately compensate them. We want them to be safe on our projects. We just think it's a basic fairness and we are working for basic fairness.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you pretty much would like to be able to &#x2013; or to have immediate sort of sanctions for the illegal behavior?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think I'll let you draw conclusions to my comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one more actually had on Bayu-Undan or Sunrise. The graph you put on where you showed a few projects and they ticked various boxes, it seemed that the Darwin option ticked a lot more than the floating LNG. And is that a good indication of the way Woodside is thinking of the project?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, with due respect to my three partners who are really great and aligned, I promised that we wouldn't show any favoritism until we get to a unanimous agreement. So I am going to have to beg off that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Also, one more. The Alinta deal you mentioned, I know you said you could not talk about price but you referred to some recent WA gas deals. Is that maybe aligned with oil prices or is it set price? Is there anything at all you can give us like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I would just say that you can look up online some of the recent contracts. They are publicly stated. And, yeah, we like them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, Don.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately we have run out of time for any further questions. I would now like to hand the call back over to Don Voelte. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well thank you very much. I have got two announcements, one small one and one pretty large one for me. First off, with the changes in the tax laws you may see some of our managers including myself selling some of our shares. Now we all have been really good at keeping skin in the game but the new law says that when we get shares in we have to pay tax on them. And some of my guys are racking up some really big tax bills. They have got to eat and they have got to have houses and they have got to pay mortgages and they have got to send their kids to university.</p>
          <p>So don't panic. It's not like us. But I think if you ask other companies you are going to see a lot more people, since they are taxed from the point of vesting, there is no ability to put into trust or anything like that. And frankly a lot of us, and I'll just include myself with that, are really getting hit up, which is fine, it's just a way that the law has changed.</p>
          <p>Number two, and this one is a tougher one for me, Mark Chatterji, our Chief Financial Officer, he has really put us in a good place in this company and our financial shape. I will tell you, what he has done for this company can't be overstated. As far as I am concerned, I think everybody in Woodside, including the Board, thinks he is the best CFO in Australia. And I know he has built the best financial team of any ASX listed company and we have really, really increased the skill sets thanks to Mark.</p>
          <p>I would say that I really respect how he has controlled costs and raised capital for Pluto and really put us into good stead. I will also say that he has been really great on the commercial side. He has built good contracts. He has also prevented me from probably doing some bad deals that I would probably do, so he has really been good.</p>
          <p>It's with sadness and happiness I announce that we are going to be losing Mark at the end of the year. He is not going away immediately. But it is sad for Woodside and happy for Mark. Mark has got a growing family and he has got grandparents back in the States and he has got other relatives and he has got friends. He is going to have to get his kids back to where the rest of the family is at.</p>
          <p>Now, when I talked to Mark about joining Woodside in 2004, I think he and I were thinking about three years to come in and clean up some issues and fix some things. As you all know I have worked with Mark before Woodside and I knew he could help me out, and he has exceeded all my expectations. And the idea that he will be here almost six years when he leaves is really beyond my wildest dreams.</p>
          <p>So he is going to leave Woodside and he has made a lasting positive impact on the company and an impact on me personally and as well as the management team. We will be making the announcement of his replacement later on, but I will tell you he has built a lot of people with certain capability to be CFOs and needless to say that we will be looking to fill his internally first.</p>
          <p>So with that, I will turn it over. But I want to congratulate Mark for what he has done. And I just want to say I look forward to working with you in the future. And bottom line is I think that everybody at Woodside will miss you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much for that, Don. And I imagine everybody that my decision to leave Woodside at the end of 2010 comes as a bit of a surprise. Look, while it might sound trite, I can tell you it was not an easy decision. Woodside is a unique story in the oil and gas industry and I have really enjoyed working with the company and the company's management staff over the years. As Don said, when my family and I arrived at Perth in 2004 we really did not expect to stay as long as we have and now it's getting time for us to go back to the United States at the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">

          <p>With that we will sign off on our end and we look forward to seeing a lot of you here in the next couple of days and in the weeks and months to come. Thanks.</p>
