      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our presentation of the first nine months 2008 results. Before going to the numbers let me tell you that I am here with Claudio Machetti who will join me in explaining the liquidity and the deposition of the group, and after that Mr. Fulvio Conti will join us for the Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>Now in the strong set of numbers that I will comment today you will see a robust loss in the domestic and international activities. First, I will take you through our overall financial results, than you will have some specific details on each of our divisions. The annexes will provide with additional relevant details.</p>
          <p>First some financial highlights on chart number three. Group EBITDA increases by 68.6%, driven by the consolidation of Endesa, the solid performance of the domestic operations, and the increased contribution of the other international activities, mainly Slovenske Elektrarne.</p>
          <p>Without the contribution of Endesa, EBITDA grows by 13%, group net income grows by about 86% to almost &#x20AC;5 billion, also due to the effective tax rate decrease, which I will comment in the next chart. Group net debt reduction reflects among others, the completion of the asset stage we're in. Later on I will give better details also on this.</p>
          <p>Now, on chart number four are certain numbers, starting from EBIT down to net income. First, let me tell you that this set of numbers is not taking into account the impact of the Endesa and OGK-5 purchase price allocation, which will be accounted for by year-end. EBIT increases by almost 72% driven by EBITDA improvement. Without the contribution of Endesa, EBIT grows by 12.5%.</p>
          <p>Our net financial charges amount to &#x20AC;2277 million. This is the net effect of the following: First, higher interest charges for &#x20AC;1.6 billion. This is mainly due to the resulting net debt position following the acquisition of Endesa, OGK-5 and Muntenia. The comparison with nine months '07 is affected by the inclusion in the last year's figures of &#x20AC;300 million related to dividend distributed by Endesa. Second, higher income resulting from the fair value valuation of Acciona put option for &#x20AC;17 million.</p>
          <p>Group's tax rate has gone down from about 38% to 10%. Let me be more specific on current tax calculation on chart number five. The purpose of this chart is to reconcile the current tax rate, positively influenced by the one-off impact of deferred back taxes to the normalized tax rate to be taken into account on an ongoing basis. Net of this positive effect, the normalized tax rate in the year 2008 would be around 33%. As already explained in the first half 2008 results presentation, at the end of June we decided to take advantage of a 2008 financial law which provides, by paying a substitute tax, a specific option in order to eliminate temporary differences between the accounting and the fiscal carrying amount of assets that are tax depreciated for extra-accounting purposes.</p>
          <p>The difference between the deferred taxes registered in the past and released to the profit and loss and the above-mentioned substitute tax is equal to &#x20AC;555 million, net of volume taxes on current income for generation and sales activities.  An additional decree issued in August 2008 under the same financial laws allowed us also to eliminate the temporary differences arising from past extraordinary operation in the generation activity for &#x20AC;704 million.</p>
          <p>Now on chart number six, our EBITDA evolution, which shows an increasing EBITDA null of our division. And let's start now analyzing the operating results of the market division in chart number seven. EBITDA totaled &#x20AC;324 million versus 191 of nine months '07; this is the cumulative effect of the following: First, the increase of &#x20AC;100 million in the electricity regulating markets, thanks to the following: &#x20AC;31 million of higher electricity margin due to tariff revision, &#x20AC;31 million of non-recurring items and 39 mainly relating to lower operating costs. Second, the increase of &#x20AC;32 million in the contribution of the free market, mainly thanks to the electricity business.</p>
          <p>In the following chart, let me give you an update on how our energy strategy in particular come forward electricity sales. As far as Italy is concerned, our 2008 domestic production is already 100% hedged, while we are already over 85% hedged for 2009 and 45% on 2010 at an average baseload price equal to &#x20AC;82 per megawatt hour for 2009 and 87 for 2010.</p>
          <p>As far as Spain is concerned, 2008 domestic production is already 85% hedged, while we are already 53% hedged for 2009 at an average baseload price of &#x20AC;62 per megawatt hour. In Slovakia, 2008 domestic production is 100% hedged while we are already 74% hedged for 2009 and 4% on 2010 at an average price of 71 for 2009 and 73.7 per megawatt hour for 2010.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to the Domestic Generation and Energy Management Division on chart number nine. The increase in the generation margin equaled &#x20AC;331 million thanks to the following: &#x20AC;327 million of higher generation margin due to the contribution of higher-unit margin, higher volumes and better generation mix; &#x20AC;3 million volume margin in the ancillary service market, despite a decrease in the related revenues of &#x20AC;120 million. This is the result of the better utilization of our plant portfolio. Additional items are minus &#x20AC;27 million trading activities mainly due to lower volumes, minus &#x20AC;72 million of other items, and lastly &#x20AC;353 million due to capital gain from disposal of some hydro assets to dollar meet the energy.</p>
          <p>Let's now have a quick look at the fuel cost evolution on chart number 10. Net of ancillary service, the unit margin in the domestic thermal generation market is increasing from &#x20AC;25.4 per megawatt hour to &#x20AC;27.4 per megawatt hour. This is the result of our forward sales and commodity aging activities.</p>
          <p>Moving now to chart number eleven, our Domestic Infrastructure and Networks Division. EBITDA totals &#x20AC;2,884 million, representing an increase of &#x20AC;127 million versus nine months '07. This is the result of the following: First, the improvement of &#x20AC;156 million in the electricity business, mainly thanks to higher margin, no recurring items of &#x20AC;134 million, and net cost saving for &#x20AC;50 million partially offset by increase of the early retirement incentive fund by &#x20AC;50, &#x20AC;60million. Second, the decrease of &#x20AC;29 million in the gas business, mainly due to no recurring items posted in 9 months '07, which more than offset the increase in volumes.</p>
          <p>Moving on to chart number 12 on Iberia and Latin America Division. EBITDA totals &#x20AC;3,839 million, representing an increase of more than &#x20AC;3.5 billion there since '07, mainly thanks to the consolidation of Endesa for &#x20AC;3.7 billion. But let me be more specific about the Endesa results on chart number 13. 100% EBITDA totals &#x20AC;5,436 million, representing an increase of &#x20AC;666 million versus last year or plus 14%. This growth has been boosted by a balanced contribution of Iberia and Latin America.</p>
          <p>In particular, in Iberia, growth has been obtained thanks to 72% higher fuel price versus nine months '07, 13% better load factors versus the rest of the market, and the more-efficient commodity cost base 15% lower than the sector, obtained by better generation mix with a greater weight of nuclear and hydro capacity. EBITDA growth of 10% is reported including the negative effects of Royal Decree on fuel cells equal to &#x20AC;363 million.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, higher power prices, improved distribution margin and additional capacity boosted Endesa EBITDA by 21% versus nine months '07, more than doubling the growth path during first half of this year. EBITDA growth of 21% is reported including lower output in Argentina effected by lower rainfall. Due to the recent events in this country we would like to underline the limited exposure we have in terms of net attributable profits in total capital invested. We are talking about less than 1% in most cases. With regards to Synergies Program, the company has already reached 90% of the target for 2008.</p>
          <p>Moving now to chart number 14 on international operations, EBITDA totaled &#x20AC;778 million, representing an increase of &#x20AC;178 versus '07. This is the cumulative respect of the following: A strong contribution of Slovenske Elektrarne for &#x20AC;67 million, in particular, nine months '08 EBITDA of this company equal to &#x20AC;511 million was boosted by higher domestic energy margin and higher volume sold and penalized by negative extraordinary items of &#x20AC;64 million for 2005 tax penalty a fair value of contracts derivatives. Positive results will continue all throughout 2008 since, as already said, 100% of Slovenske Elektrarne outlook has been already sold forward.</p>
          <p>In France we have a positive impact of &#x20AC;56 million, mainly due to higher prices, and in Russia a positive impact of &#x20AC;23 million, mainly due to positive contribution of OGK-5 consolidation for &#x20AC;37 million.</p>
          <p>Before moving on to the following divisions, a quick look at the Russian activities on chart number 15. First, let me remind you that EBITDA has been included in the results since the end of May. In the first nine months 2008, OGK-5 reported an EBITDA of &#x20AC;104 million, that represents a 22% increase on a like-for-like basis versus last year.</p>
          <p>As you can see in the chart, the electricity price net of capacity payment is up by 20% versus last year. This confirms that the liberalization process of the Russian market and the alignment of its prices to the European average level is going on according to the government agenda.</p>
          <p>Moving on to chart number 16, a quick look at the EBTIDA of the Services and Holding area, which stands at &#x20AC;75 million, or plus &#x20AC;44 million versus nine months '07. This is mainly due to the following: First, higher margin on imports for &#x20AC;48 million and some other items for minus &#x20AC;4 million.</p>
          <p>And now on chart number 17, let me focus your attention on renewables. Before moving to comment on the nine months figure, I would like to anticipate that we have redefined the parameter of the renewable division as previously presented in March 2008 by increasing the total capacity of about 1,000 megawatt, thanks to the contribution of further hydro capacity to meet them. EBITDA of these activities, according to the new parameter, totals &#x20AC;824 million with a total production of 12.8 terawatt hours.</p>
          <p>As far as our net debt evolution is concerned, on chart number 18 you'll see that overall, net debt stands at &#x20AC;51.6 billion, including the net debt related to Endesa renewal business. The evolution of the debt level is mainly due to the impact of extraordinary activities and in particular the sale of Endesa Europe and Viesgo assets we own, which counts for &#x20AC;8356 million and the acquisition of a further 22.65% of OGK-5 and Muntenia, which counts for &#x20AC;1224 million. By year-end we confirm that our consolidated net debt will fall below &#x20AC;50 billion.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention and now I will hand over to Claudio Machetti, for an overview of the group's liquidity position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Luigi, and good evening to all of you. In the following two slides I would like to work you through the main deadlines ahead of Enel in the next few years, insulating the Endesa group financial commitment from Enel.</p>
          <p>As you can see from this chart the Enel group without Endesa is sitting on a comfortable liquidity position. Beside the fully outstanding commitment to credit lines set up for the acquisition of Endesa, we can rely on an additional commitment line for a total original amount of &#x20AC;5 billion, which is currently available for approximately &#x20AC;2.6 million at a competitive spread <mark type="inaudible" /> 15 basis points.</p>
          <p>Discounts up to uncommitted lines and to <mark type="inaudible" />, the latter despite rising credit market turmoil, still represents the cheapest source of funding, with an average price of <mark type="inaudible" /> lower than 10 basis points, approximately from 6 to 8 basis points. We have enough <mark type="inaudible" /> to cover our short-term commitments; by the way let me remind you that in last October we have already repaid 1 billion relating to our 10-year public bond issued in 1998. <mark type="inaudible" /> was not significant at maturity until 2010.</p>
          <p>Before turning to a snapshot on Endesa, let me point out that the recent market crunch with its consequences on the interbank market rates and thin spreads has a very limited impact on our average cost of debt, which as you will see in the annexes that include additional details on our Endesa rose to 5.4% from 5.3 as of June this year.</p>
          <p>Turning to end data, liquidity, as you can see, is not an issue besides the approximately &#x20AC;5 billion in cash and cash equivalents mostly coming from the disposal of Endesa Europa and Viesgo. Endesa has an extensive amount of liquidity available, thanks to undrawn committed credit lines for almost 8 billion.</p>
          <p>In addition, under its commercial paper program for an overall amount of 4 billion, Endesa can also rely on 1.8 billion <mark type="inaudible" /> available. Let me now hand over to Fulvio Conti for a few closing remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. I'm sorry, I'm told that my mic went off. I want to repeat some of the concepts, just in case you might have missed what I just said overall. I say that I feel our liquidity position remains strong in both Endesa and Enel. And we're committed to continue efficiency programs that will continue to deliver results, and I would expect to have more than &#x20AC;14 billion of EBITDA at the end of the year. And we'll continue to apply financial discipline to our debt reduction. And would expect to have 50 billion lower and 50 billion net debts at the end of the year. We're also working on prioritizing our CapEx program in a way that we can actually serve that debt reduction mission that we want to achieve.</p>
          <p>Dividends at the same time will remain stable, $0.49 throughout 2012. As far as disposals we continue to work on the high voltage in terms of the grid, and we have just decided, the Board of Directors has decided to launch the process for a majority sake in the low pressure gas networks. And we do expect that an agreement on this might be reached in the early part of next year.</p>
          <p>On the renewables, as you know, we have finally a new division in place, a new entity being incorporated. It will be landing on December the 1st this year. And despite today, it will look feasible, we're confident that by the end of 2009 we will be in a position to place a minority stake to either financial investors or into the market, if conditions will be available.</p>
          <p>In summary, I believe that Enel will continue to perform above expectation and certainly above what we have announced to the market in March of this year. In our future you will see increased performance on an operational basis and a solid liquidity position, which will allow us to support the ongoing business need as well as deliver growth and returns to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Having said all of this, and taking advantage of your presence here, we're now ready to take on any questions you might have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Any questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The first question is from Mr. Gergolet from Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello, good evening. It's Matjia Gergolet from Goldman Sachs. Three questions. The first one, well you talked about dividends for, and remaining stable at $0.49 I would like to know your view also with regards to the dividend of your major subsidiary at the moment, Endesa. I'd basically like to know whether you think that from Enel's perspective, also in light of the liquidity analysis that you have shown us, you think it is in the best interest for Enel to, for Endesa to pay out the special dividend or you prefer to keep Endesa under levered.</p>
          <p>Secondly, just a small thing on the renewables, if I caught it correctly you said that you are still targeting to basically sell &#x2013; sorry, to make an IPO of the renewables during 2009 and confirm that.</p>
          <p>And thirdly just a quick question on the numbers. With regards to the power deficit that you have in Spain could you just let us know where is it booked under the activities, please, and how much is that amount for your share? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay let me handle the first two questions and than I'll hand over to Luigi for Spanish <mark type="inaudible" /> as they call it. Dividends $0.49, I confirm to you that we maintain and carry on with the dividends as a matter of financing, now we are going to pay the interim dividend on November the 24 with the coupon being cut for the November 24 payment of $27.20. We will continue to deploy the dividend policy the way we have announced.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the business potential dividend, we believe that it is appropriate for Endesa to carry on working on a plan for its future five years and before you can see through the plan, it would be not be wise to place any dividends out of any extraordinary dividend out of Endesa.</p>
          <p>For renewables we are considering not only a potential outcome of a flotation in 2009. I stated if the market conditions will not be there, I am also seeking investors who look into our renewables for a minority stake. And there are some which have already expressed their potential interest in taking a minority stake in that company. So it will be either way, if market conditions will be available we'll pursue that floating opportunity. If not, we will definitely take on board any interesting offer coming from a financial infrastructural investors <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Spain, Luigi, would you <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. At the end of September we have in our account more than 100% at &#x20AC;4.7 billion in terms of receivable; a portion of that is referred to the system deficit, for &#x20AC;2.5 billion, and the remaining portion for &#x20AC;2.2 billion is referred to the so-called extra peninsula receivable. Where we show these numbers, when it comes to the deficit receivable, we show the net financial position and the extra peninsula are part of our working capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So just to be clear, so 2.5 billion of the entire deficit are treated as a financial credit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. It is a financial receivable and there is, the remaining portion is working capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Miss Susanna Invernizzi from Lehman Brothers. Ms. Invernizzi, please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good afternoon. I have a few questions. First of all, if you can elaborate a little bit more on your CapEx and maybe giving us a guidance for 2008. And also any of your potential CapEx savings.</p>
          <p>Second, on your production volume, I think I noticed that there were not any major significant changes versus the percentage that you disclosed at the end of the semester. So I was wondering if I'm right and if you are happy with the current volume edge.</p>
          <p>Then a question on your working capital if you can elaborate more on Q3 and also expectation for Q4 if possible? And then lastly, now based on the transfer of Endesa renewable energy to the new accord with Acciona Energia, so when do you expect this to happen, and how are things proceeding? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me ask Luigi to take on the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. When it comes to the first question regarding the CapEx guidance for 2008, I would expect for this year the total amount in the range of 6 to &#x20AC;6.5 billion, which is well below where the couple of billion was when we presented in London six months ago.</p>
          <p>When it comes to your second question, yes, you are right we had just a slowdown in the pace activity in the last quarter. First of all, because August, as you know, is normally a month where you have a slowdown of this type of activities; second we &#x2013; I think we have reached more than 85% of the coverage for 2009 forward sales and 45% for 2010. So I think we are well on track to reach 100% by the year end for 2009. I think it's almost done, and also to be very close to 45% for 2010.</p>
          <p>So we're working with that. I don't know if you had the chance to listen at my explanation. I said that we are selling forward at an average price or base load price for 2009 at &#x20AC;82 per megawatt hour and 87 for 2010. So I think that with this number we should expect that our euro per day margin is going up. Working capital I think was the third question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, at the end of September despite the reported number, which it looks to be lower than 2 billion versus the end of 2007, in reality we have some receivable debt that's still to be collected. And particularly in Italy, we have more than &#x20AC;700 million of regulatory receivable that has to be collected by the end of the year and that is going to affect most likely the fourth quarter. The same is expected to be recovered when it comes to the overdue receivable, mainly the gas field. You might recall that in particular in the first quarter and second quarter this year, we had experienced some problems in finalizing all the invoicing activity which now has been definitely set up. Therefore we expect the cash flow by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>So, we expect at least 1.4, &#x20AC;1.5 billion worth of cash improvement because of the working capital, all in Italy. Then we have to expect an improvement in the working capital in Endesa as well. And of course in the rest of our group. So if you couple this with a reduction in the CapEx I think we are well on track to reach our guidance.</p>
          <p>Fulvo, the fourth question...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, when it comes to the business renewables, both Endesa and Acciona are continue to actively work on the valuation, taking more time than we actually anticipated due to the complexity of the perimeter, the number of countries, the number of projects involved and the due diligence process being carried out; so definitely it's taking longer than expected. But we continue to work on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Yes, good evening everybody. I have just a few questions regarding the domestic generation business. First of all, in the past if I remember correctly, you'll get an indication of the 3.6 billion EBITDA for this year, so, even adding the 320 million for the dummy transaction capital gain, it seems to me that the implied fourth quarter is quite undemanding. So, I'd like to know if this guidance is still valid?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on production 73 <mark type="inaudible" /> in the nine months, what can be a reasonable indication for the full year? And last is about Porto Tolle. I'd like to know if when you think about the prioritization of the CapEx there could be other thinking on that project, and if you have already taken some commitment on that front? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the final question on Porto Tolle. As you know we have full commitment to the project. The only question as usual is to obtain the permitting process ongoing. At the moment we see that some decision will be taken by the authorities involved and the <mark type="inaudible" />, as you know, has to take the final decision sometime during 2009. Therefore I would not see this project to be started any earlier than 2010 and with big money to be spent around 2010.</p>
          <p>That's the fact of life and the results of explaining the reason why we have committed to a level of CapEx, which is lower than what we have announced in March as an overall total. The whole idea is to make priorities, to prioritize our CapEx guidance to make sure that we can deliver things that, from an engineering standpoint, can be delivered and to contribute to EBITDA by prioritizing the early inputs CapEx and EBITDA deliveries as opposed to a longer-term project.</p>
          <p>Based on that Porto Tolle still remains in our horizon; it's expected that it will be a positive outcome by this government during 2009 this will be approved from a permanent standpoint and that CapEx will start flowing towards the end of 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to the other two questions about the EBITDA for 2008 in Generation and Energy Management Division in Italy. Well, of course since we have closed the books at the end of September with &#x20AC;3.4 billion, taking also into account the capital gain we had, that we surely mentioned by the end of the year, we should land at 3.8, &#x20AC;3.9 billion at least.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the production, we expect to reach a level of production of 94, 95 terawatt hours. There might be some changes depending on the hydro condition, but for the time being I think 94, 95 is the right projection.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends also on the seasonality of course, I would say that we're expecting a normal fourth quarter.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good evening everybody. I have a couple of question, the first one regards the debt guidance, the 50-billion debt guidance you give. Does it include any kind of disposal or it's, let's say, organic? The second question is if you can also provide the guidance for 2009 EBITDA as well? And regarding the CapEx issue, have any indication regarding the CapEx also for 2009. And if you're going to, let's say, cancel or postpone some CapEx, which are the less important for you. So the one that you could decide to postpone. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the 50 billion we mentioned in terms of overall indebtedness at the end of the year is without considering any disposal and as we have said so clearly in our position before. When it comes to the EBITDA for 2009, obviously, I will not be leaving this room with you and a number. But I can confirm to you that I'm committed to and I have visibility on the performance of the company our 2009 number for EBITDA will be higher than it will be 2008.</p>
          <p>And the reason we're saying so is because we have good visibility on the revenues, what we're selling, and we have quite a good grip on the cost of commodity oil and therefore it will be higher then 2008 that I obviously don't need to tell you what the number would be on the presentation for the overall plan, based on my word that this will be a better performance.</p>
          <p>When it comes to CapEx guidance I think I mentioned already that we are definitely taking into consideration the real account evolution in the world. And I do expect that the priorities will be given to those strategic organic CapEx that will support the continued growth of our overall income performance in the plan. There will be some postponement, there will be some redirection of our CapEx. I think the 2008 performance can be assumed to be a maximum when it comes to it in terms of overall CapEx. So I guess that spending in particular in 2009, 2010 will be regionally anything between 5 to &#x20AC;6 billion maximum. I hope you're satisfied with my answers.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good evening. Just if you can clarify where the CapEx have been cut so we have chart the major difference the major project that has been postponed? And actually, if you can just give us here a view what happens if Acciona decided to put option and if you are not able to sell the assets, then which is your plan B in this case? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>When it comes to the real question about Acciona, I don't see this item to be in the agenda, <mark type="inaudible" /> so I won't be able to answer the question. When it comes to the CapEx program and profile, I think I mentioned in the previous answer that we are selecting those organic growth CapExes that will be instrumental to deliver during the plan the EBITDA growth that we gave to you, that if we can achieve, and this would be in all areas.</p>
          <p>And you just heard me saying that we are delaying not because we want to delay but we've been delayed by the process of permitting, the Porto Tolle project, just to give you an idea. This is the kind of action. We're working on that right now, and you will see the deployment of our CapEx of 5 to &#x20AC;6 billion maximum during the presentation for the long-term plan.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Three questions if I can, please. First of all, looking at slide 21, you expect &#x20AC;5 billion from asset disposals; could you provide a split of this number and does it include renewables? Secondly, clarification on page eight, where you mentioned in your comment the volume sold ahead for Spain. In 2010, I didn't catch what the average price, I think 62 for 2009 but didn't catch 2010. And finally on Endesa, when do you expect to approve the business plan and can we consider here a cut of the 6 billion of CapEx for non-organic growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well of course Endesa's part of our consolidation, and CapEx prioritization will be fact of Endesa's plan as well. I keep saying that there is no need for approval of the plan that has been effectively approved by the finance committee and that has been actively implemented by Endesa. So we're speaking about, really, a holistic approach that I keep saying this over the last few months, and see no reason to repeat my previous comment on that.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the breakup of the 5 billion I think we're speaking here of high voltage and the distribution of gas that we would expect to have anything between 2.5 and 3 billion and we expect to be able to get anything between three and hopefully a renewables minority considering the asset performance size of the renewable basis all together. But we're being prudent and conservative; we are only giving 5 billion in total just to give you guidance on both sides and to make sure that we can deliver.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to the last question &#x2013; well, actually you have not heard because I have not said that what was the forward sales for 2010. I can give...we are talking about 15 to 20% of forward sales in Endesa for 2010...</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, and good evening. Javier Suarez from Dresdner. Three questions if I may. The first one is on the reduction that you have mentioned on the CapEx plan, I follow-up after some of my colleague's questions. I was wondering if you can give us an indication on the effect that this is going to have on the EPS of the company, the EPS growth of the company at 2000, 2012. And you have gave the guidance that the dividend up to 2012 is going to be one payment. I was just wondering which is going to be the effect of these degrees on the CapEx, on the EPS of the company, which is your view at the current time.</p>
          <p>Second question is on your view on the evolution of the cost of debt of the company going forward. I'm interesting to see which is the number that you have on your business plan, for your cost of debt evolution in the period 2009-2012. And also, I'm interested to know your view on the breakdown between the fixed and variable borrowing going forward. Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the CapEx, I'll try to repeat what I just mentioned before. I tried to convey the message that we will be prioritizing Enel's organic growth, CapEx required to maintain any level of growth in our EBITDA performance. And I think, therefore, right now I see no difference guidance &#x2013; no different guidance to be given in terms of EPS and that's why I think the dividend commitment can be confirmed comes to cost of debt evolution of fixed and variable <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the fixed rate, that represents approximately 55% of the total and the total of course, the remaining 45. Add the cost of debt, we are at 5.4%. Personally, I think we are basically at the peak because due to the decline trend of UI growth in the next quarters we will see a decline &#x2013; a decline in cost of debt. Going to what we put in the business plan for 2009 and '10, we are approximately at 5.5, 5.6. Consider that not the majority but the total debt <mark type="inaudible" /> had been done when the credit spreads were very, very low considered that the <mark type="inaudible" /> dropped approximately 30 basis points over the <mark type="inaudible" /> so very far from present levels.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening everybody. Three questions if I may. One is related to slide 17 on the renewables if you can give us the other breakdown on the capacity and the EBTIDA between Italy and the rest of the world.</p>
          <p>And I wondering if the new parameter target was a revisitation of the target in terms of capacity, the 7.4 gigawatt that you have for 2012. A second question is related back to Porto Tolle, if you can elaborate a bit on the profitability that now you expect on this plant considering that the conditions in the coal markets are now quite different than when the decision on the investment was taken.</p>
          <p>And third question is related if you can update on the timing that you expect for the stage of the electricity and gas grid, and particularly if Turner is still in discussion for the position of <mark type="inaudible" /> you are looking somewhere else at the moment? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start with the last question. I do believe that Turner has asked the staff to temporary stop to accommodate the financial turmoil consideration into their picture, as this will be just a temporary stop and both activities can be resumed based on the easening of the financial conditions. I don't want to give you the idea that tomorrow we will be signing the agreement but definitely we would like pursue that in good spirit with them. And I don't see them, you can ask them directly, not more interested, I still see them interested.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Porto Tolle, I do believe that the Project Coal, I support the critical coal technology in the north of Italy is still very much attractive. The dark spread of the coal plant is still very positive. We think we can really plan on that basis. The only question is when we are going to get the full permitting for that. We've been starting for a number in months, and years, and we do expect that to be again, possibly, fully permitted by the regular authorities in 2009 with the first project yards being prepared for 2010 and major expenditures starting from that moment onward. It makes still a lot of sense to have that plant available and the plant and sale of <mark type="inaudible" /> the years to come. When it comes to renewal break-up let me ask Luigi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Sure, when it comes to the capacity, out of the 4,200 megawatts, 2,500 are in Italy and the remaining 1,700 of course outside of Italy. When it comes to the EBITDA out of the &#x20AC;800 million reported at the end of September, &#x20AC;600 million is coming from Italy. Then when it comes to the technology breakdown, I think here in the chart are the breakdown for each type of technology.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. It's Chris Moore from RBS. Most of my questions have been answered now, but just two quick ones if I can. In the generation performance you outline on page nine, you talk about the margin up by &#x20AC;331 million. Can you give us some flavor as to how much the hydro has contributed to that, and maybe talk about where reservoir levels are for quarter four?</p>
          <p>And the other question goes back to coal. I think that you said that spark spreads are pretty good right now, you've got the first delivery at Tor de Viellega and yet it looks as though at the moment that your load factors in coal are pretty low. Could you talk about that and where you see them going with Tor de Viellega running up to speed into next year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, starting from your first question. Yes, you're right, the contribution of our generation margin for the first nine months, has been of &#x20AC;331 million, out of that &#x20AC;230 million is coming from an improvement of our unitary margin, which is mainly driven by I would say the thermo electrical basis, where we report an increased net margin of more than &#x20AC;2 and the remaining 82, &#x20AC;90 million is coming from the contribution of the renewables.</p>
          <p>Then we have an additional &#x20AC;100 million of higher volumes, which are mainly driven by the hydro. So I would say that the variance out of this &#x20AC;330 million is driven, for &#x20AC;200 million, by the renewal field of the business.</p>
          <p>I think your second question regarded the impact of the coal regeneration and therefore of the starting operation coming from next year of this new power plant. On a normalized basis, which means on a full year, we should expect that this plant will contribute in terms of additional EBITDA to account for more than &#x20AC;300 million on an annual basis.</p>

          <p>Hi, good evening, three questions actually. Two on debt and one on the CapEx if I can follow-up on the question already asked.</p>
          <p>So on the debt side if you can reconcile demonstrated as you expect until 2010 so, about 15.7 billion of debt would be, on slide 21, in particular what would be the potential usage of credit lines elements? And the second one on the debt, you mentioned 5 billion asset disposals, and if I have understood correctly, you include in this the renewable unit, is that, I mean that you might be willing to sell the grid assets below regulatory asset based value? And the third question is regarding CapEx you have highlighted tonight, as if I understood it correctly, 6.5 billion potential for this year 2008, and 5 to 6 billion CapEx for '09 and 2010. My question is is, this decrease in guidance in any shape or form to a potential decrease in capital cost that we've seen since the commodities are actually declining down and potential of renegotiating, I mean, terms with the supplier? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Well on this last comment, yes, there is an element of lower cost of our new equipment. If you want to see the dramatically reduced cost of cost of steel and other materials will be part of it. We still don't see it, of course this might be going through the pipeline of issued projects and we feel encouraged by that.</p>
          <p>The cost reduction that we &#x2013; sorry, the CapEx reduction that we were commenting here is amidst scheduling of our commitment to organic growth in relation to changed condition of real economies in all the countries where we are living. If the economies are slowing down, there is no need to accelerate investments. So we will be prioritizing the investment portfolio to accommodate the real need of incremental capacity of those countries where we are going to have obviously a small deal of work.</p>
          <p>And if there will be additional positive impact on the cost of the equipment because of the raw materials being lower this will add to our reduction of CapEx. Final comment about it, that I already made to all of you, that we will be selecting those CapEx to go on based on the fully, maintenance of full adherence to our five years' plan EBITDA performance. So it's a matter of achieving the ones that can deliver EBITDA in a period and moving forward with the ones that will go to the next period. Preparing for better economic climate conditions altogether. And I hope this answers all of your questions again on the same subject. And I will ask Claudio Machetti to answer it.</p>

          <p>Yes. As you can see the maturity in 2010, we have to keep on &#x20AC;8 billion of which 10.8 referring to the <mark type="inaudible" /> and the remaining portion coming from different sources of debt and other facilities. The &#x20AC;11 billion that we've mentioned in slide 21 are net of the debt expanding from time-to-time.</p>

          <p>Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question is from Mr. Gandolfi of UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, Good evening it's Alberto Gandolfi of UBS. It's three mostly follow-ups. Just when you explain the liquidity line, credit lines, I think, I count almost 20 billion putting together Enel plus Endesa at 100%. And you mentioned that 2.6 billion of those have a pre-agreed to spread over <mark type="inaudible" /> of I think 15 basis point I wrote down. So, can you actually say how much of the rest has already being locked in terms of spread, credit spread? And also can you comment on what's your logic for using those credit lines. Because I'm hearing more and more from credit people that these are normally used as a last resort &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
          <p>Second question, with marginal cost of debt of some of your peers at 8.5% in the last issuances, do you feel any pressure from rating agencies and do you feel that to keep your single of 18 at 3.5 times of EBITDA is not anymore sufficient? So should we change the par amount as well, in the way we think?</p>
          <p>And last question is about the Italian generation market. For next year 2009, given you have a pretty good visibility, could you disclose what you have for your budgeting for ancillary services in million euros? And could you give us an indication of the dark and the spark spreads that you are expecting, or you just can give us the fuel cost in coal and gas if you, if that's easier? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think for the ancillary service you'll have to bear with us, but we will not be telling to you what the number is. We are living in a competitive market. Alberto &#x2013; to give you an indication on the microphone for anybody else to listen, so please bear with me. Different things with dark spread, is something that we have really put on the wire. So, I'll ask Luigi to give you that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we should expect for the coming year, basically spark spread and dark spread at least for us in-line with what we have now. Now we have a clean spark spread of &#x20AC;27.5 per megawatt hour. We have a clean dark spread, for instance, of power plants like <mark type="inaudible" /> which is coming in, of at least 38, &#x20AC;40 per megawatt hour assuming a Q2 cost of &#x20AC;23.5 per ton and assume a level of the break the region of 100.</p>
          <p>Anyway, thanks to the forward sales, as I said, I think that this margin and this stock spreads are locked in and therefore minimal. Then I think you had a couple question regarding credit lines and I turn it over to Claudio.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, let me make a few comments on the commercial paper program because as you probably know we have &#x20AC;4 billion of commercial paper program. There are a lot of discussion in the market concerning the interest of the investor towards the commercial papers. I have to say that for Enel, it is still today a very interesting funding tool with the cost of very cheap. The cost of commercial paper is a reliable plus 5 to 10 basis points, and I have to say that even in the most difficult period of the recent market, this market remained open for us. I can say that in the last month of October, we issued &#x20AC;1.04 billion of commercial paper and just to make a simple comparison, in last June we issued &#x20AC;1.2 billion, that is to say that the debt of October was higher than the debt of June. And there's no seen the week in which we didn't issue any commercial paper.</p>
          <p>So no issues concerning commercial paper. Going to the credit lines, today I can say that we have approximately &#x20AC;4.5 billion of credit lines available, in addition, other 2 or &#x20AC;3 billion in discussion. The average cost of the credit lines of Enel are very low; of course I have to say that the most recent &#x2013; the most recently initiated credit facilities I mean in the last two months, the cost is higher. It is in the range of 100 basis points over LIBOR.</p>
          <p>Going to the agencies, the agency paying to be with us in the first half of 2008 we discussed in depth the situation of Enel has been explained, and they concentrated mostly on FFO coverage and FFO total debt. And they are satisfied, in fact they confirmed the A9, A2, A9 very recently, we're in touch with them to discuss with this agency. Again, no problem because the facilities available were continuously sufficient.</p>

          <p>I assume that there aren't any questions left over on the table. I have a technical comment all of your voice were coming to us, very weak with exception of Chris Moore who I should congratulate as it's the only question that was loud and clear. Maybe you want to double check on your technical features. I heard my voice and our colleague's voice relatively clear and that you had all the answers you want. Keep supporting us, and thank you for your patience. See you next time.</p>
