        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and welcome to the Westpac's Full Year 2010 Results Announcement. My name is Andrew Bowden. Thanks for joining us, whether be here in person or on the Web.</p>
          <p>Presenting this morning will be Gail Kelly, our CEO and Phil Coffey, our CFO. And as per usual practice we'll run through the presentation of the slides this morning and then we'll open up for questions.</p>
          <p>So, without further ado let me invite Gail Kelly to start proceedings. Thanks, Gail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Andrew, and good morning everyone those of you here in person and those of you who are listening in by the way of telephone. Welcome to you all. And I certainly realize it was only a month ago that we were actually here together discussing the productivity and IT initiatives, but today of course is our full year 2010 results. And I have all of my team here to help take questions, any questions that you may have after the conclusion of our presentation and George Frazis who is on the phone from New Zealand.</p>
          <p>So let me start with the key messages from the result. 2010 has been another challenging year, and I am pleased with our performance. This is a strong, high quality result. We've made a number of strategic choices over the past few years that have driven this performance. During 2010, we have in a very focused way improved the sustainability of our earnings, and put the business on an improved footing.</p>
          <p>Starting with customers, this is the year we implemented enterprise-wide reductions in exception fees across both business and personal customers, across all brands, in both Australia and New Zealand. We remained open for business throughout the crisis and we have intensified our focus on key relationship segments and grown market share in chosen areas.</p>
          <p>In home lending, we've materially strengthened the contribution of proprietary channels over third-party channels. This year has been further significant investment in our people, in our multi-brand distribution platform and in technology.</p>
          <p>Our multi-brand platform was made possible by St. George merger, which has proved to be a highly successful strategic decision. It has provided us with an exciting point of differentiation in our local market.</p>
          <p>We've enhanced our wealth platforms where BT and Asgard together rank number one in market share and number one in share of new business flows. We further embedded wealth into our distribution business with great traction occurring in Super for Life and insurance products sales.</p>
          <p>We've materially strengthened our capital position and the quality of our funding. We've lengthened the tenure of our short and long-term funding and we focused on retail deposit gathering. This of course has come at a cost as can be seen from the margin outcomes for the year.</p>
          <p>A feature of the year for us and a highlight has been the lower impairment charge, and I would like to pause and reflect on this just for a moment. Across any major credit risk management metric or ratio, the Westpac Group comes in at the number one position. We came into the crisis in good shape. We managed our way through with less impact to the bottom line than others and we've emerged more quickly and more strongly. Our ratio of impaired charges to average gross loans comes in at 0.30 and is lower than our peers. And our provisioning coverage to credit risk weighted assets at 1.46% remains sector-leading. I dwell on this because not only do we have further upside here, but what it says about us is that we are a lower risk, higher quality business with a consistency that investors can rely on.</p>
          <p>Finally on dividend, you will have seen with our final dividend of $0.74 we have restored our dividend growth path. As a half yearly dividend this is a new high.</p>
          <p>Looking at the numbers, a 21% increase in earnings per share to $1.978 is a strong performance. Return on equity is a healthy 16.1%, which is a pleasing outcome given the additional goodwill we picked up with the St. George merger and our stronger capital base.</p>
          <p>Cash earnings comes in 26% higher and reported net profit after tax is a very strong outcome boosted by the tax consolidation related to the merger. Core earnings are down 1% this year, perhaps not surprising given the 19% uplift last year and the rebasing of revenue that has occurred during 2010. I've already referred to our performance with regard to impairment charges and our expense-to-income ratio, while up on last year, remains an important comparative advantage.</p>
          <p>Looking at the portfolio of businesses, we see a remarkably strong outcome and uplift from our high quality Institutional Bank, and material improvements for BT Financial Group and Westpac New Zealand. Our Australian Retail and Business Banks have taken the brunt of the rebasing of customer fees and of the higher funding cost environment. St. George earnings were unchanged year-on-year with Westpac Retail and Business Bank down 8%.</p>
          <p>On Westpac Retail and Business Bank it's worth recalling that the business was a stand-out performer in 2009, partly because of its credit quality and so it's not had the decline in impairments that other business units have benefited from. It's underlying momentum is pleasing. It has grown market share in home lending and retail deposits.</p>
          <p>It's grown its customer numbers and strengthened its products per customer. Its customer retention is at pleasingly high levels as is its employee engagement. Overall, it is a business that has to had to adjust to a new funding environment, absorb fee cuts while position itself for the future.</p>
          <p>On Westpac New Zealand, I'm pleased to say that we have a real turnaround in performance occurring. While the economic recovery is slow, we have renewed momentum in our franchise with a reinvigorated network and much strengthened risk management focus. We are winning market share in target segments, both household and business, and margins are starting to improve.</p>
          <p>A key theme for the Westpac Group is, of course, sustainability. Across all elements of business, our people, our customers, our engagement with the community, this is something we focus on. And in our 2010 year we've done a number of things to improve the sustainability of our earnings. This slide points to a few. Firstly, and I've already mention this, the 300 million reduction in customer fees. We've gone further on this front than many and have effectively rebased our customer fee revenue line.</p>
          <p>The year has also seen a rebasing of markets and treasury income, down almost 500 million from last year's extraordinary year, and now effectively at a more sustainable level. On productivity, we provided some insights into our approach a few weeks ago. We are underway with this and have a growing trajectory of savings and benefits to come.</p>
          <p>And as the bottom right slide shows, we've quietly gone about restructuring a few of our businesses. In particular, we have largely closed our Structured Finance business, and the book is running off. The turnaround in the Equities business has also been a success story. This is a small business that last year made a 95 million loss. It is now being restructured and refocused, and this year contributed 93 million. Further, within WIB we have existed property funds management.</p>
          <p>Finally, we have managed our commercial property portfolio back down to levels we were at prior to the merger, at 7.7% of TCE and 9% of lending.</p>
          <p>The year has been a busy in terms of focus on customers. And in the light of a challenging funding environment, we particularly focused on key segments, those where we can build deep relationships, relationships that last. We have worked hard in increasing the number of customers with four or more products, in both Westpac and St. George. And retention levels have remained very high.</p>
          <p>We have also put a particular focus on driving stronger productivity out of our proprietary channels and I am delighted by the significant increase in the percentage of home loans coming through our first party channels, up 10 percentage points. In our Westpac brand, 71% of home loans come through our own channels, and at St. George, 62%.</p>
          <p>On complaints management, we have made excellent progress this year. Total complaints in Westpac are down by 55%. And I am pleased to say we have made gains in actually removing the underlying source of the issues. That has been aided by our much improved technology environment with severity 1 incidents down 95% over three years.</p>
          <p>One of the success stories over the year has been BT, a strong performer with an excellent platform for growth. Significant merger work has occurred in this business over the past two years, yet the franchise has not missed a beat.</p>
          <p>On the distribution front, we have an extensive network of financial advisors, firstly within our Westpac and St. George distribution businesses also through our Securitor and Magnitude advisor groups, and finally, through independent advisor channels. In light of the strengths in distribution, we are capturing more than our natural share of new business flows, consistently one in every three or one in every $4 of platform flows.</p>
          <p>Our BT Super for Life product continues to power ahead. It has now surpassed the 1 billion mark in funds under management. This is a truly innovative, very easy to sell, easy to understand product that breaks down the barriers between banking and wealth. It is also very well aligned with regulatory change. Insurance has had a strong performance with excellent cross-sell in both Westpac and St. George.</p>
          <p>Turning to our capital and funding. From a Tier 1 capital point of view, we finished the year at 9.09, up 98 basis points from a year ago. Our common equity ratio at 7.5% sets us up well for regulatory changes in the pipeline and Phil will talk more to this.</p>
          <p>From a funding and liquidity point of view, this has been a big year. We raised 43 billion in wholesale funding and in doing so we materially extended the term of this funding, so ensuring a balanced maturity profile into the future. We reduced the percentage of short term wholesale funding and even within that category we extended the average duration. We grew our customer deposits by 13 billion, or 5%, and our overall stable funding ratio improved at 80%. All this has meant rising costs and we can see the effect of this in our margin.</p>
          <p>Not surprisingly, a very big focus for us over the past two years has been the St. George merger. I'm pleased to say that after incredible effort across the organization, this is largely complete, almost a full year ahead of initial expectations. From an operational point of view, all the key milestones have been achieved, all on time and within budget.</p>
          <p>On the benefits side, we are ahead with expense synergies 28% higher than we had planned at this point. Revenue benefits are also tracking ahead of plan. While our business case allowed for the expected 4% customer attrition, we set ourselves a goal of not suffering any customer loss and we've delivered on this. In fact, we've grown customer numbers consistently over the past two years.</p>
          <p>We have this year also extended the product range available to St. George customers, including BT Super for Life insurance products and our new Amplify rewards card. Overall, we are truly delighted with this merger. It has materially assisted us in the transformation of the Westpac Group and has set us up with a multi-brand strategy, offering customers choice. There is much more in terms of potential to come.</p>
          <p>I'd like to pause for a moment and just take the opportunity to acknowledge Greg Bartlett. As CEO of St. George, Greg has steered the bank through the merger and ensured the unique St. George positioning of being both big enough and yet small enough has been further embedded. After 28 years of being in the bank and 18 years on its Executive Committee, Greg heads off onto a well-earned retirement at the end of this month.</p>
          <p>So to finish on dividends, it is pleasing to announce our $0.74 final dividend, which is up 23% on the second half 2009 dividend and is in fact a record level for the half. For the year, our total dividend is $1.39. The payout ratio for the full year is 71%.</p>
          <p>So to sum up, we've delivered a high quality result for 2010. As I have discussed, we used the year to further strengthen the franchise, to steadily implement our customer-centric multi-brand strategy and to ensure that we have the capacity in our balance sheet for future growth.</p>
          <p>We have a strong and stable team and a culture that rewards collaboration and accountability. And for this year and the next, we are raising the bar in terms of delivery. There is a lot more to be done.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Phil, and the conclusion of his presentation I will return just to make some brief remarks on the outlook.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks, Gail, and good morning, everyone. Our full year financial results for 2010 like all years have their specific elements and I will cover those today, looking at both the full year and the second half outcomes.</p>
          <p>Let me start by looking at the performance trends over the past three years given the volatility and the disruption that we've experienced. It's very pleasing to have achieved healthy compound growth rates in cash earnings and in core earnings. And core is the term that we use to describe revenue less expenses.</p>
          <p>As well whilst we had some sizable swings in statutory reported results, both from the major and from tax impacts, the growth picture over the past three years is also very strong. And you see that in the capital picture, which I will touch on later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>Looking at right hand side of this slide, it highlights our cash earnings performance has also largely translated into earnings per share. The full period impact of our share issuance in early 2009 still had some impact on annual growth rates. But other than some dilution from issuing undiscounted shares to satisfy the DRP, the earnings per share have not been dampened and that's obviously important in terms of how we set the dividend.</p>
          <p>As we flagged at the first half a 25% increase in cash earnings was a difficult act to follow. And our second half earnings were largely flat on the first half down 1%. Impairment charges were the key feature of both halves and therefore the key feature of the full year result.</p>
          <p>There are a number of moving pieces in the components of the result and starting with interest income, and the balance sheet saw a good volume growth over the year in mortgages and in household deposits, with growth ahead of the banking system in both those key metrics.</p>
          <p>Growth in mortgages did slow during the year as we had foreshadowed and we've emphasized distribution through our own enhanced retail networks and we've wound back the use of third-party brokers. Aggregate business lending was lower over the year and it was recently consistent half on half. Our decision to reduce exposure to commercial property reduced loans by $7 billion and that accounted for two-thirds of that business decline.</p>
          <p>A further $3 billion was from lower outstanding to financial institutions, mostly in securitization facilities that we were rolled out into the public bond markets. Customer deposit growth was slightly stronger in the second half and a fully funded lending in the half.</p>
          <p>The segments spilt for deposit is important and we saw strong growth in the Westpac Retail and Business Bank where deposits were up 10% and in St George with deposits up 7%, while the Westpac Institutional customers ran down their deposits.</p>
          <p>The margin picture is shown in this slide, now I want to highlight a few points. In the left chart, we've shown the margin outcome distinguishing between our total margin and that excluding the volatile element coming from our Markets activities. We've also shown the quarterly results for 2010. And I wouldn't normally highlight perspectives to margins, but given the size of the swings that we saw through the year, I think this helps explain the underlying picture.</p>
          <p>Importantly, as we expected the rate of decline in margins excluding Markets eased in the second half and our margin at the end of the fourth quarter was about 2 basis points rather than at the end of the second quarter when we exclude Markets.</p>
          <p>The chart on the right-hand side highlights the drivers of the decline over the year. And we have moved to show these excluding our internal transfer pricing impacts and hope this will assist your analysis. The chart shows that cost of funding pressures reduced margins by 26 basis points over the year, 15 basis points from deposits and 11 basis points from wholesale. And this has been partly offset by assets repricing, which has recovered 21 basis points of margin.</p>
          <p>Within deposit costs, 4 basis points was due to the mix impact of more deposit growth in higher rate term deposits and online savings accounts, while 4 basis points was due to the impact of hedging our low rate balances and others call that their replicating portfolio. Lower interest income from our Markets activities in Institutional Bank and Treasury further reduced margins by 6 basis points over the year.</p>
          <p>Our non-interest income performance has been impacted by two significant headwinds. Firstly, the reduction in customer exception fees and you can see that on the slide in the dark gray bars on the chart. As Gail mentioned, we have reduced fees on a broader range of products and across both consumer and business customers compared to our peers. And we are confident this is the better approach. However, it has reduced income and the full year impact across all brands and in Australia and New Zealand was $298 million.</p>
          <p>The second headwind was the natural winding back of Markets income as volatility eased from the extraordinary levels that we saw at the end of 2008 and through 2009, and the trading income component over the full year was down $217 million. Growth in wealth income and other fees helped offset these headwinds. Other fees were up 7% over the year and wealth income was a strong 21% higher.</p>
          <p>Fishing out the total Markets results in a bit more detail shows that customer-related revenues saw good growth, and the second half result was up 14% compared with the previous half and 21% over the prior corresponding period. Nevertheless, volatility has reduced quite a bit and you can see that in the VaR measures for both Markets and Treasury. They are significantly low, almost half the levels of the first half of 2009. And this has reduced the potential for risk management income. In total, Markets and Treasury income was 205 million lower in the half and 479 million lower over the full year.</p>
          <p>There does tend to be a correlation between impaired assets and Markets income and in 2009 with deteriorating economic conditions, more uncertainty and higher market volatility, we recorded higher impairment charges but also higher Markets income. In 2010 as conditions reversed course, so have these two P&amp;L lines, with lower Markets income and lower impairment charges. Whilst it is difficult to forecast, our Markets results appear to have reached a more sustainable level from which to grow.</p>
          <p>I want to touch on the performance of two of our key divisions, that of the Westpac Institutional Bank and Westpac Retail and Business Bank and I think that will benefit from some more detail.</p>
          <p>The WIB result was a stand-out. Obviously, the significant reduction in impairment charges was the biggest driver of the better bottom line and that in turn highlights the underlying quality of the WIB loan book. However, we shouldn't lose sight of the top line and revenue growth of 7% and core earnings growth of 10% over the year is very pleasing given the decline in markets income I just spoke about. The continuing growth in our transactional business, good management of our debt market risks and recoveries in equity and Hastings businesses all contributed to the WIB result.</p>
          <p>The WIB loan book decline was the major factor behind our business line negative growth. Within that book, more than half the decline is due to the reshaping of the portfolio. We've wound back our commercial property exposures, allowing capital raisings, cash flow and asset sales for our customers to flow through to lower exposures. And that reduced WIB loan balances by $3.7 billion over the year.</p>
          <p>At the same time, as capital markets began returning and support of by the AOFM we rolled off mortgage securitized exposures out of the bank's warehouse into the market. And that's the appropriate operating model for these exposures. WIB is the lead arranger in Australia for domestic bonds and securitized assets over 2010. Our WIB loan book reduced by $3.3 billion over the year due to this activity.</p>
          <p>So de-gearing of non-property corporate Australia was material and accounted for a rundown of business lending of $5.7 billion, but that was only 40% of the overall decline in the WIB book.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we expect this declining trend to have run its course. WIB is a healthy pipeline of borrowing intentions and we would expect positive growth over the course of 2011.</p>
          <p>Our Westpac Retail and Business Bank division recorded a drop in earnings of 8% over the year, but was 1% better in the second half. The drop in exception fees for this division of $182 million was the major drag on earnings over the year and lower credit card loyalty fees also contributed to a year-on-year reduction in income. This business though does have good momentum, flowing from the Westpac local investment. Loan and deposit growth continues at or better than system.</p>
          <p>In the mortgage area this is really pleasing given the winding back that has taken place in terms of third-party origination. It reflects excellent and improved customer retention and relationship referred new business and ultimately this will be reflected in relatively better margins.</p>
          <p>Customer number growth in aggregate has been good and there has also been an enhanced focused on earning more business with existing customers. 30% of the Retail and Business Bank customers now have four or more products with the bank. And this includes business customers and yes in each segment, especially customers with facility between 1 and $5 million which is a specific area of focus for us. Loan growth of 6% to this segment over the year and the Business Bank of Year award indicate the Westpac local focus is delivering.</p>
          <p>Expenses continue to be well managed and accommodated quite a large investment program. Investment in distribution capability, the Westpac local initiatives, and in St. George expanded footprint increased expenses over the year by $129 million. Across the Group we opened 26 new branches and 85 additional ATMs.</p>
          <p>We've also increased the investment in our strategic technology priorities assets and in compliance requirements and other projects and that added 182 million to expense growth. And these increases were mostly offset by additional merger synergies. We have had some one-off increases, the $20 million grant to the Westpac Foundation, and additional restructuring costs, which were also $20 million higher in the second half, and we've taken those items above the line.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, the overall expense growth was kept to 3%. Our cost-to-income ratio lifted to 41.2% for the full year and was 42.4% in the second half although this lift had more to do with the revenue headwinds I've mentioned. Nevertheless, we continue to operate with a significant efficiency advantage over our peers with the cost-to-income some 400 basis points better than the average of those peers and we aim to retain that through our productivity initiatives.</p>
          <p>It's interesting, there seems to be a lot less market focus on credit health these days and I guess that goes to show analyst optimism regarding the Australian economy. For the Westpac Group, our broadest indicator of credit health is our stressed exposures. And you can clearly see from this chart that the aggregate picture has stabilized over the year.</p>
          <p>Within the total, we are still seeing a drift down in credit ratings with watch list exposures actually reducing as some facilities deteriorate to substandard or impaired and they weren't replaced fully by new problems. However, the deteriorating credits have generally already been recognized and the requirement for additional provisioning is reducing.</p>
          <p>The bulk of our impaired assets also had security, which underpins the risk of loss. The amount of new and impaired assets at a less than $3 billion for the 2010 year is down from 4 billion in 2009 and compares with over 5 billion for each of our peers.</p>
          <p>So you feel pretty good about the relative credit health of our portfolio. And our provisioning coverage remains scintillating, with collective provisions to credit risk weighted assets at 146 basis points. That allowed a small $49 million reduction in our economic overlay at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Our capital position is also very healthy with a Tier 1 ratio now over 9% and up 98 basis points over the year and our core Tier 1 or common Tier 1 ratio of 7.5%. Organic capital generation was very strong at 86 basis points for the year. We benefited from 42 basis &#x2013; in terms of 42 basis points from the St. George merger related impacts. And that helped to offset some sizable other negatives, including the impact from increased deferred tax assets. That deduction is mostly from higher impairment provisions and FX impacts, and that meant that Tier 1 was down 9 basis points. There was additional defined benefit deduction, we're down 6 basis points from that impact, and higher software capitalization down 7 basis points. I'd call it a number of the deductions a lot to be timing issues only.</p>
          <p>We are also very well placed to meet the Basel III capital requirements as we understand them today. And the chart highlights that in two ways. Firstly compared to the current FSA calculation our Tier 1 ratio would equate today to 12.6%.</p>
          <p>Secondly, compared to the proposed Basel rules, our common equity ratio today would decline by 82 basis points. However, alarming APRA measures to Basel adds 266 basis points. So if you combine this, our core common ratio would be 9.34%, obviously a very strong ratio whether you use domestic or international comparisons.</p>
          <p>Now APRA had made it pretty clear that they would take a lot convincing to change their measures. I do think though there is good argument around the accrued dividend deduction, which reduces our ratio by 62 basis points, especially given that the dividend payment flexibility is reduced by the proposed conservation data. So we'll be having that discussion and making that point to APRA. But in any case, I think our overall comparative position to the proposed capital requirements is very sound.</p>
          <p>We've also focused on our funding strength this year in improving the quality of our funding, both deposits and long-term wholesale, reducing our short-term, and increasing our fully funded high quality liquid assets. As is seen, our stable funding ratio measure increased 80% compared to 64% in 2008 and 78% in 2009.</p>
          <p>Our term wholesale maturities were only $17 billion in 2011 and that's down from $20 billion last year. The amount we continue to access from global capital markets will also be influenced by the speed of recovery and credit growth in Australia versus deposit growth, the pace of continuing to build liquid assets, the value of the Australian dollar, and the extent we get ahead of our 2012 maturity program.</p>
          <p>Overall, today, I would anticipate raising from wholesale markets 5 to $10 billion less in 2011 than we did in 2010. We have done considerable work over the year to reposition and strengthen the balance sheet, and we are now well placed to meet the opportunities and the challenges in the year ahead.</p>
          <p>So let me wrap up with some comments regarding our financial outlook for 2011. We had been dealing with three major revenue headwinds &#x2013; lower fees, reduced Markets income, and falling margins from higher cost of funds. On the first two sectors, we'd largely dealt with those issues. In regard to margins, whilst we expect margins to be lower over 2011, we would expect the rate of decline to ease compared to 2010. Volumes should be generally supportive over 2011, although credit growth will still be modest.</p>
          <p>Mortgage growth is likely to be in the 6 to 8% range and business credit is expected to expand through the year compared to the decline that we saw this year. Our relatively strong capital positions us well to participate in the business recovery without having to require external equity.</p>
          <p>I'd also point out that our total Australian business book when combining WIB, St. George and Westpac Retail and Business is roughly equivalent to two of our peers and larger than the third, so we feel well placed to benefit from improved credit growth in Australian business.</p>
          <p>Wealth markets and flows should also be broadly supportive over the year. Expenses, I've mentioned quite a bit over the past month and there is not much to add. We will manage those in a disciplined fashion and we have already a broad based productivity program underway.</p>
          <p>In payments we're in the improving part of credit cycle. We won't get the reduction we saw in 2010, but we have a relatively high quality book and we will see the benefits of that.</p>
          <p>With that, let me hand back to Gail.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Phil. And so let me make just a few brief remarks in conclusion. While the global operating is improving, we're still living in a world of continuing uncertainty, particularly in the U.S. and European economics, which are facing major structural challenges. The Australian economy is overall strong, with some sectors such as mining much better placed than others.</p>
          <p>The fact that credit growth is remaining somewhat subdued at present reflects caution on the part of both consumer and business customers and the deleveraging trend continues. Next calendar year we would expect to see business credit growth pick up. And as we know from prior experience, when that happens, it can happen quickly.</p>
          <p>Looking beyond the short term, we become more positive still. Australia will be one of the best performing advanced economics over the coming years and one of the five key economies in Asia in terms of GDP growth.</p>
          <p>2011 and 2012 will also be busy years in terms of dealing to a very full regulatory agenda. There is, as you know, more work to be done with regard to the anticipated Basel III regime. So far the industry has been working well with APRA and the government, and I expect that will continue.</p>
          <p>Turning to Westpac specifically, Phil has pointed to key factors for the 2011 year. It is likely to again be a challenging year, with modest credit growth. Although, pleasingly having dealt with some major headwinds this year, 2011 should see more in the way of top line growth for our Retail and Business Banking divisions.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, the transformational journey that the company has been on over the past few years is well underway. We are substantially stronger than we were before the crisis. And you can see that in any number of ways. If you look at funding profile, our capital position, our credit quality, the technology environment, our market share positions, employee engagement and our customer franchises, all are stronger. But we have so much more to do, and I know I will look back in the 2010 year as being a seminal year, one of adjustment, one of building, one of heightened focus and of discipline.</p>
          <p>So, I would like to thank you all for coming this morning and thank you for listening to Phil and I. I'm going to move on to questions and Andrew will lead us through that. But before we get to questions, and in the light of the cash rate move yesterday, let me deal upfront with the obvious question.</p>
          <p>So the question is, obviously with regard to our own decision on interest rates. And the answer is that we have not yet made a decision on that. Perhaps not surprisingly, our focus today and indeed over the past several days has actually been on the delivery of our full year 2010 results. And it's very important to deal with this properly, the significant Board and other processes that actually go into that.</p>
          <p>Interest rate decisions are also very important and they're things that we never take lightly. And coming to our position, we always take in account a range of factors, including the effects on all of our stakeholders and our competitive positions. And so no decision has been taken as I stand here today and our interest rates remain under review.</p>
          <p>So with that let me hand over to Andrew.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Guys John Mott from UBS. Actually I had a question on deposits and the trend in the second half. So, I'm just referring to the full result, the <mark type="inaudible" /> on page 19, which gives a bit of detail about the deposit mix.</p>
          <p>One thing that you're seeing in Australia in particular is that -- a big slowdown in deposits in the second half to close to zero. But not only that,  big swings around in the movements. You're seeing at core really pick up and the term deposits and CDs move. Can you just give us a bit of a background on what's happening there in the deposits, firstly slowing down in the second half and why the big movements in those categories?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, the big trend has been, as you correctly say, from term deposits, which was the phenomenon, the feature, of the first half into online deposits and savings deposits in the second half. Just recently, actually, it slowed a little and just recently, the price competitiveness has come off a little. Prices have been just a little more favorable from that point of view. But, I don't think it has slowed materially for us over the whole half, it's been really just a shift of composition more from the term onto the online side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, in fact, I mean that's what those -- that that table shows you that actually our customer deposits actually had just as good growth in the second half, in fact, slightly higher than we did in the full year. And I think once again, it's a matter of sort of the composition of them. But I think the thing we're most pleased about is that the total customer deposits in the retail businesses, St. George and Westpac RBB, continue to perform well. So, as Gail mentioned, compositional shift, yes, but aggregate growth, no. It didn't slow that much for us at all.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Victor German from Nomura. Just a question on dividend policy. If we look at your capital position, it's clearly very strong and you're generating significant amount of surplus capital. Can you just perhaps give us an idea how you see your dividend policy pan out over next few years, particularly if we're entering a lower volume growth environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well let me start off, and Phil, I'm sure you'll add in. As we see things at the moment and as we understand the changes that are coming our way in terms of capital in the Basel III regime, we feel very comfortable with our dividend payout ratio at around the 70% level. We are driving strong organic capital growth at the moment.</p>
          <p>Now, obviously, things may change, there may be something unexpected that emerges, and then we may need to adjust for that, but as we see it at the moment in terms of what we see coming our way, in terms of the regulatory change, we remain comfortable with our payout ratio. Phil, I don't know if you want to add to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Only thing I'd add is the franking balance for Westpac, given the amount of Australian dollar earnings that we generate, is a healthy surplus today, and likely to continue to be healthy. And we weigh that up in terms of what should we pay out as a dividend to return those franking credits to shareholders versus what kind of dilution you might get through issuing shares in the DRP. So we've kind of weighed that up, we've come to the balanced view that maintaining the dividend and issuing shares undiscounted into the DRP is the right balance to get those franking credits back out to shareholders.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>James Freeman from Deutsche Bank. I just wanted to ask a little bit about the economic overlay. We saw the production come out this half, just sort of a bit of an indication as to what we can get for next year. Is the expectation you'll get rid of the whole economic overlay or do you want to keep some of it around. If you can give your views on that, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think the expectation is that we will continue to have an economic overlay for the foreseeable future. About half of the economic overlay really goes to uncertainty in the economic environment and half of it goes to individual risk items that we believe are unusual, and those risk items over the last years have covered things like aspects of the property market, aspects of exposures in New Zealand, exposures to financial institutions early in the GFC, and those are the kinds of things that actually play out in terms of justifying holding an additional provision in the form of an overlay.</p>
          <p>Over the last 12 months, as we've got into the end of 2010, we looked at a number of those factors and came to the conclusion that it was very difficult for us to justify holding the full amount of the provision, and so you saw the release. The release actually has got two bits to it. There's a release to do with Australian exposures into the property sector, given how much we've already recognized. But we actually topped some up for uncertainty coming out of the Christchurch earthquake. So those sort of things play their way through the overall provision balance.</p>
          <p>Over time, whether that provision balance gets released, how much gets released will be a function of those specific issues, and also obviously what's happening to the other collected provisions as credit growth starts to grow again.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Ben Koo from Goldman Sachs. Two questions on the revenue growth outlook. The first one is just when I'm looking at slide six of what you've just shown us there with the treasury and market's contribution over the last half and comparing that to '08 halves, the second half of '10 still looks relatively elevated versus the '08 average. Your comments just about how its rebased. Is that just around the view that it's now a bigger balance sheet, so you just don't see as much normalization risk going forward? So that's the first question in terms revenue outlook. And the other one is in terms of your comments at improvement in business lending, can you just give me a feel for where you're seeing the pipeline for business lending growth as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you really almost got the answer there, Ben, with regard to the markets and treasury income. So, clearly, there is volatility there. But our view is that it's back to more sort of sustainable level. It certainly is a bigger balance sheet, and that's the key factor about why it would be expected to be higher than it was in 2008. So that's the key answer there.</p>
          <p>With regard to business lending, which was your other major question, look, I think we all expected over the course of this past period to see the pipelines that are there for business lending to start to translate into drawdowns. But it has been a whole lot slower. There's remained caution in our business customer segments and I would expect actually that to continue for a period.</p>
          <p>So, there will be pickup, and we're set for that pickup when it happens. There are still quite healthy pipelines in our business banking businesses, institutional is still in a deleveraging phase. But really I would see that more as a second half 2011 pickup.</p>
          <p>So credit growth, I think Phil briefly spoke to. It will be at least as strong as it was this year. It should be stronger when business credits starts to pick up in that second half of next year, with home lending being much the same as it's been this year in this sort of 6%, 7%. And then we will start to see a pickup of business credit next year.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jarrod Martin from Credit Suisse. Notwithstanding the strong headline results, you rightly point out that core earnings growth was a bit tougher and particular in the second half it was weaker sequentially, pointing out to the rebasing fees in treasury. Particularly on the rebasing of fees, you say you have gone harder than others have gone further. Could you comment on that against the backdrop we have a senate inquiry into competition.</p>
          <p>We've also got Wayne Swan announcing that he is going to come up with ideas next month in terms of competition. Where are the vulnerabilities, one, for the sector and also in particular for Westpac and whether there is actually further rebasing to go for the industry as a whole?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is lots of uncertainty in all of that. I'd have to say certainly on the exception fee side, as you'll recall going back to September last year, we made a call to actually rebase all of those fees and to do it at once. So across our personal customer segments, across our product sets, both overdraft type products as well as credit cards, across all of our brands in Australia and New Zeeland.</p>
          <p>So at one turn, we actually reset all of those fees and took them down to $9, which was a sustainable level. So, from what was, obviously, higher levels and different levels, so that was going further than others. There are still some organizations out there that haven't done as much in that particular area. They may have done in some product categories or with some customer segments, but not quite as comprehensively as we have. So we think that does position us quite strongly with that category of fees that's called those exception fees.</p>
          <p>It's difficult to know -- we wait to see what the next steps will be with regard to the announcements that Wayne Swan made yesterday. We certainly hope that there will be proper consultation and discussion with the industry on that. But I would have to say, I think from a Westpac and St. George point of view, we paid a lot of attention to the range of fees that we have over the course of this year, and whether it's mortgage exit fees or other fees, really to make sure that we're comfortable with where they sit just at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that likely to be one of the risks for your revenue next year, though?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think -- we'll wait to see, I'd have to say. We need to wait and see what actually merges out of the reform that's being tabled and certainly hope that we can engage constructively with government on this because, as always, when there is new reform coming, new regulations coming, there can be unintended consequences and things that pop up that haven't been expected. So we certainly hope and expect that we'll have an opportunity to engage constructively with government on this and understand those impacts.</p>
          <p>We're certainly very pro-competition. We believe competition is a healthy thing. We believe there's plenty of competition in the market and we want to be in a position where customers choose to bank with us. And that's because we provide good service for them, deep relationships with them and support for them through the cycle. So we're certainly prp-competition.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ben Zucker from CBA Equities. Just two quick questions. One around funding, trying to get a better feel for &#x2013; you talked about the improvement in funding mix, deposit growth has been healthy, happy with some of the terming out that you've done today, et cetera. But when you look forward, how intensely are you still planning to compete for deposits and the priority there? And also how much more in terms of terming out funding?</p>
          <p>Now, on the cost management side, in terms of investment spend and the pressure that's coming through there, the productivity initiatives and how much that will offset that, how would you describe, I suppose, the cost pressure and the ability to maintain your efficiency edge?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, on the funding side, as you heard me say, this has really been a big year. This 2010 year raising as we did 43 billion in wholesale markets and, of course, doing quite extensive maturity terming out of the portfolio, so extending the term of the portfolio, both in the longer-term funding profile and in the shorter-term funding. We don't expect to need to do as much as regards to wholesale funding next year and it's partly because we think that the credit growth will remain relatively modest next year.</p>
          <p>We've also improved our capability of raising retail deposits. I'd have to say we've got more to do there. It has been a source of focus for us really ever since I've arrived in the organization and part of the shift, I think, we're all going through in the industry, of shifting our bankers from thinking about lending to thinking about relationships and making absolutely sure they are talking to customers and engaging on the deposits and transactional side of the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>So we've got more to do there, but we have upped the focus on that and that's the way we incentivize people, the way we manage people, what's on the scoreboards with our local bank managers.</p>
          <p>So we expect to continue to grow above market share with regard to retail deposit gathering. We have strong franchises that speak to customers in terms of safety and security and looking after all of their savings. So we'd expect to continue with that. Phil, do you want to add to that and perhaps answer the productivity one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there is a lot of different moving parts that shape the balance sheet and, therefore, shape how much wholesale fund raising we need to do &#x2013; given Gail's touched on deposits. I think that the &#x2013; the only other couple of points to make are, one, in the process of this year's term raising, we've also reduced our short-term wholesale and we reduced some of the WIB deposit balances that were quasi short-term wholesale, and so that, we think, is part of the element of strengthening and repositioning the balance sheet, which we wouldn't expect to have to do next year.</p>
          <p>Similarly, the Australian dollar plays into just how much wholesale fund raising we need to do. And whilst we might expect the Australian dollar to perhaps be strong and even stronger next year, the reality is over the course of the last 12 months we've had an extremely strong Australian dollar and that's led to more capitalization balances and that's absorbed some of the wholesale funding as well. So those things, I think, will also &#x2013; unlikely to be as severe in 2011 as what we've seen in 2010.</p>
          <p>Look, on productivity, I thought we had a good session at the start of the month. It is important for us to ensure that we are able to find the wherewithal in the company to invest in the technology that we want to invest in. And we've got two programs at work that Bob and Peter spoke to, which &#x2013; Bob talked about what we're looking to do from a technology point of view.</p>
          <p>They will have benefits, but they are longer-term benefits and we have to find a way in the company to absorb the cost of that until those benefits start to flow through. And so the productivity initiatives that Peter is leading, that really are right across the company are already starting to have traction. They do go to doing things smarter, not just kind of tighten the belt and they will lead to lower costs. And that in turn, as I said, will be the mechanism by which we fund the company.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard Wiles, Morgan Stanley. Phil, in Westpac, in Retail Bank, you said you ultimately expect relatively better margins. Could you explain what you meant by that? Did you mean relative to this year or relative to peers? And given that you've made no decision at this time in relation to home loan interest rates, does your guidance for the group's full year margin assume that current level of interest rate remains in place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the relatively better margins goes to the reality that if you're originating a mortgage through your own distribution channels, you're not paying brokerage and therefore your return is bettered by the amount of brokerage that you are not paying to a third-party. And so as we've shifted the mix of our origination to more first-party and less third-party, therefore, the return on that individual loan should be higher. So that's the comment on that. And this is part of an overall mechanism that we should expect to get as a return on the investment that we've made in Westpac Local and that we are making in a broader base St. George distribution. So it really goes to &#x2013; that's what you would expect us to get as a return on investment, better margins per line.</p>
          <p>Look, I think when we think about our margins going forward, we're thinking about the fact that our cost of funds will continue to increase. They did in 2010 higher average long-term wholesale, higher deposit costs. We would expect that to continue through 2011 and we need to find ways to offset that. But overall, we are thinking that our margins would be slightly lower. But the decline would be less than what we experienced and recorded in 2010.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I think one of your short-term incentive drivers is customer advocacy. Can you talk about customer advocacy as a driver of volume growth because it appears &#x2013; if I refer to page 67 of your result deck, St. George appears to be growing below system and lending and probably deposits. You've called out today that 62% of St. George's mortgage origination comes through proprietary channels versus 71 for your Westpac brand, so if you could provide some observations around that, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Craig. Well, certainly one reason why St. George would be growing below system in lending is that very shift of focusing more on raising the loans through the proprietary channel. Because if you'd recall, St. George's primary geographies, its primary states, its primary strength is in New South Wales and then in South Australia through the BankSA franchise.</p>
          <p>And as we're winding back the focus on raising broker-originated loans, necessarily in areas such as Victoria and in Queensland and in Western Australia, we would be sub-system. So when you look at St. George, really you shouldn't be looking at St. George's performance relative to system as a whole.</p>
          <p>You should be looking at St. George's performance relative to New South Wales system and with regard to South Australia system. And certainly, we would expect them and Rob Chapman, the new CEO of St. George, would expect to grow above system in these core geographies and using this proprietary channel as the area of primary focus.</p>
          <p>So have I answered the question? What's the other one?</p>

          <p>Customer efficacy. Look, that's always been a long battle within St. George, sort of I recall going back many years ago, and I was there too, that one had very strong customer efficacy and strong customer satisfaction and yet one seem to have to work really hard to have that actually translate into increased products to the customer.</p>
          <p>We're beginning to that get right, I'd have to say. It's been really good to see over the course of the past year that St. George's products per customer have risen quite significantly. And what we measure there is in particular customers with four or more products in our chosen segments. And we've definitely seen uplift there. I think it's referred to in one of the slides.</p>
          <p>So that remains a key area of focus. And pleasingly, all the way through the merger, it is a &#x2013; I think a highlight of St. George and it does speak to its strong culture and it does speak to the effectiveness of the merger that we've retained number one spot in both consumer and in business in customer efficacy over that period.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I had a question on costs as well. I guess just initially on the head count, if we go back to when the merger was done with St. George, there was just under 36,700 staff. And today, there is 38,500. I recognize there's a lot of temporary staff in the numbers at the moment. I'm just interested on a two-year view, whether you see that staff number coming back to once the projects are over.</p>
          <p>If I can focus just a bit more near-term on costs, you've been very adamant about managing the growth in the near term. You had 3% growth in the last half. If I look into the next half, you will have an amortization headwind kind of benefit from a release in the staff cost provision and the head count move as well. So I'm just interested if you think you can do better than 3% per half on cost growth over the next couple of halves.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Look, on the staff numbers, let me start with that. Phil, you might want to deal with the absolute growth in costs. On staff numbers, what we said at the presentation that we gave just a few weeks ago that we expect overall staff members to be lower at the end of this year and then lower again at the end of next year. So those are the points that we made and there are a number of moving pieces within that, which is why we don't want to be more definitive than that.</p>
          <p>We are still putting on staff in our technology areas to actually deal to those 14 strategic investment priorities that we have there. We've put on something like over 1,000 over the course of last year and we're putting on more people as those programs ramp-up and as we need to implement there. So there is increase of costs going on, and specifically in projects. But we also are continuing to invest in distribution where we believe it's necessary. But in our head office areas, in our operational areas, there is staff reductions occurring. So overall, we would see staff numbers coming down, but we really don't want to be more definitive than this.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the cost base, Matt, the reality in the second half, we've called out a couple of things. I called out a couple of things that were also sort of one-offs in the half, the $20 million of grant to Westpac Foundation and the additional restructuring costs. Both those, we've taken the line, so there's $40 million of additional costs.</p>
          <p>The software, as you point out, is going to be up again, but we did have some of that in the half. That's up quite a bit on the first half as well. And then lastly, the productivity benefits that we expect to get from the productivity program, we started to get those in the half, but they're actually pretty minor and we would expect to see a much better result going forward to allow us to have quite a bit better result than 3% growth per half.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>My question basically came down &#x2013; Phil, could you give us a bit of an explanation, page 47, movement in the expected loss, capital deduction if we were to strip out the impact of St. George's change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you picked up the point, Brian, that the bulk of that increase was actually due to the fact that when you transition St. George from standardized to advanced, you then have to take an expected loss calculation into consideration which was not there before. And so that led to quite a material uplift in the reg expected loss. The overall benefit, though, turns up in the fact that you get much lower risk-weighted assets for that same portfolio. I don't have the numbers to hand in terms of what the direct impact was on the reg expected loss. I'm happy to get it for you. But I can assure you that the overall combination of those two things was a significant improvement and we called that out in terms of what was the overall impact from the St. George advanced accreditation on capital. We called that, including those things, together gave us some 18 basis point uplift in our Tier 1 capital ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Phil, do you think that all the major banks that called out are systemically important banks for Basel III?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Brian, that the origination of the concept of systematically important came from a view that when looking at the global disruption that was &#x2013; that occurred, a number of very large global entities were having ramifications broader than their impact in their high economies. And I think the regulators then said, well, we need to consider a globally systemic importance here when we look at what's the appropriate allocation of capital.</p>
          <p>I think that discussion has moved broader. I'm not sure it's actually broadened in the regulatory space, but it's certainly broadened in other commentary to say, isn't every big bank in their home market systematically important. My view, and in the discussion with our local regulator is that they think that's part and parcel of what they do. They provide prudential supervision on the banking system here.</p>
          <p>They have to take account of different size banks and the different importance that we have for the local financial system. And there's lots of means of doing that through prudential supervision that necessarily jumps straight to, shouldn't we be applying a different capital measure. So I think the debate has got some way to go. I think we'll distinguish between domestic and global and I don't think you should necessarily assume that therefore domestics have to get additional capital overlay.</p>

          <p>Brett Le Mesurier from Axiome Equities. Question on the outlook on your core earnings, since you had income falling from the first half to the second half, and obviously you've described the reasons for that. It looks like it will be difficult &#x2013; and given that your expenses are continuing to go up, it looks like it will be difficult for your core earnings in 2011 to exceed the pro forma number that you provided for 2009. Would you agree with that observation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am not sure what pro forma number we provided for 2009. But just to talk to the overall points about the factors that drive our revenue and core earnings, I think we have discussed the expenses already, the factors therefore that drive the revenue. But 2011, as we've said already, we think will be a challenging year.</p>
          <p>There will be continued modest credit growth, although you've heard me say already, I think the credit growth will be at least as strong as it was this year. Frankly, it should be higher as business credit starts to pick up later in the year. So &#x2013; and we would expect to actually grow in our chosen segments ahead of system growth in the areas that we've chosen. So we've used this year, this 2010 year to really to significantly strengthen our franchise and rebase that revenue.</p>
          <p>We have dealt with some of the major headwinds during the 2010 year and we don't expect that they will come back in 2011. And what we have done through our Westpac redistribution and St. George is really strengthen that frontline distribution with an absolutely razor sharp focus on particular segments. And we would expect to grow above system in those key segments over next year. In St. George's case, as I've said, in their natural geographies; in Westpac's case, in those key segments nationwide. So we feel we've used this year quite well to be really disciplined and very focused. Critical segment focus, so we can have depth of relationship, longstanding relationships with four or more products per customer, and then a real focus in our proprietary channels because we believe that drives a greater value for us and is in line with our strategy. So that's some of the points that would actually go to revenue growth.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Philip Parker, Parker Asset Management. Could you just give us a feel for &#x2013; around the housing line sector, whether you've got &#x2013; what the movement in defaults has been over the last period? And also just on that product improvement that you've got with the four products you're talking about, the 30%, just the main products there, and where you're getting that growth from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I might ask Rob Coombe, he may want to add something to the product piece actually, about where he's getting the product growth from. The wealth product has been particularly strong. But I know that Rob would like to add to that. On the housing situation and with regard to the performance, it does remain an exceptionally high quality portfolio and performing very, very well.</p>
          <p>There has been some pickup, as you would have seen, in our 90-day delinquencies, but it's off a very low base. So the overall 90-day delinquency for our Australian home loan portfolio across the board at both St. George and Westpac, comes in I think at 0.43. Our overall properties and possessions have grown a little and it's new coming on and taking a little longer to actually move those that you have in the system out, but it's 383. Now, that's against, obviously, an overall portfolio that's well over 1 million, 1.5 million sort of properties.</p>
          <p>So it does remain a very well-performing portfolio, more than 55% of our people actually are ahead of their repayments. Our overall loan-to-valuation ratio across the portfolio as a whole is in the 40s and the loan-to-valuation ratio for new to bank customers at origination is in the 60s. I think it's 67%. So the portfolio does remain in very good shape. Our low doc portfolio that obviously grew during the period last year remains, as we said I think at the half, better performing than actually the portfolio as a whole. And we have a particularly strong product per customer relationship with our low doc customers. So that's performing well too.</p>
          <p>Rob, would you like to add something on where you're getting the products per customer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Firstly, it's mainly coming from the segments that we relationship manage and we've lifted the level of credit relationship. I was going to say <mark type="inaudible" />. The areas where we relationship managed and we've lifted relationship management focus particularly in the SMEE segment, and also in the upper end of the affluent.</p>
          <p>So we've been significantly lifting our penetration of products per customer in those levels in particular. If you want to look at the products, it's been primarily in the wealth area, so in our premium financial services area, which is the upper end of the affluent area, we've lifted wealth sales by 60% year-on-year. We've lifted Super for Life sales 37%. Over the year, and more broadly, we've lifted wealth sales by about 30%. As you can imagine, given my background, this is an area that I'm particularly interested in continuing to up the ante on that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. T. S. from Southern Cross. <mark type="inaudible" /> is back in fashion, does it make it more difficult for you to sustain St. George as a fighting brand, perception wise, given its association with Westpac?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not at all. T. S., that's not the way I would have thought the question would have gone actually. I think, if anything, it gives us additional strength. St. George is a very strong brand with a very strong culture and connection to customers, providing customers choice. And customers respond to that. And I think it provides us with an opportunity to speak to different types of customers. We've seen remarkably little overlap between customers who choose St. George and customers who choose Westpac. It's one of the reasons why we've had no customer attrition. And so I think it gives us an opportunity to actually have a multi-brand approach with BankSA as well. Customers choosing those brands, keeping relationship with those brands, it helps us rather than anything else.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So it's &#x2013; at the moment, we've got 24 of the total is in what we call <mark type="inaudible" />, which is the semis, govies and everything else. 23 of it is in banks and corporate and RMBS. I think the thing to remember is obviously that 23 does roll off, so turns into cash. There's no new funding requirement for that. Going forward, I think when you think about liquidity, we'll soon go away from just looking at the liquid assets and we'll look at management of outflows and inflows.</p>
          <p>So inflows are obviously skewed very much towards liquid assets, but there's a lot you can do on the outflows. And obviously, the third thing that we don't know yet is what the high quality liquid asset solution that we're going to get. So I think all of those things factor in. At the moment, it's very difficult to predict what the economics are going to be, whether it's better to more liquids or to manage your outflows out.</p>
          <p>So at the moment, the key thing is it's all repo-eligible. It provides us with that insurance that we've talked about in the past. It's built up appropriately given what's happened in the world over the last couple of years. And at the moment, we're really comfortable with the position where we stand.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, everyone. First, an observation that I'm sort of missing the product spread metrics in the pack that used to be in the cash earnings results section. But just as an aside, and then a question on New Zealand. We're seeing the net interest margin improving by 9 basis points for the half, which is explained by a mix of new business and some re-pricing. Could you provide some further details around that NIM movement and also your expectations in terms of the re-pricing that you may look forward to for the current FY '11 financial year, especially in the light &#x2013; if I look at some of the peers, the sort of NIM improvement in the second half seems to a little bit less than what we have seen for the other two banks reporting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'll answer that, Johan. The product spread data really obviously also had a large element of internal transfer pricing as a component part of driving that. And we thought without having a consistent approach to doing that across sectors, it's very hard to include that data.</p>
          <p>And in terms of New Zeeland NIM, you picked up a number of the factors that have driven the improvement. I guess, the one you didn't mention was the mix shift in mortgage origination and mortgage book, which has shifted to more floating rate and less fixed rate. That has had quite a material mix benefit to the margin.</p>
          <p>There has been re-pricing. There has probably been another round of re-pricing across the industry in business. And I think that probably reflects the assessment of credit risk that exists in business lending in New Zeeland. And I think that that's been an industry phenomenon that we are starting to see play through in New Zeeland. We feel quite positive about the way that the team in New Zeeland is managing that volume margin trade-off.</p>
          <p>Volumes continue to be quite modest, but actually still positive which is different to the system. So we are actually gaining share both in mortgages and in business in New Zeeland, but we are still improving margins. And that feels to be the right mix. We'd rather do that rather than see volumes down to repair margins.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think Phil sort of characterized it correctly in the sense that we're making the right trade-offs between the margin and volumes. So we've gained share in all of our key products and been able to see the benefits of repricing in the first half, flowing through in the second half. There will be some more re-pricing flowing through as the book turns over and we'll continue to manage that tightly.</p>
