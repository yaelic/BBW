          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Presentation of BNP Paribas 2009 Third Quarter Results. For your information this conference is being recorded. Slides of the presentation are available on BNP Paribas Investor Relations' website, www.invest.bnpparibas.com. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Philippe Bordenave, Senior Executive, Vice President and CFO. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Welcome to you all. Please allow me to -- allow me a few introductory words before taking your questions as usual. Third quarter, in an environment characterized by an economic cycle still in the downturn, but normalizing capital markets, BNP Paribas posted 1.3 billion net income, again confirming its robust profit generation capacity. It's a very good set of results, especially for third quarter.</p>
          <p>Beyond those good results, I would like to stress six key takeaways from this set of results. One, we have now repaid in full the &#x20AC;5.1 billion non-voting shares subscribed to by the French state. It appeared at the end of October, so state intervention is now behind us. Two, we have reached a very comfortable capital level. On a pro forma basis of this repayment of non-voting shares and the &#x20AC;4.2 billion write issue BNP Paribas's Tier 1 ratio reached its all time high at 10%. This is 7.8% at the end of last year. The equity Tier 1 jumped from 5.4 to 7.8% over the same nine months period. This level of solvency, which has been reinforced thanks to the group's robust profit generation capacity, is very comfortable given BNP Paribas' diversified integrated business model.</p>
          <p>Three; at the same time the legacy effects of the financial crisis are subsiding and will now only marginally affect the coming quarters. The remaining positive impact from the own debt revaluation to be written back over time is now lesser than &#x20AC;250 million and the quarterly impact will be negligible. The future P&amp;L impact of our remaining sensitive exposure, which is low as you know, is not a specific concern.</p>
          <p>For BNP Paribas, the page has been turned. Four, the cost of risk at &#x20AC;2.3 billion is plateauing at 141 basis points of basal 1 risk weighted assets this quarter compared to 145 basis points in the third quarter of last year, and 144 basis points in the second quarter of 2009. And this &#x20AC;2.3 billion of this quarter include a total 250 million provisions on a portfolio basis while the non-performing loans themselves increased by a mere 3% on the linked quarter basis.</p>
          <p>Five, for the first nine months of 2009, despite the still challenging economic environments, BNP Paribas annualized return on equity was 11% above the cost of equity. The Group's revenues totaled in fact &#x20AC;30 billion, up 34% compared to the first nine months of 2008 and the net income attributable to equity holders was &#x20AC;4.46 billion, up 1.8% compared to the same period a year earlier despite doubling of the cost of rate and despite the significantly higher income tax.</p>
          <p>Six, on top of that let me remind you that, at BNP Paribas we are presently all at work to ensure the success of BNP Paribas Fortis integration. The resulting industrial plan and synergy generation will be disclosed on December the 1st. So thank you for your attention. I will now be happy to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Philippe Bordenave. Ladies and gentlemen, the question and answer session will be conducted electronically.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We will take the first question from Kimon Kalamboussis from Citi. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi this is Kimon Kalamboussis from Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Kimon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. I would like to -- I have two questions really. First on Personal Finance, the loan loss provision trends if you can elaborate on the trends there, particularly sort of more forward looking trend and also the -- the same question little bit some color on BancWest on loan loss provisions? And also to &#x2013; smaller questions, first on the CIT bankruptcy if you have any exposure to that please? And the second one on why the tax rate was so high or the amount of taxes was high please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, starting with the loan loss provisions trend at Personal Finance. Well, you know, Personal Finance is a business where loan losses are part of the business and consumer lending, so you -- well certain level of losses is kind of inherent to the business and margins are tailored accordingly. And also if the business were in the downturn -- in the economic downturn like today, they tend to have a higher risk and cost of <mark type="inaudible" />  rising I would say rising rapidly, more rapidly than retail networks. But usually it comes down also earlier than retail network.</p>
          <p>Well, we had seen a first -- while we are hit first in Spain if you remember, it already started last year. It seems that at the moment -- somewhat coming down in Spain but it is now rising also in Italy and to a certain extent throughout Europe as well.</p>
          <p>We are lucky enough to have a very, very negligible exposure to the UK market, which is <mark type="inaudible" /> have very low -- Eastern Europe. So we are not skipping difficult area. And so now the trend you know it is always difficult to speak about the future. I am &#x2013; we hope that we are now close to the top, but the only thing I can say it is more than the prediction.</p>
          <p>At BancWest, we are giving regularly -- we are giving you a scene on the appendix comparison with the visitors, where it is clear that we are beating the competition and given it seems that the number of indicators are plateauing the evolution of the non-accruing loans on total loans seems to kind of start slowing down. They still are up, but today nowhere than the previous quarter. And well, the US crisis is very strong. The US started the crisis. They entered the first one in the crisis. Well, we may expect that there will be some recovery in the US economy next year, but up to now, it remains difficult. So I'm sorry not to be precise in my predictions, but it's extremely difficult. We have seen a kind of slowdown in the deterioration for corporate loan in BancWest. What deteriorated somewhat this quarter was the first mortgages, but more kind of portfolio basis than -- but also it's linked or it's also linked <mark type="inaudible" /> for loan and clearly the unemployment rate which is 10% in the US, we are in the middle of the crisis. So I think before we have seen the real plateau, I think it's premature to announce it, but we &#x2013; only thing we can say that we hope it's not too far away.</p>
          <p>Now on the CIT a bit, well we have &#x2013; well, we have negligible exposure and it had been adequately provisioned, it is really not an issue. Under the tax rate, we, yes, we had a high tax rate, somewhat high tax rate here, and for the first nine months, it is at 30% and it is especially spectacular, because last year it was very low at 20% at the same period of the year of the nine months.</p>
          <p>We have given explanation on slide 38, and we have explained that we &#x2013; last year we had some positive factors coming from certain number of significant capital gains realized at the beginning of the year, which was the foreign crisis, which reduced the tax rate in the beginning of the year. And in the third quarter, we had losses due to the Lehman crisis. We had losses and to <mark type="inaudible" /> we had losses in countries, in the US and UK basically, where tax rate is relatively high and so it generated high tax assets, because it was about losses this quarter.</p>
          <p>While this year it is quite the opposite, and we're not generating losses any more in those countries and to the opposite and the results are quite high in the UK due to the regular fixed income results and also certain extent in the US. So, we have <mark type="inaudible" /> of this effect, and on top of that now have growing relatives importance of Belgium in the mix. It was already a difficult case for the second quarter but given more in the third quarter and Belgium is the country with the tax rate which is similar to France and 34% income tax and 0% rate on capital gains. But this year we have no capital gains, we tend to have rather capital losses on impairment with the low tax rate. So, it is not bringing that up, so that all that plus some tax provisions we took this quarter is creating relatively higher tax rate at 30% compared with 5% for the first six months.</p>
          <p>I think we'll have to reassess maybe some day. We are still guiding for 27%, which is our guidance for the tax rate, I would say on a medium-term basis. With the addition of Belgium, we'll have to make some study once the industrial plan is achieved, is completed and in order to see if these transactions can be confirmed or if it has to be slightly revised, the fact is that this time it is 30%. So, we are not that far from 37, but still it is higher. So this was the tax.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, very helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from <mark type="inaudible" /> from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of questions. As you said BNP Paribas has a core Tier 1 ratio now, which has never been higher, is it an indication that you are going to pile up the group with core Tier 1 close to 8%, would you view that as a temporary element, knowing the environment we are in? And the second very quick question is to know if you made any adjustment or writeback on the 1.5 billion adjustments you had on some of the trading assets before this? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we had no significant writeback I would say from the Fortis Asset except from some redemption, and as far as core Tier 1 is concerned, we are &#x2013; we are really seeing that the main indicator remains the Tier 1 which is as of today the only regulatory ratio, which is relevant for our regulator, and so -- but we are adding the core Tier 1 because it's a strong demand from you guys and so we thought it was necessary to mention the information.</p>
          <p>And now we have included two pilot groups, I think we will have to wait until the intensions of the regulator of <mark type="inaudible" /> there was a period where all the regulators and strategists and so on, brought up ideas about new regulations, additional capital needs -- capital requirements and so on. Now we are entering a period, where there will be some impact for this in order to assess the impact of all that and what is, well, what is overreaction, what is bad idea, what is pleasure, what is not and at the end of 2010, the whole thing will be settled.</p>
          <p>And I think also it's too early to say, what's going to be the outcome of all this. The only thing, which we believe firmly is that the ART will be maintained meaning that before the crisis, we were among the banks with the lowest minimum Tier 1 required from the regulators due to our robust and diversified business model.</p>
          <p>I think it has proven to be robust and diversified and certainly during the crisis, so after this track record, I think it is deserves being again one of the lowest requirements in the new period having in mind of course that the new lowest level will necessarily be higher than the previous one and the one before the crisis in UK. And -- but we can't tell more at this stage and we'll see the outcome of all the restrictions and studies which are going to be conducted.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Pascal Decque from Natixis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon everyone, I have two main questions, the first one is on Ukraine, regarding the evolution of the economy of the country, are you still targeting, I would say 20% losses on your 5 billion loan book, one. The second is on Fortis. The point is you are much higher than the consensus for the result of Fortis, and apparently much higher than you were anticipating, then how that you are doing so much better? And the second part on the Fortis question is we are in the PPA, could you give us some indication on potential positive number of positive 2010? And so is the last question on BNL in Italy. Two main points. First one is technical point I would say is BNL offered us fees on the net interest income, can you give us some numbers and how do you intend to compensate this loss in revenue with new fees? Some banks, I think they can get back 60%, eventually more. And last more strategic point on BNL is the return on equity I thought is very good number. It's still twice slower than retail trends and where are the leverages now in the profitability in Italy. What kind of good level of profitability would you like to have in medium term in BNL? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Lot of questions Pascal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No problem. Starting with Ukraine. So in Ukraine, yes we have reached cost of risk of around 10% and compared with our spending, if we add all the provisions we have taken over the quarter, I think we are now receiving something like 800 or even more than that, close to 6 to &#x20AC;700 million. So we are not far from the 20% of 5 billion you are mentioning. I think, yes, you have seen as well, nevertheless it's a bit less each quarter and we are seeing some slight improvement in the scene.</p>
          <p>We have of course increased the recollection teams and the workout teams, and we have stopped this <mark type="inaudible" /> now for almost one year. So, we would say the situation is progressively improving, marginally improving, and I think the Ukraine evolution will depend a lot on the outcome of the elections in January, because clearly the economic policy in Ukraine has been hampered by the kind of development at the highest level over the last few months, and clearly now we are in the runup period towards the elections and elections are going to be pretty good. So we keep at the moment, at this stage we primarily see some -- trend has not changed, and we may reassess solution depending on the outcome. Of course a clear political result helps probably &#x2013; would help the country. About Fortis, we are higher than the consensus, yet why, the first obvious reason is that the Fortis capital market activities are benefiting from the same volume clients environment, demand environment as old industry <mark type="inaudible" /> of BNP Paribas as well. So, this part of the Fortis is more volatile like any bank and clearly proving to consensus and our own expectations we were anticipating more or less zero results on that part of the business due to kind of inherent fragility. And in fact we achieved a very good result. It doesn't mean it will repeat itself each quarter but well let's enjoy as long as it lasts. It was already the case last quarter. On the PPA, I am not going to -- the reversal, the mechanic reversal of PPA, I think I am not going to elaborate further, because we discuss that extensively on the 1st of December, so I think it is better to wait until then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in Italy, well, the overdraft &#x2013; the maximum overdraft fees had been already I would say forbidden, one or two years ago and replaced by so called facility fees,  which were I would say maybe more transparent in the &#x2013; and what is new of &#x2013; what is in the making is that there is a new draft flow tree which was approved on the 1st of July, but it is not yet approved by the Parliament, so it's a kind of suspect and which is introducing your quarterly cap of physically 0.5% that quarter on those facility fees and clearly plus additional constraints in terms of value date and deepwater and certain number of other additional constraints on that.</p>
          <p>And on the basis on the preliminary assessment of the impact, potential impact of these measures, for us the impact on 2009 would be marginal, because we are closed right now. But for 2010 on the full year basis, the impact could be in the range of 25 to 30 million. So it's a significant impact, but you have to bear in mind that these measures could still change in the process of conversion into low.</p>
          <p>And now about the return on equity, yes you are right. The return on equity is still half roughly in France, and but you know we are not yet at the end of all the industrial transformation of P&amp;L. I think we have industrial plan was the kind of first step that we are now in the process of completing,  achieving, announcing the second step, which is the Findomestic integration I would say was P&amp;L -- or not integration but <mark type="inaudible" /> with P&amp;L. We -- now that we have agreed with Intesa to take the full control of Findomestic and once the inspection is completed and the &#x2013; we will be in a position to really organize industrial synergies between P&amp;L and Findomestic, and it will normally create a kind of new flow of synergies both in terms of revenue strategy, because we intend to develop consumer lending usually, and there is Italy still a country, where the consumer lending business is underdeveloped. The debt per capita in Italy is the lowest in Europe and we still have a lot of, I would say upside on that business. And also on the cost side, we'll optimize the setup for consumer loan in Italy. So, this is something which remains to be done and which we are going to do in the next few months. And second, you have to bear in mind that the BNL is not yet switched over to Basel II. We are still in standout method in -- most advanced methods have not yet been implemented, and I would say blessed by the Italian authorities at BNL. So, we are working currently, we are working for that. You see, it was not the priority in initial stage, because we had to integrate, but now with something which is well underway for whole month.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have some questions. First regarding the balance sheet as of June compared to one indication you gave on slide 14. In June the shareholders equity for the group was &#x20AC;64.8 billion, including 1.5 negative capital gain, and in slide 14, you indicate that now as of end of September, your shareholder's equity is 57 with capital gains of positive 1.1. I just would like to have the explanation of difference considering that the payout ratio is not -- I would say, the sole explanation I guess. Could you also give us the capital allocated to Fortis or risk weighted asset, and could you give us the number of net new accounts in the French retail and remember the first semester. And also a global question regarding the coverage ratio, how do you explain that your coverage ratio is 20 points, around 20 points above your peers including collective provision, do you think that you are really &#x2013; why do you have such a difference and what is the view of the banking commission regarding this coverage ratio and the difference between French banks. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the last question really, you shouldn't ask us, you should ask the <mark type="inaudible" /> itself and maybe the competitors with lower coverage ratios. We feel it is adequate coverage ratio, that's all I can say. On the first question about the balance sheet, I think the explanation is that in new figure in for June you are taking the actual balance sheet, which is taking into account the hybrid Tier 1, which are equity accounting wise, because they have all equity features, but which we don't report as shareholders equity on page 40, which &#x2013; so we correct, we adjust for those super-subordinated bonds. They are representing 8 billion, so it is around the amount you are looking for.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>So your following question was, I missed one question in the middle, sorry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Fortis, again we are not going, because at the moment as you have seen, we adjust putting Fortis I would say alone with the rest, but on the side at the moment as it is and all Fortis has not yet been integrated in all the mechanism of co-businesses, business lines, capital allocation and so on in the Group. So that is what we are going to explain at present, the new capital allocation, the new integration of different Fortis businesses within the BNP Paribas Group. All that is going to be presented on the 1st of December.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey good afternoon. Just three questions please. The first is on risk weighted assets. Just wondered if you could give us your thoughts going into the fourth quarter, whether you could bring that balance down any further as you look at jumping the Fortis CNIB port or is the growth in the underlying business going to offset that and we should be up?</p>
          <p>The second question was just on Fortis, whether you could confirm whether any negative AfS reserves which you crystallized had come through in the numbers? And finally just any color around the dividend policy of any kind of target payout? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Jon, on the risk weighted assets, I think we are little bit at the end, because I mean we intend to -- as you are right, as you say we will have two opposite forces. One will be the further kind of risk weighted assets synergies and we can draw from the integration of Fortis because clearly on the total of Fortis Bank, we will have some optimization possible, but on the other hand, if the recovery comes and well &#x2013; it seems to come in certain countries, with positive GDP figures, here and there. We may yet be in the situation, where the loan demand is rebounding somewhat and so we may have some need of more risk weighted assets in order to accompany our client. So, the balance of that is difficult to predict the magnitude of the risk weighted assets synergy with Fortis is are going to be given 1st of December again, sorry, to defer the answer on that. And so -- but all-in-all I think you shouldn't expect further sharp decline in the risk weighted asset. But rather either a stability or even some evolution up again. At the end of the day, the bank is here to grow and to &#x2013; the risk weighted assets are making revenue as well. Now Fortis, we had some AfS securities being redeemed and some sales. I don't have the precise figure in mind. It was not huge, it is not huge I think. It may be a few tens of millions or something like that -- maximum.</p>
          <p>About the dividend policy while you know, although if you look back the payout ratio of BNP Paribas has been always between 33% and 40% let's say. Last year we were at 33% and the decision is taken by the Board. I really don't think it will be lower than 33%. At the same time, we have -- if we manage to achieve a fourth quarter that is much better than the fourth quarter of last year, which shouldn't be difficult, the total result of the year will be much higher than total result of 2008 and maintaining the coverage ratio will mean increasing the dividend quite a lot. So I can't tell you more than that.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon. I have three quick questions if I may. The first question is on BankWest. I would like to know whether you have an update on the charge-offs and the reserves as a proportion of loans, because I haven't found them in the disclosure. I reckon the last time I saw them the cumulative charge-offs were about 150 bps in cumulative since the beginning of the '07. And balance sheet provisions were about 180 bps off the top of my head. The second question I had was on CIB. I see obviously a CLO cost run rate and there was some in a way some help from the G20 change in regulation on bonuses and things like that. I was just wondering what you think in terms of the run rate going forward and whether you saw -- maybe a structural step change downwards because of that regulation or whether that's more reflected your outlook for revenues in the coming quarters? And thirdly and finally, I had a question on net interest margins. When I looked at your half-year disclosure, I saw a steady increase in net interest margins over time, including when your customer margins, but also on our trading net interest margin. I was wondering if you could qualify the extent to which the steepness of the yield curve has helped you and the extent to which re-pricing of commercial margin has helped you as well. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois. Let's start with the CIB. I think this quarter cannot be taken as a new benchmark, we are in a kind of transitory period this quarter, and since the final payment terms of the <mark type="inaudible" /> have not yet been completely finalized, we have used the kind of temporary rules to determine the quarter's provision. The parameters being that because, well, the big change for us in the G-20 rule is that we'll have to pay a significant part of the bonuses in shares, while in the past we were deferring part of the bonuses but we were paying them in cash mostly, but the part being paid in shares was very small and by paying that also in cash we were allowed to put it in the accounts on the first year, the year where the results are made. So, there was a kind of symmetry between the revenues and the bonuses. By paying <mark type="inaudible" /> shares, now we have to comply with IFRS 2, so called share based payments rule standard and these standards provide that we have to strike the cost of those shares over the vesting period, which is going to be three years according to this 20 rule. And so it necessarily creates kind of disconnection between revenues and bonuses, but past year one, which is this year and more specifically this quarter, the impact will be much lower, so I think you should keep in mind the same run rate that we had in the past and the guidance we were giving in the past meaning that our target is to run our CIB with a cost-income ratio below 60%. In good years, it goes significantly below that, down to or close to 50% in very good years like this year. And in bad years, it is at 60, sometime 62, 63 or 60 plus. But for us, the 60 is a kind of alarm bell, because we think the cost-income ratio has to be good in order to prevent the CIB to lose money, in fact that is a cost of risk. So, this is a good guidance we are giving and you can keep it.</p>
          <p>Now on BancWest, we are not &#x2013; we don't have the figures, sorry. Well we will come back on that in a while &#x2013; I don't have the figure at this time. And then your last question was about the group's net interest margin versus commission and again this is something we are giving only twice a year at the moment of our official financial statements and we tend to &#x2013; it has a lot of importance for the retail networks and it is of less importance for all the activities like CIB where sometimes you cannot really make the difference between what is the fee and what is an additional interest rate being capitalized in the form of a fee at the beginning of the period, so the relevant substantial distinction at the level of the group is somewhat blurred in fact by this phenomenon, so we tend to look at it for retail networks like the French retail and we are giving that kind of information, but otherwise the group level is only once a year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, two quickies hopefully. First, if you could just talk quickly about the customer <mark type="inaudible" /> bonus element that has gone through there. And secondly I appreciate this may will get to the 1st of December as well, but on the Fortis cost of risk, if we strip out the portfolio provisions you plugged in there, the cost of risk looks relatively benign compared with previous data. I just wondered if you could comment on that and maybe sort of give us a little thought on the outcome, the outlook for next few quarters on Fortis cost of risk? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We -- the French, your question is about the French retail kind of bonus?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not to be compared with the CIB bonuses of course. But you know once a year in France it is even a rule, a law I think once a year we have to negotiate yearly compensation increase package with the unions and so you can do it more or less early depending on what you want and this year I mean like last year by the way we decided to do it relatively early, because we negotiated in September for 2010, and we came to an agreement in the third quarter and part of that agreement is about a 1% increase in wages for 2010. So, this is going to impact 2010 cost to 1%, so it's kind of reasonable wage increase, but still significant in zero inflation time. But to note of that was kind of exceptional bonus which was added to the negotiation to come to an agreement. A kind of year-end bonus, which is going to be paid at the end of this year and which is going to be kind of a compensation for the very good year we are enjoying. So this is why we put the cost of it mostly this quarter. In fact, we &#x2013; as it was related to this year, we put in fact according to the kind of basic rule. We put like three quarter of the cost in this quarter and the remaining quarter will be borne by the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't want <mark type="inaudible" /> negotiating position for next year but is that a sort of bonus that we're likely to see recurring in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. it's completely exceptional. Just completely one-off link to this negotiation. There is no reason why we would do it again next year, in other negotiations we will take <mark type="inaudible" /> which will &#x2013; the only thing which is, I would say recurrent is the rendezvous and the meeting point throughout the end of the year in order to discuss about next year's compensation. What is completely exceptional is to add something which is related to this year. And this is really because the negotiation evolved that way.</p>
          <p>Now Fortis, the Fortis cost of risk, yes I understand your question. You have to bear in mind that as we have gone through the PPA exercise and we have taken all the necessary provision, the necessary allowances out there, in short our necessary market allowance, which <mark type="inaudible" /> deserved by each file, I mean it's relatively logical that the cost of risk plus PPA in the groups account is not that big, because it just relates to the deterioration, but I'm sure deterioration of the situation since the 12th of May by definition. And so I think it explains why the specific allowances are not that high and it also explains why we added this provision on portfolio basis due to the evolution of the SME economics, I would say throughout Europe and well including in Belgium, due to the economic environment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon everyone. Just a follow-up question on risk-weighted assets. We have seen a steady decrease of risk-weighted assets in the third quarter, it was 32 billion. If I recall properly, at the end of the second quarter results, you actually said that risk-weighted asset management was going to be limited. Now you are giving us indication that in the fourth quarter, the reduction on risk-weighted asset should be limited. Actually we might see an increase of traded risk-weighted assets. I am just wondering how you can &#x2013; we can reconcile these two statements, the one you are making now and the one you made at the second quarter results. And also on the Fortis decrease in risk-weighted assets. If I remember correctly, the number you gave us at the time of the acquisition was 166 billion of RWAs and then we have seen a decrease in Fortis banking of 11 billion. So I am just wondering whether an indication of 150, 155 billion of risk-weighted assets for Fortis is correct. That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is on Fortis again and on the restructuring charges, I am just wondering whether you can give us indications as to -- are we going to see some restructuring charges in fourth quarter 2009 and whether these are going to be in line with the announcements you made at the time of the acquisition.</p>
          <p>And finally, on the -- you mentioned on the advisory <mark type="inaudible" /> ratio which has been very favorable in the last quarter should be in the region of 50, 55%. I am just wondering whether there was an indication for this year or for 2010 as well including the acquisition of Fortis assets. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You are asking a lot of questions on Fortis and again we expect to spend the full day speaking about Fortis on 1st of December, so we wouldn't like to elaborate too much this year on that. But maybe I will give you some elements. The evolution of the risk weighted assets, we &#x2013; well first is you have to bear in mind that you, we are not mastering the evolution of risk weighted assets completely. We can have a policy, but we cannot master completely the</p>
          <p>risk-weighted assets, for example on the loan demand is something which is not in our hands and clearly yes, we were somewhat surprised I would say this quarter by the fact that the loan demand in PNB has been in <mark type="inaudible" /> relatively weak, weaker than what we would expect. And we had also some good surprise on the stock exchange side, where we have seen a recovery which was relatively strong over the third quarter and which is what clearly not factored in our anticipations and which has reduced the risk weighted assets as scheduled with our industrial portfolio participation.</p>
          <p>And due to the increase in the <mark type="inaudible" />, which are taken into account in the model transforming participations into risk weighted assets. So, this is why, yes we have achieved a reduction in risk weighted assets which was higher than -- clearly higher than what we expected. So, for the fourth quarter what I am saying is our policy -- our intention but again, well, it will depend on the facts and circumstances, and we cannot I would say reach exactly the targets we are &#x2013; we may have, because it depends on the business and the environment.</p>
          <p>Then about your second question, sorry was about &#x2013; I have lost your second question. Restructuring charges and that was the third one. But, let's start with the restructuring charges. The restructuring charges again we will give more details on the first of December as it was. So I don't want to elaborate. We will discuss that more in detail on the first of December. Your second question was about <mark type="inaudible" /> impact, no, about what sorry?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had two questions, one on the comp ratio in advisory, you gave us an indication of 50 to 60%. I am just wondering whether this relates to the BNP Group or the BNP Fortis new group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. sorry, first it's not the <mark type="inaudible" /> advisory, it's about CIB business as a whole. And it is not the comp ratio, it's the cost income ratio including all costs. And it is for the group the BNP Paribas Group as a whole. CIB, yes it is including the Fortis staff now for the future of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And going back to the risk weighted assets at Fortis, the indications of 166 billion from which you deducted 11 billion of risk weighted assets and decrease at Fortis. And that makes 155 billion of RWAs in the third quarter. Is it plausible or is it an indication of where the risk weighted assets might be for this division?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I was wondering if you could just go back to BankWest in emerging market retail. If you could explain to us just from your perspective how you will turn this business into profitability and I'm aware of the cost cutting program in BankWest, but assuming no material provisioning improvement, what are the steps that you are doing to change this around? And when should we expect a breakeven level again in both of these operations? And the second question is relating to fixed income, still a great number but coming down how should we look at this especially putting it in context of history, i.e., how much market share have you gained? How much is market related relative to looking at numbers in the past?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As for BankWest, well, we &#x2013; yes, for the first time this year, we are below breakeven and we &#x2013; as you said, we are taking steps on the cost side. We are not really thinking that this kind of level of cost of risk will last forever. I mean we, it is difficult to give a precise quarter for the peak. But it is clear that if you take a medium term view, I mean the US economy is very cyclical with cycles which are much more dramatic than in Europe, it's well known and so we are at the moment in the midst of very, very historically sharp crisis. We are also going to see a re-bound some time, so the &#x2013; in that kind of situation, we do everything we can in such situation, so first on the cost side, as we said. Second, on the recollection side and on the loan extension side, strengthening further our rate policy criteria, and increasing the workout teams and trying to improve the cost of risk as fast as we can.</p>
          <p>So, I think that the return to profitability and we hope will come relatively fast. I mean we &#x2013; again I don't want to provide with the precise date, because it would be somewhat brave, but clearly we are not overly worried at this, because we know that the US economy is cyclical and because we are faring better than the competition in that context. So, probably we'll be among the first ones to be breakeven again, and so the total banking industry cannot leave in such a situation for too long. We think that it should come rather sooner than later.</p>
          <p>On the emerging market, I think we are really in a situation where as I said there are two different -- apart from Ukraine, the rest has been swell. After kind of aftershock of the crisis in the Gulf, especially but overall it's profitable. Our trouble is I would say coming really essentially from Ukraine, and as I said Ukraine evolution will depend a lot on the election next year. So, again it is  difficult to provide you with precise date, but we keep developing the business as we have said in the slide. We keep developing the business in certain countries, especially in the Mediterranean  and we are relatively confident that with the oil price picking up again, the Gulf situation should improve relatively soon. So, I think we should come to a breakeven or so relatively soon.</p>
          <p>And fixed income, fixed income, yes I think Europe the &#x2013; we have changed the range I would say, due to the crisis, due to competition having lessened due to our market share gain and we &#x2013; I think that the range where fixed income results were evolving before the crisis, has now somewhat sifted upwards and is &#x2013; but it will remain a very tight business and don't expect the results to stabilize at certain level and to stay there.</p>
          <p>I think it is going to evolve and will depend on <mark type="inaudible" /> two factors including PN demand, and at the moment I will think PN demand has remained sustained. We keep on gaining market share with barriers to entry being very high. That is <mark type="inaudible" /> products and on the floor products, even if the margins have come back to I would say to something like close to  preliminary levels now and they are still much higher than the pre-crisis levels. I mean trades <mark type="inaudible" /> and which is the kind of reference, the pre-crisis reference you may have in mind.</p>
          <p>So, again as we are cautious -- I am not going to give you any specific figure. But you can take for granted that the first and second quarter levels we are really exceptional and are clearly out of the range. I would say that the current for the third quarter level can be taken in the new range -- and which doesn't mean that the level is going to be repeated each quarter. But we -- clearly it means that the new range is much higher than the previous one.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Good afternoon. I have a couple of questions still regarding the fixed income. I understand that probably it just looks more than what you could achieve in the first <mark type="inaudible" /> of '08, but nevertheless could you assess what is linked to some seasonality possible factor in Q3 and what is margin normalization? What could be the risk weighted impact in the decline? And on the financing side, it seems there has been absolutely no seasonality factor on the contrary. Could we imagine we can transport there to the fourth quarter as a positive ongoing trend on financing? Another question is regarding the tax rate. You mentioned that there were fiscal provisions &#x2013; tax provisions could we have an idea of the amount if this is one-off, to what is it related by the way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the margins on fixed income under the <mark type="inaudible" /> yes they are somewhat contracting. Well, I would say that while we &#x2013; the decline between the second quarter and the third quarter from 1.9 billion to 1.55 billion. I don't know, maybe &#x2013; let's say half and half if you want a kind of guess which is not very scientific measure between both effects. Margins have been reduced on very different ways depending on the products, by the way. So it's also difficult to measure in detail, but let's say half and half. And on the financing, yes, the financing businesses are more stable, much more stable and they are evolving in a range which is between 700 and 770, something like that over the last few quarters, so yes, normally it should be in that range and again I <mark type="inaudible" /> give you the fourth quarter results now, it is a bit early, but it should be relatively stable compared with expansion, this is more predictable than the fixed income or equity derivatives. And the tax rate, no sorry, I'm not going to give you the detail of our tax provisions. Yes, it's a one-off provision. Well, and it is few tens of millions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. <mark type="inaudible" /> from Execution. Good afternoon. I just had a few follow-up questions. Firstly, on the cost income ratio in the investment bank and the benefit from on the change in accrual or cash versus share base compensation, and there were some press reports about your accrual and cash equivalent in the first half, and I was just wondering if this is now going to stretched over the next three years. That would be quite a meaningful benefit for your cost income ratio before it goes closer to the 60% cost income. So, whatever you are right in assuming in 2009, the benefit of changing from cash to share based compensation, the benefit to the cost income ratio might be as high as 3, 4 percentage points coming down in the next year. Then secondly I was just wondering on the progress you made on the reduction and risk weighted assets. Are you willing to give us any update if this has been reflected in the reduction of your total assets from the 2.3 trillion at the end of the first half? And then just lastly follow-up, I think Fran&#xE7;ois  asked this before as well. I was just wondering if you have any number for the coverage of MPL at BancWest, should be assume that at least in line with your group level given the high provisions in the last quarter. And then just lastly, on the size of your shipping portfolio, and should be assume that Q3 provisions were sort of like a clean-up and that should be over? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Total assets. Yes, sorry I can't. We are not closing balance sheet at the end of September, so I can't give you kind of precise figure. The trend was somewhat down certainly, but I don't have the magnitude of that. Now on the, yes, the coverage ratio at BancWest, here I have more precise figures. We stand at 85%. I mean loan on lease losses to non-performing loans at BancWest and non-occurring loan on leases is 85% at the end of the third quarter. And the &#x2013; on the shipping portfolio, I will give you the size of the shipping portfolio. Yes we have tried to &#x2013; industry is in difficulty clearly due to the restriction in international trade. And so we have tried to anticipate the <mark type="inaudible" /> in that business and we -- yes normally we should and we should cover some -- for some time bad evolutions, <mark type="inaudible" /> and then asset securitization we have on shipping that they stand at roughly $1 billion, so --</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi &#x2013; I would say two remaining questions, the first one related to the insurance business, could you kind of give us the amount of impacts you booked in Q3 to reinforce <mark type="inaudible" /> from reserve in equity in order to give us more an idea of what could be kind of dollar run rate for the revenue in trends? And my second question is related the cost of risk in financing, you perhaps already answered this  question earlier, sorry if it is a case, but if we deduct the kind of <mark type="inaudible" /> there on the cost of risk of the financing activity. We had a quite significant decrease in case we compare to Q2, do you consider it is more one-off item or do we have to consider it as a kind of run-rate for the next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, the cost of risk in financing business in CIB has some volatility also, because one big file is enough to change the order of magnitude on the cost. And this is the first remark, and the second remark is that you should not mark <mark type="inaudible" /> is that the evolution of the NPLs was relatively low quarter-on-quarter we had, but we still had small increase of &#x2013; only of 3%. I mean, between the second and the third quarter of 2009, which is relatively low compared to the competition and which is encouraging. So, this is the only indication I can give you. I think in -- again the cost of risk is difficult to anticipate. All of a sudden you can have the company being in bad shape without an early sign, and so well you have to remain -- it's difficult to make predictions. But clearly there is -- it seems that the peak is behind us. Now on the insurance business &#x2013; no, I'm sorry. I'm not going to give you the figure, because it's kind of an important figure in terms of competition to <mark type="inaudible" />. The only thing I can tell you is that as you may know, in the insurance business, they do have in the general fund, they have this number of shares. Part of their investment in these shares and part of those share investments are &#x2013; for technical reasons they are in mark-to-market mode. In fact, the P&amp;L of the insurance or the revenues of the insurance accounting-wise they are linked to the stock exchange to a certain extent. And when the markets are going down they suffer, and when the markets are going up, like in this quarter the natural evolution of an insurance company is to show good results. And in fact, we decided to kind of reinvest that this good evolution of the quarter and even more than that in the increase of the shareholder surplus reserve in order to be well placed in case of reversal of trend.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon Philippe. Two questions, first one based on <mark type="inaudible" /> 10 and 11 of your selected exposure, could you give the results for your commercial real estate disclosure in the US and second question is regarding <mark type="inaudible" /> finance. I mean clearly this quarter is record jumps of in terms of provision margin and it has been part of <mark type="inaudible" /> were reduced. Can you give us a guidance on how we will see this pre-provision margin going forward. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We, starting with the questions, the pre-provision margin was helped by I would say mostly three factors; one on the revenue side is the fact that in environment, where interest rates are going down, and where cost of risk is relatively high, the consumer lending  competitors are &#x2013; they managed to reduce the rate to the client at a lower pace, so they there opening wider margins on the -- between the client's rate and refinancing rate. And this is probably going to remain sometime in the low rate, and given the fact that all competitors are facing the high cost of risks, so they are not inclined to higher price. So, this is one thing. And the second thing,  which helped on the cost side is the reduction in &#x2013; structural reduction in cost we have reviewed a certain number of structures both in developed countries, we have optimized structure and we have launched cost cutting programs even before the crisis, and they are now maturing and providing us with complete consequences, positive consequences. And also we have kept closer, we are going out at the number of marginal countries. We are not yet at breakeven point. And so it improves also, that reduces cost. <mark type="inaudible" /> this is example, there are a few like that. We are reducing significantly in Romania, in Bulgaria, things like that in difficult countries. But the third thing, but on this last <mark type="inaudible" />, the two first ones should remain, but the third thing was that we cut the marketing costs quite significantly in the stock, and if this is -- as soon as we see the light at the end of the tunnel, we will resume advertising, <mark type="inaudible" /> any results network or a very limited network, so they rely on marketing complaints to attract values and so as soon as we will be in a more expansive mode I would say, as soon as the situation <mark type="inaudible" /> we will stabilize. We will resume some <mark type="inaudible" />. So it's normal and &#x2013; it is normal to see some &#x2013; the latest factor is temporary.</p>
          <p>Now about the page 10 and 11 of the FSF, do you want some comments on the commercial real estate exposure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes exactly. And basically on your core <mark type="inaudible" /> specifically on your exposure which is at the end of the calendar?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Behind balance <mark type="inaudible" />, we have the home builders,  the property companies and others excluding, are not occupied in real estate yet. The loan provision occupied, if we -- well for the others you have the &#x2013; what we call the none other occupied and none home builders, and <mark type="inaudible" /> it primarily comprises of commercial loans secured by &#x2013; because of this of trust on commercial properties and so we have offices to let if you want.</p>
          <p>So we have &#x2013; it's mostly offices, land and some hotels as well and for the bulk of the exposure at BancWest, so you also have some farm and functions. So, the sector is facing some difficulties in the current environment and we -- I mean, we expect the trend to keep worsening through 2009 and even probably next year. The only thing is that the &#x2013; you know the fragility is about investors having borrowed money in order to invest in that kind of real estate properties, and in order to let them and to prepay their loans with the rents and we -- this has been I would say helped by the fact that the refinancing cost has dropped to zero almost, a very low interest rate in the US and as long as federal reserve is not increasing, the interest rate in the US the situation will remain kind of, probably stabilized somewhat by this slow refinancing cost. This is what I and you will feel instead. And the exposure on page 11 on Fortis is much, much lower and the others, our US REIT and some UK <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

          <p>Last question comes from Eric Vanpoucke from Oppenheim, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just three quick questions. The first one, I was pretty surprised by the reaction from one of the rating agencies. I mean, if there any misunderstanding between you and rating agencies for instance. I mean if we exclude of course some of the contribution of Fortis, all the points raised in their report. The second question is regarding the exposure to Spain. I mean, can we have them <mark type="inaudible" /> pretty high residual exposures in Spain. Can we have some idea of the situation there? Even so I understand, certain financial services &#x2013; it was improving. I mean, I am thinking about real estate for instance. The last one is regarding Turkey. We heard that you made decision to restructure turkey and to consolidate your activity there. Can you elaborate on that or should we wait till 1st of December.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm afraid you will have to wait. Nobody gave in one about Turkey. The situation is that with Turkey, we have now &#x2013; we now have a bank in Turkey which we hold which we have the full control of, and on the other hand on the BNP Paribas side, we as you know we have CIB on the joint control basis with the founder of CIB on the 50-50 basis, so I would say merger potential which is as exciting in Turkey as it is elsewhere. It is a bit more competitive to implement due to the side that it's a three-way negotiation and not only something which can be done purely on a bilateral basis between BNP Paribas teams and BNP Paribas Fortis team.</p>
          <p>So we are currently in discussion and I hope we'll able to tell you more on the 1st of December I am sure. And now the rating agencies, I don't know what kind of reaction you are referring to, I have not seen any reaction today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. not today I mean it was &#x2013; I think two weeks ago, when the outlook was revised downward and --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The outcome we put in the review and we were on the negative outlook and we're putting the review. Well, I was very surprised myself, so I can't explain anything. You should ask them, I mean, I hope they will revise their views following this year, today's results, that's only thing I can tell you. Now the exposure to Spain, yes, you mean on personal finance or marginally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Marginally speaking because if you have a look, I mean to consolidated exposure, you have I mean on real estate for instance, and not only specifically on our financial services, I mean you left with pretty high assets and I just would like to -- I mean if you have seen any further deterioration or we should expect any?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If that's from personal finance, we have an exposure to spend through CIB on the real estate, on commercial real estate. It's recorded on page 10 of financial stability for exposure. So we try to &#x2013; it is an exposure which is linked to corporates working in the industry of commercial real estate and its property companies things like that. We try to limit as much as we can of course, we have been trying to limit for several months now and we -- in fact the bulk of the exposure is 600 million commercial mortgage loan positions through the securitization warehouse activity. And it's a very good quality exposure and we are not overtly worried by it. So this is our main exposure to staying on real-estate from personal finance which you know. That's it. Okay.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from Guillaume Tiberghien from Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes hi, I have two small questions. One relates to the swing in AfS reserve between the minus 1.5 billion of Q2 and plus 1.1 of Q3, could you just give us a little granularity on what it is exactly? And secondly I still struggle to make a forecast for the provision in the capital market division in the part of corporate and investment banking, can you help us give us a bit of feel as to exactly what sort of counterparts you are talking about? And maybe whether you can guide us for what to expect in 2010 in that section of the provision line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Starting with the second question, normally the capital market provision should come down further to get to zero. In normal market situation, it's extremely low and it is &#x2013; it used to be extremely low before the crisis, and it has to come back to close to zero I think. So we still have, we still have some corporate counterparts mostly being in difficulty, and having being in, not able to reimburse the value, the floors they hold to us, through swaps or structure of  product and we &#x2013; I think it is really the aftermath of the crisis and it should not last really. We had this quarter, half of it is related to one specific file. I think it's really something which should not last.</p>
          <p>The AfS reserve, yes, we plus the swing from minus 1.5 to plus 1.1 this is the total valuation of reserve and you have to want to bring it down. Clearly the bulk of it is while it is coming from the AfS, the really AfS again and has been somewhat offset, so it is plus 2.4 billion in fact, and it has been offset, but to that you have to add the Latin gains of capital on cash flow hedges which are also part of the valuation reserves, 700 million and on the other side, you have the ForEx translation adjustments and due to the fall in dollar, and this is negative figure in the quarter. It has been reduced by 1.9 billion from foreign translation adjustment. So you see you have plus and minuses.</p>
          <p>In the Latin gains of AfS it is coming mostly from -- while you have that equity aspect of it and due the recovery in the stock market, you have the fixed income aspect of it due to the decline in long-term interest rate, the combination of both, the addition of both.</p>
