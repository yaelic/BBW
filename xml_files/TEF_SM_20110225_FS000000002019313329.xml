        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mar&#xED;a. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and thank you for attending Telef&#xF3;nica's 2010 full-year results conference call. Today I have with me Julio Linares, Chief Operating Officer; Santiago Fern&#xE1;ndez Valbuena, Chief Strategy Officer; Guillermo Ansaldo, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a; Jos&#xE9; Mar&#xED;a &#xC1;lvarez-Pallete, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Latin America; Matthew Key, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Europe; and Miguel Escrig, Chief Financial Officer. During the question-and-answer session, you will have the opportunity to ask questions directly to any of them.</p>
          <p>2010 achievement reinforce our track record as a highly predictable and reliable company and proves our differential profile in the industry with tangible results.</p>
          <p>First, in 2010, we have posted a solid set of results, delivering superior top line growth, best in class profitability and high cash generation. A strong execution and diversification have been key for this strong performance. Let me highlight that Latin America accounted for 43% of group sales, while our push in mobile broadband data has delivered a 90% annual organic growth in mobile data revenue.</p>
          <p>This was achieved in the context of a strong commercial effort, resulting in a very rapid expansion of the customer base and the acceleration of restructuring measures that will further increase efficiency in the future. Second, we have completed key strategic transactions, particularly the acquisition of 50% of Brasilcel following the M&amp;A path set in October 2009.</p>
          <p>Third, we continue delivering on our commitments, meeting our 2010 guidance and maintaining our robust balance sheet. Of this, we're leaving cash returns for our shareholders, raising the dividend for 2011, 40% year-on-year to &#x20AC;1.60 per share.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide number three to review 2010 major financial metrics. Reported year-on-year growth rates were impacted by several non-recurring effects, change in consolidation, especially the full consolidation of Vivo in the fourth quarter, and ForEx.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, underlying results remain very robust. Revenue increased 7.1% in nominal terms to &#x20AC;60.7 billion, and &#x20AC;2.4 billion year-on-year on organic terms. 2010 OIBDA exceeded &#x20AC;25.8 billion, up 40% or 0.8% in organic terms. As pertains to cash flow generation, operating cash flow almost reached &#x20AC;15 billion in 2010 despite increased CapEx and spectrum acquisition. Net income exceeded the &#x20AC;10 billion mark, increasing by 71% over the previous year.</p>
          <p>At the OIBDA level, the &#x20AC;3.8 billion positive impact deriving from the revaluation of our pre-existing stake in Vivo was partially offset by a decision to accelerate operations restructuring, which led to non-recurring restructuring expenses amounting to &#x20AC;1.3 billion in the second half of the year, &#x20AC;1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. On top of that, in the fourth quarter of the year, we had the impact of tax asset reassessment in Colombia.</p>
          <p>Non-recurrent restructuring expenses were mainly related with personnel reorganization &#x20AC;658 million and firm commitments relating to the Telef&#xF3;nica Foundation's social activities. This reached &#x20AC;400 million in total, 70% recorded at Telef&#xF3;nica and the remaining 30% at Telef&#xF3;nica Latinoam&#xE9;rica.</p>
          <p>Depreciation and amortization increased year-on-year reporting &#x20AC;84 million in the fourth quarter, due to the amortization of the Vivo purchase price allocation. We estimate an annual impact our depreciation and amortization of around &#x20AC;650 million for the next five years, so this impact are preliminary and unaudited. As a result, earnings per share reached &#x20AC;2.25, above our target of &#x20AC;2.10 per share.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide number five, the value oriented strategy across the group is behind the strong commercial performance recorded in the 2010, which has allowed us to maintain our strong competitive position. We focused our commercial investments on value and growth levers. Mobile broadband data continue to expand with a year-on-year increase of 64% to reach the 22 million mark. The contract segment kept gaining traction, accounting for 53% of 2000 (sic) [2010] mobile net adds. Fixed broadband net adds increased over 44% in organic terms. As a result, we now manage over 288 million accesses, 7% more than a year ago in organic terms.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to slide number six for the review of the top line. Reported revenue growth recorded a fourth sequential quarter of improvement, ramping up 9 percentage points from 2009 year-end, underpinned by the faster customer base expansion and the full consolidation of Vivo in October 2010.</p>
          <p>In organic terms, sales sustained a positive trend posted up to September, showing a healthy 2.4% year-on-year growth. Excluding that for MTR cuts, organic sales growth jumped to 3.4% year-over-year, 190 basis points more than a year ago, on the back of our strong commercial efforts to drive penetration and usage growth.</p>
          <p>Slide number seven outlines the high-class diversification of our sales. For an additional perspective Telef&#xF3;nica Latin continues to be the key growth driver of the group. Telef&#xF3;nica Europe also posted some numbers, compensating the lower contribution form Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a.</p>
          <p>From a business perspective, we are increasing our exposure to the high growth business both on connectivity, applications and new service revenues were already 23% of our total sales in 2010, three points more than a year ago, with significant growth rate across those services. Please turn now to the next slide to get more color on our mobile broadband strategy.</p>
          <p>Mobile broadband adoption is booming in our markets and we are capturing this growth opportunity. Mobile broadband active users already account for 10% of the total mobile base, 3 percentage points more than the previous year, backed by the increasing penetration of the smartphones. I would like to say that 20% mobile broadband penetration mark already achieved in our European footprint, while the 5% level reached in Latin America gave us a very clear opportunity for the future, as handset costs continue to decline very rapidly.</p>
          <p>As a result, mobile data revenue recorded a solid 19% year-on-year increase, principally in organic, driving over 32% growth in non-P2P SMS sales. Please notice that we have already launched tier pricing across our footprints, which will allow us to profitably monetize the data opportunity. On top of that we continue to enlarge our handset portfolio, leveraging our scale to further reduce cost. It was great to see the new devices, applications, and continuous innovations in the recent Mobile World Congress. This is key to further stimulate growth in the mobile data business.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide number five (sic) [nine], in 2010, we retained a benchmark profitability in a contest of renewed commercial efforts to drive future revenue expansion. Underlying OIBDA trends improved throughout the year. As we had previously outlined driven by sales expansion, further advances in cost control initiatives and tactical synergies, our integrated management model and also from our global initiatives. The acceleration of the restructuring measures announced will further enhance efficiency in the future. As such, underlying OIBDA margin stood at 78.3 for the Group, virtually stable year-over-year in organic basis.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to slide number 10, total CapEx reached &#x20AC;10.8 billion in 2010, rising close to 50% year-on-year mainly due to investments in the spectrum in Germany and Mexico totaling &#x20AC;2.6 billion. In organic terms and stripping out spectrum acquisitions, CapEx increased 6% year-on-year to support growing usage and fast customer expansion.</p>
          <p>By regions, the spend in Latin America underpins the increasing CapEx, with focused investments in fixed broadband and mobile broadband networks. Lower CapEx at Telef&#xF3;nica Europe was driven by Germany, where we already have a high quality owned network. 77% of the group CapEx, excluding the spectrum cost, was devoted to growth and transformation. We maintain this accounting for the remaining.</p>
          <p>Let me just finish this session highlighting that we have delivered on our annual target for eight years in a row, as slide number 11 outlined. Now let me hand over the call to Santiago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you C&#xE9;sar, and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Let me now summarize the performance of our businesses in Spain, where we have delivered on the business priorities that we announced for the year.</p>
          <p>With a backdrop of strong competition and a weaker than anticipated telecoms market, our value oriented commercial activity allowed us to maintain our undisputed leadership in the market with an estimated revenue share of 53%, and limited erosion year-on-year. We have also retained a comparable benchmark OIBDA margin of close to 47% in spite of reinvesting efficiency gains to set the basis for future growth.</p>
          <p>Cost cutting measures in those areas where OpEx is manageable in the very short term have been already implemented, leading to a 3% year-on-year decline in non-labor costs on a comparable basis, despite increased commercial efforts.</p>
          <p>Cash flow generation remained strong with an operating cash flow margin of 36% on comparable terms, again the best in class mark. Taking into account the significant purchasing revenues, the increased CapEx and higher commercial volumes year-on-year, it should be highlighted the efficient management of the working capital which allowed to limit the decline in operating cash flow after working capital in reported terms to 5.5%, well below the drop in the operating cash flow numbers.</p>
          <p>On slide number 15, we outlined the top line performance in Spain. On top of challenging economic conditions, adverse regulatory measures explain 1.4 percentage points of the 4.4% year-on-year decline in revenues.</p>
          <p>ULL prices in Spain are not only the lowest it was in Europe, but they are also below our costs according to the regulators cost accounting methodology. In our view, current prices are not sustainable. Obviously, competitors are taking advantage of these attractive prices to launch aggressive commercial campaigns in the fixed broadband market, therefore impacting our retail access and fixed broadband revenues. These together with lower the consumption patterns are the main drivers of the decline in sales.</p>
          <p>Price pressure intensified in the fourth quarter of the year and has continued during the first months of 2011, with the traditional rational network competitors launching very aggressive campaigns. So, there might be some regulatory consequences. As according to the press, one player has sued one of them in the CMT, the local regulator for dumping.</p>
          <p>We continue to focus on value. Therefore, though this situation is also affecting our pricing policy leading to higher promotions we keep upgrading and enhancing our fixed broadband offer to increase its perceived value and to preserve the valuable market. We expect competitive rationality to come back to the market.</p>
          <p>To finish up with Spain, I'd like to stress that we keep working to have a more competitive cost structure. On top of the initiatives already launched that have allowed non-labor costs to go down in 2010, we're making progress in our goal to reshape personnel expenses and we aim to accelerate these measures in the coming months.</p>
          <p>We are already reducing management positions in Spain and we are analyzing the potential outsourcing of some operations and further head count restructuring processes. At the same time, we will negotiate with labor unions to have more flexible labor conditions and pay reviews not linked to CPI. We will continue optimizing operational commercial cost where further capitalizing group scale will lead to additional savings.</p>
          <p>Finally, an active management of our asset portfolio should help us to deliver a healthy profitability, which will continue to be benchmark in this sector.</p>
          <p>Please turn now to slide number 15 to review our Latin American operations. 2010 results confirm the success of a profitable growth model on the back of an integrated management of the operations in the region, a model that is now bringing benefit to Vivo, as the company is already under full control of Telef&#xF3;nica. Revenues for Latin American increased 7% year-on-year in organic terms up to December fueled by the double-digit growth in MSRs and sequential acceleration of fixed broadband revenues.</p>
          <p>OIBDA performance was strong with year-on-year growth ramping up to 9% in organic terms by year end leading to a solid OIBDA margin of close to 40%, if we exclude the capital gain from the revaluation of our pre-existing stake in Vivo and non-recurring charges booked in the fourth quarter of the year. The improvement in profitability was achieved despite higher commercial volumes, especially mobile contract. And in 2010, mobile contract net adds reached 6.7 million. They were almost half of total net additions, a benchmark ratio for the region. As a result, we reached 184 million total accesses by the end of 2010 or 9% higher than a year ago.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide number 16, on mobile, we are enjoying the perfect combination of growing voice and data revenues. The strong net adds and the higher quality of the accesses growth drove double-digit growth in MSRs with positive growth in voice revenues and over 40% year-on-year increase in data revenues shows our focus on enhancing customer value.</p>
          <p>Our strategy in the region is not about capturing growth at any price, but to focus on commercial efforts in the higher value segment. This is proven by the sound performance of the contract segment, up 29% year-on-year in 2010, on the back of higher gross adds, lower churn rates and an active prepaid to contract migration policy.</p>
          <p>It's also worth noting the strong push in mobile broadband accesses, which have almost doubled versus 2009, and already account for over 5% of our total mobile base in the region. As a consequence, ARPU ex foreign exchange remained almost flat year-on-year, despite the 11% rise in the customer base and negative regulatory impact.</p>
          <p>Regarding our wireline business in Latin America, in 2010, we posted a strong commercial momentum, which gradually lead to an improved trends in financial metrics through the year. Broadband accesses rose 16% year-on-year and the back of very strong net adds, which almost tripled versus 2009, reflecting the success of our strategic levers, bundles and churn contention leveraging enhanced quality.</p>
          <p>It's also worth mentioning the positive evolution of fixed accesses, which remained virtually stable year-on-year as we continue to push bundles. Pay TV also delivered positive performance in the fourth quarter leading to a 9% year-on-year increase in the access base. As a result Internet and Pay TV revenues growth improved sequentially to account for 22% of total wireline revenues in 2010 and growing contribution across our markets.</p>
          <p>On slide number 18, we view the strong results recorded in Brazil in 2010 with fourth quarter figures confirming the trends already delivered up to September. In Telesp, our efforts to enhance quality led to a record level of fixed broadband net adds, over 680,000 accesses.</p>
          <p>More importantly, the company continued to regain market share leveraging an enhanced broadband offer. We also managed to turn around the traditional business through the positive growth in the customer base versus significant line losses in 2009. As a result, the financial metrics continued to gradually recover through the year, especially on the top line.</p>
          <p>On the other side, Vivo continues to outperform in a very competitive wireless market with even better results in the fourth quarter. The focus on quality growth allowed Vivo to gain market share in the contract segment, which accounted for a third of total net adds in 2010. Thus, the strong rise in customers and the actions to foster voice and data usage led to a healthy 11% increase in mobile service revenue in 2010 with an acceleration in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Profitability improved with OIBDA margin expansion year-on-year despite increased commercial efforts and efficiency initiatives. Again, a very different performance versus our key competitors.</p>
          <p>I also like to highlight that we are fully on track with the capture of synergies derived from the combination of Vivo and Telesp. We will provide further details on the execution process in our Investor Day, but we are very positive above all the opportunities we have ahead of us.</p>
          <p>And last with Brazil, let me remind you that the tender offer for Vivo's ordinary shares has already been launched and is expected to finish by the third week of March. The total outflow will be &#x2013; should be below &#x20AC;800 million, in line with our expectations.</p>
          <p>On the other side, the corporate restructuring of Vivo and Telesp is also on track with the full process expected by the end of the first half of this year. And to finish up with Latin America, on slide number 20, we will just make two comments on Mexico and Venezuela.</p>
          <p>Mexico in 2010, we continue to gain market share. We reshuffled our prepaid offer in the fourth quarter, already leading to better commercial results as prepayment adds doubled quarter-on-quarter. Nevertheless it is too soon to see the results in financial metrics, but we expect sequential improvements throughout 2011. We have also strengthened our position through the investment in spectrum, which should lead to better results in the mobile broadband market in 2011.</p>
          <p>In Venezuela, we posted strong financial results leveraging a very robust increase in data revenues despite lower commercial activity impacted mainly by limited availability of handsets.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to slide number 21 to review Telef&#xF3;nica Europe that delivered strong financial and operating performance in 2010 with continued expansion of our customer base and the fast growth of mobile data revenues. Of our new mobile customers, 65% were in the contract segment and now represent close to 50% of the base. Significantly, active users of mobile broadband increased 46% year-on-year in 2010, resulting in a customer base of close to 10 million. As a result, organic revenue accelerated its growth trend throughout the year topping a 7% year-on-year growth when excluding MTR cuts underpinned by the healthy organic rise in non-SMS P2P revenue, 26% year-on-year in 2010.</p>
          <p>We managed to maintain a stable OIBDA margin in 2010 despite higher commercial investment recording a very solid 17% operating cash flow growth both in comparable terms.</p>
          <p>On slide number 22, we show that Telef&#xF3;nica O2 UK showed strong results in 2010, underpinned by the growth of mobile broadband while mobile core continued to excel. 23% of our customer base actually pay for using data services at year-end 2010, which is a significant 7-percentage point improvement over 2009. We advanced on our goal to profitably monetize the mobile data opportunity with an introduction of data caps in the fourth quarter, already taken by 36% of retail mobile contract data users. We also reduced handset subsidies in the fourth quarter leading to higher hardware revenues. As a result, total revenue growth for the year was 6.5% year-on-year in local currency and obtained by the strong 5.6% rise in mobile service revenue despite the drive for MTR cuts. Continued efficiency led to sounds 7% year-on-year OIBDA growth in comparable terms.</p>
          <p>We also increased our investment in the network including the recent 900-megahertz reforming to ensure best-in-class quality. Let's now turn to slide number 23, to explain the performance of Telef&#xF3;nica O2 Germany. 2010 continued to deliver growth in the mobile business in particularly in the contract segment, which accounted for over 50% of total net adds in the fourth quarter. This was driven by improved customer service and strong demand for mobile broadband, including the iPhone, which we have been selling from October.</p>
          <p>LTE network rollout in rural areas is already in progress with most of the planned sites for this year located in existing O2 premises and commercial operations due to begin in the second quarter of 2011, after successful trials with customers in four locations.</p>
          <p>Mobile service revenue growth accelerated through 2010 to 5% year-on-year in the fourth quarter excluding mobile termination rate cuts, which were helped in December. This compounded with My Handy HanseNet model, which does not allocate subsidies into mobile service revenues led to a strong 8% organic year-on-year increase in total revenues for the year.</p>
          <p>Profitability improved sharply in 2010 through the tangible synergies with HanseNet and continued operational efficiencies leading to an operating cash flow that more than tripled 2009 figures in comparable terms.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide 24, I would like to highlight that we have generated close to &#x20AC;8.5 billion cash and dedicated 80% of it nearly &#x20AC;6.8 billion to shareholder remuneration.</p>
          <p>One the first chart, you will see that our debt has increased by &#x20AC;12 billion in the year of which &#x20AC;8.6 billion are due to financial investments, mainly the Vivo acquisition, and &#x20AC;2.4 billion to changes in foreign exchange. Close to 50% of those are due to the Bolivar devaluation in Venezuela.</p>
          <p>Even so, our financial flexibility at the beginning of the year has allowed us to accommodate this increase without exceeding our 2.5 times limit for the debt and commitments over OIBDA as shown on the bottom chart. That limit is respected both in our reported basis and if adjusted by adding Vivo's OIBDA, not consolidated in the first nine months and subtracting the positive result of the gains on the sale of fixed assets net of non-recurrent restructuring expenses.</p>
          <p>If we remove the current restructuring expenses other than the firm commitment to Telef&#xF3;nica Foundation, the net debt leverage ratio would not exceed &#x2013; will still not exceed 2.5 times.</p>
          <p>Turning to the next slide, we showed that we have decreased our effective interest rate tax ex of FX at 5% of our debt, 55 &#x2013; this is 54 basis points lower than 2009, while implementing prudent financial management.</p>
          <p>So we have succeeded in keeping our financial expenses ex foreign exchange at &#x20AC;2.5 billion, nearly exactly the same level as we had in 2009, excluding from the previous year about &#x20AC;600 million charge, due to hyperinflation in Venezuela. All this despite the aforementioned debt increase.</p>
          <p>On our financial management, let me mention first that we have taken advantage of the low rate environment to increase our fixed rate debt by close to &#x20AC;13 billion, though &#x20AC;6.8 billion years has been implemented through forward swaps starting to fix our debt in the middle of 2011.</p>
          <p>The weighted average interest rate of these swaps is 2.7% with average maturity in 2017. Had we fixed this amount of debt at the end of January 2011 we estimate that the equivalent cost would have been 60 basis points higher at 3.3%.</p>
          <p>Second, we have been reinforcing our liquidity position by increasing our undrawn committed credit lines up to &#x20AC;9 billion, &#x20AC;1.8 billion up in the year, with 100% of the amount of the credit lines maturing in 2010 rolled out successfully.</p>
          <p>Lastly, we have raised around &#x20AC;16 billion long-term financing in 2010, &#x20AC;8 billion through a syndicated loan, close to &#x20AC;6 billion through bond issues, and around &#x20AC;2 billion in LatAm financing and public entities.</p>
          <p>Despite the less active fourth quarter leading to one quarter reduction in the average life of our debt in the quarter, not surprisingly, the issuance at the beginning of the year by &#x20AC;3.2 billion should be enough to slightly exceed our six years medium term limit for the average life of our prior debt.</p>
          <p>With this, let me now hand back the call to our Chairman.</p>

          <p>Thank you Santiago. Let me share now with you our priorities for 2011. We continue to prioritize our revenue growth, leveraging our diversification. Final momentum of Telef&#xF3;nica LatAm and Telef&#xF3;nica Europe, with a base topline pressure in Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a. We focus our efforts on capturing our data mobile growth opportunity in our footprint. We commenced our efforts oriented to increasing customer value and therefore quality growth.</p>
          <p>As a result and according to the other criteria, group revenue is expected to increase up to 2% in 2011. We report the growth rate being significantly higher due to the full consolidation of Vivo in the group accounts in the fourth quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Despite increased commercial activity, we will be able to deliver an industry-leading profitability. We expect group EBITDA margin to be in the upper 30s, limiting margin erosions despite high commercial activity based on executing our profitable growth business model further leverage in the scale economics and benefits from global initiatives.</p>
          <p>Total CapEx ex the spectrum cost should be around &#x20AC;9 billion this year, and we continue setting the foundation for future growth, improving network capabilities to support the mobile data explosion and further growth in fixed broadband.</p>
          <p>CapEx, excluding the spectrum acquisitions, will go up in LatAm and Spain, remaining nearly flat in Europe, despite higher investments in the United Kingdom network. But you should notice that the full consolidation of Vivo have a significant impact in this figure. We are fully consolidating 100% of Vivo CapEx in 2011, which is expected to be around R$2.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Please be aware that the quarterly return is going to be severely back loaded. As the market recovery in Spain takes longer to materialize and the bulk of the synergies in Vivo and Telesp start after the operational integration is completed.</p>
          <p>In 2011, we will honor our commitments to deliver growing dividends. There are no key strategic transactions pending on the M&amp;A front. And therefore, the focus will be on acquiring additional spectrum in countries we are already present to secure future growth. We will continue analyzing value creation opportunities, maintain an active management of our non-core asset portfolio. And we expect to improve the leverage ratio. Therefore the Board will propose a dividend &#x2013; execution of the dividend of &#x20AC;1.3 in 2011 growing 14.3% year-on-year. Usually the dividend will be paid in two tranches. Free cash flow payout is clearly below the 100%. With no doubt , we do reiterate our commitment to pay &#x20AC;1.75 in dividends next year.</p>
          <p>Regional priorities are outlined on slide 28. So, there is one clear common priority for all of them: Increase the value of the customer base and monetize the mobile broadband opportunity in a very profitable way.</p>
          <p>By region, in Spain, where we defend our revenue leadership with a rational commercial approach focused on leveraging our integrated profile, while we aim to force the broadband revenues both fixed and mobile and to capture the remaining growth opportunities in the corporate SMEs where the demand for ICT service will recover strongly in 2011.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, we will speed up the integration of fixed and mobile business to maximize the benefit of being integrated, maintaining at the same time a strong commercial momentum. In Europe, we aim to continue outperforming in the contract segment and to the lead the mobile broadband monetization.</p>
          <p>In summary, our high-class diversification with a growing bias toward emerging markets and integrated operations will allow us to deliver further top line expansion and to prove we continue to generate a strong cash flow for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>To recap, we have delivered a solid set of numbers at the Group level. Leveraging our high-class diversification and our strong execution skills that mitigate external challenges. Once again, we have met year-on-year targets for the eighth year in a row. We have also completed the key strategic transactions in 2010, positioning us much better for the future and with them in the path set in October 2009.</p>
          <p>And finally in 2011, we will continue to focus on capturing the growth opportunities of the digital world while maintaining premium returns.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention. I hope you will join us in our next Investor Day in London where we will share with you the main challenges and opportunities for the industry and we will provide an update on Telef&#xF3;nica's strategy for the coming years.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon everyone. Couple of question from me, first of all, just on the revenue guidance you've given, can you just elaborate a little on the assumptions for Spain within, I know Santiago you said that January had been very similar to Q4, are you actually assuming things get a great deal better in 2011? So just a little more thought around that please. And then second of all, just on the restructuring and Telef&#xF3;nica Foundation charges to OIBDA, could you give us some guidance on how they will feed through the cash flow statement please in 2011, whether there are immediate impacts, or whether they run over a certain period? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding our revenue guidance, and looking into Spain, we expect strong commercial activity in Spain, value oriented, focused on total broadband, both fixed and mobile, and we expect a downward recovery in consumption on the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, this is Santiago. On the restructuring charges, what we've done is accept as irrevocable some of the commitments that have been previously done with the Telef&#xF3;nica Foundation, especially to fund our star program, which is called Proni&#xF1;o and you may have very well heard of it. By being &#x2013; by making this irrevocable commitment, we had to register in our accounts the full amount that is going to be disbursed over a three to four year period. So the hit in the cash flow is going to be spread out over three to four years depending on whether we are looking at Latin America or Europe.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Couple of questions from me. The first is just around the way you framed your guidance, which is obviously somewhat open-ended to the downside. Normally you give a much more precise range of guidance. I'd just like to understand why you've changed that, obviously one conclusion could be that with the uncertainty in Spain there is less visibility at this point in the year than normal. So if you could talk to that a bit I'd be grateful. Secondly, you talk in the release also about regulatory pressures, some of your peers have articulated the size of regulatory impact this year on revenue and EBITDA for the major markets, I guess, particularly in Europe. If you could do the same that will be most helpful. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Santiago again, let me take the first part of the question on how we frame the guidance. After having given it a lot of thought, and having made all the comparisons, we've decided that besides building credibility, which is what we've been able to build over the past 8 years, as the Chairman explained, we should build some flexibility going forward.</p>
          <p>We think we are in a growing sector and that's why we are &#x2013; and certainly we're a growing company and that's why we've guided to positive growth, a modest but positive growth Group-wide for 2011. But we wanted to hold a few of our cards in case that we have to fight back on some commercial fronts or we want to increase the commercial efforts, should those be necessary. So it is not our intention to be vague, it's our intention to become more flexible than we have been in the past and that's why we have farmed it the way we have.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, two questions please. First with regard to CapEx. I think I understood well that you plan to increase CapEx in Spain, maybe if you could give us a little bit of color as to where that CapEx will go? Second, with regards to Latin America there was a very noticeable reacceleration in mobile service revenue growth in pretty much all the countries. And maybe if you could give a little bit more color in terms of whether that was driven by more volumes or a better pricing environment? And the follow-up to that would be if you fear or you include maybe a potential negative impact from the rising inflation in some of these countries. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mathieu, this is Guillermo, I will take the first question regarding CapEx in Spain. Yes, what our priorities or policy for next year regarding CapEx in Spain is the following: we will continue investing in the future in the next few years. Second, we will continue focusing on value customers. And third, we will focus on premium quality. That means that we will continue investing heavily on 3G, since we are seeing great growth opportunities and profitability there.</p>
          <p>Second, we will continue investing on SMEs and corporates where we now have a very strong market position and that means fiber for this type of customers, new services, cloud computing, machine-to-machine and so on. Third, we continue with our very selective deployment in fiber for the residential and software business. That will mean that the CapEx level will be about the same level, a little bit over the number that we have in 2010, and also please take into account, when you compare Spain with other incumbent operators in Europe we are in the lower part of the range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Mathieu, taking your question on Latin America on the revenue, on the service revenue growth, in fact it is due to both parties volume as traffic keeps growing, and the results, percent of value that we have been able to focus on value and foster migration to prepaid to postpaid and prioritizing contract customers with regard to prepaid. And as a result we have been able to reach our customer base, which is in concert, which is almost, I mean that's surpassing 20% of the total customer base at the end of 2010 as well as we keep significantly growing data revenues, which are growing 43.4%, with an ARPU that is practically stable. So it's a mix of different effects, we have been managing our customer base, the existing one and the new adds, and we keep focusing, really focus on the value customers.</p>
          <p>With regard to inflation, I mean inflation is much more focused, as you know, in two countries, Venezuela and Argentina. In those countries we are holding up as much as we can with inflation on the mobile tariffs. In other countries, in fact we are holding on pretty well, namely in Brazil, where you know that the euro has been having an outstanding year. So it's a mix of different effects. I would outline the customer, the contract, the postpaid focus that we have been having, the value that we have been &#x2013; the value focus that we have been having and in fact trying to be much more effective in terms of campaigns and subsidizing less in terms of handset.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, good afternoon. Two questions, please. Number one is on Venezuela, if you could give me any update on cash and if there is any improvement in terms of getting the cash out. And secondly on Brazil, Vivo is clearly outperforming all its competitors, which I think is mainly driven by the focus on data. So, looking into 2011, where all the competitors are investing more, where do you think that is sustainable and also on the MTR cuts in Brazil, is it more likely that we don't see any MTR cuts in 2011 now? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello Torsten. Regarding the cash we have in Venezuela, it's equivalent roughly speaking to &#x20AC;1.1 billion, this year we have been granted authorization to pay import denominated in U.S. dollar for around $500 million in the year and we have been able to reappropriate a small amount based on structure notes. We have not been granted access to dividends, but we have been claiming for the year and we expect that this could happen in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking your question on Brazil, on Vivo, yes, we have a very good 2010 with revenues 9.3% up and very sound OIBDA performance, which is also very, very important with a stable and growing OIBDA margin, which is the highest in the industry. <mark type="inaudible" /> based on several factors. The first one being that Vivo is the most valuable and recognized brand on the mobile market in Brazil. By the way the Brazilian mobile market is the fastest growing out of the 10 largest mobile markets on earth. We have the largest coverage of 3G, thanks to our network in Brazil, we were the first one to deploy and we have been pretty consistently investing in that front. We have also been at the forefront on the data expansion both in smartphones and in Big Screen. We will keep growing, in fact we have been growing at a very high rate in 2010. So, we have been also basing &#x2013; namely in the last part this year on contract. And in fact the contract customer already account for 21% of our total customers in Brazil. The traffic of our network has been up significantly or most slightly decreasing or almost stable, 1.1% decrease. And ARPU is almost 3% decrease. Data ARPU has been growing 31%, so it's a mix of different factors. I would say that I think that we have an outstanding distribution network, an outstanding brand which is by the way the most valuable brand in Brazil. The customer satisfaction index is the highest in the industry, so it's a mix of different factors and we intend to keep going into the same direction.</p>
          <p>We have been aggressive on the last spectrum auction in Brazil because we wanted to increase the spectrum capacity of the Group and we have been successful on that front, which is especially important in the northeast part of the country, where we are a new entrant. So I would say that our plan is to keep growing, to preserve our leadership position, to optimize the level of our OIBDA margin and I think that we will have an outstanding platform to keep leading the Brazilian market.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon everyone. Two questions please, the first question is on mobile applications, it looks like the wholesale application community has made little progress since it was launched more than a year ago. Do you think operators are still in a position to regain a role here and properly monetize the application layer in mobile? Or shall we consider this opportunity as lost for good to the likes of Google and Apple? My second question is on your core holdings, is your stake in Telecom Italia still core to your strategy? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Julio Linares, regarding your first question on WAC. I think that the WAC was enormous one year ago. Progress has been pretty good until now, taking into account the number of memberships in boards, taking into account that what WAC 1.0 was released in September for developers' community. Based on that there are around 12,000 widgets that were already available in September last year. The number is increasing, it is very important to take into account that release 2.0 was delivered in February this year, including HS iMetal 5 and is available for the developers' community with significant improvement in the source version and there is a commitment on WAC in order to release WAC 3.0 in September this year that will include network APIs. That will be a significant differentiation regarding mobile ecosystems. So overall, we are pretty comfortable with the progress until now, I'm very confident on the future of WAC.</p>

          <p>Thanks for taking the question. A couple if possible, firstly, financing cost in the last couple of years in the cash flow statement has been around &#x20AC;2 billion. That's it's well below the P&amp;L cost. Is this more representative of the sort of clean cash cost of interest for you both in these two years and then going forward? And then secondly, I wonder could you remind us how much intangible or PPI depreciation has been in 2010 and maybe give us a guess at just what it might be in 2011 in total? Thanks very much.</p>

          <p>Hello, James. This is Miguel. Well, regarding the difference between the accrual and the payment in interest ex FX really in the financial expenses ex FX, we have had this year some extraordinary effects. One of them is that we are including the write-down of our participation in BBVA, a financial expense, while there is no payment related to that. Other than that we have also some zero coupons that are creating some savings in payments and also partially there are some effects at the year end depending on the payment date of some interest in loans, which amount roughly speaking to &#x20AC;50 million euros in that area. But over time we reestimate that we will be converting to the same amount as we are accruing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>James, Santiago again, on the impact of the PPA, what I can tell you is that the increase from last year into this year has meant going from &#x20AC;753 million to &#x20AC;867 million and the greatest contribution, as I think we'd mentioned in the call, is the of the inclusion of Vivo and the new PPA of &#x20AC;84 million allocated to Vivo. So the overall number is &#x20AC;867 million in PPA amortization this year.</p>

          <p>Hi, there. I was just &#x2013; could you elaborate on your comments around the guidance that the performance would be back-end loaded if I understood correctly?

But, as you know, with regards to M&amp;A, I like to make clear that we have fulfilled our necessity. We're happy with the present field we have. We might do a small acquisition at the level that we did with 20 on JAJAH on some bilateral business. But we have completed our footprint and we have &#x2013; we've seen with the footprint we have now we have tremendous capacity of organic growth and with this we are going to concentrate the whole organization to deliver organic growth of the Group because we have tremendous potential.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, yeah, some &#x2013; couple of things. In Brazil obviously there's trend with long distance pricing that TSU is exploiting. I guess, if we look at Brazil, it is quite an archaic market, quite an old market, most markets' long-distance is gone. Just wondering what your exposure is to long-distance within Telesp. And whether at some point, perhaps post the merger we should expect you to attack that mobile long-distance market and take some share back off TSU? Secondly, just big picture in LatAm, could you give us a feel in 2010 as to how much of your mobile data growth was driven by dongles versus smartphones and whether 2011 is the year where you hit a sort of tipping point on smartphones coming down to the right price to hit the class B and class C parts of the population of that region? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks for the questions. The first one, we are looking for the exact figure of exposure on long-distance, but in the meantime let me tell you that as we have been bundling aggressively in the last 3 to 4 years in Telesp, not only for traditional products with broadband but as well in within the traditional products in terms of voice between domestic long-distance and international long-distance, I think that the exposure that we have to the traditional long-distance or plain vanilla long-distance product has been significantly reduced in the last four years.</p>
          <p>We are looking for the current figure, as soon as I have it I will send it to you &#x2013; I will give it to you. Let me, while you are doing &#x2013; when you were asking a question, I remembered that I didn't ask about the MTR's cut in Brazil in the previous one. Let me stress the fact that nothing has happened yet on that front on the mobile side, that if you remember the initial graph for public hearing that ANATEL issued some months ago, we are proposing a steady decline of 10% in the next two years. This draft is still under discussion. So we are not &#x2013; it is not clear for us when this is going to happen, but it is clear for us that it is probably going to be steadier and not in a significant or immediate cut, at least for the current environment. In the meantime, Vivo exposure to interconnection rate keep being reduced, as we are fostering on net traffic.</p>
          <p>And with regard to your comment on the mobile growth in Latin America, in terms of how much we have out of the total 7.5 million mobile broadband customers that we have in the region, approximately 3.5 million are smartphones and these are growing very rapidly. The smartphone penetration in Latin America at the end of 2010 is in the neighborhood of 5%. That compares with the something in the neighborhood of 30-something percent in Europe. So the rules of the game are still to be written in Latin America in terms of subsidy. The main barrier of entry is the price of the handsets, it is still too expensive, to multiply. But in the last year prices have declined very, very dramatically and we are seeing already some handsets in the neighborhood of $150 and going down.</p>
          <p>So I guess that probably 2011 is going to be a year of explosion of the smartphone in Latin America and that provide us with a very good opportunity and that's why we have been working so hard in the last two years in our customer &#x2013; in our postpaid database and namely on being more I would say precise on the knowledge that we have for our customers.</p>
          <p>And I'm afraid that we don't have the number that you were asking I think in terms of the long-distance, but please get back to our Investor Relations and we will share that number with you.  But remember that most of our traffic of traditional voice is already bundled in Telesp.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello everyone. I have two questions. The first one is on the guidance slide in the presentation. You are mentioning 13 basis for profitable mobile broadband growth and you're mentioning this throughout the whole presentation many times. So, if you could elaborate a bit on this. I am wondering whether the focus is on the cost and subsidy of the handset, maybe tiered pricing and ARPU implications, maybe applications. I guess that all of them are important, but if you could elaborate a bit on what's the main focus now and how you see this evolving would be very helpful.</p>
          <p>And the second question is on retail share of broadband in Spain, which you are mentioning to be around 53%. You're saying a solid market share 53%, but that has come down 1 percentage point or around that in the fourth quarter and around 2 percentage points for the full-year, so clearly accelerating in the fourth quarter. So, I'm interested in getting your thoughts on whether this negative trend is going to continue or it was especially aggressive fourth quarter and you're expecting this aggressiveness to slow down and if possible what could be the level of market share at which you will consider kind of minimum at which market share should stabilize? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Luis, it's C&#xE9;sar. We talk a lot about that, because that is one of the bigger leverage of growth opportunity, not only for Telef&#xF3;nica, but the whole industry. And in our Investor Day, we will elaborate a lot more on that, but there's one thing which is clear, it is clear now <mark type="inaudible" /> is working in our markets and is working very well. You know how we're stealing people and really working and assisting the tiered pricing and so that is very good news on one front. And the second thing which is very good news is that smartphones are going down, their prices. And every time there is going to be more competition, the smartphone, the competition of smartphones is going to be very strong, especially in the second part of this year. So both news are good so when we talk.</p>
          <p>And then, you've seen our presentations and we have took the value of the client and we are working a lot on Telef&#xF3;nica on the value of the client in every three of the business lines, Europe, Spain, and LatAm. So but as I said, we are very confident on that it's going to be tremendous footprint. But this is something that on the Investor Day we are going to talk a lot more about it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>This is Guillermo, I will take your question regarding retail market share on broadband. First, it's true, in the last quarter, in the last year, we witnessed an increased level of competition &#x2013; price based competition in fixed broadband, two type of conducts or behaviors. One is aggressive promotions as usual and second, cross promotions, meaning that players with mobile operations giving discount to fixed broadband, if they bring also the boys with them. This is a conduct that has been challenged by another operator under CMT and we will see what happens with that. My belief is that that will soften in the near future that players will become more rational and also taking account that according to the CMT own accounting, regulatory accounting, the ULL prices are below costs. So that's some thing that should be solved in the future in someway or another. And finally, keep in mind that our focus is on value that means that we will put more emphasis on value market share, not in access market share. And that's why we have been highlighting that our retail revenue market share is around 53% and only 1.3 points below last year. So, we keep the leadership in the market and our profitability measure, for example, as OIBDA margin is benchmark in Europe. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. This is Jesus from Merrill Lynch. The first one is on cash taxes, you've given us guidance for operating figures in 2011. I wanted to know if you could give us something on cash taxes for 2011 and also working capital, where there was a big movement in fourth quarter. And the second question on the Vivo dividend, from a Telef&#xF3;nica shareholder's point of view, can you explain the logic for such a high increase in the Vivo dividend and why that versus maybe delaying that dividend for a latest stage after the merger with Telesp or perhaps doing a buyback of dividend &#x2013; of minority piece in Vivo. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Jesus, this is Miguel. While we have had this year at cash tax of 27.5% and we will still be within the range we have stated previously, and certainly around 27% in the next year.</p>
          <p>Regarding working capital, we are working a lot on that front, but we do not expect to repeat the excellent result of 2010. That has also been underpinned by some extraordinary facts such as the fact that we are not paying in full in the spectrum acquired in Mexico or that the provisions that we have recorded in the last quarter have no impact in cash, while they are pressing their OIBDA . This has been behind the extraordinary result in 2010 in part on top of an adverse effect on the CapEx payment and also on the bad debt recovery especially in Spain. For the next year, we expect maybe something is slightly negative also driven by the fact that we expect some revenue growth that has always a negative impact on the working capital.</p>

          <p>This is Santiago again. Just a quick comment, not that there is much we can say about this. But the one thing I do want to say is that we don't change our mind, depending on the size of our stake. So, we had a dividend policy in place before this whole thing started and when this is over, we will probably have to review it. But until that happens, we think we are on the right track applying the policy, the dividend policy that had been done at the regional level. And at the top level, you know that we've, we pride ourselves of being a shareholder oriented company and you may or may not like the policy that we have towards the dividend, but certainly we will give you an update at the Investor Day as how we think about this going forward. But for the time being, we thought this was the right way of completing the top line payment, the top company payment.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. My first question is, I would like to know to which extent you are committed to come back quickly to meet the low end of your comfort zone in terms of net debt to your OIBDA ratios or if you are easy with the current level of 2.5 times? And secondly in terms of organic revenue growth, 2011 in fact should be close to 2010 despite Vivo's having a higher rate in 2011, which implies probably weaker trends out of Brazil, so is it mainly coming from NTR cuts in Europe or are there any other reasons?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, David. Regarding our comfort with the current leverage, is not very high certainly. We have stated that we want to be in the 2, 2.5 range and we are in the 2.5, which is the upper limit, so we want to reduce it, and we count on improving that ratio over the year. And this is our ratio that has served us well in the past. We have been able of acquiring Brasilcel in 2010. This is partly due to the fact that we have flexibility and that we were not at the top our leverage and also it is good to be below that limit in order to accommodate any unforeseen damage such as could happen with the devaluation, for instance, in Venezuela or in other country. So we are committed to going towards the middle.</p>
          <p>Regarding your second question, the impact on our revenue organic growth of NTRs that we see for the whole year it is around &#x20AC;1 million, as I mentioned before for the whole Telef&#xF3;nica Group, basically in Europe. So today in Brazil, we did not see an immediate impact.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I had two questions please. The first one was just regarding your CapEx guidance. I believe in 2009 in Madrid you talked about CapEx gradually being able to come down from a level of about &#x20AC;8.4 billion. So this seems a bit of a change in the CapEx outlook. And I was wondering is this a case of front-end loading CapEx, so we can expect a sharp decline in 2012 or do you see CapEx now on an ongoing level near the &#x20AC;9 billion mark?</p>
          <p>And the second question I had please is just regarding your Vivo shares, last year you wrote the value of those up in your books following the offer for Brasilcel. Does that mean that if the offer made by Telesp for your current Vivo ON shares is below the price on your books that you pay for Portugal Telecom you will have to make a write down in the 2011 P&amp;L? And is that something you would be happy to do? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the first question on our CapEx, first of all, you have to take into account the difference in our perimeter because now we have new companies in Germany, we have 100% of Vivo, so that has significant input. In addition to that, based on our commitment to capture revenue growth opportunities, there is a change in the mix of our CapEx and we are going to go deeper in the development of all the broadband network, particularly in the mobile side of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi James, Santiago back again. In terms of the accounting impact, you are absolutely right in pointing out the effect that our proposal to buy the 50% Brasilcel had on our accounts. Let me also remind the audience that we did not imply that that offer was going to be recorded at exactly that price on our books. It was rather a lower number which is closer to the one that we have proposed to the minorities, the voting minorities of Vivo to come in. So, yes, it is based on the offer that we made, but no, it is not the exact price, but a lower number.</p>
          <p>With the ongoing process of putting together Vivo and Telesp, we do not expect any change in either the valuation or in the accounting impact of them, but of course as this is a pending and ongoing issue, we will have to wait until the end, until that is fully realized.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you please provide us some comments on the competitive dynamics in the Spanish mobile, seems that in Q4 the mobile service revenues trend of Vodafone and especially Orange was materially better than yours, even more than it was already in Q3, if you could provide us some comments please. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Giovanni, this is Guillermo, the last quarter as you know is always a quarter of strong seasonality and a lot of campaigns in the mobile market. In Spain was very active and what we have seen in the last month is stronger price competition started from the mobile data operators, Yoigo and then Orange competing against Yoigo with the small carriers. And later Vodafone made some moves in order to be competitive from the pricing arena.</p>
          <p>So it looks like the dynamics in the last quarter were a little bit more loaded towards the tariff price. While Spain, was a traditional market there was a little bit more balance between handsets and prices. And I think during this year 2011 will see a more rational or balanced approach and we continue focusing on our market share.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you as to give you an example that in terms of, in the mobile market, revenue market share, when you compare our revenue market share with our access market share, at the beginning of the year in 2010, we had a 4 percentage point difference and at the end of the year, 5% point difference. That means that a lot of the accesses that have been traded in the market have &#x2013; some of them have retained little value.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon everybody. Couple of them. The first one on the broadband business in Spain, how concerned you are about own upgrading the network to DOCSIS 3.0, maybe it would be useful if you could share with us the share of net adds in the areas where ONO is upgrading and where it's not. And eventually if that would push or could push you in the future to anticipate fiber-to-the-home deployment in Spain?</p>
          <p>And the second one is about Telesp. It's true that the top line is doing rather well, but still the company looks to be lagging a bit in terms of EBITDA, so I don't know &#x2013; when do you expect to see EBITDA to stabilize in Telesp somewhere in 2011 or maybe still too soon. And if there is a way to slowdown that aggressive fixed to mobile substitution in Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Guillermo, I will take question &#x2013; the first question regarding the broadband market in Spain, and in particular the cable operation in ONO. As you have seen has been published by ONO, ONO is upgrading its network to DOCSIS 3.0, and they have been focusing so far more on their own customer base, which is logic in order to improve the quality and the speed of the network and to retain the customer base. You know ONO in the last year has been losing or flattish in terms of market share, so this looks like in the first wave a defensive move. In the future, we'll see if they escalate to be on the offensive side taking to account that given the leverage that ONO has, the room for maneuver is limited.</p>
          <p>I don't have here market shares per region, and we usually don't disclose that, but if you look at the Spanish markets and the information that is provided by the CMT, you will see that in 2010, they wanted our gaining market share on the un-bundlers, not the cable operators.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon Iv&#xF3;n, it's Jos&#xE9; Maria speaking on your question on Telesp. Well you know that after a very complex and tough and difficult 2009, we decided to turn around Telesp basing on seller-dealers, the first one of them being quality, quality and customer satisfaction index. And as a result of that, given the whole of 2010, we have been working on that front. We have increased significantly of the subcontracting effort in order to ensure that we were able to preserve the both the level of quality of the existing customers and of existing network. And at the same time, retaking our commercial effort.</p>
          <p>It is true that in terms of revenues, we have been having a turnaround situation and we have been able to slightly increase revenues in the company during 2010. It is also true that OIBDA has been impacted by several effects, one of them being positive <mark type="inaudible" />. And also another one being the fact that we are incurred more cost to ensure quality and preserve the level of net adds.</p>
          <p>Taking everything into consideration, the year for Telesp has been outstanding. We have been able to almost maintain the traditional line customers, the number of customers of traditional lines, while in 2009 we have been losing 400,000. We have been increasing broadband almost 700,000 customers, which is historically high. We have been adding more customers. We have been having more net adds in the month of December of 2010 than in the three previous year altogether. And we have been also &#x2013; been retaking growth on the TV part, which is part of our pending issue and we have been able to do that with the highest level in the history of Telesp customer satisfaction.</p>
          <p>Taking everything into consideration and excluding non-recurring items that the auditor says, another one-time impact of 2009, OIBDA margin in Telesp is more stable in 2010 than in 2009, it is still at the lower level, but it is not decreasing, at least not decreasing at the same pace and we think that all the effort that we're doing in Telesp are going to be paying off in 2011.</p>
          <p>Taking to consideration as well the fact, and I take advantage of the opportunity to communicate that to you that in the first two months of this year, it has been running even more than in the previous year. 2010 was the heaviest rain period in the last 63 years, 2011 has been the highest one in the this 54 years, and therefore we have also focused on quality and therefore, commercial activity in the first two months of the year is going to be lower. But we are fully confident that we'll be easily taking the commercial effort as the Brazilian market is booming.</p>
          <p>And in terms of fixed mobile substitution that you were mentioning, I would just outline the fact that we have been able to preserve basically the number of traditional lines. We have been just losing 39,000 in 2010. So, I think that the bundling strategy and the transformation strategy and the quality focus that we have putting is paying off. So, we will keep you posted. We are much more optimistic about Telesp, and we are waiting for the final process of the Vivo tender offer and integration in order to do even more things together with Vivo.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Couple of questions, firstly on Spain on the restructuring charge, I just wonder what level of savings on personnel costs you might achieve this year after you book the &#x20AC;202 million charge, and also I guess how many employees does that cover. You also mentioned outsourcing. And I just wonder what sort of political pressure you're under to not reduce head count too much given the unemployment levels in Spain right now?</p>
          <p>And the second question, again just, it was interesting to see the Vivo dividend yesterday. And I just wonder after you've completed the merger between Telesp and Vivo, is there anything to prevent a full 100% pay out of free cash flow of the consolidated entity. I am thinking really around distributable reserves, in that context. Thanks.</p>

          <p>Hi Will, this is Guillermo. Regarding human resources in Spain, yes it has provision for several projects, restructuring projects in Spain for a total amount of &#x20AC;202 million. Among them, there is a program for example for reducing managers' position that was mentioned in the presentation. Roughly, we are thinking about a reduction of 6% of this management position, roughly 250 people. Obviously, the unit costs are completely different to the ones we had in the previous redundancy program because we are talking about managers and the payback is similar to the previous ones.</p>
          <p>Regarding outsourcing, we have no political pressure at all. This is basically a typical managerial discussion and analysis that we're conducting. We will give more color and information in the Investor Day in London.</p>

      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I just have two questions, please. Firstly, on Spain, you've noted there's been a certain amount of price promotion on the fixed broadband side. I wonder how much additional pricing pressure you've been seeing on the mobile side, and whether your guidance accommodates an element of price rebalancing on the mobile side during 2011. And then secondly just on Vivo and just to sort of labor the point on distributable reserves, obviously the Vivo dividend is 127% payout ratio. And I just wondered whether there is anything to prevent you in future running down those distributable reserves to boost cash flows into the corporate center? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeremy, this is Guillermo, yes there is price promotions in the fixed broadband and also some more intensive productivity on the mobile side. But and that's taken into account obviously in our guidance in the future. Let me stress that our focus in present and in the future will be on value, and that means that revenue market share is a much more relevant metrics than access market share and we have been defending very well that metrics and profitability as usual is all but very good measure and we still have almost 47% OIBDA margin. So, we would focus on value, we will not enter in destructive price wars or tactics and we will continue focusing on our best customers and our bottom line.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">

          <p>Taking your question on the structure of &#x2013; would there be any restriction or limitation on the Vivo or the integrated unit dividend payment after the processes are completed. Again we are highly restricted to comment, but it is going to be highly dependable on the final structure of the exchange ratios and all that. So it's very soon to conclude. We will keep you posted, but for the time being, we do not see any major limitation.</p>
