      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks for your interest in Lowe's.  Following my remarks, Larry Stone will review our operational performance including what we're doing to manage the business in today's challenging environment. Then Bob Hull will review our second quarter financial results.</p>
          <p>First, a few thoughts on the quarter; while many challenges remain, I'm proud of the results we delivered this quarter.  Our 215,000 plus dedicated employees focused on taking care of customers and capitalizing on opportunity in order to deliver better than anticipated results in a difficult economic environment.  Comps for the quarter were negative 5.3% but exceeded our guidance.</p>
          <p>Contributing to our better than expected results was relative strength in many outdoor categories as generally more seasonable weather and replanting and recovery from last year's droughts helped drive sales.  Reflecting that strength, comps of broadly defined outdoor products exceeded indoor product comps by over 300 basis points in the quarter.  We saw a similar lift in last year's second quarter, which seems to suggest that in addition to drought recovery, consumers remained willing to take on smaller outdoor projects.</p>
          <p>Also aiding sales in the quarter was the positive impact of the fiscal stimulus payments.  We cashed some checks for customers but many more customers deposited their checks and used other forms of payment.  We saw evidence of this with an increased use of cash and debit cards in the quarter, but it's obviously difficult to get an accurate read on the exact stimulus spend in our stores.  Based on external estimates of spend within the home improvement channel and our own consumer surveys, we feel that stimulus payments benefited second quarter comps by 100 to 150 basis points, slightly more than we expected heading into the quarter.</p>
          <p>As a result of our customer focused efforts and compelling product and service offering, our solid market share gains continued this quarter.  According to third-party sources, we added 120 basis points of total store unit market share in the second calendar quarter, which represents our largest unit share gain in eight quarters.   As we navigate through this down cycle for our industry, our share gains continue to be driven by great in-store execution, our disciplined store expansion program, and market share gains from competitive closings.  On the other hand, we continue to experience weakness in spending for larger projects and more discretionary purchases, leading to our eighth consecutive quarter of negative comps.</p>
          <p>As many of you know, we've watched home pricing dynamics at the market level over the past several quarters.  Today, nearly 90% of our stores are in markets experiencing year-over-year home price declines, and generally our weakest comps continue to be in those markets that have experienced the greatest declines.  Where home prices have been or have become more stable, our comps have been much better.  By way of comparison, the bottom 20% of markets, those with the biggest home price declines, had double digit negative comps in the quarter, while comps for the top 20% were essentially flat.  While our sales results will likely continue to vary widely by market, we're focused on capturing the unique opportunities presented in each of our stores and driving profitable market share gains.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, we experienced a slight decline in gross margin as a percent of sales.  Our gross margin performance combined with solid expense management helped minimize the earnings impact of continued industry-wide sales weakness.  As a result, earnings per share of $0.64 declined only 4.5% and exceeded our guidance for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally, great working capital management led to a 26% increase in cash flow from operations versus the first half of last year despite a decline in earnings.</p>
          <p>As we look to the balance of the year, we continue to watch the macroeconomic variables we feel are driving our business.  While there are signs that suggest stabilization in the absolute or month-to-month level of housing turnover, significant year-over-year declines remain the norm.  In addition, broad-based declines in home prices, rising mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures, an increasing inventory of unsold homes, tight credit markets and rising mortgage rates, as well as rising unemployment all suggest continued pressure on the home improvement consumer.</p>
          <p>We expect some continued benefit from drought revitalization spending in the third quarter, but we also anticipate the typical seasonal mix shift away from many of the categories that drove our second quarter results.  I'm confident we will continue to capture market share and we remain focused on providing the best products and service in home improvement. But as I mentioned earlier, considering the level of uncertainty in the current macro environment, the waning effect of federal stimulus payments, and the larger mix of indoor versus outdoor category sales in the back half of the year, we feel it's prudent to maintain a cautious near-term outlook.</p>
          <p>Thanks again for your interest, and I will now turn it over to Larry Stone to provide a few more details on the quarter.  Larry?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Robert, and good morning.  As Robert mentioned, we achieved solid results in a challenging sales environment.  Today, I'll share some details of the quarter and describe the things we're doing to continue to drive profitable sales in the current environment.</p>
          <p>Reflective of the tough sales environment that has been pressuring our industry for the past eight quarters, only two of our product categories, rough plumbing and nursery, achieved positive comps for the quarter.  Our positive comps in rough plumbing were driven by solid sales in air filtration products, pumps and tanks, water treatment, and HVAC controls. Also, we experienced commodity price inflation in copper and resin products, which drove part of this increase.  Favorable weather, wide product selection, and great customer service helped drive solid nursery sales as consumers took on small projects to enhance the appearance of their outdoor space.  Additionally, as homeowners repaired damage caused by last year's drought and continued to do routine lawn maintenance, we drove better than average comps in lawn and landscape and outdoor power equipment.</p>
          <p>Despite the significant pressure on sales, we continue to gain market share, a good indication that our programs are working as we continue to offer value-added solutions for home improvement customers.  According to third-party estimates, we gained unit market share in 17 of 20 product categories in the second calendar quarter versus the same time period last year, and we gained 120 basis points of total store share in the quarter.  We had solid performance in seasonal products, reducing the need for markdowns outside the normal course of business, helping us to maintain gross margin.  Also, our seasonal inventory is in good shape leading into the third quarter.</p>
          <p>On a regional basis, we continued to see a wide range of comp performance as five regions achieved positive comps while six regions had double digit negative comps.  The solid sales performance we experienced in Texas and Oklahoma during the first quarter continued into the second quarter.  Additionally, we are seeing solid results in the Ohio Valley and parts of the upper Midwest.  These are markets that did not experience the same overheating of home prices that was experienced in other parts of the country.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, sales continued to be pressured in two of our California regions, some of the markets most pressured by the overheated housing market.  The two California regions improved slightly compared to quarter one, but we still experienced double digit negative comp performance for the quarter.  In our Florida and Gulf Coast regions, the story remains the same with both regions posting double digit negative comps for the quarter.  In Florida, easing year-over-year compares were offset by an increasingly difficult housing market.  The Gulf Coast while improving over our 2007 performance, still has double digit negative comps.  Also we had double digit negative comps in two of our Northeast regions as housing pressures and unfavorable weather led to below plan performance in these regions.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, we had good success in installed sales. We achieved positive comps for the first time in the past several quarters; but on the flip side of the coin, big ticket projects had the highest sales decline. And on a regional basis, we saw the largest year-over-year sales declines in our Western regions, Florida, and the Gulf Coast.</p>
          <p>Although there was some weakness in our special order sales, comps outperformed the company average for the quarter, driven by special order window treatments and carpet.  However, consumers remain cautious about buying big ticket discretionary products, including many that are available through special order. During the quarter, we continued to see soft demand in cabinets and countertops and fashion plumbing.</p>
          <p>Finally, sales to commercial customers outperformed the company average for the quarter, an indication that our targeted marketing programs and products are resonating with this customer.  We're driving comps in many different categories across the store, which has been our stated strategy for commercial business.  While sales remain soft in lumber and commodities, we continue to focus on property management for the day-in, day-out repair business is still strong.</p>
          <p>Despite the weak sales environment, the promotional environment was rational during the quarter.  We remain committed to our rolling 18-month promotional calendar that supports our marketing plans.  We continue to focus on easy-to-understand promotions with a fewer, bigger, better approach, and this is resonating well with customers.  For the quarter, we leveraged advertisements as a percent to sales and our draw rate, or the number of times Lowe's was in the consideration set of customers buying products we sell, improved in 17 of 20 product categories, a clear indication that our advertising is connecting with home improvement customers.</p>
          <p>On the merchandising front, we continued to experience product cost pressures; and in most categories, we've been able to pass these increases along to our retail prices.  Some categories have been slower to move and we have not been able to change our retail price.</p>
          <p>Primarily as a result of the soft sales environment, we did leverage payroll by 32 basis points in the quarter, but I'm confident we're prudently managing the business, ensuring our stores remain appropriately staffed and positioned to ensure great service to customers.  In fact, our customer service scores for the second quarter increased in all five categories compared to the same period last year.  I was very pleased with improved scores for selling skills, checkout, and phone service.  This further demonstrates that our store teams are doing a great job of taking care of customers.</p>
          <p>In addition to prudent expense management, we have a heightened focus on maximizing every customer interaction to drive sales while improving customer service.  Project sell-in to the DIY customer has always been a priority for Lowe's.  We continue to look for ways to maximize all opportunities to sell complete projects while continuing to provide great customer service.  Earlier this year, we rolled out a related item sell-in report to our stores.  This tool helps us sharpen our focus on project selling and ensures we consistently offer customers all the supplies needed to successfully complete their projects.  Specifically, this tool gives store managers visibility into missed opportunity to sell the entire project as well as provides them a report to measure their performance.  This increased visibility has helped motivate employees to drive sales in their respective departments as well as create a friendly competition among stores.  Also, this tool can be used to coach employees to help them better identify products needed to complete projects.</p>
          <p>By selling the entire project, we have the opportunity to increase the ticket and provide customers the level of service they came to expect from Lowe's.  Customers are now properly equipped to complete their project and related-item selling makes Lowe's a one-stop shop, which is extremely important to customers considering today's fuel prices.</p>
          <p>Another opportunity to drive efficiencies was store signage.  Over the past couple of quarters, you heard us discuss our approach to ensuring we maintain our best in-store environment by reducing redundant store signage.  During the quarter, we continued to identify ways to reduce store expenses by replacing disposable product information tent cards with promotional towers, which are mobile, reusable A-frame towers that enable us to highlight special values and promotional items by simply changing the signage.</p>
          <p>Our best-in-class logistics and distribution infrastructure ensures our stores have the right products at the right time.  To further drive efficiencies, we continue to implement changes that improve transportation and DC performance.  Rising fuel costs have been, and continue to be a concern.  However, for the quarter we offset the majority of approximately 15 basis points incremental fuel cost through network optimization, where we shorten the average length of calls to our stores.  Also, we increased the outbound payload per truck and increased our dedicated DC backhaul to mitigate the impact of rising diesel prices.  As a result of these actions, the net fuel impact for the quarter is approximately five basis points.</p>
          <p>As we examined our sales, it was clear that much of our sales were driven by seasonal and outdoor products. And, as we discussed in our previous quarters, we continue to see stability in repair and maintenance products.  A few more examples of our opportunity include shingles, where our sales have been strong all year as few consumers will put off roof repair, regardless of the macro environment.  Also, we're seeing strength in pellet heaters as consumers anticipate higher fuel costs this winter.  Additionally, we're seeing relative strength in freezers, probably a function of consumers buying groceries in bulk for better prices, and also the trend of more consumers having gardens this year.  But, until we see improvement in our core categories and larger-ticket items, we continue to take a cautious and measured approach to our outlook.</p>
          <p>Stating the obvious, we're not happy with a negative 5.3 comp for the quarter; but considering the sales environment, I feel we posted solid results.  We anticipate that the challenging sales environment will continue into 2009.  We have plans in place to continue to capture market share and grow profitably as we capitalize on the opportunities created by the changing competitive landscape in our industry.  I'm confident that continuing our focus on the customer and prudently managing the business will position Lowe's for continued long-term success.</p>
          <p>Thanks for your attention, and I'll now turn the call over to Bob Hull to review the financials.  Bob?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Larry, and good morning everyone.  Sales for the second quarter were $14.5 billion, which represents a 2.4% increase over last year's second quarter.  In Q2, total customer count increased 4.6% but average ticket decreased 2.2% to $66.95.  For the first half, total sales increased 0.7% to $26.5 billion.  Comp sales were negative 5.3% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking at monthly trends, comps were negative 5.5% in May, negative 4% in June, and negative 6.5% in July.  For the quarter, comp transactions decreased 2.7% and comp average ticket decreased 2.6%.  As Robert noted, we estimate that the stimulus checks positively impacted our second quarter comp sales by 100 to 150 basis points.  We experienced nominal lumber and building material inflation in the quarter, which had minimal impact on second quarter comps.</p>
          <p>With regard to product category, the categories that performed above average in the second quarter include building materials, rough plumbing, hardware, paint, flooring, nursery, outdoor power equipment, lawn and landscape products, appliances, and home environment.  In addition, walls and windows and seasonal living performed at approximately the overall corporate average.</p>
          <p>From a regional perspective, five of our 22 regions had positive comp sales in the quarter.  The positive comping markets were in the middle of the country, from the upper Midwest down through Texas.  However, six of our 22 regions had double digit negative comps for the quarter.  The double digit negative comp regions were: California, Northeast, Florida, and Gulf Coast markets.</p>
          <p>Gross margin for the second quarter was 34.3% of sales and decreased 13 basis points from last year's second quarter.  The decrease in gross margin was driven by a number of factors.  First, the whole house carpet promotion negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 20 basis points.  The customer has responded favorably to the offer, and the promotion generated positive gross margin dollars.  However, as I mentioned last quarter, we continue to modify offers like this to find the right balance between sales and profitability.  As a result, we did increased labor retail to 249 related to this offer.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have received vendor price increases in a number of product categories.  In most cases, we have been able to pass on price increases.  However, there is sometimes a lag in the timing between our increase in cost and the movement in retail prices.  This had an approximate negative 10-basis-point impact on gross margin in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Higher fuel costs increased cost of goods sold and negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 5 basis points.  Lastly, fuel leverage on distribution fixed costs caused approximately five basis points of negative impact on gross margin in the quarter.  Slightly offsetting these items were positive impacts of 13 basis points from lower inventory shrink as a percentage of sales and eight basis points from the margin mix of products sold.  Gross margin of 34.7% represents a decrease of 21 basis points over fiscal 2007.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A for Q2 was 20.8% of sales, which delevered 74 basis points, driven by store payroll, fixed expenses, bonus, and credit.  For the quarter, store payroll deleveraged 32 basis points.  As sales per store decline, additional stores are hitting the minimum hours threshold, which increases the proportion of fixed to total payroll.  In addition, rent, property taxes, utilities, and other fixed expenses deleveraged approximately 20 basis points due to the comp sales decline.  Bonus expense deleveraged 18 basis points in the quarter, as we attained higher performance levels this year versus missing many of our performance targets in the first half of 2007.  Also, as expected, we did experience deleverage related to proprietary credit due to higher losses than last year, but credit losses came in on plan for the quarter.</p>
          <p>This deleverage was offset by leverage in in-store service and advertising expense in the quarter.  Year to date, SG&amp;A's 21.6% of sales then deleveraged 68 basis points for the first half of 2007.</p>
          <p>Store opening costs of $21 million leveraged 4 basis points to last year as a percentage of sales.  In the second quarter, we opened 23 new stores with no relocations.  This compares to 26 new stores including two relocations, in Q2 last year.</p>
          <p>Depreciation at 2.6% of sales totaled 381 million and deleveraged 28 basis points compared to last year's second quarter, primarily due to negative comp sales and the addition of 153 stores over the past 12 months.</p>
          <p>Earnings before interest and taxes or operating margin decreased 111 basis points to 10.8% of sales.  Year to date, operating margin of 9.9% represents a decrease of 125 basis points over the first half of 2007.  Interest expense at $69 million deleveraged 12 basis points as a percentage of sales.  This deleverage was caused by the additional expense associated with last year's bond deal.  For the quarter, total expenses were 24% of sales and deleveraged 110 basis points.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax earnings for the quarter were 10.3% of sales.  The effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.4% versus 37.7% for Q2 last year.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share of $0.64 for the quarter exceeded our guidance but decreased 4.5% versus last year's $0.67. For the first six months of fiscal 2008, earnings per share of $1.05 were down 8.7% to 2007.</p>
          <p>Now for a few items on the balance sheet, cash and equivalents balance at the end of the quarter was $477 million.  Inventory turnover, calculated by taking our trailing four quarters cost of sales divided by average inventory for the last five quarters, was 4.01, a decrease of 12 basis points from Q2 2007.  Our second quarter inventory balance increased $140 million or 1.8% versus Q2 last year.  The increase was due to the addition of 153 stores from this time last year, offset somewhat by lower inventory in comp stores.</p>
          <p>At the end of the second quarter, we owned 87% of our stores versus 86% at the end of the second quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Our debt to equity ratio was 30.1% compared with 30.9% for Q2 last year.  Return on invested capital, measured using the trailing four quarters earnings plus tax adjusted interest divided by the average debt and equity over the last five quarters, decreased 374 basis points for the quarter to 12.4%. Return on assets, which is determined using the trailing four quarters earnings divided by average assets for the last five quarters, decreased 265 basis points to 8.3%.</p>
          <p>Our leverage guardrail remains 1.2 times lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR for the first three quarters, and due to the seasonality of our cash flows, 1.4 times at year end.  These targets were established based on our goal of maintaining a strong single-A credit rating and an A1-P1 commercial paper rating, which is not only prudent in this environment but provides us the financial flexibility to manage our business. At the end of the second quarter, lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 1.3 times, which exceeded our 1.2 times target for Q2.</p>
          <p>There were no shares repurchased in the quarter and our outlook does not contemplate any shares repurchased for fiscal 2008.</p>
          <p>We will continue to evaluate market conditions and diligently evaluate our options to balance financial flexibility against opportunities presented in the market.  An outcome of our ongoing evaluation was the decision to call of our outstanding convertible debt in the quarter.  As a result, we have retired $521 million of debt from our balance sheet and removed approximately 21 million shares from our diluted share count.</p>
          <p>Year to date, cash flow from operations was $3.9 billion, an increase of 790 million or 26% over the first half of 2007.  The strong cash flow from operations growth versus last year was driven by good inventory management and continued efforts to improve payment terms.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. We continue to expect our sales results to vary widely by market as the housing impacts are regional and we have limited visibility to the bottom for each specific market.  We do expect some markets to improve. However, markets like California and Florida will continue to be challenged.</p>
          <p>Given this, we expect a third quarter sales increase of 1 to 2%, which incorporates the opening of approximately 38 stores, two in August, seven in September, and 29 stores in October.  Comp store sales are estimated to decline 5 to 7% from last year.  EBIT or operating margin for the third quarter is expected to decline by approximately 290 basis points to last year as a percentage of sales.  Approximately 100 basis points of this decline is related to the reduction of self-insurance reserves for workers compensation and general liability experienced in last year's third quarter.</p>
          <p>The anticipated sales growth and operating margin decline are expected to generate diluted earnings per share of $0.27 to $0.31, which represents a decrease of 28 to 37% compared to last year's $0.43.</p>
          <p>For 2008, we expect to open approximately 120 stores, resulting in an increase in square footage of 7 to 8%.  We're estimating a comp sales decrease of 6 to 7% and a total sales increase of approximately 1%.  For the fiscal year, we are anticipating an operating margin decrease of approximately 180 basis points, driven by store payroll as well as depreciation, fixed cost, and gross margin.</p>
          <p>We are forecasting an effective tax rate of 37.6% for 2008.  As a result, we expect diluted earnings per share of $1.48 to 1.56 for the year.  For the year, we expect cash flow from operations to be approximately $4.5 billion, up approximately 3% over fiscal 2007.  In addition, we forecast total capital expenditures of approximately 3.9 billion with roughly 300 million funded via operating leases, leaving cash CapEx of approximately $3.6 billion for 2008.</p>

          <p>Deborah, this is Robert Niblock.  For the current fiscal year, we are maintaining our plan of approximately 120 new store openings that we announced at the beginning of the year.  That was down from our original plan.  We originally had a number closer to 140 &#x2013; 145 range, so approximately 120 that are on plan for this year.  We are, in light of the current environment, in light of how long it looks like the recovery is going to take place, possibly before the recovery takes place, evaluating the number of stores that we'll open next year, and determining what the appropriate adjustment needs to be, and we will announce the final number for that at our analyst conference next month.</p>
          <p>With regard to our international performance, as far as markets beyond Canada and Mexico that we've announced, we continue to evaluate markets, nothing beyond that.  We are continuing to &#x2013; we've got a team assembled down in Monterey working on our plans for our store openings in Monterey late 2009.  We continue to be very pleased with the performance we're seeing out of our initial stores that we've opened in Canada, and we'll have three or four more of those opening between now and the end of the fiscal year.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, just two actually little quick ones.  First, the average ticket looked like it was down about 2.2%, not on a comp basis but a total basis, best performance since it looks like the end of 2006. And yet you commented that you continue to see the biggest declines in the big ticket items.  Can you just reconcile that and maybe provide a little bit more detail on what you're seeing in average ticket and whether that's just an outcome of having now anniversaried some of those big ticket declines?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, you also mentioned you saw the greatest share gains on a unit basis in eight quarters, and I was wondering if you might be able to provide a little bit more insight as to whom you think those share gains are coming from and how you think that's trending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Colin, this is Bob. I will take the first question regarding average ticket.  I think some of it is cycling prior comparisons where we have seen big tickets being impacted, also in this quarter, a lot of smaller projects related to outdoor lawn and garden. So they're smaller than let's say a cabinet transaction but they are still a decent sized project which I think helped with the rate of decline in average ticket for the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Colin, it's Robert. As far as the unit share gain, that's the track line results that we speak to.  Certainly the 120 basis points of unit share gains we said was the largest we have seen in eight quarters.  We continue to see gains quarter over quarter. And really, you really have to get all the track line stuff and look at it.  It depends on what product category you are talking about as to where the share gains are coming from.  As you know, it's a highly fragmented market.  Sometimes it's coming from independents.  Sometimes it's coming from other direct competitors that are out there, but it's really on a category-by-category basis.</p>
          <p>As you know, the track line information is really sample based where they contact consumers.  They ask them where they shopped, where they ultimately bought that, what brand they bought, those types of things, so it is consumer recall.  There can be from time to time a little bit of noise in the numbers.  We really use it as directional guidance to say okay, we continue to see that we're moving in the right direction.  We're gaining unit share.  We are gaining dollar share.  We're drawing more customers, we're closing more customers.  We really use it as directional guidance, not hard and fast for any one particular category because there has been from time to time a little bit of noise in the numbers, but I really think it's across the board. You have seen a lot of independent closings that are out there.  They're harder to accumulate but as we poll our stores out in the market and ask them to give us feedback on the competitive dynamics and the competitive changes that are taking place in your market. As you can imagine, some of the areas that have been most hardest hit from a housing environment have also been the areas where we're hearing more about small competitive closings that are taking place, be it a cabinet shop, a lawn and garden store, a small lumber yard, whatever the case may be and those I think are providing some of those gains that we're seeing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's really what I was trying to drive to, whether you have seen any kind of a step change in some of the closings from the independents, and I know that's hard to see in the track line data versus where you see any kind of change in &#x2013; step change function in like seer share or something like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the biggest step change we probably have seen is from independents based on what we've anecdotally seen coming in from our stores.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>The information, it's hard to quantify.  You really don't have that historical data.  It doesn't all roll up the way that we've seen or where you really get independent data other than what our stores are telling us; and then anecdotally what we think that environment was like in the past when we saw a significant number of those independent competitors opening up in very robust economic and housing market times.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Robert.  Good morning, Bob.  Good morning, Larry.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm curious about the promotional environment.  You said it has been fairly rational and you are maintaining your 18-month rolling calendar.  Do you see it getting more promotional to try to generate sales? We're hearing from some of the suppliers that that might be what's in the cards at least going forward.  I also wanted to ask about inventory.  So I will come back on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Budd, I'll start and I will turn it over to Larry.  We looked at the promotional environment. So far, it has been fairly rational out there.  We continually look at the promotions that we've done and tried to adjust those accordingly for what works in the current environment, what will be best received by the consumer.  So we're very pleased with the way things have turned out in the second quarter in light of the environment.  We had some promotions that worked well.</p>
          <p>As we look at our forward guidance, the exact thing that you mentioned is what causes this caution in our forward guidance.  The longer, the deeper the slowdown is &#x2013; you don't know what's going to take place out there in the competitive environment from a promotional standpoint.  We try and have an element of caution built into that guidance.  We know what our promotional calendar is.  We plan on executing forward the promotional calendar, but that doesn't mean that we may not see something out there in the competitive environment that would cause us to have to shift and/or react depending on what it is.  Larry, I'll see if you have anything to add.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Budd, just a couple of things to add to that; as we've talked before, this 18-month promotional calendar really helps us give guidance to our merchants and our operators about what's coming up for the next quarters and so forth.  We also go back; every promotion we run, we go back and really tear that promotion apart to see what did work, what didn't work, so we don't repeat the same mistakes, so we take things that really worked for us and really figure out a way to make them better in the future.</p>
          <p>To Robert's point, we're not quite certain what's going to happen in the next six months of this fiscal year. But certainly, it has been pretty rational much of the year and we continue on that same track.  We hope it's going to stay rational.  If it does, we will continue our promotional calendar as we have it laid out for the next 18 months.  Please keep in mind, we're constantly reviewing it.  We're constantly looking at it.  We're constantly being challenged by the merchants and operators.  My staff takes a look at it every week to determine if we need to make any fundamental changes to what we're doing, but we still think things are going to be pretty rational for the balance of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on inventories, you control them.  It looks like you did that exquisitely, and it looks like it was down 8% on a per-store basis.  I'm curious about if you looked at it on a unit basis, what do you think inventories are down because obviously, this year's inventories have got a fair amount or some price increases built into what you've had to expect, or what you had to endure.  Bob, any thoughts on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have the change in units specifically. On a comp store basis, inventory was down 7.7% second quarter of this year versus second quarter last year.  Budd, a couple of categories really drove the majority of that decrease, good inventory management practices in fashion plumbing and lighting, doing a better job with reset activity, less duplicity in inventory as we transition through recent activity.</p>
          <p>And then the other one I will mention, Budd, is tools. Tools has done a very good job of being smarter with promotions.  Larry mentioned earlier: fewer, bigger, better.  We're doing a better job with tool promotions and less in-and-out inventory, so those are really the three specific product categories that drove the majority of the decrease in comp store inventory for the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, this is Larry Stone. Just to add to it, we have spent a lot of time in the past several years on educating our stores on better inventory management and making sure that we don't have excessive inventory. We talked a few years ago about R3 and how we get inventory faster to our stores.  A lot of efforts that we've been working on for the past several years are starting to pay off this year in better inventory management.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but in tools, I would expect that that was one of the three categories you might not have gained share in.  There was a fairly well understood and well publicized transition that's going on in your tools that should hit the third or fourth quarter. Isn't that correct, in terms of the transition from Firestorm?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a new line rolling out with Porter Cable that will be rolling out this quarter and next quarter, and certainly some fundamental changes in our products in terms of DeWalt and other products that we sell in our stores.  But -- not going to comment on the three we didn't gain share in, but certainly we thought we have a real solid tool program as we head into the balance of this year.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question I'd like to dig into relates to your comments on outdoor, indoor, and I guess there are two elements to it.  First of all, did the trend of indoor versus outdoor improve a lot from where it had been? In other words, had this been consistent through the past several quarters? And then what's the magnitude of mix shift, indoor versus outdoor, that you see from Q2 into Q3, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matt, this is Bob.  I'll talk about the mix impact indoor/outdoor.  The outdoor categories represent roughly 40% of our total sales in the second quarter, drops to about 30% in the third quarter and further drops to about 20% in the fourth quarter. Certainly it's a much bigger mix of our business in the second quarter, and it has a bigger opportunity to have a positive or a negative impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you, and you said that second quarter last year, outdoor outperformed. Second quarter this year, outdoor outperformed.  What happened in between? Has it been a consistent outperformer as the macro trends faded or was it more volatile than that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A lot of it is weather driven, Matt. If you think about last year, I think the spring, the early spring we had pushed some sales over into the second quarter so it pushed it to a higher peak than normal; this year, somewhat of a similar trend. You throw the drought recovery from last year and the economic stimulus checks on top of that, and that would &#x2013; particularly if the customers focused on the outdoor replanting and recovering from the drought and they got the stimulus checks, some of that may be helping push those sales as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you, and a very quick financial follow-up. Your payables ratio increased nicely and that really helped drive the cash flow from working capital.  You typically see that from more aggressive ordering, yet your inventories are in very good shape.  Can you talk a bit about the payables pop that you got?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Matt, there are really two factors driving that.  One is timing of purchases, timing of purchases Q2 this year versus Q2 last year.  Last year, our business was trailing off and orders slowed throughout the course of the quarter.  This year, more of a constant purchase throughout the course of the quarter, so a bit of timing quarter over quarter.  Second is just an ongoing focus from our merchant team to work with our vendors to increase days payable outstanding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you, because it's up on the tiers?  It seems like the best payables ratio you've ever had in the second quarter.  So would you agree that it's more structural at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Some of it is structural.  However, by year end, the timing of purchases is going to have an impact.  We think that AP leverage at year end is going to be close to about 51% relative to just under 49% Q4 last year.  So we'll still have an improvement, not to the same degree we had second quarter.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks and again, good job on the quarter. You mentioned the stimulus having a bigger impact than you thought, and then cited cash and debit card. Could you just update us on how much of your sales were on your own private label credit card and how much that shifted?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">

          <p>Greg, this is Bob. Roughly about 22% of our sales are on our proprietary credit card for the second quarter. That was down about 100 basis points from Q2 last year, driven largely by the increase in mix of cash and debit card.</p>

          <p>This is Larry Stone.  In the California, Florida, and Gulf Coast that we spoke of, you can tell a big difference on the big ticket purchases in terms of comp sales.  Things like cabinets, fashion plumbing, countertops, and so forth, are not as strong in those particular markets. We look at other parts of the country where the economy is not as overheated, Texas, Oklahoma, the Ohio Valley and places like that, and we've got reasonably good growth in our cabinets and countertop business.  So it is being affected by this overheated housing markets.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, thanks for taking my question.  On the installed sales, I believe you said that part of it was positive for the period. And then historically, you have talked about detailing fees being a leading indicator and that had improving for the last couple quarters. How is that trending now, and does that relationship forebode anything else, such that it leads to overall improvement at the store level or the market level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, this is Larry Stone. I will start.  Detail fees are still trending in the right direction.  Installed sales, as I have stated in my comments, we had positive comps for the first time in the past several quarters.  So certainly, we're seeing a lot of our jobs &#x2013; the carpet promotion that we did, the walls and windows promotions that we did, really got us a lot of good foot traffic and some positive details.  However, as I've stated, kitchen cabinets still seem to lag and some of our fashion plumbing products are still lagging.  But overall, we're pleased with the increase in installed sales, and we think there's a lot of small projects that people are still doing that our install program works well for.</p>

          <p>And then on the mix shift to cash and debit cards, was that solely due to a shift away from the private label card, or did you also experience that in the third-party cards as well, such that &#x2013; and how were you able to discern that was related to the stimulus? Could it have been due to just a generally contracting environment for consumer credit? And the last question is, have you changed any of your assumptions about proprietary credit losses, since you did comment they were turning up a bit?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As it relates to the mix of tender type, cash and debit were up just about a little more than 200 basis points quarter over quarter, so they increased by 200 basis points.  Proprietary credit was down about 100 basis points.  Bank card was down just a little bit more than 100 basis points.  Structurally, we haven't done anything different as it relates to getting new apps and getting new accounts.  I'm sure folks are stressed for credit, but I think it has more to do with the stimulus checks than anything else as people had &#x2013; 8% of the folks had money directly deposited into their accounts.</p>
          <p>As it relates to the credit program, our credit outlook for the year hasn't changed.  Credit losses are higher than last year, but where we expected them to be. That is being somewhat offset by increased cardholder income and lower money costs related to the portfolio.  So our expectations for where in the credit program we'll be for the year isn't any different than it was 90 days ago.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  I guess we're all looking for when the comp can turn positive on a sustainable basis and you mentioned continued sales pressure into 2009.  When you mentioned macro factors, I think the first one you cited is housing turnover.  Is that in your view the key factor, or should we be looking to home prices, or is there some other driver that will help us see when that top line turn is coming?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Laura, this is Robert Niblock.  When we think about the macro factors, certainly there's &#x2013; you can draw a relationship between comps and housing turnover.  Now we're just trying to find the bottom of housing turnover, certainly so we can start forecasting an upward trend.  The issue you got is probably somewhere in third quarter, so it's best estimate of when housing turnover will bottom out on an absolute number basis, so we've still got some pressure from a year-over-year standpoint.  Certainly, you have a significant amount of inventory that has to be worked off and you have continued pressure from foreclosures and other delinquencies, and the existing inventory of homes is going to continue to put pressure on housing prices.  The latest forecasts show housing prices probably not bottoming until the second quarter of next year.  So I really think on a sustained basis, you've got to probably get past that second quarter of next year where you really start to see then the markets turn.</p>
          <p>What does that mean for comps? Certainly we've got easier comparisons we'll be going up against between now and then. And then depending on what takes place, the competitive dynamics that take place in the environment, closings, opportunities to gain share, those types of things, what happens with unemployment, those other types of things all have an impact on our business.  When we talk about really looking at positive, sustained comps for recovery, you're probably looking at the second half of next year for the recovery.  It doesn't mean that comps can't move positive before then depending on what else takes place in the environment, how many more positives versus negatives that we have, what happens with fuel prices, what happens with food prices, those types of things that are currently putting pressure on the consumer.  Greg, I don't know if you have anything else you wish to add.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Laura, this is a Greg Bridgeford.  If you look at some of the factors we're trying to monitor very closely, on the positive side with decline in median home prices across most markets in the US that we track, especially the larger markets, we're seeing housing affordability, long-term housing affordability factors come back into play.  We're moving more towards the long-term median affordability ratios, which is very positive.  But as Robert said, it's housing but it's also consumer spending, and we have to watch the factors that affect consumer spending very carefully, so you've got two major dynamics that we're trying to track and understand. And as he said, most economists today say you really won't see housing prices bottom out.  You may see some stabilization in housing prices towards the second half of 2009 and housing prices start to recover and move back toward more of what you would consider longer term growth rates until 2010 plus.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple questions, good morning.  Proprietary credit down 100 basis points, I know you said some of that had to do with the tax stimulus.  What level of tightening is going on with that card for your customer and are the approval ratings coming down? That's the first question.  The second question was, if you can give us an update &#x2013; I'm not sure if you did already, I may have missed it, an update on how quarter to date trends are looking relative to your plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As for the credit, we've had no changes in lending standards related to proprietary credit, no changes in how we think about FICO stores, how we think about the account lines and whatnot.  We've had a prudent growth strategy over the past several years.  Yes, losses are ticking up slightly in this environment, but we felt good all along about our growth strategy and have not changed anything there.</p>
          <p>One other thing that is impacting our credit performance slightly is, as Larry talked about, as big tickets suffer when you think about a 12-month no payoff or with a ticket requiring more than 299, some of that is having an impact on the credit program as well.</p>
          <p>As relates to the start of Q3, the third quarter started right where we expected it to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just a follow-up on the credit side. Can you quantify what the SG&amp;A pressure is from that deleveraging that you mentioned earlier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The credit program deleveraged about 15 basis points or so in the second quarter, driven primarily by losses.  We expect increased losses to have roughly a $0.04 a share impact.  However, as I mentioned earlier, the higher portfolio income, lower money costs will offset the majority of that.  So for the year, the income related to our proprietary credit program will only be down slightly from 2007.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then last question on inflation. I know you said that the building material and lumber had nominal impact.  What would you say the level of inflation is that you are seeing to your sales across the entire store?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lumber and building material impact had about I said a nominal, only about an eight or so basis point impact during the quarter.  It's a mixed bag, Dan. When you think about inflation as it relates to our products, you have got some price increases.  You've got a greater mix of foreign sourced goods that has a net deflationary impact. So on balance, I think it's a less than one percent impact across the board.</p>
