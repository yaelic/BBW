        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody. We are holding today's conference in a new conferences hall. The French Electricity Board, EDF, has taken our usual convention hall, it comes to that in front of the press, but it turns out that we're fine here. We just have to adapt to the important thing is the figures, I believe that the seats are very comfortable &#x2013; in fact, I even tried them last night. We're actually closer to you, I don't know if that's going to help you get a better understanding of our business, but, let me in all events wish you, welcome you should I say to, here are my results which are at an all-time high for the Group.</p>
          <p>As our Chairman says, they're probably higher than we will see for quite some time, if at all, but doesn't mean that there no dangers -- on the contrary. What we're going to talk to you about is not just the results for 2008, because they are worth talking about, but I think what you really expecting is to hear us talk about 2009, and thereafter, how we foresee the future, and how we plan to pursue our strategy.</p>
          <p>I am going to begin with an overview of the Group's activity, and Patrick de la Chevardi&#xE8;re will talk to us about the financial results, and then we will go through the different operating sectors and I will conclude with the conclusion, as we say.</p>
          <p>Now you are probably as familiar with these charts as we are. I've felt nonetheless that it was necessary to begin by talking about the new environment that we are working in, if only to demonstrate that more than ever before, our strategy is the right strategy. Now the economic downturn has been expected for quite some time. And as you all know, the crisis didn't start last August with the emergence of the credit crunch and the ensuing events. In fact, the economy had been slowing down in a somewhat cyclical way, beforehand, before becoming as it has now become a crisis.</p>
          <p>Now I think our main concern is GDP growth. For the first time in quite some time, the U.S. has negative GDP growth. I think the figure is minus 1.1%, the euro zone is at minus 1%. I expect that future figures will be even gloomier. Of greater concern is China, which after a slowdown in 2008, slowed down to 9% GDP growth, nonetheless saw a fourth quarter GDP growth below the 7% mark. We don't know where China is heading exactly, but we all know that the drivers to economic recovery will be China and the U.S.</p>
          <p>On the right-hand bar chart, I'm not going to dwell on this, particularly not this morning, on the right chart you will see that, from time to time, good old traditional sectors which are often termed conservative are actually the sectors that are producing good results and posting good growth. In fact, the virtual world has been adversely affected as it was in 2008. You will see on the chart that despite the drop in market cap of the oil and gas companies, they still account for a very substantial portion of our economies. You see that Total's market cap has dropped by some $200 billion. &#x20AC;100 billion is easier to remember, but that's certainly not what we feel the real value of the company is. So, even though we're still experiencing a lot of uncertainty in our economy, the importance of a well understood and relevant long term strategy obviously hinges on the fundamentals that we believe in.</p>
          <p>Before talking about 2009, I'd like to say a few words about 2008, which demonstrated the relevance of our strategy in all of the sectors we operate in, but in particularly in the Upstream, where we have not only delivered on our new projects, we have also continued to invest in new projects, be it in exploration or through acquisitions, we are still renegotiating contracts in order to prepare for the future. In a word, I think life goes on for Total.</p>
          <p>Now, the results for 2008, though you were certainly expecting them, were nonetheless well received. Production was down 2% year-on-year, you will see later on that the underlying is actually up 1%. The scope of consolidation and price effect had a negative effect, that's a negative 3%. But, that was below our expectations. We have new production on stream, and new projects as well. But unfortunately there were too many events, too many technical incidents, so the resources out there -- we still have our reserves, but because of these events and incidents we haven't been able to increase production as we expected.</p>
          <p>So, the potential of reserves has been boosted by new projects we've signed, even though not -- up to 2 or 2.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent a day, Madagascar being one example of a new project. Okay, we have focused on the most dependable parts of the planet for these new projects, but one of the characteristic features of oil is that it is not always available in the most convenient parts of the world, but we are continuing with Synenco in Canada and of course our bid for UTS.</p>
          <p>The reserve renewal is 12%, much better &#x2013; our reserve replacement rate is 12%, which is -- or 112% should I say. It's not as high as the 130 or 140% we had in recent years, but nonetheless I think we can safely claim that we have at least 12 years reserve replacement ahead of us. Yves-Louis will talk to you about our situation with and without acquisitions, with and without price effects, just to show you that it's not good or bad.</p>
          <p>From one year to the next we do have a fluctuation of between 112 and 140% but we're still much higher than last year. We may not be at as high level as our competitors, but there are a number of exceptional items and more importantly quite a number of projects that are coming on-stream. This is the case of Dalia among others. Adjusted net income in dollars is $20.5 billion, that's up 22% on last year. Patrick will explain that in euros, the figures are just as good. Adjusted net income of &#x20AC;13.9 billion. That's up on the previous year, even though the fourth quarter, as was expected, saw a slight downturn because of the changes, the environmental changes.</p>
          <p>ROACE for the sector was almost 28%, again one of the highest figures we have published to date. As we often say, we are used to lower figures, particularly when the economy is in turmoil. But we have achieved a return of 28%, that's a good achievement. I think it's a good way to start out on a crisis. It's better to start on a good footing.</p>
          <p>CapEx was slightly below the budget at 18.3 billion, up considerably on last year. We've increased our CapEx in all sectors, but particularly in the Upstream. In 2009, we will be making similar CapEx, capital expenditure, even though the amount earmarked is slightly below what we had planned. Nonetheless, our CapEx will be very high. Gearing is very good, down substantially to 23%. As a result of which, we have a lot of potential with the view to the long term. And, of course, the dividend now, we are eager to increase the dividend by 10%, even after the &#x2013; I'd say for the full year, that the dividend will be up, on the dividend paid out, that's inclusive of the interim dividends, up 10% on 2007.</p>
          <p>But let's be very clear about this -- Total intends to remunerate its shareholders fairly. This is our way of thanking you for your trust in our company, in our strategy, and in our ability to manage the situation.</p>
          <p>Well, I'm sure you know the environment by heart now. Obviously we've never seen as much volatility as we have in recent times, the -- barrel was $44 only yesterday, but, at -- that's 28, &#x20AC;29. So, we've seen a lot of swings and changes. Now, when the euro weakens, the news is good for us, but the barrel is a different situation. The barrel is a little dearer now. OPEC has done a good job, I would say. But, very clearly, OPEC has proved its efficiency. That was what we expected OPEC to do in a crisis situation, but I think we have every reason to be pleased about how OPEC has gone about the -- managing the situation, particularly with a view to putting an end to the extravagant volatility in the market, even though that the -- no guarantee this will never reoccur.</p>
          <p>On the right-hand side &#x2013; I won't dwell on this, because Yves-Louis is going into a bit more about it later on. You see Brent prices, and you'll see that all our projects were based on prices that were well below current prices. As a result, they are still perfectly profitable even at $40 a barrel. However, in certain situations for certain projects, particularly long plateau or high technology projects, the situation is somewhat more complex.</p>
          <p>On the whole, however, not only do we withstand the situation well, but we can maintain our commitments. Now why have we put a dotted line and particularly two downward arrows on what are heavy oil prices?  Well, the overall message is that the decline in prices in all sectors, and particularly in the energy sector, is obviously going to reduce our breakeven points.</p>
          <p>Now every chart has a silver lining, and of course contractors will inevitably understand, particularly in exploration, that if they do not do something about their prices, not only will projects not come to fruition but they at least &#x2013; at the very least, they will be delayed.</p>
          <p>Moving towards the longer term now, because this our main concern, we invest in the long term really. We are looking at projects for 2014, 2015 or even thereafter. Certainly the cost of crude oil is what generates cash for the Group. At the same time we have to be able to anticipate how things will evolve. Very clearly it's difficult to understand for how long demand will continue to decline, and to what extent. And Michel will talk to you about this when he talks about Refining and Marketing, but we are banking on a substantial decrease in demand, and particularly in the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>We see all too many figures comparing 2009 with 2008, that seems to completely ignore the current blip, but when OPEC reduces production by 4.2 million barrels a day, while demand is only declining 0.8%. This should drive prices upwards, but the 0.8% at a given moment is a much higher figure, probably much closer to 2%. At the same there has been a lot of stocks that we will have to use, but clearly if OPEC continues to do its job properly, we can expect prices to be &#x2013; to remain at a level which, even in a crisis period, should enable us to get through the, weather the storm quite comfortably.</p>
          <p>Our production capacity was only very recently believed to be very aggressive, our 95 million, that got a number of people reacting. We now believe we can say that 95 million -- which includes condensates. The figure's currently a 93 million, 4 million barrels a day, so we're below the, at the peak we're below the 90 million barrels a day. That's the production capacity peak. We still have our reserves. We have longer reserves than before. We have a better plateau, but not at quite as high a level, obviously the challenge for us will be there.</p>
          <p>When we explain this minus 4 million, particularly with the heavy oil projects being delayed, this is because growth in Iraq and Iran will come through, but at probably a lower level than expected, particularly with the depletion of oil fields, we expect the baseline to be maybe at a lower level. And this is something people find it difficult to understand. They always tend to overlook the decline, but there is a decline, and this decline will gather pace quite simply because we are investing less. This is something that we will have to pay.</p>
          <p>Total has decided to uphold its investments, apparently most of our competitors likewise, but apparently we are not alone. Some oil companies are much more severely hit by the crisis than we are, the financial crisis that is. As for producing countries, the first thing they do in these problems is that they reduce production, of course, but they also reduce their investments. This is something we are faced with. This is a possibly, a new type of partnership we could look into, but very clearly this is going to generate a negative result.</p>
          <p>This is why we are maintaining that it's supply that will keep <mark type="audio gap" /> on demand, rather than the other way around. This is why our strategy, as I am sure you will understand, is we feel, the most appropriate in the current situation. You know the global oil production, the OPEC figures, you are familiar with them, that's the right-hand chart, and all this states that we are in a relatively strong position. Obviously we still have to go and seek out oil.</p>
          <p>In this deteriorated environment, we will continue to develop. We will be talking you through development sector by sector, but the one thing I would like to emphasize here is the fact that we are not going to maintain, but we will be upgrading our safety and <mark type="audio gap" /> involvement with no question of stopping mid-stream <mark type="audio gap" /> thinking of figures and figures alone, a stop and go approach would prove to be much more costly in the long term, so going to continue to make our industrial plant as efficient as possible.</p>
          <p>We will be reducing CO2 emissions. We'll be investing in research in gas sequestration, and the storage of CO2 of course. And of course beefing up research and development. No question of downsizing our own due we're better off reducing the cost of projects and becoming more efficient elsewhere. I think industry is extremely aware of its responsibilities in terms of costs, but this must not be to the detriment of the company's future.</p>
          <p>So, our priority is safety. We must reduce costs and see if there are opportunities to be seized, possibly in terms of major restructuring operations but certainly we will be trying to work better together, and I think Canada is a good example of that. There are others of course, in the offering. As you know we don't want to put all our eggs in the one basket, at the moment there will certainly be other opportunities, particularly if the crisis continues, as would appear to be the most likely scenario.</p>
          <p>Well, Patrick will tell you more about our strong balance sheet in a few minutes. Most importantly, I would like you to remark that our CapEx has increased very sharply in recent years. This year it will be slightly below last year, this is to be compared with the 18 billion we'd earmarked, but there are a number of acquisitions planned. We will of course be keeping this plan running, particularly in terms of volumes. We want to be comparable with the best of class.</p>
          <p>Our technical costs are low, even though they have risen quite a lot. We have slightly modified our gearing ratio expectations, because it is more plausible in the short term to look to 25 or 30% rather than 20 to 25%, for I think very obvious reasons. However, at this level of gearing, we feel that the Group is not in any way in jeopardy, but on the contrary must leverage its clout, particularly with a view to borrowing at much lower rates than our peer group.</p>
          <p>Most importantly we must work on our major projects, not just the current ones but our future major projects, of which Yemen is a good illustration. That is our policy. We must continue to invest and certainly not invest to the detriment of our dividend policy. Our dividend policy is only natural, in view of <mark type="audio gap" /> outcome of our efforts in the past, and of course a reflection of your faith in our growth model which is based on added value, even though prices have deteriorated.</p>
          <p>That's what I wanted to say to begin, but now Patrick de la Chevardi&#xE8;re is going to tell you about the financial results. Patrick, you have the floor.</p>

          <p>Results in dollar, $20.5 billion an increase of 22% compared to 2008. What I think is interesting on the slide is to see the sensitivity of our results to the volatility of the climate. On the right-hand side, 2008 and 2007, the price of Brent went up from $72 a barrel to $97 a barrel, an increase of 34%, and our adjusted result in dollars has gone up from 16.7 to 25. So, that's plus 22%. So, we have managed to lock in a large part of the increase in crude oil. However, in 2008, there has been a fall in the oil price by 37%. But, our adjusted net income has only gone down by 16% in dollars. So, our results have withstood the deteriorated environment very well, and I think that's a characteristic of the company. Of course, we have, like everyone else, been hit by the turnaround in the environment in Q4 2008. In Q4 we had &#x20AC;4.1 billion, with &#x2013; in Q4 2.9 billion with the oil price at 55.</p>
          <p>Now, something which illustrates our good resistance compared to the other majors, I am not going to comment on these two parts of the slide, I'm going to look mainly on the right-hand side of the slide, which is the change in adjusted net income of the majors, Q3 115, Q4 55. We have an adjusted net income down by 38%, Exxon 42, Chevron 46, Shell 52, and BP minus 71. So, I think this clearly shows that in a worse environment, Total resists better than the other majors.</p>
          <p>Cash flow allocated, this of course is what it's all about as we are concerned. If you look on the left-hand side of the slide, cash allocation in 2008, we generated more than $31 billion of cash. We allocated more than $20 billion to investments including acquisitions, that's an increase of 25%. What that means is that more than 65% of the cash flow generated by the company was allocated to investments.</p>
          <p>The dividend was up by 9% in dollars here. That's 23% of cash flow allocated, and on the top, share buybacks have stopped in the second half, and the reduction in net debt by about 2 billion and that has brought the gearing down to 22.5% at the end of the year, whereas in 2007 it was more like 27%. Now, I think that this has enabled us to strengthen the balance sheet at the end of the year. You have the gearing on the left-hand side of this slide, in that smoothed curve, and it's that strong balance sheet, basically, which will enable us to maintain in 2009 an ambitious investment program, 18 billion, as well as maintaining an ambitious dividend policy.</p>
          <p>As far as our financial capacity is concerned, the markets are difficult in terms of raising funds at the moment. As we all know in January, we were able to issue $1 billion at a fixed rate of 4.25% for 10 years. I don't think there are many issuers which could issue that amount at that rate of interest, and we are very happy with that situation. We shall continue to benefit from it, and we shall be issuing four, five, to &#x20AC;6 billion over the year, and I am pretty sure that we won't have too much difficulty in doing that. We think that we have sufficient financial flexibility, both to finance our growth and our dividend.</p>
          <p>And with that, let me give the floor to Yves-Louis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. In 2008, we continued to strengthen our position in the upstream sector. We feel we are very competitive here. And this is illustrated by this slide. We are geographically diversified but we are also technologically diversified. As you know, we have slightly more than 40 years of resources spread over close to 40 countries, but the different technical sectors are well represented as well, heavy oil is about 15%, LNG is slightly below 20%, deep offshore accounting for close to 10%, 35 to 40% in conventional oil, and that is including offshore, and 20% in gas, which includes HP/HT and sour gas.</p>
          <p>The second positive side of our positioning is our technical costs, and we have every reason to believe that we will continue to outperform our peers in terms of technical costs in 2009. Now the decisions to invest are centralized, as you know, and we take a very disciplined approach to this investment portfolio. We have a portfolio of projects under development or pending final investment decision, which is probably among the best in the whole industry. Now, in 2008, our performance was very good despite a number of operating difficulties that we had to contend with, unexpected needless to say.</p>
          <p>First of all, in preparing for the future, this is the left-hand side of the chart displayed here. In 2008, we have made a number of breakthroughs. We've carried out, successfully carried out a number of operations that gave us access to some 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, in new long-term resources. Now this is of course, slightly anticipated, this figure, but between Madagascar, a billion, Synenco, half a million (sic) [billion] , and UTS Energy, if our bid is successful, should generate another 800 million barrels or thereabouts.</p>
          <p>We've also enriched our traditional resources in traditional and less traditional areas. We expanded our exploration acreage in places like UK, Azerbaijan, Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, Nigeria, Australia, Yemen, and we continued to generate some 800 millions of barrels from exploration in countries where we've traditionally operated, on the one hand, but also in countries like Brunei or Australia, China, or Yemen, although Yemen isn't mentioned on the chart. These are countries where we haven't always -- well these are the countries, rather, where we have been present for quite some time.</p>
          <p>We've also conducted a number of re-negotiations and extended contracts in places like Kazakhstan. Here the idea was to extend our concessions as was the case in Libya, Syria, and Argentina, even though in Libya we extended our concession while renegotiating our situation. We've also launched a number new projects, Usan in Nigeria, Anguille, Japan, OML 58 which is an upgrade as you know, also in Nigeria. And finally we have started our production on Moho Bilondo, Jura and K5F.</p>
          <p>Moving on to production, in 2008 we produced 2.34 millions of barrels of equivalent per day, which is not quite as high as 2007. Not quite as high as we hoped, for that matter, but this nonetheless, this puts us on a -- in joint second position in, on the leaderboard, which is not a bad place to be. Although production was down 2%, there was a price effect and a consolidation effect which accounted for 3%. Portfolio changes if you like, this we preferred to increase our production rather than decrease it, but underlying growths, as Christophe de Margerie said, was 1%. This came from 7% increase in new production which was slightly below our expectations, but satisfactory nonetheless.</p>
          <p>Existing production declined by some 3.5%, two-thirds of that was in the North Sea, which is very much what we expected. On technical issues, operating problems that we encountered, as I said unexpected as always. These technical issues cost us 2.5% production, mostly in the North Sea, probably because of the age of our plant, but these technical issues have been overcome, particularly -- certainly in these areas mentioned to you. That doesn't mean that there is any decline, on the contrary, but with Elgin where we had big technical problems in January. Well, Elgin over the full year, actually exceeded the budget we set it. So that we more than offset the shortfall in January of the remaining 11 months, which is evidence of the fact that the underlying resources are well and truly there.</p>
          <p>On the whole, net operating result was $15.82 billion in 2008, which is up 30% and average cost of access to new resources was less than $2 per barrel. This brings me to the replacement of our reserves in 2008. At the end of the year, our proven reserves were very comparable to the level that we started the year at, 10.5 billion barrels. Between the two, there were price effects of course at the start of the year, these reserves had been calculated at $93.72 a barrel at the end of the year, the price according to the rules -- by applying the rules, we calculated them at $36.55 a barrel.</p>
          <p>At constant prices, new contributions, give or take a few barrels, covered our production. The price effect wasn't as big a factor as we might have thought, admittedly the decrease in prices for shared production contracts and shared production agreements certainly generated reserves. But the fact that the price dropped from $93.72 to $36.55 had an effect on the cut-off, which pretty much offset the price effect, give or take 100 million barrels or so. We also disposed of more than we bought, so the portfolio effect was negative, as you know, that was the case with cash again. Libya were contractual modifications, contractual amendments, had an impact on our reserves. And a third disposal that I seemed to have missed, but it's a much smaller one.</p>
          <p>Overall the reserve replacement range, this is not including acquisitions, it is, or was, in 2008, 112%. If we factor in disposals and acquisitions, there were more disposals than acquisitions, but the replacement rate would be 101%, that is including the -- or excluding the price effect. But if you factor in the price effect, you need to reduce these rates by about close to 10%.</p>
          <p>On the whole, our reserves, our proven reserves, are slightly over 12 years. That's the reserve life, that's a 10.5 billion barrels. We could add 9.7 in probable reserves, and this gives us over 20 years proven, or probable, reserve life. If we add all our resources, we will be slightly over 40 years.</p>
          <p>So, what are the operational challenges and objectives for 2009?  Well, I've drawn up a list of five here. First and foremost, we have the fact that we need to successfully start up the five major projects we have planned for 2009. You know these projects, overall they should generate 200,000 barrels at plateau level, that's the &#x2013; our share, 200,000 barrels a day, of course. You have the list here in red rectangles, in chronological order they would be Akpo, Tahiti, Qatargas II, Tombua Landana, and finally Yemen LNG. That is not actually quite to chronological order, but it is close enough. The second challenge facing us in 2009 is to continue to optimize the development of our giant projects. These projects have a combined total of 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent, 40 to $50 billion worth for Total.</p>
          <p>The third operational challenge is to improve the reliability of our installation. As I told you, technical issues cost us 2.5% of our production in 2008. Now we've had a number of issues due to the age of our installations and also to a far negligible extent, to the downturn in quality from our suppliers and subcontracts. If we talk about rotating machines any with shaft turbines, turbo compressors, pumps, or whatever, the failures we've had with these rotating equipment from -- supplied by major suppliers cost us the equivalent of 35,000 barrels a day. This is something we will be looking very closely at ,with a view to improving that figure. We plan to maintain an active exploration program. I am going to come back to that. The discovery cost target will be two to three barrels -- 2 to $3 per barrel, rather. I know the price was lower a few years ago, but.</p>
          <p>Our fifth objective is to reduce our breakeven point, putting special efforts into operating expenses. We've set ourselves the ambitious target of reducing OpEx by 800. That is company-operated OpEx. We plan to reduce company-operated OpEx by $800 million by the end of 2009. We have actually been rolling out OpEx plans in all our subsidiaries, more about that in a few minutes. And on the left-hand side of that chart, you will see the contribution of these various challenges, certainly the three biggest. This will be the impact on our cash flow and you will see that by far, it's the start-ups that will contribute the most.</p>
          <p>For a full year, which will be 2010, these start-ups should generate cash flow of some, a little over $2 billion. If we could gain 1% in reliability by reducing the number of technical issues, that will be the equivalent of another $250 million, and the plan to reduce OpEx, while $800 million is on company-operated OpEx, but we also have the share to our affiliates under taxation of course. But on the whole, that OpEx plan should make a net contribution to cash flow of some 200 million.</p>
          <p>The upshot of all this is that we're going to continue to pursue value creation by Upstream investment and by technical cost. And I want to dwell on technical costs for a few seconds. Our technical costs, this is the right-hand side of the chart. Our technical cost increased by almost $3 a barrel in 2008, and of those $3, slightly less than $1 was due to ForEx under price effects or portfolio effects, the remainder being spread fairly evenly between depreciation and amortization on the one hand, and OpEx on the other.</p>
          <p>2009, in view of the fact that depreciation amortization, well, being what they are. This is a reflection <mark type="audio gap" /> of our previous outlays, and with a mechanical effect on the amount of depreciation and amortization, the upshot being that we'll have to improve our OpEx if we want to stabilize technical costs.</p>
          <p>As I said, to do that we have focused on the company-operated OpEx. And in the last quarter of 2008 we launched OpEx programs in all our subsidiaries. We have to set ourselves a target of 800 million in savings a year. According to the feedback on this OpEx program from the subsidiaries, this objective is certainly achievable. It's still ambitious, admittedly, but it's achievable.</p>
          <p>This can be achieved in three ways. Some 40% from optimization streamlining, some 20% can be achieved through, by delaying certain operations, which at current oil prices wouldn't be altogether justified or altogether viable. In all events they need to be postponed. The remaining 40% of the OpEx reduction plan coming from re-negotiation of projects and cost reductions, particularly with our suppliers.</p>
          <p>I also said we'd be upholding our CapEx, our CapEx budget will be U.S.$14 billion in 2009. As you will see on the left-hand bar chart, that is up slightly on 2008, but the breakdown is very similar to 2008. 43% of those 14 billion will be devoted to the conventional off-shore operations, some 23% to deep offshore operations, 13% will be earmarked for LNG projects. In the region of 10% for onshore exploration, and exploration accounting for some 8% of the total OpEx budget. Heavy oils, which we really looking at very closely for the long term, only account for something like 4% of our total CapEx for the moment.</p>
          <p>Now, the real issue here is how costs are evolving over time. Here again I want to come back to our company-operated OpEx or operation -- operating expenditure. Now, the breakdown, this is the central chart here. The breakdown you will see is approximately 29% of our CapEx for drilling, 20% on construction, 37% on equipment, and 13% are for steel. The remaining 14% being for supervision and engineering. Here again, engineering services aren't necessarily at the same levels of cost, but there is a lot of work, and these are costs that are difficult to reduce.</p>
          <p>If we look at how we foresee developments over time, certainly with the hindsight of 2007 and 2008, you will see that in 2007 -- right-hand chart -- 2007 by comparison 2006, the various components: FPSOs, LNG, the rollout of offshore pipes, subsurface equipment, that's not including wells, but umbilical cords and other flow lines and gas-turbines. On the whole, the increase was about 18%.</p>
          <p>In 2008, there was a sharp slowdown in CapEx, and certainly these components, and with components such as turbines, the downturn was 15%, also reduction in offshore pipes. Conversely the subsurface equipment we'll continue to invest in. As for next year I think all components, with the possible exception of subsurface equipment, will decrease. We expect a sharp decrease in our CapEx in offshore pipes, and probably as well in gas turbines. So we are taking a very active approach to the reduction of costs. We're doing a lot in-house to benefit from the fact that the economy has contracted, and this should of course be reflected in our cost structure.</p>
          <p>Over and beyond, that we must look at the next wave of major projects. Here again we are doing a lot of work while being very disciplined about our investment. This is illustrated, I think, best by the chart on the left-hand side of the slide, which shows our internal rate of return on the one hand, but also the enrichment on the X axis, internal rate of return on the Y axis. Now, our decision threshold, or hurdle rate as we call it, is between 10 and 14%, that's the range.</p>
          <p>There's quite a sharp contrast between deep and ultra deep offshore, which have very short plateaus, but a very high rate of return, and longer plateau projects which aren't as profitable, but provide with considerable, provide us with considerable enrichment. So, obviously at oil prices between 40 and $100, at $40 it's still viable in the case of deep and offshore, or ultra-deep offshore, but with LNG, heavy oils, or Kashagan for instance, we are really looking at $60 a barrel to make these projects viable.</p>
          <p>We also expect OpEx and CapEx to be down by 20% on these projects. Over and beyond that, we do have a certain amount of leeway as regards the volumes invested. On the right-hand side of the chart you will see our plans for Upstream projects in 2009 and 2010, that is the CapEx for Upstream projects of course.</p>
          <p>And moving further field, for this new wave of projects, we have set ourselves an exploration budget of $1.7 billion, that's the same order magnitude as 2008, which was $1.8 billion. Discovery costs in 2008 were 2.4, approximately. Now by maintaining this exploration budget, the volume of the budget, this should have a sharper price decrease than in other sectors. I think contractors know that exploration's probably the most fragile block in the process, but with seismic exploration and drilling we expect sharper cost cutting.</p>
          <p>A little over a year ago, we rolled out a disciplined program for exploration. We simplified our exploration, well trajectories, we also took a more selective approach to data acquisition through electronic acquisition, for instance, by avoiding redundancies and nice to have data, as we call it. We have taken more selective approach to prospects screening. Talking about the exploration programs, they are reviewed four times a year by the management committee. Our exploration budget will be about 45% devoted to Africa, 25% to Northern Europe, and about 15% between the Far East Asia and the Americas. So we will continue to explore the most prolific oil fields and believe that we will be able to maintain our exploration costs in the region of 2 to $3 per barrel.</p>
          <p>Now, we will continue to consolidate our heavy oil portfolio. Heavy oils are an important component in our strategy. We believe that they will be absolutely necessary to meet hydrocarbon demand once the crisis is behind us. Demand will be driven by the emerging countries, of course. So we are grasping the opportunities available to us to consolidate our portfolios while making acquisitions at reasonable costs, as you know Synenco in 2008, Synenco rather, and of course the bid we've made for UTS.</p>
          <p>However, in the current market conditions, we probably need 80 to $85 a barrel to justify heavy oil exploration. Costs increased considerably because of overheating, and particularly in that part of the world. So maybe that overheating will cool off. So, we need higher oil prices to justify development. We are consolidating our portfolio also to reap as much benefit as we can from new synergies between this redeployment of our portfolio. We were looking at cost technology, structures, organization, projects; to see if we couldn't generate better synergies. And of course the calendar of our Canadian projects. We will continue to invest in research and development to improve our recovery rate and to limit the impact on the environment.</p>
          <p>In fact, there are two real issues to be solved in terms of development. The tar sands of course and that's the price issue, as I said. And of course the environmental footprint, not just in terms of CO2 but in terms of water resources. So, here we will continue to invest in research and development for these purposes.</p>
          <p>Five major projects will be started up in 2009 and we have great expectations of them in terms of value creation. Now you are familiar with these: Akpo, Yemen LNG, Tahiti, Tombua Landana, and Qatargas II. That is more or less in chronological order this time around. At the bottom left of the slide you will see the contribution that these projects will make to our production. As of 2009, they should be contributing some 75 million barrels a day, and in 2010 we'll be closer to the plateau that will be in the region of 230 million barrels per day. If we add in what we started up in 2008, Jura and Moho Bilondo and -- to name but two of them, this will contribute significantly to our production.</p>
          <p>Now these projects are at lower than average technical costs. The lower than the average of our exploration production portfolio, certainly lower than they were in 2008. The rest of the portfolio has taken a cost at about $13.5, but these projects have an average technical cost of 11.5. In fact, the gap between the two is closer to 2.5% rather than 3%, or dollar should I say, not percent. They will contribute considerably to the creation of value and on the right-hand side you see the profitability of these projects, which even at $40 a barrel are still highly viable, and of course all the more profitable as prices rise.</p>
          <p>Generally speaking, the impact of hydrocarbon prices on our Upstream portfolio is two-fold. First of all, there is the impact on production. This is illustrated on the left-hand bar chart, and in 2009 I think we can expect that every time the prices fluctuate by $1, we can expect our production, which is estimated at -- while the equivalent is 2 to 3,000 barrels a day, that's at the same dollar price, will be the same depending on what the oil price is. And something we've already mentioned, the Group, this is the good resilience of the Upstream portfolio, in terms of adjusted net operating income for the fourth quarter of 2008, which is a good reflection of our ability to withstand the situation. We, along with Exxon Mobil, in having our net operating income per barrel -- just net operating income barrel, sorry, let me say that again. Along with Exxon, the impact on our adjusted net operating income per barrel is lower than any of our competitors. We have withstood the situation better than anybody else.</p>
          <p>If we compare the fourth quarter 2008 with the third quarter of 2007, where Brent price dropped by 20%, our return -- our net per barrel was down 43%. This was because of two things. First of all, our share in a contract with a very tax rate, but fixed margin. Also the fact that our technical costs are among the lowest of the five oil majors listed on this chart.</p>
          <p>To conclude, a now traditional overview of all the projects we have, you will see that quite a few are already being developed. The majority, in fact, have already been appraised and studied, we are now conducting basic engineering on these projects.</p>
          <p>Now, with the natural decline rate of approximately 4% per annum, these projects should enable us to keep our production on the trend you can see here. We are not quoting figures, but you will see that the trend is less and less accurate as we -- the further ahead we move in time, obviously.</p>
          <p>That's what I wanted to say to you about the Upstream.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Yves-Louis. Philip Boisseau on LNG, just a focus on LNG, just a few words about the way in which we find the market today. The price of gas of course has fallen in the U.S., gas price is around $4.5 per Mbtu, in Europe it's about $8 <mark type="audio gap" />. Question is, in the next couple of years, how do we see the gas market?</p>
          <p>Well, I am not going to make any predictions here, because there are lots of uncertainties, but what we can say is that, if we believe the economic forecasts for 2009 and 2010, there are likely to be two effects on gas consumption. The first effect is, of course, the effect of the recession, which is going to bring consumption down. But there's a second effect, which is linked to the fact that the, in a low price environment, the electricity producers will probably arbitrate in favor of gas, and that will increase demand. So for 2009 and 2010, we believe that, overall, the effect will be a stabilization of gas consumption, no increase. And we have 85 million tons per year of LNG projects, which were launched 2004, 2005. Half of that comes from Qatar, and -- which are of course to supply the world market.</p>
          <p>So, is there going to be gas bubble on -- and an impact on gas prices?  I think in the current price environment, $4.5 in the U.S., and American prices which are lower than European prices, which are correlated to Brent, we have two things which are happening. The first is that U.S. gas producers, in particularly the difficult producers in gas or top gas, have stopped drilling, and basically that will lead to a sudden and massive reduction of U.S. domestic gas production, because of a 30% production decline.</p>
          <p>So, if that means that more gas is going to be used for electricity generation, the U.S. is going to have more demand for imported LNG, and that's going to happen at the end of this year and beginning 2010.</p>
          <p>And there's a second effect which makes the market even more dissymmetric, which is that European gas consumers, which have flexibility of about 10% in their long term gas supply contracts and in the, given the spot price is $4.5, and the market for long term in Europe is higher because of the Brent prices. So the European gas companies are going to take more out of the spot market and less out of the long term contracts. So the 85 million tons arriving on the market by 2011, gradually should be taken up in U.S. and in Europe, and $4.5 in the U.S. on the left-hand side. That is homogenous with the project costs as we see them today, either the West Africa LNG projects or the Middle East LNG projects.</p>
          <p>In the longer term, and the longer term means 10 to 15 years to prepare and bring online new LNG projects, we have a fairly good visibility about that. And what we see is that it is a pretty tight market because the number of long-term projects is not big enough to meet increasing demand, which of course will take off again when the crisis is over, because of the major constraints, geopolitical, environmental, or even economic. Most of the sources of the major projects in the future are basically Nigeria, Australia, Iran, with all the uncertainties of course that those areas involve.</p>
          <p>In the shorter term, how is Total doing in this environment?  The projects we announced and the growth figures we announced are now coming online. The two major LNG projects which are coming online this year, Yemen LNG in the second quarter and Qatargas II in the second half, will increase production and therefore LNG sales by Total, and it will be up to about 40 million tons per year. In 2009 is the year in which the two latest terminals will be commissioned. The first terminal in which we have a holding is <mark type="inaudible" /> and Sabine Pass, South Hook in a few weeks' time and Fos-Cavaou this summer. So we will have upstream and downstream production, which is taken care of. We now have a portfolio with a couple of new projects where we have access to sales in the Middle East, they are well-positioned for arbitrage possibilities, and we therefore have an integrated position and well distributed geographically.</p>
          <p>What can we say about the value of the LNG chain?  Well the value is, I think is a good opportunity to illustrate in the current environment, the benefits of our integration project. As production increases, on the left-hand side, we increased our sales portfolio and our marketing possibility. So, the two go up, and in terms of long-term demands, you have a impact of the long-term production contracts on the basis of oil-indexed contracts, or on the basis of spot contracts, and we have a tripling of long-term purchases.</p>
          <p>What that graph doesn't show is the pure trading on the spot market, if we integrate that to give you a few figures in terms of number of cargos, because I know our competitors tend to give that. 2008, we traded 40 cargos, and it will be more like 120 in 2010. So, that will triple our positions on the global LNG market.</p>
          <p>In this environment, we need a downstream position because when the price is a buyer's market, the fact that you're a buyer means that you can send the cargos to wherever you want to send them, towards markets which give us greater returns, and that's the European market. So the fact that we have upstream and downstream means that we can -- we can arbitrage the markets which are the most profitable. We have also signed with CNOOC, a long-term supply contract of up to 1 million tons a year at prices indexed on energy, and that's a good contract.</p>
          <p>In summary, therefore, we're continuing our strategy. It's a strategy which makes our projects as robust as ever, given what I said on arbitrage possibilities, and which will continue beyond 2010 because beyond that, Angola LNG will start up and we'll continue growth into 2012.</p>
          <p>And then the next wave, as Yves already said, we're in the process of preparing it. There are four projects here: Shtokman, Nigeria LNG, Ichthys LNG, and Brass LNG. These are products which are in the feed stage and the final investment decision will be taken at the end of this year for the quicker ones, and 2010. And I think the point I want to make on this slide -- this is the time to derive the benefit from cost reductions because as these are not yet projects which have been launched, we hope that when the projects are launched, we shall get the best possible benefit out of new market conditions, lower costs, and that would ensure the long term future of these contracts. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody. Well, in the Downstream, no need to tell you that the environment is difficult. Demand is decreasing. Now on this chart you will see our best estimation of the first half-year. It will be between -- global figure will be somewhere between 1.5 and 2 billion barrels, down on the previous year. And that's all we can say for the moment, we're not going to venture any further than that. But the figure of 1 billion was in the press only yesterday.</p>
          <p>And if we look at this by region, you'll see on the chart that in Europe, where Total has its biggest foothold. Europe is not as badly affected as North America, or as badly affected as China, which is moving into negative growth at the moment, negative growth of demand. But it's not all about the tonnage, we need to look at the additional capacity going on-stream. There are projects that were launched and that should come on-stream in 2009 or 2010, will come on-stream because there is no stopping these projects when they're started up. This of course will contribute to an even greater imbalance.</p>
          <p>Thankfully, capacity projects are not based in Europe. However, we in Europe will have to face the imbalance between petrol in the Atlantic Basin, which is not just increasing but increasing considerably, some 30 million tons a year are exported from Western Europe and this is a produce that does not find outlets. The usual outlet is the U.S.</p>
          <p>As for Northern European production, but because of the increased engine capacity in cars in the U.S., because of biofuel programs, which are decreasing demand for fuel on both sides of the Atlantic, and because of tax incentives to revert to diesel. Because of these factors, we do not see this imbalance being reduced in the years to come. I think it's quite obvious that we can't just stock unsold refined products. If gas, or gasoline, or petrol as you prefer, continues not to sell, this is going to be a serious problem for refiners, particularly the least efficient of the refiners.</p>
          <p>Moving on to regulatory issues, we have all heard about the energy and climate package and other similar programs in recent months, which are going to add on an extra layer of cost that the industry is going to have to take on if it wants to survive. In the shorter term, and I'm now commenting the right-hand side of the chart, there are price differences <mark type="inaudible" /> with Brent for the main products leaving our refineries. And this isn't a reflection of the French market, these are the figures as quoted in Rotterdam.</p>
          <p>What you'll see is that petrol is gasoline, is worth less and less. A barrel of gasoline, a barrel of petrol, is at exactly the same cost, more or less, as a barrel of crude. So refiners do not make money refining gasoline. This is a free market and obviously there is excess production, so if you are producing gasoline, at best you can hope to recover the cost of the crude oil molecules that you put into your distillation process. Diesel, however, is increasingly scarce and has a scarcity value, it's become expensive. Naphtha, which Fran&#xE7;ois Corn&#xE9;lis will probably talk about very shortly, is very similar to gasoline. The naphtha curve is heading south. So, a barrel of naphtha costs less than a barrel of crude.</p>
          <p>As for heavy fuel, the situation will probably not last, but for the moment, heavy fuel is holding up well. The winter was cold. But we can't bank on cold winters in the years to come. Now, between postponements and projects abandoned, everything we've announced will or will not happen, and the effects of the various imbalances I will just comment will all lead the OECD countries to reduce their refining capacity in the fairly short future, with a view to achieving a better balance over the long term. We nonetheless have to get over the hump.</p>
          <p>So, what are we doing about that?  At Total, we are very well geared to diesel refining, we are in a stronger position than our competitors. We are in a stronger position to harness mergers than with the balance of supply and demand suggest for the various products. Three of our biggest refineries in Europe: Antwerp, Leuna and Vlissingen, which account for one-third of refining capacity in Europe are regularly ranked in the top quarter of all refineries, that's in terms of efficiency. We also have a number of projects up our sleeves that should enable us to actually reinforce this position.</p>
          <p>Now, I'm going to comment the right-hand side of the slide now. We are capable of improving or should I say -- of further improving -- our capacity to produce diesel between now and 2015. Just to give you an order of magnitude as regards to what we have in the pipeline, between 2005 and 2015, we will -- we should be capable of improving our diesel production by 50% without actually increasing the number of barrels coming through our refineries. In other words, we should be able to produce more diesel, but we have to be able to produce and sell gasoline at the same time.</p>
          <p>But, the chance here is to produce more diesel without increasing the overall throughput in our refineries, this we'll achieve by investing in desulfurizing units, this is something we are doing. This would be achieved by leveraging our recent investment in the Normandy refinery's hydro-cracker, which is doing well, and this will be achieved by investing in a coker. In Port Arthur, that's our refinery in the U.S. The coke balloons arrived in the very last week of last year. And the project is going to plan.</p>
          <p>We will also achieve this by preparing for the future, investing in order to meet the long-term demand in the market. Our emblematic project is really the Jubail refinery that I have talked about in the past. But the Jubail project is one you are familiar with now. This is a project that has been confirmed. On the left-hand side, you have our estimate of what will happen in the industry. Early 2008 there were 24 million barrels a day of new refining capacity.</p>
          <p>That's -- they're figures that were announced by the various players in the market, by the refiners, certain number of consultants, certain number of governments. Number of governments announced that they would be building refineries on their own territory. So we took a look at some 500 projects, one by one, and believe that only half of these will come to fruition. So the 34 million barrels a day would in fact, in all likelihood, be 12 million barrels a day. That is the probable figure.</p>
          <p>Now we believe that a number of projects will be whittled down to something in the region of, well, 12 million barrels a day will be whittled down to probably 7.5 million barrels a day, and probably be further whittled down again. Jubail is one of the survivors for the simple reason that Jubail is a very good project, it's a dependable project because the partners Saudi Aramco and Total on a 50/50 basis, are determined to go ahead with the refinery. This is because the refiner is ideally positioned for arbitration between the different markets. It will be fueled by an Aramco oil field which is very close to the refinery, so the supply cost will be very low. The Jubail port is one of the most efficient on the planet, and because of -- we're looking at dedicated crude, we can tailor a refinery for this particular crude. Because of that, because of this whole structure, with 100% heavy oil or heavy crude, should I say, we will not be producing any heavy fuel at all.</p>
          <p>As for the economics of the project, the economics are good, as we may or may not have said, we certainly announced in Jubail that the start-up would be postponed for a simple reason. That is because we need to give the construction bidders a little bit of time to realize that the world has changed. That there is a crisis going on, and that costs are not what they thought they were, certainly not what they were last year.</p>
          <p>So, when you receive tenders we review them, and if we do not reach a successful conclusion, we repeat our questions, which shouldn't -- delays the whole process by a few weeks every time, but we believe that the potential CapEx decrease is worth the wait. As a result, the Jubail refinery will probably be delayed by a few weeks, possibly up to six months, and if we need more time, we take more time. When the bidders and contractors realized that the world has changed, we will award the contracts. I will have signed $120 million contract, we actually signed one just a few days ago.</p>
          <p>When the refinery starts up, our entitlement will be 5% of our total refining capacity, and we expect a net operating income in excess of $300 million. The margins will be similar to those of last year, giving us a return on average capital employed of over 15%.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, life goes on -- life goes on and we must keep up our efforts, that means that we must trim what can be trimmed, and when we compare ourselves with our competitors, we are relatively pleased with the way things went in 2008.</p>
          <p>As illustrated by the colored curves on the left-hand side of this slide, page 30. If the people who complied these statistics are reliable,  we are one of the most efficient actors in the industry on a level footing with ExxonMobil. I saw figures over the first nine months of the year that reached the same conclusion only recently.</p>
          <p>It would appear so that despite the difficulties encountered, our mix is not bad at all ,even more reassuringly we have no shortage of ideas as to how we can continue to improve in 2009, that's the right-hand side of this slide. We have listed the various &#x2013; or should I say, we listed the results of the various performance and productivity plans we have been rolling out since 2004 over the last five or six years, that's in orange. In grey, we have the impact or negative impact of inflation, our productivity gains were obviously partly offset by inflation, and you will see that every year we have improved, we have outperformed inflation.</p>
          <p>For 2009, we have 120 plans all over the world in the difference subsidiaries in the world. 120 action plans that should enable us to continue to improve, we haven't put a grey bar for inflation, because we don't what it's going to be -- probably less in 2009 than in 2008, but there really isn't any knowing. These plans are already up and running. 2008 was a record year in terms of the reliability of our industrial plant. We outperformed the budget, which was nonetheless a difficult budget to achieve, and in 2009 we plan to beat the record we achieved in 2008.</p>
          <p>We are going to continue to cut costs, which should enable us to maintain double-digit growth in 2009. This is a relatively conservative estimate as regards refining margins in Europe.</p>
          <p>Thank you. Fran&#xE7;ois?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, three messages that I'd like to leave with you as far as Chemicals are concerned. The first is that the impact of the economic crisis has been very strong on Chemicals. But we are restructuring our industrial base. So we haven't been taken entirely by surprise, and Chemicals should not consume very much capital in the years to come, because apart from Qatar, we have no other major investment projects for the time being.</p>
          <p>First thing, the collapse in volumes in 2008. I think it's important for you to know that this is unprecedented in recent history of the industry. You can see on the top left-hand part of the slide that Europe has lost 10% of volume after gaining 3% in 2007. United States lost 12% in 2008 after  flat 2007 and, even more serious, China lost 2% of volume in 2008 after a plus 9% gain in 2007. The figures for Q4 are of course exaggerated by massive destocking along the supply chain. But nevertheless, overall in 2008 and for the first time, I think, since 50 years, the world ethylene demand has fallen by 3% whereas the global capacity for ethylene increased by 4%.</p>
          <p>Now we of course hope for 2009 that volumes will stabilize at those low levels. As far as the margins are concerned, we had a very difficult and different year in the first half. We didn't manage to accommodate the price increase in naphtha, and in the second part of the year we had artificially high margins because the price of polymers fell after the fall in the price of naphtha. The utilization rates of the crackers were much lower, less than 80% in the United States. They fell in Europe from July, and in December it was 50%.</p>
          <p>For the time being, we are up to about 80% utilization rate with some restocking. So I think there are two things important which -- here, the first is that we should have an industrial base which is turning at 80% of capacity, which is of course not enough, so there will be restructuring in Japan, in Europe, and in the United States. Secondly, this crisis is occurring when three of the five major petrochemical players are in difficulty, Dow Chemicals, BASF, and ENOS.</p>
          <p>Second important point -- we haven't, as I said, been taken completely by surprise, because we are in the process of restructuring our industrial base. Three years ago, we launched self-help measures, which were focused on three issues. The first was the continuous cut in overheads, and that basically means refocusing our capacity on the largest facilities and the most efficient facilities. And we are in the process of starting up the new styrene facility in Gonfreville, which will be the only styrene facility we keep in Europe, and we shall close down the old styrene facility in Carling next year, and stopping one of the Carling crackers. Then we are cutting variable costs with some investment to reduce our energy consumption and increase the efficiency of our facilities. The aim is to continue to make energy efficiency gains at a level of 2% a year.</p>
          <p>Third point, the improvement in our infrastructure so that our petrochemicals is -- has lower price feedstocks than naphtha, naphtha prices of courses collapsed over the past few months. But, naphtha prices has been -- have been very high in the past few months. So, to have profitable petrochemicals we have to have other feedstock. So in Port Arthur, Antwerp, and Gonfreville we are equipped to deal with ethane from other refineries, and we can also deal with gasoline if the gasoline market further collapses. And we are installed in countries where we do have low cost ethane, and that is precisely the aim of the project in Qatar, where we are starting the largest ethane cracking facility this month -- this summer, which should have a polyethylene facility which is the largest in the world, which will have synergy with Qapco.</p>
          <p>We are therefore talking about improvements of between 150 to $200 million of net income in terms of petrochemicals, on the basis of the margin assumptions, or the crude oil price consumptions. And we are not going to consume much capital either. As I said, we've refocused on a small number of world-class facilities in the Middle East, in Europe, and the U.S. Our U.S. business is based on the largest liquid cracker in the world in Port Arthur, and downstream of that we have the largest polypropylene facility in Houston.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we have refocused on Antwerp and Gonfreville. Antwerp, which has the largest polypropylene plant in Europe, Gonfreville will have, downstream, this new world-class styrene facility. In the Middle East, we shall be concluding the Qatofin with Qapco this summer. And that will be absolutely decisive for us in accessing the Asian market. In Asia, we are now focused on the Daesan platform in association with Samsung. This is one of the most efficient petrochemical platforms in Asia. It's been de-bottlenecked systematically over the past few years. We still need to make one or two improvements there to make the plant even more efficient.</p>
          <p>And we have two major projects, which are more long-term &#x2013; Arzew, which is still being negotiated today to deal with Algerian ethane, and to produce polyethylene in Algeria. That will be a good complement to our European installations, and the Jubail project, where we will have a world-class paraxylene unit, integrated with the Jubail refinery.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much indeed, Fran&#xE7;ois. Okay, we'll try and go through the outlook and conclusion a little more rapidly. My introduction was almost a conclusion in itself, so it shouldn't take long.</p>
          <p>First slide, we are going to maintain our CapEx program. Now, this is a very clearcut message, $18 billion, same level as last year. This is -- includes our intentions to reduce the cost of our investments, rather than the volume of investments. All the better if we can improve on that, but very clearly, we must maintain our projects within the budget. We'll see if we can reduce cost on existing projects, but for new projects, discipline is of the essence in every sector we operate in.</p>
          <p>Now the Upstream is given pride of place, because it generates most profitability, 14 billion in Upstream, 3 billion for Downstream, 1 billion for Chemicals. There will be opportunities and acquisitions as -- we will be making bids, as we did with UTS. In Canada, you're familiar with all the projects in all our sectors, 75% of all CapEx being dedicated to the Upstream.</p>
          <p>Now the portfolio is moving towards high-value segments. This is an aspect of our strategy that you're familiar with as well. We are an integrated company, and we're not going to change that. We believe that it's in our interest to remain integrated, not just to reap the benefits of the value added by each sector, but also in view of the ability this gives us to develop. We have seen this in the past.</p>
          <p>Very clearly, between 2004 and 2009, the proportion of capital employed in Chemicals has decreased from 24 to 12%. This was largely due to the spin-off of Arkema, which is of course included in these figures. Now Fran&#xE7;ois explained very clearly that we now have a high-quality industrial plants. We've already made the investments required. In the Downstream, we will be employing less capital, but this is also because the core business is very clearly the Upstream, not just in exploration and production, but also in gas. And of course the proportion of our capital employed in the Upstream will be increased from 48% in 2004 to 64% in 2009. I mentioned 75%, you see where we're heading.</p>
          <p>Now leaving aside Exxon, which is a bit of a &#x2013; not in the competition here, but we in terms of, obviously for business segments, are top of the class. Total had some difficulties when the barrel of oil was $140, as we saw in the third quarter of 2008. But once the prices dropped somewhat, we are able to resist the market better than the rest. All the better, because that would appear to be the prevailing environment at present, but as Yves-Louis has said, it is more important than ever to keep our technical costs below those of our competitors.</p>
          <p>In all events, we must put an end to the inflation of technical costs we saw in recent years. I think Patrick told you about how strong our balance sheet is, but the most important thing I would like to say here is that, with our solid balance sheet we can make the investments despite the fact that we are investing substantially in a time of crisis. We can have the means to have a very strong dividend payout policy without jeopardizing our situation in any way. This is all the more important in times of shortage of liquidity. With a net-debt-to-equity ratio of 22.5% at year-end 2008, I told you earlier on that we will be aiming at 25 to 30% in 2009, and this increase will enable us to withstand one or more difficult years while continuing to create value for our shareholders, and while continuing to ensure that when the economy picks up, the Group will be able to reap the benefits of its long-term strategy.</p>
          <p>I told you about the sources of value creation, that's only half-illustrated in this slide, because when you have yields increasing at a time when the share price is decreasing, that's only half satisfactory. With that said, that's life, that's way thing are. At yesterday's Board meeting proposed is that at our AGM, we propose to increase the dividend by 10%, that's 10% year-on-year with a total pay-out ratio of 37%. That's of course in respect of financial 2008.</p>
          <p>I'm not going to shout as loud as a number of our competitors, but in the current situation, with a very deteriorated market, we are not going to change our dividend policy. We will ensure that our shareholders receive a good return on their investment. We will of course be acting responsibly. This has been clear in recent years. I think the industry has changed its perception. This is particularly important in times of crisis, when people are very sensitive to issues such as -- especially at a time when posting profits leave some people a little bit taken aback, but posting profits is one thing that enables us to invest, enables us to fund our CapEx, enables us to have one of the best social policies of all French companies. Posting profits also enables us to ensure that our responsibility in security and environmental issues is greater and better defended than before.</p>
          <p>We've had a number of problems of late, despite the fact that our statistics are much better than the past. We had one or two accidents in France, which is evidence of the fact that you can never do enough for safety. It is not a matter of money, it's a matter of behavior, whence the whole notion of acting responsibly. We want Total, in times such as these, to take a clear-cut as -- position as possible. When accidents occur, particularly the pollution of rivers or similar instance, not only is it unacceptable, it is also very difficult to accept. We must be more watchful than ever before. We have been increasing our attentiveness, but we are more watchful than ever before.</p>
          <p>We've been looking at strategic partnerships with a number of oil-producing countries, but let's be optimistic. A better partnership doesn't necessarily mean paying more taxes, it means being better integrated. It means not just developing our core businesses, but it means more training for staff. It means operating in a number of areas that aren't &#x2013; that we aren't automatically associated with, but that are part of the value that a company like Total can create, possibly better than others in these difficult times.</p>
          <p>The messages are very clearly, though we may not be aiming at three-thirds exactly. However, we are continuing to recruit. We have a very proactive recruitment policy throughout the world. We have a very impressive compensation policy. We pay a high payout ratio to our shareholders. This means that we can continue to invest, continue to recruit, and continue to let civil society benefit from our profits.</p>
          <p>Finally, a few words about strengthening our growth model. Now this may seem strange, but we are talking about strengthening the growth model at a time when some may have expected us to withdraw from the areas that made us successful. But with our gearing, we have a very strong financial situation. We are continuing to employ the same levels of capital. We intend to reduce our costs, but we also want to show that our industrial efforts will pay off in the long term. So, there is no question of having a stop-and-go policy in this field, not just in the Upstream, but also in the Downstream and Chemicals.</p>
          <p>Now we're not putting figures on our production here, but our production will increase. Yves-Louis has already made a commitment before you to ensure that there will be fewer technical issues next year, that's a 2.5% production capacity increase, that's just been announced. So, congratulations Yves-Louis. Something your predecessor didn't achieve, but I'm sure you will. Well, with the 10% increase in the dividend, well we believe that that's warranted, justified over and beyond pressure there's been -- people have tried to bring to bear on us here and there, but most importantly we will continue to invest in research and development.</p>
          <p>Its absolutely essential that we continue to take technology a step further, not just the technology we use day-in and day-out, but also new ways of using energy, more efficient ways of using energy. This is one of our commitments to the environment, not just in health safety and environment, but also in terms of what we call the footprint, particularly in terms of global warming and CO2 emissions.</p>
          <p>So, to sum up, Total is a company that is in a strong position to sustain growth in difficult times. We don't necessarily foresee when these difficult times will end, but we do know that energy prices will benefit companies that had a good starting position, as we have. But companies that have contained their costs, improved their industrial capacity, and continue to focus on the long term. Remember that the best return, or best yield for shareholders, is of course the dividend, to create value we have to invest. More than ever before this is being borne out.</p>
          <p>But I can't resist saying that all the great business models we heard about and that were expounded and extolled years ago have not only proved to be, well, a folly in financial terms, but a number of industrial strategies have also proved to be follies. But I hate to say this, but to earn money you have to invest money. You have to invest smartly. If there is no investment, there is no yield and there will be no dividend. That's not the message by the way, don't get me wrong.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Aymeric De Villaret, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. You talked about an ambitious dividend policy. Now six months ago, it was a sustained dividend policy, and then it was competitive. Now you're talking about strong or ambitious. What does that mean, a strong dividend policy? We've had a stable final dividend, compared to the interim dividend. 2009 when the price of oil is going to go down a bit and therefore the results probably will as well. What does a strong dividend policy mean? Shell has already announced an increase in its dividend for 2009. So, what do you mean by a strong dividend policy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the words, the words may change, but the policy remains the same, is the answer. I think it's fairly clear that, as our results have increased, the dividend has increased. The dividend has increased by 10% year-on-year. Now, the interim dividend is equal to the final dividend, so compared to the interim dividend it hasn't increased. Now that clearly is something that goes down well with the press, or doesn't, but the analysts can see through it and I'm sure you do. So we have increased our dividend by 10%. And don't forget that. And we also have increased our investment, so a strong dividend policy means maintaining our dividend policy even when prices fall. And that's a strong dividend policy, because you could expect if oil prices fall the dividends fall, no.</p>
          <p>Now I'm not sure that Shell's solution is the right solution. I think perhaps they should start by giving production figures, and once we have production figures, we can talk about dividends. That's a jibe at my neighbor, but I -- talking about a dividend in advance, I think it's a little peculiar, because it becomes an obligation. I hope that we shall be able to do better in this year than last year, but we're not obviously going to forecast an increase in dividend when oil prices have fallen from 140 to $40. But we believe that a dividend policy is an integral part of our strategy. We will not yield to pressure, which is not -- nothing to do with this industry. We are not asking for the support of governments wherever they are, and we shall maintain our policy and that I think is a strong policy.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What about Sanofi, you sold some of Sanofi in Q4. Are you going to continue doing that in 2009, are you going to continue to sell your Sanofi investment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we've been doing that since the beginning of the year. The figures have come out very clearly from the presentation. We sold about &#x20AC;1.3 billion -- $1.3 billion, and I put it in dollars, because it's easier for the cash flow. But we sell the sales -- we sell the shares in euros, of course. $1.3 billion of Sanofi shares in 2008. We are going to speed up the pace of that in 2009, 2010, and 2011, because our strategy is clearly, as markets permit, to sell that portfolio.</p>
          <p>And we've announced that we are going to do that and we shall do that, but we shall do it quietly. We do not wish to disrupt the share price by selling a lot of shares on the market -- that would be bad for Sanofi and bad for us. And you will have noticed that the sales that we've made have not driven Sanofi sale price -- share price down.</p>
          <p>Next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A question about your acquisitions policy and the possible opportunities in the current economic environment. Even if you are putting pressure on your suppliers, the cost of services is not going to fall considerably. So, given your financial capacity, are you likely to be a little more aggressive in terms of acquisitions than you have been on UTS?  Perhaps you could go for bigger deals? You were talking about that in September, and how has your thinking on that changed since last September in terms of acquisitions, that is the first question?</p>
          <p>Second question, what is the necessary oil price in 2009 to maintain a stable gearing ratio?  You said that quite a few new projects, which are very profitable, will be coming online in 2009, so that is my second question. Third question, there has been a considerable fall in the tax rate on the Downstream in 2008, now if the price of oil doesn't change compared to today, what is the tax rate likely to be in 2009, can you give us some guidance on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Answers. I am going to answer that first question straightaway. On acquisitions, what we intend to do, I think, on costs I am not sure that I agree with your assumption. I think costs will fall more quickly than you seem to be thinking. Don't forget that, given the current investments, even if we are trying to get prices to fall, it is difficult to get a contractor to lower his prices on things we've already signed. But we don't want to kill off contractors. Obviously we need the contractors. We are not going to start back as we were in 1990.</p>
          <p>But for new projects, clearly the costs will fall. I have absolutely no worry about that whatsoever. Contractors know that as well as I do. Their costs will fall, and they are going to pass that down the chain. Yves-Louis showed this in his presentation, in -- particularly in terms of exploration, where the contractors are really afraid that we will lower our exploration if they don't lower their costs. So they've lowered their costs in exploration, they'll be able to lower cost elsewhere because their cost base is basically the same.</p>
          <p>On acquisitions &#x2013; yes, we have said, and we continue to say, that in order to continue growth in the long term, a number of acquisitions would be necessary. That remains very much on the agenda, except that the market of course has changed very substantially, but we have already started a number of operations without waiting for the crisis to influence matters. In other words, lower prices or particularly share prices, of our prey because you have to take opportunities when they arise, obviously. But now that the oil price is falling and the effect of the financial crisis -- without being necessarily a shock, there may be some opportunities, although it would be wrong to jump on them very hastily.</p>
          <p>If you say the oil price is going to be $100 in six months' time, then things would be different but that's not going to be the case. So, I think we should make haste slowly, quite honestly. But if there is a good opportunity that comes by, then we should take it, and UTS is a case in point. And we wish to continue that operation, but there is no need for unseemly haste.</p>
          <p>Second question, Patrick, in 2009 a number of projects will be starting up, as you know, we shall be taking into account of the sale of a number of Sanofi shares in the calculation, I am going to give you in 2009 and cash breakeven. In others words the level of, the level at which we can pay the CapEx and pay the dividends is about $70 per barrel.</p>
          <p>Your third question concerned the tax rate. In Q4, it fell for two reasons. The first is that when the price of oil falls, the tax rate on Downstream falls, and that's quite logical, economically. Second point is that, in terms of relative weight, the results of the Upstream have fallen more than the overall results, and that has put more weight on the Downstream. The Downstream tax rate is lower, and therefore the tax rate has fallen by about 50% for the Group as a whole. For guidance in 2009, I think if we have a trend of about $40, it should be about the same. It was $55 in Q4, the price of a barrel of oil is about 40 now, so it should be slightly lower than 50.</p>
          <p>Next question please.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There was a question about acquisitions and there was talk about an alliance with Norsea and in Brazil, Petrobras needs a lot of CapEx. How you are going to manage these future alliances with the NOCs, and particularly in Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, is the answer. This is moving into an area that we can't be fully upfront about. Brazil clearly, and Petrobras is one of the targets that we believe we would have mutual interest in joining up with, but we are not the only ones. It's -- they have a gigantic program there. And not only Brazil, we'd have to look at, with our existing partners, how we can do more than what we have done with them so far, and that is true for the Middle East, that is true for Libya. We've said very clearly, when we signed the day before yesterday, the agreement on the renewal of our contracts in Libya and the change in the tax system. We said that we hoped that this would open the door to new opportunities in that area. So I think that is basically our policy, and to answer your previous question, why not think, too, that acquisitions would not only be Total acquisitions, but would perhaps be acquisitions in conjunction with other producers?  I think that would be a way of strengthening our partnerships, not only on existing projects, but for future projects.</p>
          <p>Did we make such detailed presentations that you've run out of questions?  No, there is a question over here.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Natixis Securities, I have two questions. There is more and more talk about Total being involved in the nuclear industry, and you said you were more interested Upstream, and now you are interested in operating nuclear power plants apparently, so has there been a change of thinking there? And how much are you willing to invest in that type of venture, are there short-term targets which you're thinking of?  And then the second issue is on oil -- you talked about an investment budget of $19 billion last year. You spent $18 billion in 2008 in CapEx. So, why was there that fall, and have some projects been postponed, and is there clearly already a fall in technical costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Answer -- on the nuclear industry, I'm not going to say the usual things about maintaining the effort, but what we've said about Upstream and Downstream and then nuclear has been misunderstood, because we talked about this in terms of Areva, and talking about the upstream and downstream in Areva, and I think we were not interested in increasing our stake in Areva. I don't know whether Areva is upstream or downstream in the nuclear industry, but as far as we are concerned, Areva is a supplier and we could become the customer of that supplier one day, but not a financial partner. It is not an industrial logic to have a stake in your supplier, and that of course can lead to conflicts of interest, which can be rather awkward. We've been through that before, when we were involved in Teknipel, and Teknipel and Areva are two different cases.</p>
          <p>Now, as far as our strategy is concerned, I think our strategy is now clear. It took some time to make it clear, but it's &#x2013; we are not as familiar with this business as with the oil business, we need to develop our know-how, and that's going to take a few years. And when we mean -- when we say know-how, we mean know-how to operate projects, not only to participate in projects, but we need to <mark type="audio gap" /> know-how, and we have decided therefore to tie up with GDF Suez and maybe with EDF on EPR No. 2 in France, but the aim of all this is to eventually decide whether we can develop a nuclear industry ourselves.</p>
          <p>Now whether we're talking about Upstream or Downstream, I think that's irrelevant, but what we want to do eventually is to have the capacity to operate a nuclear power plant. I don't see how we could be an intermediary, because if you are an intermediary, you have a supplier, and our aim is not to become a supplier of nuclear power plants. Otherwise, we'd simply purchase Areva and that's not the aim. What the aim of all this is, one day to be able to be involved in the operation of a nuclear power plant. And the aim is, with GDF Suez, to see whether we can be successful, in the United Arab Emirates, but this is a long-term project. There is very little investment in that today, hardly any, except in human capital. And we shall see, later on, if this becomes another business of Total, but we shall see.</p>
          <p>On your second question about CapEx -- yes, we had slightly lower CapEx in 2008 than forecast. This was -- was this due to cost cuts? No, that was your question, so the answer is no. But there have been some postponements and some delays in projects. You know what they are, Kashagan is a good example, but there are others. And I think it's &#x2013; there is not much of a difference after all, as Yves-Louis has however said, there is a fall in inflation, because the figures we showed you show that in -- cost inflation was about 18% between 2006 and 2007. 2008, it's now 2%, 2% is still up. But of course, it's a much lower rate of growth than it was previously, and I think we can say, and Michel would agree with me, that inflation next year will be close to zero, it might even be negative. So, we will have that impact on our costs in the future. Was there another question there?</p>
          <p>There is also a technical reason, which is that in our CapEx we have flows to PNEs and SMEs, and there was a technical issue which was the accelerated investment of our investment in Sincor, because we sold a part of our stake there to the Venezuelan government.</p>
          <p>I think we should continue the discussion on the first floor around cocktails, if Christophe would agree. And that brings the meeting at this stage to a close.</p>
