          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and, of course, welcome to everyone who is viewing our Fourth Quarter Analyst Conference online. I am joined this afternoon by Peter L&#xF6;scher, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Joe Kaeser, our Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>It's great to be back, again, in London, with many of our major investors and the key analysts. The Q4 fiscal '08 financial data can be retrieved from our website. I would like to remind you that today's presentation is also being webcasted, alongside with charts we will be presenting. And I would also like to refer to our Safe Harbor statement on page two.</p>
          <p>This morning, we announced our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal '08. During this afternoon's conference, Peter and Joe will give you some color on the Q4 result, on the outlook, and on the underlying assumptions. And after that, like always, we will have enough time for a Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to hand it over to Peter. Peter?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Michael. Welcome to everybody from my side, as well. As you know, 2008 was an exciting year of transition within Siemens. We have achieved significant progress on our strategic agenda. We delivered strong results for the full year. We are ahead of our schedule in our Company Transformation Program. We exceeded our growth targets two times global GDP, and we had an excellent cash conversion.</p>
          <p>Siemens today is a much stronger company. While we cannot ignore that the current economic turbulence will, obviously, also affect us, but as we look into 2009, we are well prepared for a tougher economic environment.</p>
          <p>If I can stress one thing today, we are prepared. As you remember well, we were one of the first companies highlighting a potential economic downturn. So we have prepared ourselves for a tougher economic environment, and this we also built into our plans and we took the corresponding actions.</p>
          <p>Joe, in a few minutes, will give you an overview about the financial highlights of the year. I'd just like to summarize, for a moment, our TAP program. We have significantly increased our execution focus of the company. We have increased the transparency. We focused on executing. We have, clearly, with the new organization in place, also driven performance. So, for 2008, we have focused on reducing our cost base, improving our cash conversion cycle, and this in 2009 will obviously be a key theme of our company &#x2013; cash is king.</p>
          <p>We recently achieved a critical milestone, also, in our negotiations on the compliance method with the authorities in Germany and the US, which has allowed us to book a provision of &#x20AC;1 billion in Q4.</p>
          <p>In addition to the SG&amp;A program, which Joe will highlight in a minute, we will have a major new strategic initiative. We will focus on cost of goods sold. We will focus on productivity, we will focus on &#x20AC;42 billion of supply chain. So I am delighted to announce Barbara Kux, as our new Board member responsible for this initiative, and as we go into 2009 we will highlight to you the initiatives, the milestones and the specific programs as we go forward.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet remains strong, our gearing is low and the cash conversion is solid. I will discuss capital allocation in more detail shortly. But I am pleased to announce that our dividend for 2008 will be &#x20AC;1.60 per share. We are realistic and remain cautious about where the economy is going in 2009. Clearly there are great challenges ahead. Our guidance for 2009 was built with this in mind and although achieving this target has become more challenging, our guidance remains unchanged.</p>
          <p>Turning to the financial highlights of the quarter. We had an order growth of 6%, revenue growth of nine, book-to-bill of 1.3. Order growth was mainly driven by Energy, which delivered a comparable 40% year-on-year increase; revenue growth was driven by strong performances in both the Energy and Industry sectors, which saw 19% and 8% year-on-year increases, respectively. We also saw high single-digit order growth in our shorter cycle businesses, namely Industry Automation, Drive Technologies and Building Technologies. Total sector profit was 1.485 billion, which includes the negative impact of 325 million transformation costs, costs that were necessary to ensure our long term profitable growth.</p>
          <p>Underpinning our operational performance was excellent earnings conversion in Industry Automation, Power Distribution and Diagnostics and we were able to achieve a stable underlying margin in Healthcare, within the target margin range, despite a difficult US environment.</p>
          <p>Income from continuing operation includes transformation costs of 1.539 billion, and the provision of one billion for the settlement being negotiated by the company with the authorities in Germany and the United States, which I mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>Let me give you a little more color on the top line performance. As I said before growth in orders and revenues were well above our 2x-GDP target. On this chart you can see the breakdown of orders and revenue performance by geography and across our sectors and divisions. As shown, some of our businesses faced particularly tough comparisons from the prior year quarter. For example, if you take China, a locomotive order of 334 million in Mobility in the prior year's period accounted for more than the entire order decrease in China and Mobility year-over-year. Renewable Energy's order growth slowed in Q4 as we expected; however, for the full year, order growth was more than 100%.</p>
          <p>As you will recall, in Q2, we guided you that the total sector profit for the full year 2008 would be at least matching the prior year's level. We successfully achieved this, if you include also the Mobility transformation cost of 151 and the Healthcare transformation cost of 174.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to the significant progress we made in 2008. As I said earlier, we are well ahead as we have planned the company transformation. We have the organization in place and the leadership team in place. Joe will give you briefly the update on our SG&amp;A program, which is also ahead of schedule. We also made significant initiatives around streamlining our non-core assets, again ahead of schedule, Joe will highlight the progress what we have made in other operations.</p>
          <p>We have formed the joint venture of Siemens Enterprise Communication and most recently also we sold our 50% equity stake in our Fujitsu-Siemens joint venture to our partner. We have as October 1 the new management incentive system in place, which allows us to clearly align our shareowners' or shareholders' interests with the company. We have built last year a world class compliance team and compliance initiatives, and we have made significant progress in our settlement discussions with the authorities.</p>
          <p>To supplement our leaner -- if we go now to the next chart please. Why do I fundamentally believe are we in a better position in comparison to our last downturn in 2001? Siemens today is structurally and fundamentally a very different company. The first one is our strength in emerging markets. In 2008, 31% of our businesses were in the emerging markets, which compares to 19% in our last downturn 2001. Again, the emerging markets will be a critical area where we will drive growth initiatives also in the upcoming more difficult global environment.</p>
          <p>On the right-hand side you can see the revenue growth in 2008, which we have achieved in Brazil, in Russia, in China, in India, in the so-called BRIC country. And as you can see here clearly, we have outpaced the market growth. And in this market we also anticipate that these markets again will continue to be significant growth drivers.</p>
          <p>We also will benefit from initiatives which governments are driving. I'm just returning from China and I'm very pleased to learn that also the stimulus program which China has put in place, the US$600 billion, is a great opportunity for us to drive incremental business because their focus will be how they continue to drive domestic demand and how do they accelerate their build-out of the local infrastructure investments.</p>
          <p>The second factor which fundamentally makes Siemens a stronger company compared to all the other downturns; on the left-hand side you can see how we have sharpened our portfolio focus. Today, 97% of our businesses are behind the megatrends, businesses focusing on Healthcare, on Energy and on Industry. The same was only 62% in 2001. We have today a far stronger portfolio, clearly focused on the global growth trends. And within this portfolio, we have two-thirds of our businesses in global number one or number two positions.</p>
          <p>The other aspects, which I have highlighted right from the start, which is a key priority of us going forward, is how do we drive profitable ongoing service businesses within all our businesses. We have double-digit growth there. And again, this will be a key growth initiative going forward, as well.</p>
          <p>The next factor, which is a significant one for us going into a more difficult global environment, is the strong order backlog. We have 85 &#x2013; on the right-hand side, you can see we have an order backlog of 85 billion; 40 billion of it will be for 2009. And we were able to build the order book, clearly, over the last number of years and quarters. So, again, this provides us with clearer visibility, going into a far more difficult economic environment.</p>
          <p>The next factor, which is one which differentiates Siemens from many other companies, is the comprehensive portfolio what we have around energy efficiency, being it on the left-hand side in the Generation side, Transmission &amp; Distribution or on the right-hand side how do we drive energy efficiency solutions, either in an integrated drive technology aspects in the Automation side or from a Building Technology standpoint or within Lighting.</p>
          <p>Again, we have a very broad-based portfolio, which fits perfectly well and will continue to drive underlying growth demand in all these markets.</p>
          <p>Let me give you one example in terms of the innovation advantage what we have in this position. This is one of our key technology, high voltage direct current transformers. This is a market which is as you can see in the right-hand side is growing very, very sharply &#x2015; today, &#x20AC;3.2 billion in total marketplace. We anticipate that this market continues to be growing. Again, HVDC provides significantly less distribution losses, in the order of 40% versus a normal technology; provides the customer with a key advantage and we are clear market leader with this very exciting technology for us, again, allowing to distribute and transmit energy over very long distances &#x2015; a perfect solution for markets like Russia, China, India and others.</p>
          <p>If we go to the next chart, please. As you can see here, we have build out our head count in low cost countries: in 2001 it was only 14% of our global head count base; today it is 25%. Again, we are increasing not just our physical presence from a distribution and marketing standpoint, but also our manufacturing footprint, allowing us to optimize our global cost structures from a global supply chain standpoint, as well as cost of goods sold. Again, we will continue to invest in emerging markets in this aspect.</p>
          <p>Local sourcing will be a critical, as I mentioned, initiative for 2009. Today we are sourcing roughly 20% of our global sourcing is coming out of low cost countries this will be an initiative which Barbara Kux will drive for us going forward into 2009. So we will update you with this initiative also within the next upcoming quarters.</p>
          <p>And with this, Joe I would like to hand over to you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Peter. Good afternoon and a very warm welcome also from my side. 2008 was certainly a year of transition for Siemens, a year where we believe many changes were made reality, and we believe that also ensures that this will make us a better company going forward. As we -- I think pretty much flat to the market, fiscal Q4 2008 has seen a very, very significant number of charges related to our transformation. And I think if I summarize the quarter, it's been quite a lively quarter in terms of what we wanted to achieve to clear the way forward into 2009.</p>
          <p>If we look at the full year, I would really like to walk you through all those charges and transformational items we have been booking, either in the first half of the fiscal year, which you see on the very left hand side, but particularly on fiscal Q4 2008. You may recall, we announced project-related charges adding up to 1.1 billion in the first half of the fiscal year for Fossil Power Generation, Mobility and the IT division, you see here that the majority of those charges also of course will impact the cash flow going forward to 2008, '09 and '10. So the cash outflow will be just about equally spread over 2008 all the way up to 2010.</p>
          <p>As far as Q4 is concerned, we've had transformation related charges, including Healthcare, where we had a strategic review going on and I will come to that later; Mobility with 151 million, as well as Osram with 129 million, whereas that was been offset by one-off gains from the disposal of assets, which was 130 million. Other operations were 133 million. So in total, transformational aspects as they relate to the divisions in the first five areas, had been 587 million in total; so that goes  from Mobility all the way up to Fossil and Areva, and the Fossil charge we have been taking amounts to 162.</p>
          <p>We've pretty much guided the 52 million, which we count as an equity loss from our transitional from the Nuclear portion. We also said time and again that the nuclear reactor in Finland may also pose risks going forward when our partner, Areva, came out and was, let's say, giving an update on how long it will last to build the reactor, we decided to put another 110 million on charges to our cost calculation going forward. With that we take a significantly more conservative stand as maybe others looking at the project.</p>
          <p>We will now turn to our SG&amp;A program. I will go into more detail just in a couple of minutes, but as you know, we've made, I think, decent progress in getting the vast majority of the SG&amp;A-related charges into fiscal 2004 (sic) [Q4]. Time and again, we've been discussing the matter, whether or not we were able from the accounting standpoint to put those charges in Q4, and I think it's fair to say that enough progress has been made in discussions and agreements with the Workers Council, that we were able to book 1.1 billion into Q4 2008. Those are charges, obviously, they are all cash based and you see the breakdown on how we expect the cash out to come in the next couple of years.</p>
          <p>So all in all, as Peter said, we recently reached most of our important milestones with regards to the provision regarding compliance. And while we do not speculate how long it take till we reach a final settlement with the government, which &#x2015; the governments actually &#x2015; which are involved here, we were able to book a one billion provision related to the ongoing settlement negotiation with the German and the US authorities.</p>
          <p>Also in Q4, we announced that Siemens would establish a foundation with an endowment of roughly 400 million. I think it was 390 to be accurate. That foundation supports Siemens efforts to improve education, and also assumes full responsibility for all donations, which are being made for charitable giving going forward. Those 390 million had become P&amp;L and cash effective in fiscal Q4, 2008.</p>
          <p>Another area that we made significant progress in the past 12-months has been our portfolio transformation. In Q3 we announced that we've reached a major milestone here, finding solutions with Enterprise as well as Siemens Home Communications Devices. The related chart is to those transactions, are about 2.1 billion for the businesses, which we realized all in fiscal 2008. So I think we've pretty much kept the market updated on the impact of Enterprise and SHC, going forward.</p>
          <p>Fiscal 2008, and especially fiscal Q4 2008, had been quite a busy effort to streamline our company's portfolio and focus the company and prepare it for a downturn. In our core areas, which are the sectors we've made reasonable progress on operation improvements, or sectors we believe comfortably exceeded their 2010 targets, and were all in all accretive.</p>
          <p>With Industry, we continued to see strong earnings conversion coming from the key value drivers, Industrial Automation as well as Drive Technologies, where we both had incremental margin in the sector well above 20% &#x2013; actually, they went up to 25%. And as I've said many times this year, you should like what you see and what you have seen in those two businesses in the last several quarters.</p>
          <p>Within Energy, the two T&amp;D divisions added over 20% incremental margin last year, as did Renewable Energy in Q4, although we have to admit that total sector margin was adversely affected by the Fossil project charges, which we reported in Q2, and also now in fiscal Q4. Despite a very soft US Healthcare market, their DRA was negative,, and also currency exchange matters had an adverse impact on our bottom line. We believe that we saw a very strong performance at Diagnostics, which resulted in 20% incremental underlying margin in Healthcare in fiscal 2008.</p>
          <p>First, let me now look into the key metrics we have been taking up for our 2010 program going forward. We pretty much talked about growth, we did achieve 2x GDP growth, actually &#x2013; for the full year we achieved 3x GDP. With regard to the capital structure, there are obviously two sides of the coin; first of all, if you look at the numbers, it shows that we are still way below our targeted 0.1 to 1x net debt over EBITDA. By the same token, though, we believe that in this current environment our balance sheet strength is a key differentiator. So we believe that financial headroom provides us with a comfortable safety net going forward. So, therefore, we are not particularly concerned about not achieving the 0.8 to 1.0 in 2008, and we will carefully watch the situation as we go forward in our financial leverage. We just believe that in this current time it's more important to maintained flexibility in a financial crisis, which we do not yet believe to be over, as far as depreciation and other impacts might arise.</p>
          <p>Last fiscal year, we bought back about four billion in shares, which reduced our share account by almost 53 million in shares, developing our capital structure ratio to 0.42. Looking at the ROCE, we are obliviously below our target range of 14 to 16%. The year-over-year decrease was due to lower income, which was adversely affected by product charges, transformational costs, as well as the settlement provision in connection with the negotiations with the government. If we look at the increase of capital employed, obviously, this predominately results from the fact that our major acquisitions now are part of the total capital employed.</p>
          <p>I think we are on record as taking a more cautious view on the economy and acting earlier than many others. Clearly, the economy has only become tougher. And over the course of this year, this is further impacted by the continued volatility of credit markets. We believe that the SG&amp;A program has become even more crucial, and as a fresh view from the potential of the supply chain is another step to support our 2009 and 2010 earnings targets going forward.</p>
          <p>We acted clearly, thoroughly and decisively, and the actions taken are a good example of the self-help potential this company has. And we do share our sense of urgency here, and Peter and I are aggressively driving the SG&amp;A agenda.</p>
          <p>This slide will probably look pretty familiar to you; we've had it several quarters now. And if you look a little more closely, while we maintain our 1.2 billion absolute savings goal going forward, we took a slightly more conservative view on what the GDP will look like in 2009 and 2010. So, if we only take a 2% GDP growth for 2009 and 2010, and maintain our goal to increase the revenues by 2x GDP, the 1.2 billion savings in SG&amp;A will actually result in a significant reduction of the cost in percent of revenues, and the SG&amp;A percentage will go down from 16.7 to 13.4%, which accounts for 330 base (sic) [basis] points improvement on the bottom line.</p>
          <p>Finally, you can expect us to continue driving the execution of our SG&amp;A program in 2009, especially considering the weaker prospects in the sales area. We'll see some of the initial benefits of the personnel cost savings already in 2009. However, the majority of the SG&amp;A savings, as far as they relate to head count related savings, will be pretty much back loaded, which means that the majority will be realized in fiscal 2010.</p>
          <p>Let me now maybe give you one example as a deep dive and look into the IT area. Here we will be able to achieve about 300 million of IT-related savings already in fiscal 2009. For example, by consolidating our global IT infrastructure within the 20 clusters all across the global regions of Siemens. The effect will be fully realized in 2009, and will help us driving down SG&amp;A costs further in the current fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Let's now move into the so-called Other Operations. I think this is an excellent example where we delivered what we promised. What we actually did was that Other Operations &#x2013; which consist of about 187 different operations, small and mid-sized business entities, mostly outside of Germany under the leadership of the regions &#x2013; accounted for 2.3 billion in revenues and a pretty much loss-making enterprise also in 2007?</p>
          <p>We said last year that we would fully exit those businesses, either by taking them into the sectors if they were strategically suitable, or if not relevant, sell them, joint-venture them, or shut them down. Here we have made significant progress. We've resolved about 90% of the activities today, which count for about 70% of the revenues. While we are ahead of schedule in cleaning up our Other Operations, we certainly will make good on completing that operation during fiscal 2009 going forward.</p>
          <p>Now, I would come to our free cash flow development, and especially what its drivers will look like. Peter mentioned that cash is king, and we believe that the king has never been more important than today. Let me give you maybe some color on what drives free cash flow, which we believe was a remarkable 2.7 billion in fiscal Q4 2008.</p>
          <p>Rigorous focus on asset management is a clear imperative, contributing to a strong liquidity position as we enter potentially uncharted territory in 2009. We saw a significant improvement in managing our net working capital turns, which have consistently improved over the last two years from a 7.2, 7.4, all the way up to 8.6. If we only consider an average net working capital for the company in the neighborhood of about &#x20AC;9 billion, so we actually reduced our capital employed there of 1.5 billion by increasing the factors to 8.6.</p>
          <p>In fiscal 2008, our CapEx ratio marginally exceeded our target range of 95 to 115% of depreciation, solely due to the fact that we pulled in some CapEx investment on a very attractive order growth in Energy. We do believe that going forward, we will maintain the target margin of 95 to 115% of depreciation. For 2009, we actually have frozen about 50% of the CapEx budget investment of the divisions and the sectors. You can be rest assured that we keep a very tight lid on CapEx spending in the company for the businesses going forward.</p>
          <p>If you look at the cash conversions, we delivered an excellent performance in all three sectors. Of course, that cash conversion rate has been pretty favorably impacted by the charges and transformational costs which we have booked in fiscal Q4, which not yet materialized into cash. And in the same token though, this is the reason why we will stand very firm on securing the liquidity and secure the company's freedom to act in this business environment, as far as our financial position is concerned.</p>
          <p>Our cash position of nearly seven billion, with another &#x20AC;6.1 billion of undrawn credit facilities, will provide us with a very strong liquidity position today, and we do not intend to weaken it going forward. The key takeaway is that we have about &#x20AC;13 billion of available net liquidity, which gives us plenty of headroom to repay our short-term debt, which is about 1.8 billion, as well as to grow the business forward.</p>
          <p>Despite the financial crisis &#x2013; and this is actually a very good indicator of our conservative financial policy &#x2013; we managed to significantly reduce the amount of commercial paper outstanding to just about 200 million in fiscal 2008, 200 million fiscal 2008 from 4.3 billion in the prior year. This summer as you might recall, we also very successfully issued a &#x20AC;5.8 billion long-term debt at extremely attractive terms, and looking at those terms in the market today, that's certainly something that you will understand why this was so important to shift from short-term to long-term debt and secure liquidity going forward.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to development of the gearing and our long-term bond and loan maturity profile. The message here, I think, is very simple: we have a low gearing, even in difficult times, at around 33%, and have always been committed to a effective financial policy. Our strong balance sheet, full transparency in financial matters, and high investment grade rating of AA- or A-1, is clearly a big plus in what we believe are turbulent times also continuing in 2009 and probably also into 2010. And I know a number of you have joked with me about the fact that equity guys become now debt people, also looking into analyst topics like maturities of bonds and things like that. So I hope this one here gives you all what equity and debt guys need at the same time.</p>
          <p>The next chart doesn't need, I think, very much comment from my side. I just to want to reiterate: we do allocate and we do prioritize our resources based on incremental capital efficiency versus incremental risk, that's been the case in 2008, and will continue to be in 2009, with even more strict focus on how much capital we spend for what business.</p>
          <p>Finally, let's turn to a subject I know you focus on very intensively, and that's what the shareholder payout is from the company's operations in 2008. I think you agree with me that 2008 has been quite a remarkable year for Siemens and its owners, and among the many firsts we have achieved in 2008 was to initiate the first major share buyback program. To date, we have executed about four billion of the targeted 10 billion share buyback. We review the buyback on a quarterly base, and then we decide on what we think the right course of action will be every quarter. We did not consider a buyback program in fiscal Q4 because we believe that it's important to get an overview on what financial crisis will develop us into. So, as I said, every quarter we will look at the conditions and make a decision on what we do quarter-by-quarter.</p>
          <p>As Peter as already mentioned, we announced a total dividend for 2008 of a &#x20AC;1.60 per share, for a total payout to shareholders of about 1.4 billion. So, if we add the four billion from the buyback program, that give a total shareholder related payout of 5.4 billion for 2008.</p>
          <p>And with that, ladies and gentlemen, I will hand it back to Peter for the outlook.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Joe. Let me briefly summarize where we are today, and what we see ahead. 2008 was a pivotal year for Siemens, with a new organization and new leadership, and there is a renewed energy and competitive spirit. Ambitious targets are set out and very specific timelines for delivering on those targets.</p>
          <p>As you can see on this chart, as you know, we are cautious on the macro environment pretty early on, and we incorporate it into our planning. But as you can see on this chart, no one could have predicted the global credit crunch and its impact on the world economy. And as you can see from a few of the economic indicators we all look at, the global picture has sharply deteriorated in the past few months, and actually weeks.</p>
          <p>To reiterate what we said back in July, we believe that 2009 will clearly be much more challenging than 2008. And while we are prepared to deal with what lies ahead, we are also not immune from its effects, and our targets have become, obviously, more ambitious.</p>
          <p>We continue to expect to grow our top line at twice the rate of global GDP. Our target for Total Sector profit is unchanged, at eight to 8.5 billion. Growth in income from continuing operations is expected to exceed growth in Total Sectors profit. And obviously, given the dynamics of the current economic environment, we will frequently assess our guidance. Finally, it's also worth remembering that every crisis creates opportunities, and we'll be watching this closely in the coming year. Looking ahead, there is still a great deal of work to do, and we will continue to improve Siemens at the world-class level.</p>
          <p>In uncertain times like these, we understand that there is nothing more important to our investors than greater transparency. Joe and I are committed to continuing to provide you with frequent updates on our performance, including visibility into our sales pipeline, insight into the feedback we receive from our customers, and progress on our efforts to evolve the culture at Siemens. We have the right team, the right strategy and the right portfolio. Supported by the strength of our balance sheet we will focus in 2009 only on one thing &#x2013; on execution, delivering our results for 2009.</p>
          <p>With that we will be happy to take your questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then I would start with Andreas on the left side. The gentlemen here, Andreas , could you raise your hand please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Three questions please. The first one on your guidance, you said excludes restructuring. In the past it excluded major restructuring or transformational restructuring. Can you just explain the difference between before and now, or maybe it's just the word you've chose that's different. Second, on SIS, historically it blew up in downturns. How does it look like now in terms of what contracts are in there, how sensitive is it to a downturn? And the last question on Osram, maybe you could give us a bit of more information exactly what went wrong? How that did develop over the quarter? When were you made aware of it, maybe also as an example, in terms of how the information travels within the company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Maybe I get started with the guidance. I think we want to make it very clear, transformation is over, so there are no excuses any more for transformational items at all. If there is demand-driven restructuring coming from potentially weaker customer orders, which we cannot exclude at this time, but also do not want to speculate about whether or not that there is an restructuring that needs to be considered. We're not suggesting that this is a caveat to the guidance, we stick to the guidance; it's between eight and 8.5, and we look at the economic development every quarter.</p>
          <p>On SIS, I think the division's got parts of businesses. What used to be the outsourcing business now is considered to be very stable. We have recurring revenues and the first pass cash intensive part is over, so we have continuous revenue stream back, so that one is very sticky and that is obviously not related to any economic downturn. The second item is the, if you want, the ongoing service business for new installations. That certainly follows economic cycles, as other topics also do, like communications equipment and such. So the majority, we believe, is stable because of the recurring revenues out of the outsourcing matters; some also of course here in the UK, but there might be some, let's say, new installation driven challenges in the IT sector overall.</p>
          <p>On Osram, I think since summer this year we've been guiding the markets that we watch very carefully on how close our businesses are between, or actually on the interface between Consumer and Industry. And we always said that Osram will be the first one because that's the closest to consumer behavior. We've seen significant weakness coming from the United States, and that now has materialized into weak demand and weak top-line from US-related sales of Osram. So the abrupt drop in demand, especially in the US, has caused a significant reduction of capacity utilization in the factories, and that alone counts for a mid double-digit million number where inventories were going out the door, still, and the factories had little leverage on utilization. So that's in essence what the reason has been.</p>
          <p>So going forward, we might see some ease again of the margin. However, the demand driven challenges in Osram remain in place, reason being that Osram business is very much focused on the US through the SYLVANIA acquisition a few years ago. European demand has been holding up in Q4; remains to be seen on how that demand develops over time. So that's why the division aggressively, rigorously continues to expand its presence in Asia, where demand is still strong, especially is strong in the LED area of the company. Going forward we believe that Osram is an important asset to the company, because they are innovation leader, especially on opto semiconductors, as well as in energy efficient lamps. So that's much I think what I would have to say on Osram.</p>
          <p>So when did we know about weaknesses? As we said, since we continued to guide the market that Osram might be in the forefront of consumer related demand weakness, it doesn't come as a surprise that demand has been weakening. Always the first quarter, when the factory utilization goes down, you'll see a significant impact. We do not expect that to come again in the current fiscal quarter, yet. I have to caution you, Osram is in the forefront of consumer demand, so we very closely watch what's going on in the US and also in Europe, as far as consumer demand is concerned.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That doesn't matter. Look, eight to 8.5 is the guidance, and we stick to the guidance. It has become more challenging, and I think many of you remember when we were, let's say, encouraged to revisit that guidance, because it was considered to be extremely conservative. I think we all share the view now that it's not extremely conservative. It has become more ambitious, and we stick to the guidance. If there are demand-driven restructuring charges, then we will look at it, but that does not automatically reduce the guidance, per se. I think that's very important. We do not want to speculate of any restructuring charges, which as I've said, we are looking at it every quarter, but there is no excuse for any structural charges anymore, going forward.  Transformation is over. Peter said that loud and clear. We have booked more than billion on transformational items in Q4, and now it's time to execute.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just maybe a question on Healthcare. Clearly you have now gone through the first year of restructuring. Can you talk about what you are seeing in in-vitro now that you've taken these charges? Are we going to see that margin bounce back? Currency has obviously hurt you in Diagnostic Imaging; is that going to be an offset this year? And then in terms, obviously you showed the slide about emerging markets, do you fear that potentially these could prove to be a lot more volatile than what we've seen in the past, and that actually an increase in emerging market exposure could actually increase the risk in the business, especially let's say in the large project area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>James, I would like to start off with the emerging markets. Obviously I have made this my personal focus so I just came back: the last three weeks, I have spent twice &#x2013; I was twice in Russia, I was twice in China, I was in the Middle East. So my latest count on this is that in China we probably have to expect the growth rate between seven to 9% going forward. This year, we were still probably at the edge of double digits. As I said, the infrastructure investment program in China will create new opportunities for us. Russia is probably currently around five, potentially coming down depending on the oil price. Demand in Middle East is still very, very strong for our products. So overall, I would say that definitely this will be a key growth opportunity for us. The whole agenda of mobility, of energy efficiency of transmission of high speed trains. So we have numerous projects in these areas which we will focus on going forward.</p>
          <p>And the first one, Healthcare, we are ahead of our integration targets what we have set. The business is going strong. Obviously, the overall healthcare market per se, is still a very difficult one. In the United States, I would say the situation has not changed. We still anticipate probably a down market this year. I personally believe it will not change significantly going into 2009, although we don't know yet how the new Administration will potentially refocus the healthcare system per se. So, my take is, we count on a still difficult environment going into 2009 for Healthcare overall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I add something to the strategic reorientation and the charges we have taken in that respect. There were two items which were affected. One was the &#x2013; and that was in the Workflow &amp; Solutions area &#x2013; was the particle therapy project; we have acquired four projects on particle therapy, and the company decided not to continue above and beyond those four projects. So that actually is a charge we have taken of about, in the neighborhood of some 80 million, 81 million. And the other one was in the Image &amp; Knowledge Management, where we did mostly a software write-down of our single platform, and that accounts for about 90 million. So that's basically what this strategic reorientation is all about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the dollar impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A strong dollar in general is good for Siemens, still good for Siemens. While we are moving towards a natural hedge position, a strong dollar in general is still good. By the same token, I think I need to caution regarding a short-term impact. We basically hedge about 75 to 100% of our net currency position, so we are pretty much hedged through the year on big projects, as well as on items like what used to be A&amp;D and Healthcare, but if the dollar remains in a ballpark of 1.25 to 1.30 going forward, that would certainly ease the lines in terms of transactional impact in the mid-term.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Sorry &#x2013; thank you very much. Three questions please. Firstly, could you comment, Peter, since maybe September has there been a major change in the buying pattern of utilities? Have you seen more delaying tactics maybe on their part? And could you maybe comment on the pricing trends? Presumably, the price of power plants, etcetera are coming down. Is that driving any delaying behavior that is more intense now than perhaps it was a month or so ago?</p>
          <p>The second question, could you comment how you're using your SFS division? Are you using that aggressively to maybe assist demand with some financial help, or otherwise could you just comment what your strategy is on that, please. And thirdly, if you could give any regional color on the automation market, the Drives &amp; Automation, and how resilient do you think that business can be in a downturn? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, as I start off with the utilities. Overall, we don't see it yet. I would anticipate it because I think the utilities will also go through their CapEx programs and they will have a fresh look about their priorities. Feedback what we get is, yet we don't see it. I would anticipate that there will be certain reprioritization as we go forward. Pricing, the  supply chain initiative is crucially important for us. If you consider that we have 42 billion in the supply chain as Siemens, we have to exert the same pressure on our supplier base when we have to anticipate that the pricing environment as we go forward will get tougher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the SFS division, we certainly, we look whether we can leverage our position of financial strength and good balance sheet with the opportunities which are provided in the Industrial field. But we are not going to take more risk just by the fact that we've got money. So we are very, very risk averse in terms of financing, and I think we are well-advised to continue to do so. By the same taken of course, if it provides a competitive advantage that we can provide support based on risk management, we will consider such a scenario, but only if the Industrial benefit, together with the financial benefit, make a meaningful and economically feasible transaction. We are not back to the old vendor financing in Telecom; you can be rest assured.</p>
          <p>On the regional color of Energy and Automation, means Drive Technology and Industrial Automation, then those two divisions, what used to be A&amp;D back in 2006, 2007 some of you might remember that there was always a, let's say, a question about earnings and gross conversion. Why is it that incremental volume does not translate into incremental profit? The reason at that time was that what used to be A&amp;D was significantly building up its sales and distribution within Asia, especially in China all the way from the east to the west. Today we believe we have the most efficient Industrial distribution network and dealer network in Drive Technologies and Industrial Automation in Asia, and that will help us grow faster and take market share from competition, also in a challenging environment.</p>
          <p>As far as the industries are concerned, we do see weaknesses in the discretes area. We still see product industries, some product industries holding up in terms of demand. So Asia is important; Europe and also Eastern Europe there are question marks going forward, but as we said, there's always an opportunity winning market shares and not only at the account of price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then I would say James and then after that, Scott and then Peter. James, could you raise your hand, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's James Moore Redburn Partners. Two questions, if I could. One, on the order backlog, you cited your 85 billion backlog as an example of protection to the top line. Could you qualify that and give us a feel for what percentage of that backlog has had any kind of down payments or deposits made? And also, whether you've had an increase in cancellations in your backlog, whether that ratio has changed?</p>
          <p>Secondly, a question about price and raw material cost inflation and wage inflation. Of the 9% organic sales growth, what is the price picture at the moment? And going forward, we have seen IG Metall increase the wage cost. We know from the past raw material costs are increasing for now, but may fall. As we go into this next fiscal year, is there a mismatch between cost inflation and price that will have a margin impact, or are the two going to move sequentially?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me maybe take the commodity pricing and the IG Metall together, because they are all sourcing cost, right. So, I think one of the key questions the last couple of quarters have been, are commodity prices coming down, while demand comes down? There was some question mark about this, whether we enter straight into stagflation, or whether, let's say, we see some ease in the commodity prices. We've seen that, so that's a positive, and that certainly will help us also in some divisions which are dealing with metal, steel and related aspects. Are we going to see that immediately? Not really, because we have also been hedging those commodities, where we could hedge them, to match our order intake calculation. So that goes along consistently over time.</p>
          <p>For what we have seen with the negotiations on IG Metall, those four points, I think we've covered 1% and our onetime payment that is in the range we've been calculating, when we submitted the guidance of eight to 8.5, so that does not cause any, let's say, reconsideration in that aspect.</p>
          <p>Increasing cancellations, no I haven't seen it, haven't seen it yet. And obviously, as you can imagine, we very cautiously watch that scenario, especially in the field of Energy, where, let's say, retail driven financing plays a role. We're pretty confident about public orders from governments and government related customers. However, there might also be private and consumer financed projects which obviously we need to see how that develops.</p>
          <p>On the order backlog, there was 85 billion; about 40 billion of that relate to the revenue of 2009. While, for example, divisions like Mobility or Fossil have a very, very large extent where they recover part of backlog, there are other divisions like, for example, Building Technologies or Osram, which got nil, more or less, maybe a month or two, and everyone else is in between. So more than 40 billion are covered, and for the others I would expect to have a 20 to 25% coverage where we have very clear visibility. So Q1, we've got good visibility on all aspects and that's why we feel reasonably comfortable going forward in ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>To ask it another way, could you give us a feel for what percentage of your order backlog, or your orders, is underpinned by public safe money that doesn't have financing risk, and what percentage are organizations that could potentially struggle to find the cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The vast majority is what we believe safe, which is public or semi-public institutions, and as I said, there are a few projects which in part use retail finance &#x2013; think about renewables, for example, there are very few there. So as we said, we watch the situation closely, but at this point in time there is no reason to be concerned about major cancellations. But then again, we watch it every month.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. Scott Babka with Morgan Stanley. Two questions please. First, in terms of looking at the working capital. Joe, can you talk a bit about how much of that has been benefiting from customer advances, and what your expectation would be going forward for that, in terms of working capital? And also today, Peter, you mentioned that order flow through October was strong, and I was wondering if you could elaborate a bit in terms of where you are seeing strength, where things may be softening, to date, and what your outlook would be in general for Fossil renewable, in terms of ramping up capacity as indicated at the Investor Day for that division? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me start with the working capital and the working capital financings by customer orders. We do have a significant number of advance payments, or financing of working capital, which eventually materializes in billings in excess. And the impact going forward, there has certainly been a way that if and when, let's say the climate changed, just hypothetically, we probably would expect to be about three to five billion short of advance payments. By the same token, though, what we always have seen in areas of potential downturns that the working capital requirement significantly decreases following a three- to six-month period, and that's obviously normal because inventories as well as accounts receivables are set to go down accordingly. So I would not be, let's say, overly concerned about the dry up in the cash flow from advance payments. You probably have heard and if not then I do want to make that very clear now, that we keep a very tight grip on liquidity, and also make sure that at any given point in time we maintain our financial flexibility.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First on the second question from Scott, I said that overall October was, in light of the current circumstances, a pretty good month. Going forward, I think Energy is going strong. We have to watch very carefully how the finance situation evolves in the United States in the hospital environment, but this is nothing new. This is just a little further elaboration of my earlier comment that the tough environment in the US continues. Joe was referring to retail-driven financing. So we have to see how Alternative Energies, Wind, is going to be going forward. I think we have a great and strong order backlog. So overall, October was a pretty good month in light of the current environment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow-up, do you still &#x2013; the intention of ramping up capacity in Fossil and Wind, is that still in place, or is there a moderation of that today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No what Joe and myself have done is that we have basically only released 50% of our CapEx to the operating units. So Joe and myself are personally managing the rest of the 50%. So we absolutely make sure that we watch extremely tightly and manage very, very tightly also our CapEx program, as we move forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. It's Peter Reilly from Deutsche Bank. Three questions, please. Can you explain what happened with the Fossil Power margin in the fourth quarter? Even if you back out the Finnish charges, it was a very weak quarter after quite a strong third quarter. Is that just normal lumpiness, or are there some messages there for next year?</p>
          <p>Secondly, coming back to Diagnostics, the growth rate is still very low. Is that the weak macro environment or are you still busy with the product rationalization integration phase, and how does the growth look for next year? And then lastly, I know it's very early days, but the procurement savings, is it potentially the same order of magnitude as the SG&amp;A?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Peter. Let me start with the last first. I think we should just wait till Barbara is on the ground and running, and as soon as she builds her plan we will share this with you, or probably we will do this after the second quarter. On the Diagnostics side, I think this is now the overall &#x2013; I think the product rationalization is &#x2013; we are pretty much at the end. This is now the overall current environment in terms of market.</p>
          <p>Fossil, the situation in Fossil, has to do a little bit with the shift of the relatively high service business what we have there. If you also consider that the order book currently at the end of last year was 6.3 billion. Out of 6.3, 2.5 of it was still the critical projects, with the lower margins. So as this moves through, I think this has also an impact. The good news is that I have shared with you that our overall target is to have a third in turnkey, a third in products, a third in service. The order book of 2008 is already representing our target what we have set for 2010, so we were able to shift, actually balance pretty fast in the right direction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>To follow-up on that, was there &#x2013; did you find anything else in the fourth quarter in turnkey contracts that was not material enough to be disclosed, but hurt the margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not really we were working through and digesting those zero-margin businesses which we had put reserves onto on the fiscal Q2, and that was particularly the case now in Q4. Usually, the fiscal Q4, actually it's got a pretty good service content; for some reason that service now shifts to fiscal Q1 2009. So if the underlying Fossil margin in Q1 2009 would not be double-digit again I would be concerned, but for the time being I would not read anything into the fiscal Q4 underlying margin in the Fossil.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. This is Colin Gibson from HSBC, just one question, but it's a slightly extended one. Just trying to understand the guidance. Total profit sectors this year was &#x20AC;6.5 billion, income from continuing operations was &#x20AC;1.9 billion, so there were costs between those two levels of &#x20AC;4.6 billion. For next year, you're saying total profit for the sectors 8.0 to 8.5, well if we take the midpoint of 8.25; and you're saying that growth in income from continuing operations will exceed growth in Total Sector profit. Now that, to me, means there is still plenty of scope within that guidance for below-the-line costs to be significantly higher than they were this year. I'm trying to understand whether you're deliberately allowing for that in your guidance, or whether that's not really what you mean. Specifically, if income from continuing operations grew 27%, i.e., the same as the midpoint of the total profit from sectors range, income from continuing operations would be 2.41, and that would be 5.8 billion of costs between the TPS and ICO line. And I don't suppose that's what you mean, but could you be specific?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think you're right. There is no hidden agenda here. The focus is on eight to 8.5 for the Total Sectors, which we consider to be operational business. Through the clean-up of Other Operations and related areas in that in between we just wanted to reassure the markets that we will have a significant improvement in the profit after tax from continued operations. So just don't be shy to be a little more optimistic than your 2.7 billion that you have been calculating. But the point really is &#x2013; and that's why we set the guidance as we set it &#x2013; sectors is important because they drive our focus; this is what this company ought to be all about at some point. We are including the cross sectoral divisions. And everything else needs, let's say, to be rationalized. So we are very confident about a significant increase in the income from continued operations way above the sector increase. So don't be shy to, let's say, be reasonably aggressive here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's fair to say that you expect materially less than &#x20AC;4.6 billion of costs between the two lines.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Thank you so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably as ambitious as the eight to 8.5.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We'd then have Jochen, after that Simon and then Nicholas in the back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Three questions. First, coming back on Osram, I heard what you said and I understood it, but I just wonder, what's different this cycle than all the cycles before? We've seen figures for orders now, but I should think for 10, 15 or 20 years, I think, they've never had such a bad quarter or bad year, with margin deteriorated so much. I understand what capacity utilization means, but five years ago it was pretty much the same thing. So what's different is this cycle?</p>
          <p>The second question, back in September, in Munich, Joe, you said that depending on how the economy goes, the SG&amp;A problem might not be sufficient to reach the targets, and that if the economy worsened further, maybe there would be something more focused on additional restructuring charges bringing down, especially, cost of goods sold. Is there any plan for that on the agenda?</p>
          <p>And lastly on the pension, the underfunding there, the 2.5 billion, I mean, in the current quarter, since you have a 30% exposure to equities, that gap would probably widen further. At what point would you be required to put funding into the pension fund, and how and when would that hit the P&amp;L? And if, so if there was a hit of whatever you would need to contribute that, would that be included in the guidance or would that be outside of the Total Sectors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Let's maybe start with the SG&amp;A program and its impact on meeting the guidance, or what else would be required. When many of us met end of September in Munich, where we, I think pretty much went through the items which we saw coming quantitatively, sometimes even qualitatively, let us remember, the software related guidance on Mobility, maybe also that consumer business might be hit, like Osram. We also talked about what does this company do, in times of matters get worse than we had originally expected, because I think it's fair to say, one needs a plan B. If people don't like to play us, we'd like them to play.</p>
          <p>So, therefore, and that was already a, should I say that a very, maybe a little far-fetched guidance that we may also want to take a second step in looking at productivity, such as cost of goods sold; we still make about 70% of the total cost in Siemens, and here we go.</p>
          <p>Peter announced a new addition to the management team, taking care of major elements of the supply chain. We've got between 40 and 42 billion of purchase volume, depending on what we include. There is &#x2013; just there is no confusion, 2008 the purchasing volume was 40 billion. Purchasing volume 40 billion, which relates directly to the P&amp;L, like material, direct material, indirect material and the like, those two billion difference between the 42 you've seen in the press release, and the 40 you may or may not see in P&amp;L is just the CapEx buying. So, that's the difference, the CapEx buying obviously does not straight go into the P&amp;L so that's why you may see two different numbers going forward.</p>
          <p>So 40 billion is the consumables; it goes straight to the P&amp;L, and the two billion, which add to the 42 which we've see in the press release, is CapEx buying, and that obviously goes through depreciation, so that makes that point clear.</p>
          <p>And we just thought while some others still are struggling with the fact what program they should put in place to secure gearings, because of the second step, and that's supply chain optimization in the procurement area of Siemens. So that's &#x2013; at that time what I meant that we may see some more coming to get more comfort in what we want to achieve going forward for 2009, and of course also for the targets 2010. 8.5 billion for 2009 is one thing, but the goal remained is always also to reach the goals for 2010. So that's why, mostly, I believe it was extremely valuable to get into that second phase of productivity.</p>
          <p>Then the pension matters, 2.5 billion, it's basically back to the levels what we have seen in 2006. And I feel 2006 was a similar underfunding. I believe we've got significant margin between where we are at today and where we would need to consider putting something into the funding, so I would not be worried too much at this point in time. You never know how the markets develop. While, at this point in time I do not see any material impact from potential fundings.</p>
          <p>Would that be included or not in the eight to 8.5? It depends, obviously. It would be pure speculation. So let's focus operationally on the eight to 8.5, and if matters went further south on bonds or equity, we certainly would let you know. But as I said, we believe there is sufficient margin in between.</p>
          <p>What would happen in Osram? Look, sometimes you see marginal developments which purely and merely result from weaker demand. Sometimes you see weaker demand coupled with structural changes in the way that business will go. On the Osram, what we see is we go from general lighting to energy saving lamps. We go from general lighting, light bulbs, to up to semiconductors. So above and beyond a pure demand driven weakness, we also see some areas which we need to consider in the way the business is structured.</p>
          <p>So as I said, it was not a great quarter. We were actually disappointed with the way the impact has shown in the P&amp;L. By the same token, the divisional management has a clear goal on focusing on Asia and also build out our leading position in optos and semiconductors. The weak point was, we are heavily involved in the US and also in Automotive going forward, because this is not the spot where we have our big growth at this point in time.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next was Simon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I had three questions. I understand the initiatives that you are taking in terms of efficiency and incrementally moving that through the whole organization, but I think you said in terms of demand and how you would be looking at programs in considering restructuring, yet you still imply that you are going to wait to see what happens in this environment. Wouldn't it be right now that you should be actually cutting, making action to reduce production volumes in some areas of your business already?</p>
          <p>Second question is in terms of SFS, you have said how you are managing that business. But I think the debt there is now up to about 9.3. I just wondered if there was a limit that you were thinking of for that, as to how far you would be prepared to expand that business?</p>
          <p>And the third question, in terms of Automation and Drives, you've talked in the past about the margin decline you'd seen in previous cycles of 400 basis points, and now you were hoping more for two. I noted you didn't reiterate that. Would that suggest now that you think the environment might be more difficult? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thanks Simon . Let's maybe start with A&amp;D. If we, let's say, do not reiterate something which we still believe, that doesn't necessarily mean that we abandoned it. So unless further notice, this is still the case; this is still our conviction that we'll have all the potential to see a softer landing on what used to be A&amp;D.</p>
          <p>What has changed between the 400 peak-to-trough to what we believe can be achieved now with the 200, give or take a few points? Well, first of all, what used to be A&amp;D is much, much more international and not just Germany, Austria and Switzerland focused. As I mentioned earlier, we do believe, and we are very convinced, that we've got the most efficient distribution network, Industrial distribution network in China and surrounding areas. That will certainly help. Secondly, we significantly have reduced the value at depth, so made variable cost out of fixed cost. Thirdly, we are currently working with a significant amount of contract workers in our factories, which are still full, till under the eyeballs, working on the, I would say, comfortable backlog; for this period of time, it is very comfortable. Fourth &#x2013; and that obviously can be changed quickly in terms of contract working.</p>
          <p>Fourth, and that is important, yet may or may or not change, it just depends on Drive Technologies. We have a significant portion, I would say between about 15 to maximum 20% of the spectrum is related to Renewable Energy, namely Wind. Now that one obviously, if and when the financing prevails, that has a very huge demand. We do not see demand oriented weakness in any Renewables, we just see some potential impact from the financing crisis, which we don't see it, but it would be, I think, prudent to think that it could happen. Other that one the energy cycle is completely different from the industry cycle in discrete and process industries, so that actually gives a more moderate picture on what could fall down the cliff. So was that complicated enough?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in other words, Driver Technologies ] now has got a more challenged cycle for the fact that we do heavily support Renewable Energies through the Flender acquisition and the likes. Vis-&#xE0;-vis, there is cap, we significantly improved and increased the quality of our assets on SFS from 9.3 to 11 in change, and that's just about the cap. I would not feel comfortable in seeing SFS go above 12 billion on assets. There are enough liquid assets there in order to optimize the portfolio if need be, but I think a two point change billion asset increase in terms of SFS is just about enough, okay. So that much to ease your minds on financial exposure.</p>
          <p>Now on the topic of demand driven, or potential demand driven weakness and restructuring and things like that. I think there are two aspects we need to differentiate. First, the question what Andreas  has been asking in the beginning, would any sort of restructuring be demand- or transformation- or whatever-driven be excluded from the guidance? The answer is no, it is not. And if there was significant matters to be considered which we couldn't think of any at this time, we would obviously change the guidance. No excuses with anything else because transformation is always very important. That does not mean that we do not act based on demand change. So I think you need to differentiate between what's included in the guidance and what's not, versus that this company is acting based on demand changes going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Can I just follow up? My concern is not where the charges appear and what they're related to, it's just that if demand falls, and it takes more than two months to take the capacity out, some of your businesses seem to be quite short lead time, and you seem to be taking a more of a wait-and-see view on it, whereas wouldn't it be better now to be in consultation and preemptive, so that you can actually get the cost out when the top line goes down, rather than discussing it when the top line goes down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. A considerable amount of the charges we have taken in Osram out of the 129 have actually been for restructuring. So it's not that the company waits and sits here and hopes that if best matters go up again, we do act based on demand. The question is how long do we expect this demand to be weak? Is it going to be something which we are in for the long term, that would actually call for structural changes such as fewer production sites and things alike? Or would we be able to, let's say, to bridge that by working shorter hours, or release some sort of manpower capacity, and that's what must be considered every day, even in factories which are still fully loaded.</p>
          <p>So the fact that we increased our contract workers all the way up to a remarkable percentage, we already take care of having enough flexibility to make sure that short-term actions are possible in case demand weakens. So, I think we just should not, let's say, talk about something which is not there yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, way in the back, please. Can you pass the mic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions, if I may, the first on China, the second on utilities spending. Mark asked a very good question on the utility spending at the beginning of this. Can you give us a feel for what lead indication you may be able to give us for utility CapEx spending? Because apparently they are not really going to be able to go through their full CapEx prognosis until maybe January, February next year. But how much do your managers get privilege to lead time information on to where they are going to be cutting back, if they do? Within that, how defensible are your earnings from the Utilities area? I assume a third in the turnkey is going to be a little vulnerable, but the other two-thirds in products and services may be less so. I would be interested to hear what you say about that.</p>
          <p>And then switching over to China, we are very privileged that you have obviously just come back from there, post the big Chinese infrastructure spend program announcement. How confident are you of its availability to international companies? And secondly, how much might you have to give up to get access to it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with China first. Siemens is in China since 1869. We have a &#x20AC;5 billion business in China; we have 45,000 employees, so we are an insider in China since more than 100 years. So we have full visibility and full access. In fact this was actually hugely important that there is a very close and very good relationship now between Germany and China. And I was part of the delegation with the German Chancellor going to China exactly for this reason. And we are bidding for several of the major infrastructure projects in China. So I see the investment program, the incremental investment program, which China has now announced as certainly a major opportunity for a company like Siemens.</p>
          <p>On the utility, the best lead indicator is that we have, at all levels, with the major utilities, direct contact, myself with the CEOs, we have it at the operating level. So the best lead indicator is certainly, if you talk to the CEO directly and simply explore if they will also evaluate their CapEx programs going forward, and the answer is yes, they will do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how defensible is your earning guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And by the way, I mean, for the third -- because you say the turnkey programs are probably not so secured. I would like to counter this, because on the turnkey, what we have also, and this is Joe and the finance team has absolutely made sure, if you have projects where financing is part of the overall project, we count it as part of an order as soon as we have secured financing. So actually, we are very conservative in terms of the order intake evaluation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I would like to take the last two now. Crista and after that Tim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi it's Crista from UBS, I have three quick questions please. The first one is on SG&amp;A. It looks like the starting point is actually higher than what I was expecting. If you look at 2008, excluding the restructuring charges, the starting point is actually 12.7 billion. I'm pretty sure there should be some inflation in there going forward in 2009 and 2010, and therefore, it looks to me like yes, the target of 10.9 billion in 2010 looks pretty challenging. So I just wanted to get a feel of how do you feel about inflation versus the savings that you are going to see going forward?</p>
          <p>Second question is on the free cash flow. How do you feel about the free cash flow going into next year? This year, free cash flow was something like 5.7 billion. You were talking previously about potential cash outflow from the fact that maybe order intake could be lower in some of the project division. You are going to take some cash outflow as well for the restructuring charges. So do you have a feel for what level of free cash flow we should consider and that's probably why also you are getting more cautious on the dividend payment and also on the share buyback.</p>
          <p>And last question is on the supply chain. And you're considering a very big program in the supply chain, so surely there's a lot of potential for savings. Can we get a feel of how much it could cost actually to Siemens going into next year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So may I start with the last first and then I hand over to Joe. I repeat once more, we're delighted that Barbara will be on board. As soon as she is on board, she will develop the program. As soon as she has targets, we will immediately communicate this with you and this will be probably after the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> let's say to the character and the nature of purchasing-related achievements, they are extremely desirable since it doesn't cost anything except that we need to convince our suppliers. So that's the beauty of it. They are quick and they do not usually mean a lot of restructuring of people. So therefore, it's a very desired outcome. It yet remains to be seen on how much and when we will get. But I think it is important that you understand it is another step to act proactively on potential further downside of the world economy. That's all what it is. And everything else at this point in time will be speculation, but supply chain results from purchasing are extremely desirable, since they are quick without any major restructuring, just on a general note.</p>
          <p>On free cash flow, I think we are pretty transparent on what the cash outflow will be. If you look at page number 15 again of our presentation, that clearly shows that in 2009 there will be about 2.4 billion of cash outflow, which is related to the charges we have been taking associated with the transformation program in 2008. So this will be a significant burden on cash. And so the probability that we yet have another 5.7 billion is rather low on free cash flow, because we need to finance the charges which we have been taking in 2008, so we will not see another five point change free cash flow in 2009. I think that's just important to say. Yet, we will keep a tight grip on cash, because that's important.</p>
          <p>On the SG&amp;A, which is again shown on page number 19, we have not increased the SG&amp;A portion compared to the baseline of 12.1. So the 12.1 baseline in 2007 are now 11.9. So there has been savings already, overcompensating for the inflation we have been seeing in sales and G&amp;A costs, as well as overcompensating the sales costs related to the sales growth we have achieved in 2008.</p>
          <p>We just wanted to make sure that we understand that into the 13.6 reported SG&amp;A there is 0.9 billion on one-offs, which are in essence the restructuring charges related to the program, and that we have a comparable baseline through the addition of the portfolios for UGS and Diagnostics, which is <mark type="inaudible" />, which has not been fully part of the 12.1. So we do commit to the 1.2 savings till 2010. There are actions in place on IT and Consulting. Parts of that will be seen already in 2009. However, we also have to be clear about the fact that the majority of the head count related SG&amp;A savings are back-end loaded and we will see it 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you just come back quickly to the three to five billion you mentioned previously regarding the fact that you have excessive billings. You mentioned, and we were talking about customer advances previously, and you said that you had three to five billion excessive billings. What does it mean in terms &#x2013;  what do you mean in terms of cash flow impact for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The three to five billion had been historic numbers when we saw, that's before declining, so that would actually be just a ballpark number of what could grow or could come less into the free cash flow. By the same token, I would not take this as a net number because usually what you'll also see is net working capital reduction big time. Customer payments are &#x2013; this is nothing but financing working capital. So if there is no customer order anymore, we do not need to finance net working capital. So that's in essence what it is.</p>
          <p>So I would not get overly concerned about the fact that in a, let's say, the scenario where order growth was slowing down, this will turn the whole company upside down because of the lack of prepaid working capital. There will be a short-term impact, but then in the quarters to follow we will see a significant reduction of working capital also. So what I think I was saying is we should not overestimate the impact of customers' advance payments. They will have a short-term impact. We are well prepared if and when that came. But then again, it goes along with a significant reduction of net working capital going forward. We've seen that time and again; we've seen it in 2003, '04, '05, where we also had a similar impact. So I would not be, let's say, too concerned about potential reduction of customer prepayments, because in essence they only finance an order.</p>

And the second one was just a housekeeping question, on Osram, what assets specifically did you write-down? I think you said you wrote down something by &#x2013; you took a 129 million charge, I think 90 was and asset impairment. Just specifically, what was it?</p>

          <p>Okay. I think that's important to clarify. The asset increase on Siemens Financial Services is not even predominantly related to customer financing; it is not. We did pick up financial assets here where we do have domain knowhow: that means the broad financial assets in areas where we understand the customers and the business, like Healthcare, like Infrastructure, like Energy. So it's got nothing &#x2013; or not much &#x2013; not too much to do with customer financing, and I think that's important.</p>
          <p>Then secondly on the Osram, the charge was 129 million; about 90 million were non-cash items where we did write down the factory assets, which are not, let's say, needed that long anymore since we have a shift in consumer demand from, let's say, channel lighting to energy lighting- &#x2013; energy savings bulb and things like that.</p>
