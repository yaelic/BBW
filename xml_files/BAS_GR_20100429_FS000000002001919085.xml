      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of BASF, I would like to welcome you to our First Quarter 2010 Conference Call. BASF had a very strong first quarter 2010 driven by improved performance of our industrial businesses as well as the favorable business development in crop protection.</p>
          <p>With me on the call today to explain the results in more detail are Dr. Kurt Bock, our Chief Financial Officer and Manfredo R&#xFC;bens, President of BASF Finance Division. Following Dr. Bock's presentation, both gentlemen will be available to take your questions. Just the usual reminder, since we have our Annual General Meeting today, the conference call will be limited to one hour.</p>
          <p>We have posted all the numbers, the charts and the speeches on our website today at basf.com/share. So now, I would like to hand over to Dr. Bock.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks Maggie, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen also from my side. Thanks again for joining us today. You already saw our numbers this morning and it looks right now like the global economy continues to gather pace on the back of a jump in demand.</p>
          <p>BASF had a strong start to the year driven by volume recovery. Demand increased substantially as the result of the improved economic environment and some restocking by our customers. At the same time, supply of some chemicals was tight.</p>
          <p>Consequently, in Q1, sales rose by 26% to &#x20AC;15.5 billion, 6% of which resulted from our acquisition of Ciba. Earnings doubled to &#x20AC;2 billion. This is in comparison with the last year's first quarter, which as we all know, was the bottom of the crisis. In order to gain a better understanding of the underlying business dynamic, I will now compare Q1 with the fourth quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Sales increased by 17% over the previous quarter. Volumes increased by 9% and prices rose by 4%. EBITDA was up by 18% at &#x20AC;2.6 billion and we again achieved a strong EBITDA margin of 17%. Cost reduction and efficiency improvement measures, as well as synergy effects from the Ciba integration, further strengthened earnings. EBIT before special items increased by 32%.</p>
          <p>Net income more than doubled to just above &#x20AC;1 billion. This increase was driven by higher income from operations as well as a slightly lower tax rate of 34.7%. Adjusted earnings per share amounted to &#x20AC;1.32.</p>
          <p>We generated a cash flow from operations of &#x20AC;1 billion, slightly above Q4 of 2009 but down from &#x20AC;2.1 billion in Q1 of 2009. The decrease is solely attributable to the &#x20AC;2 billion swing in net working capital, and in particular higher accounts receivable, reflecting the recovery of volumes and sales year-on-year.</p>
          <p>And now turning over to our segments. Chemicals increased sales by 20% and earnings by 46% compared with the previous quarter due to ongoing solid demand across all divisions and regions, especially in Asia.</p>
          <p>In Petrochemicals, planned and unplanned plant outages led to very tight product markets in all regions. We were able to pass on higher raw material costs and expand margins. In Q2, we expect ongoing healthy margins in Petrochemicals. Over the course of the year, however, product availability will improve due to the start-up of plants in Asia and the Middle East.</p>
          <p>In Inorganics, sales increased, especially in Glues and Resins as well in Metal Systems. Earnings were up, which was due to significantly higher volumes.</p>
          <p>In Intermediates, strong demand from key customer industries, such as plastics, coatings, textiles and fibers as well as the seasonal peak in agro demand supported the sales and earnings improvement. The availability of several amines as well as Butandiol and its derivatives has been tight due to plant outages at competitors.</p>
          <p>At present, the first and complete turnaround of our entire Nanjing site is running at full speed, which will hurt the segment's EBIT in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>In Plastics, we achieved significantly higher sales and earnings as business development rebounded further in Q1. In Performance Polymers, sales and earnings increased significantly as demand improved across all regions. Engineering Plastics, Polyamides and Foams benefited from higher demand from the automotive and electrical &amp; electronics industries. Stock levels are expected to stay low. In light of sharply increasing raw material prices, however, margins are expected to come under some pressure.</p>
          <p>In Polyurethanes sales continued to grow in the first quarter. Stronger volumes for basic products and specialties as well as currency effects lifted net sales. MDI was exposed to margin pressure, due to the increase in benzene feedstock costs coupled with the restart of idled capacities of major competitors. For the second quarter, we expect an unchanged market environment.</p>
          <p>Following the Ciba acquisition, our Performance Products segment has a very different footprint than a year ago. In Performance Products, sales increased by 11% over the previous quarter, due to a pick-up in demand in all divisions. This was partly a result of restocking by our customers, especially in the Dispersions &amp; Pigments and Performance Chemicals divisions. All divisions contributed positively to earnings. We achieved a sustainable improvement in earnings through lower Ciba integration costs and we continued to realize synergies.</p>
          <p>In Dispersions &amp; Pigments, sales rose by 15% due to the better economic environment and the seasonal upturn in the first quarter. Demand from the automotive and the printing and packaging industry strengthened. Pigments were in short supply globally. Despite increasing raw material prices, divisional earnings continued to rebound.</p>
          <p>In Care Chemicals, sales continued to grow, driven by a strong upturn in demand in almost all businesses, especially in Detergents &amp; Formulators and Cosmetics. Earnings rose considerably, supported by healthy demand.</p>
          <p>Despite the difficult market situation in the paper industry, sales of Paper Chemicals increased by 6%. Price increases were implemented in order to pass on higher raw material costs. Divisional earnings turned positive, supported by synergies and our successful restructuring efforts.</p>
          <p>In Performance Chemicals, higher demand and partial restocking by our customers fueled sales development. Higher raw material costs were almost compensated by price increases. Earnings showed a substantial swing to profitability.</p>
          <p>In Functional Solutions, the seasonal sales decline in Construction Chemicals was offset by significantly higher sales to customers in the automotive industry. All divisions achieved higher earnings.</p>
          <p>In Catalysts, sales increased considerably, driven by further volume recovery of mobile emission catalysts and the higher precious metal prices. Sales of refinery catalysts were lower. The recovery of chemical catalysts demand hasn't happened yet. Earnings increased slightly compared to Q4.</p>
          <p>Sales in the Coatings division were flat. While Automotive OEM coatings remained at the same level as in the previous quarter, Automotive Refinish Coatings achieved higher sales. Earnings were above the level of the previous quarter due to a favorable product mix at constant fixed costs.</p>
          <p>In Construction Chemicals, the continuing difficult environment in the construction industry and the long and cold winter, especially in Europe and in North America, had a negative impact on Q1 sales. The strongest decline occurred in Europe and in North America, as mentioned before. In contrast, in South America and some markets in Asia and the Middle East, the development was positive. Earnings were positive due to better pricing and considerably lower fixed cost.</p>
          <p>In Agriculture Solutions, first quarter sales were in line with the very strong first quarter of 2009. Volume growth in North and South America compensated for the negative currency impact of the U.S. dollar. Reduced selling prices of Plant Health products in North America reflected lower commodity prices.</p>
          <p>In North America, we had an excellent start to the growing season. We generated strong volume growth, thanks to high demand for our herbicides. We successfully launched our new herbicide Kixor, which contributed significantly to sales growth. Kixor is highly effective against all important broadleaf weeds including those showing glyphosate resistance.</p>
          <p>In Europe, positive currency effects partly offset declined demand for fungicides due to a late start to the growing season. With weather conditions becoming more favorable since mid-March, demand for crop protection products has finally gained momentum.</p>
          <p>In Asia, sales were slightly lower because customers were already pre-buying certain insecticides in Q4 of 2009.</p>
          <p>In South America, the good business development from the fourth quarter continued into the first quarter 2010. Sales grew strongly, which was attributable to high disease pressure as well as the recovery of the sugarcane market which boosted demand for fungicides and insecticides. 2010 Agricultural Solutions will strive to achieve a sales increase and maintain the high earnings level  reached in 2009.</p>
          <p>Now coming to Oil &amp; Gas. Compared with the first quarter now of 2009, sales in Oil &amp; Gas decreased considerably, mainly due to significantly lower gas prices. Sales in Exploration &amp; Production were flat compared with the same period last year. The combination of higher oil prices, with Brent averaging at US$76 per barrel compared with US$44 in Q1 of 2009, and an increase in gas production at Yuzhno Russkoye compensated for lower oil production in Libya and declining gas prices. Earnings increased slightly.</p>
          <p>Volumes in Natural Gas Trading increased significantly due to the long and cold winter. This higher volume, however, could not make up for the strong decline in sales prices. Earnings decreased significantly as a result of negative time lag effects.</p>
          <p>A look at the income statement for Oil &amp; Gas shows that the first quarter EBIT decreased by 13% compared with the same period of the last year. However, net income after minority interest increased by 28% to &#x20AC;273 million.</p>
          <p>I'm now coming to Others. In Other, sales increased by 46% compared to Q1 2009, mainly due to improved volumes in Styrenics. EBIT before special items of minus &#x20AC;266 million included the corporate research and group corporate costs, which were at the level of the previous quarters. In addition, earnings in Other include higher accruals for BASF's option program. EBIT before special items in Styrenics increased, driven by higher volumes. In total, EBIT in Other was minus &#x20AC;300 million, compared with minus &#x20AC;268 million last year.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to our balance sheet. Two effects led to an increase in total assets of &#x20AC;3.3 billion to 40 &#x2013; &#x20AC;54.6 billion since the beginning of 2010. First, a significant appreciation of many currencies against the euro inflated our asset base by about &#x20AC;1.4 billion. Second, working capital, in particular accounts receivable, rose by &#x20AC;2.4 billion on the back of the strong sales development. At the same time, we reduced net debt further by &#x20AC;500 million, to &#x20AC;12.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Now an update on our Ciba integration. We have largely completed the structural integration of Ciba within one year of the closing date. This means that we have set up all the organizational structures and integrated the main systems and processes of the former Ciba into BASF Group. We have also already consolidated many company structures and production sites. Majority of integration costs were already booked in 2009. In the first quarter of 2010, we incurred &#x20AC;70 million of integration costs related to restructuring measures and severance payments, which were recorded as special items. For the full year, we expect total integration costs of about &#x20AC;200 million for Ciba.</p>
          <p>The synergies, on the other hand, are now starting to gain momentum. The cost synergy run rate at the end of 2010 is projected at &#x20AC;350 million. Once we have fully &#x2013; for 2010. Once we have fully completed the integration by 2012, we are confident that we will achieve more than &#x20AC;450 million of cost synergies per year. 23 out of 55 former Ciba production sites underwent strategic reviews. Up to now, we have announced the closure or divestiture of 14 of those 23 production sites.</p>
          <p>Now finally let's turn to the outlook for 2010. For the remainder of 2010, we expect the economic recovery to be slower and increasingly uneven. There continue to be a risk regarding a self-sustaining, lasting upturn from our point of view.  Planned shutdowns for maintenance will have a negative impact on sales and earnings in the second quarter of 2010.  As already mentioned, the entire Nanjing site will be shut down for a general turnaround and expansion.  The earnings impact of all of our turnarounds in Q2 could be up to &#x20AC;100 million.</p>
          <p>We expect our sales to grow again in 2010, not surprisingly, and outpace global chemical production. We anticipate that the income from operations before special items will improve considerably, and that we will again earn a premium on our cost of capital. We're also standing by our medium-term EBITDA margin target of 18%, as well as our dividend policy.</p>
          <p>Thanks for your attention, and we are now happy to take your questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you very much, Dr. Bock, and I would now like to open the call for questions. And ask you to please limit your question to only one at a time, so that we can take as many questions as possible.</p>
          <p>And the first question we have from Thomas Gilbert from UBS. Good morning, Thomas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Maggie. Good morning. Dr. Bock. I've got one question, of course. Your M&amp;A fire brigade team, is that done with the Ciba integration, and what's the next task for this task force? Or are you sending them on vacation for the rest of the year? I was wondering what your plans are, given there the headlines we've had in the news on BASF looking again at acquisitions. Thanks for taking that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Thomas and thanks for the question. As you can imagine our entire M&amp;A team is dead tired and they are all looking forward to a long and enjoyable vacation and that's all I can say right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just coming back to the serious part, the end markets, you're looking to expand at BASF, the strategy remains intact. You want to go downstream, away from cracker products further downstream to &#x2013; closer to the end markets, and the consumer market is one that is interesting for you. Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have always made a couple of explanations with regard to our M&amp;A policy and one is that we really want to go further downstream in areas where technology really pays off. When you look at our overall portfolio and your numbers will show this today at the general meeting, we can demonstrate that the share of commodities, whatever the definition of commodities or the specialties is, the share of commodities has decreased considerably over the last couple of years. Continues to decrease and when you look at our earnings profile this quarter, it looks like this has served us very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question now comes from Nobert Barth from WestLB.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nobert, yes we hear you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. One question, Mr. Bock, you spoke about some restocking effects. Can you be a little bit more specific in which area this is? And also of some tight situation in some segments, can you be a little bit more specific on that, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, certainly. It's very difficult for us to tell you exactly what is the restocking and what is ultimate market demand in the ultimate end markets of our customers. We have lots of anecdotal evidence when we talk with our business heads that some of our customers were running at very, very low stock levels and they really came back now in Q1. In some cases, they basically told us, please just ship that stuff, I need it. They didn't even want to talk about prices anymore. And that you could certainly take as an indication that stock levels have been a little bit too low at our &#x2013; at some of our customers' levels.</p>
          <p>It goes across the board, certainly less so in the Chemicals segment, because as you can imagine, it's more difficult to store those products. But Performance Products, Pigments I mentioned for instance, the supply chains were really empty and we saw a little bit of restocking happening in 2010.</p>
          <p>If your question is, has this come to an end already? That's very hard to say. When we look at the April sales, it's basically developing at the level of what we saw in March of 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the next question comes from Tony Jones from Redburn.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, good morning. Redburn in London, in terms of pricing increases through Q2, Q3, previously quite a high proportion of your contracts were linked to or indexed to some other feedstock. Now I think you've guided over the recession that that proportion is eased slightly because some customers prefer to change how they buy. How confident are you that you can get prices up over the year and try and offset some of this input cost inflation? Because a lot of this strong demand is in Asia, but in Europe it's improving, but we don't know how further it's going to improve over the year. Could you give us a bit of color in how this might change over the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's actually a tricky one. I understand you refer to our selling prices being linked to some feedstock across quotations. Yes, we have that in very limited cases, I would say that 95% plus of our portfolio of our sales is completely unrelated to feedstock costs in terms of contractual agreements. So it's really up to us to bring up prices and when you look at Q1 we have been successful in some areas. This is continuing, we're pushing wherever possible because we also see slightly higher feedstock costs. And we are still sticking to our oil price forecast of US$75, but currently we are slightly above that level, so we feel certain cost pressures coming up. And so far this has worked very well in Q1. We were able to improve prices in some areas where there was really a need, for instance also including the former Ciba businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may just ask a short follow-up, is the price increase that you got in Q1, is that heavily related to say shortness of supply for some chemicals? And may &#x2013; as you're flagging that that's going to ease through the year, will that power that you have fade slightly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The anecdotal evidence I provided earlier on and I said some of our customers are just screaming for product. We shouldn't over emphasize these issues. I mean, there is still overcapacity within our industry, structural overcapacity, we have said that again and again. I alluded to the ethylene business that we certainly will expect more capacity coming on stream in the second half of 2010. So we do whatever is possible under current market circumstances to bring up prices. Will it be temporary or sustainable from today's point of view? And I can only talk about the next couple of months because that is what we actually see in our books, it looks like we still have a pretty solid market environment, which supports this strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. That's really helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question now comes from Sophie Jourdier [Citi]. Good morning, Sophie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. Just a question on Performance Products. A quite astonishing improvement in EBIT, sequentially as well, very high margins now. I just wondered whether you could give a bit more detail as to what drove that? And I guess more importantly, how sustainable you seek that level of profitability. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, Sophie. Actually we were not that much surprised, because we know that our integration and restructuring efforts are well underway and we already have a Ciba synergy effect.  That is helpful. Our costs are under control, very important, and coming down further in the old Ciba unit. Margins have slightly improved at the general market. There are certainly differences from product to product, but they have slightly improved and volumes have picked up, and in that situation, with fixed costs under control and volume demand picking up, you certainly have a nice surge in earnings. And then on top of that, we certainly also have the synergy effects, which as I said, finally pay off.</p>
          <p>When you look at the EBIT after special items, you also have to take into account that obviously the integration costs have come down compared with 2009. I hope that is helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and just sort of looking as far as you can. I mean there's nothing that's particularly changing as you look into the second quarter for Performance Products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Maggie. Just quickly, Dr. Bock, let me phrase Thomas Gilbert's question in a different way. Are chemical asset prices still attractive, in your view? Because I remember that before the crisis, you repeatedly said that chemical asset prices in the market weren't attractive in your view. So have they become attractive and are they still attractive after the re-rating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean that certainly depends on our view of &#x2013; on certain businesses, whether we can make a business which we could acquire better than in the past. That is really the question and you look Ciba and what we are trying to achieve there. So it's very difficult to give a general answer. We have been looking at M&amp;A targets before the crisis, we stopped frankly, looking at M&amp;A targets during the financial crisis because we had other things to do as you can imagine. And that's all what I can say, right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thanks.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Jenny Barker from Nomura.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, good morning. Thank you very much. Yes, I wonder if you could just talk about the issue of spot gas prices being low relative to the thermal equivalent oil price. Obviously this &#x2013; it touches you in two areas, your Oil &amp; Gas area and as a feedstock to your Chemical businesses. Could you just talk about what you see as the prospects for a potential shift towards more spot related pricing in gases? How do you see that going and what do you think the outlook for that is and what are your own intentions and desires with regard to that issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, Jenny, for that question. That was certainly a complicated one, which goes beyond just Q1 or 2010. First of all, in Q1 we had a considerable decrease of natural gas prices. That is predominately 95% plus, just an effect of the all famous time lag effect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that's understood but my question is more -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I know, but I wanted to clarify that so we haven't really seen any major effect in 2010 so far. What is happening right now is that natural gas demand has been a little bit weak in 2009 due to the economic crisis. It's now picking up and we noticed already in Q1. Demand was higher not just because the winter was cold but because also the underlying industrial demand was picking up. At the same time, there's more supply available. There are some spot volumes coming in as LNG and that has developed a certain spot market also here in Europe and has certainly changed some price expectations of customers who are now looking at the price difference between spot and contract prices. And the contract price as you said, has historically been linked to the oil price.</p>
          <p>We think and we are convinced that that link that will continue to be in place for many, many years to come. The demand supply balance will change again in Europe as economic activity is picking up and natural gas reserves come down in Western Europe. There is a natural tendency that we have to rely on imports and those imports can only &#x2013; the large ones can only come from Russia and the Norwegian region predominantly. So what I have said here is that the underlying scheme will not change. We will see a slightly higher spot piece in the future. But we doubt that this will fundamentally change the nature of the natural gas market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you're not pushing &#x2013; as Germany's largest industrial gas fire, the BASF Chemical operations, you're not pushing to have your gas contract basis changed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have always had contractual &#x2013; contract prices based on this famous formula. We always had certain percentages of spot volumes as well, but you have to take into consideration, Jenny, that in this market you really have to have stable and secure supply. And I think it's almost na&#xEF;ve to believe that you could secure the demand of BASF in the spot market. I mean, we need long-term contracts and those we have in place and that hasn't really changed.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you very much. Good morning. Just a question on specifically on Pigments. You mentioned some restocking, very tight market situation in Q1. Going forward you have announced a few plant shut down, as your main competitor did. Do you think this lower supply will compensate or even more than compensate for a possible lower demand after the restocking is gone? I mean, could we expect further margin improvement in this business going forward structurally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very hard for me to say. It's certainly our intention to achieve a situation like that and frankly Pigments is a challenging business environment and that's the reason why we announced a couple of capacity adjustments, which will continue. And the ultimate goal is certainly to make this a very viable and also healthy and profitable business again. And we have seen frankly, Matthias, we have seen in the past other businesses where we have been able to turn situations around. Some businesses which had been difficult for many, many years and all of a sudden, you saw again a very healthy supply demand situation and also a very strong BASF performing very well.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, Dr. Bock. Question on Styrenics, very quickly any closer to the potential disposal of that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing really I could add at this point in time. We are simply working on this situation. The good news is certainly that the business is performing very well, good cash contributor, also a good earnings contributor. Coming back again to what I just said about businesses which are difficult &#x2013; or have been a bit difficult historically, Styrenics is just a good example where a situation has changed, also because we have taken drastic structural measures to improve that business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But given that &#x2013; also quick, could I just ask, in Q2, even with the EBIT effect from the plant maintenance, do you think you can match the first quarter levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't know. We don't know really guide Q2. We made a &#x2013; we gave guidance for 2010 in total. The only thing I can say, looking at what has happened so far in April, business activity is basically at the level of what we saw in March of 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And was March better than January and February?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was a gradual improvement of business over the course of Q1. That I can add, yeah.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So now, we come to the next question from Andreas Heine [UniCredit Group]. Good morning, Andreas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I'd like to understand a little bit, mainly on the Others line. Is there anything what &#x2013; we have to have in mind looking on the weakness of the euro in this line for hedging losses in the coming quarters? Or could you give even a guidance for this line, including these one-offs you can expect for the total year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to turn over this question to Manfredo R&#xFC;bens.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andreas, thanks for the question. We do have currency effects in the Others line, or in the Other segment. And in the 136 million that you see there, there is a portion of currency results which are hedging-related.</p>
          <p>Difficult to predict how this is going to continue over the year, but if you look at our hedging strategy, all the booked positions we hedge at a very high level. So there is very little impact on that end. And the other piece that we do is that we hedge future sales in foreign currency. So, depending on how the currency goes, we may see some negative currency effects. It's basically option premier that we paid, and with the dollar going stronger, the value of the option premier is lower. This is the effect that you see in the second half. Difficult to predict how this is going to continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But Andreas, talking about the underlying competitive situation, as we all know, a weaker euro at least temporarily is benefiting European-based production. However, as a German-based company, we are basically interested in a strong currency, as we all know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And could you maybe add also one word on net working capital? That was quite an outflow in the first quarter, as much as you had an inflow last year in the first quarter. Is it only a temporary effect on the receivables, or do you expect also on the full year line, that net working capital will require even more what we have seen in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, the one effect which we cannot really influence is accounts receivables, because with higher sales, we have higher account receivables obviously on our books. Inventory increase was very, very low in Q1. There's just a couple of hundred millions, which again underlines the relatively strong business development in Q1. And as we all know, we have very tight control of our inventory levels and we certainly try to see those levels not to go up over the course of the year. What is hard to predict frankly is the price effect if, for instance, feedstock costs go up further on, that certainly has a nominal effect on our inventory level, something difficult to avoid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we are moving on. Now the next question comes from Martin Evans from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. One of the issues a few months ago, I think at your Asia Day, was what's happened if and when governments stimulate -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Martin, you have to speak up a little bit, it's impossible to hear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, can you hear me now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Much better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. No, what it was, several months back at your Asia Day, I think one of the sort of concerns for the group as a whole was what if &#x2013; or what happens when the sort of various government stimuli packages around the world finish? And whether the sort of demand could be taken up from that, particularly in Asia, where I think you were slightly concerned that when the Chinese government stops spending on infrastructure, that could have a negative effect sort of generally for your businesses. Are you finding now that the sort of &#x2013; the potential absences of those government packages is not an issue because genuine demand is coming through quite strongly? Or is there still an issue for you that if later in the year, government support is withdrawn, that could affect some of your end markets? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's fair to say that, in Europe and North America, we haven't seen tangible effects of those stimuli programs. I mean it's starting now in public construction, infrastructure projects, but that affects companies like BASF only partially because it would only affect our constructions business, which is important, but again, there the share of public infrastructure construction is relatively low. In Europe, we were a little bit concerned for &#x2013; with this Cash For Clunkers program, especially in Germany, that the demand would fall off the cliff in 2010. That hasn't happened yet in Europe so far.</p>
          <p>Coming to Asia. We look at China and are simply amazed, to tell you the truth. I mean, the growth has continued and we're still looking at something like 10% GDP growth. That's really astonishing and that is certainly one question mark we always have. How long is it possible to continue at that pace? Because we are already in a situation where our capacities are fully loaded as you know. We are expanding our facilities, especially in Asia. We have announced a couple of major investment projects, which I think are all well timed for phasing into the market, but again right now the demand in Asia is really amazing.</p>

          <p>The next question is coming from Mr. Jaideep Pandya from Berenberg Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. My question is basically, if you look at the demand level across your business in Q1 this year and if you now compare it to the pre-crises level, so let's say Q1 in '08 or how would you rate it? So is &#x2013; would you say it is there, would you say it is over Q1 '08 or would you say it is still way, way below Q1 '08 despite of the tailwind you have from the restocking effects? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of total demand volume and also capacity utilization, we are still below the level of Q1 of 2008, which obviously was pre-crisis and probably one of the best quarters we ever had.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and just as a small follow-up about overall raw materials, obviously you have said that raw material prices are increasing, but not so much. Going forward, would you think that they would increase i.e. that's for Q2, Q3, more than Q1 or you think they're going to be more or less flattish?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very hard for us to say. As we all know, the majority of our feedstock costs is somehow linked to the oil price. So far as I said, we stick to oil price on average of $75 is again slightly above that level, rather it needs to be seen. And then if feedstock costs, if they really go up, which we don't know yet, it all depends on demand and supply in those chemical segments which we operate obviously. In the further downstream businesses, we have sometimes also special situations. Automotive demand has picked up very nicely, which really helped us across our business. And we will continue, and I think that's important. We will continue with what we call value over volume strategy, that is for us really important, to protect our margins and not to go for volume at any cost. And again, that strategy has <mark type="inaudible" /> over the last couple of quarters.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Also a question on the operating rate. I know you're not a big fan of disclosing that on the group level, but could you indicate which businesses are still significantly below the pre-recession level, and which businesses are back at or even higher than that level? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you're right, we're not really happy to talk about the specific operating rate or capacity utilization rate because sometimes you really compare apples and oranges, especially across companies. I would say that on &#x2013; in general remark, we have all businesses still below the levels we have seen in 2008 &#x2013; and early 2008. There's no particular business where we are above that level.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. And just coming back on the pricing in raw materials question again. When I look at the quarterly development of your prices quarter-on-quarter, i.e. versus Q4 and for the individual divisions, were you able to pass on more than the raw material cost increases you've seen temporarily in Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again a general statement, we have been able to protect our margins pretty much across the board and that was our intention that this would be achieved. And we don't really go into margin discussion for individual businesses or our divisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you for taking my question. It's on the segment orders and particularly on page 11 in your slides. You show and you mentioned it already that here the line Styrenics, Fertilizers and Other business has reduced earnings although for example, the Styrenics business performed extremely well with strong top line growth and also increase in earnings. So I would like to get an understanding, what was the reason why this business or this line was down in earnings because I thought from reading from your competitors that also the Fertilizer business should have performed well in Q1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Manfredo R&#xFC;bens. You're right, we have offsetting effects. As Kurt mentioned earlier, we had a strong volume driven increase in Styrenics and increase in results. But offsetting we have the Fertilizer business, which compensated those increases. So we have compared to first quarter of 2009, a lower result contribution from the Fertilizer business and a higher in Styrenics.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I may add here, that is a little bit maybe counterintuitive, as you mentioned. What happens here we don't market our fertilizers, our source, we have a company doing this for us, and the contract basically specifies that the earnings are then distributed to BASF with a certain time lag. So the lower earnings in Fertilizers in 2010, which we now had in Q1, basically reflects the situation in the market in 2009.</p>

          <p>The next question now comes from Stephan Kippe from Commerzbank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. I have a question on the regional side of things. I mean you had some very, very impressive sales increases especially in Asia Pacific. However you did not provide any information of how much of that is the impact from the first time Ciba integration. I understand that that might be a complex thing to do, but can you give us a feeling in which region the Ciba impact was the most pronounced?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, if I remember correctly, the Ciba effect was six percentage points across last &#x2013; above last year. And that number holds true across regions, actually. The Ciba portfolio had a regional distribution, which was pretty much in line with the BASF portfolio, maybe a slightly higher share of business in Asia. But again if you look at the relative size of the old Ciba and like I said, BASF, this is all sorted out and it basically means that the Ciba and all-in-all, the same all over the world.</p>

          <p>And the next question comes from Peter Clark of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Thank you. I apologize for being a bit impatient. I'm not waiting till June, but just interest on the Plastic Additives business which would call for Ciba's real core business. Just wondering how fundamentally that &#x2013; is it performing, whether you have to &#x2013;  were there tropicals? If you try and take out sort of some of the profit that there might have been in Q1 towards the end of March anyway? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I try to make a comment here, but we don't really talk too much about as I said before, about individual businesses now. Plastic Additives certainly also benefited from higher demand for Plastics. That's easy to understand and we are in the midst of restructuring that business, that &#x2013; you also have to take into account. We are taking out cost. And we are now the number one supplier globally for plastic additives. And we believe that we can make this quite a strong earnings contributor to BASF. Sorry for being so general, but we don't really go -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll try again in June, obviously, when there'll be more information -</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In June, you will get tons of data.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Now Lutz Gr&#xFC;ten from Kepler Capital.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, good morning. One question on your cost saving program NEXT. Could you give us an update what was achieved so far from the scheduled &#x20AC;1 billion and perhaps also breakdown by division? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're right. We try to achieve a total savings number of about 1 billion latest 2012. So far we have achieved 300 million of that program and it's now accelerating over the course of 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, 300 million, you said?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the breakdown by division?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So now we come to the final question or final two questions, actually. One comes from Thomas Gilbert and then Martin Evans and then we have to stop.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for taking the follow-up question. I reckon you're not going to answer it but I give myself a shot. You said that the petrochemical, the cracker products were very strong in the first quarter but that there is &#x2013; the outlook is more mixed into the second half. Is there a chance you can give a color on C1, C2, C3 and C6, whether that's uniform across the chain or whether you're specifically bullish or bearish on one of those? I'm specifically interested in all the comments from your U.S. competitors at the C3 chain, propylene and propylene derivatives, acrylic acid, are expected to remain tight. So any color on that would be helpful, if not bad luck for me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think they are the experts, so we would be probably go along with that line. As you know, the entire business for us has certain importance but it's not that important, frankly. It's basically for captive demand. And yes, C3 certainly is probably better protected against emerging competition from the Middle East, as we all know. And finally, butadiyne is just tight as it can be. It's an extremely difficult market situation right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And sorry, was propylene, acrylic acid, butadiyne, were those driving the result in the first quarter or also the ethylene side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was across the board. It was across the board.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And our final question, Martin Evans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. Just a very quick one on the catalyst performance in Q1, which obviously as you say in the press release benefited from improved demand -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Martin, you have to speak up again, this is impossible hear. I am sorry. Can you repeat it? Hello?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, he's gone. I think he wanted to ask about catalysts. Our catalyst business was much better in Q1, supported by good. I answer now a question which wasn't asked really. It was supported by recovery of demand in automotive also higher precious metal prices, which have a certain effect on our bottom-line and continue in cost and restructuring &#x2013; cost saving and restructuring efforts within that particular division.</p>
          <p>One business, which hasn't picked up and I mentioned that before is really our chemical catalyst business. That is a probably a late cycle indicator because it remained relatively healthy even after the economy and continuously fall off the cliff &#x2013; fell off the cliff in late 2008. Continued to have good demand for a couple of months, and then it basically disappeared and that hasn't really recovered because obviously not many companies, many kind of companies are still in the mode of producing and getting up their production and then they will later over the course of the year, start their maintenance programs and turnaround programs, as we recently did in Nanjing for instance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, then thank you, Dr. Bock and Mr. R&#xFC;bens. And ladies and gentlemen, this brings us to the end of our conference call. Before we close, I would like to mention again that we will have our next event namely the BASF Investor Day on Performance Products. It will take place on June 1st in London and on June 2nd in New York. And we will also bring our division heads along in addition to top management naturally, so you can really have in-depth discussions. We will next report on our second quarter 2010 results on July 29, 2010.</p>
          <p>And at this point in time, I would like to thank you for joining us this morning. Should you have any further question, you are more than welcome to contact myself or my colleagues at the IR team and we will be happy to help you on any further questions.</p>
          <p>So for this we all wish you a good day and say good-bye.</p>
