          <p>Good morning; my name is Dennis and I will be your conference facilitator today.  I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs first quarter 2008 earnings conference call.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Also, this call is being recorded today, March 18, 2008.  Thank you.</p>
          <p>Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>

          <p>Hello, good morning, everyone. This is Dane Holmes from Investor Relations and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call.  Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that by their nature of uncertainty are outside the firm's control.  The firm's actual results and condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that would affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current Annual Report 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 2007.</p>
          <p>I'd also direct to you read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our investment banking transaction backlog; and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.</p>

          <p>Let me now ask David Viniar, our Chief Financial Officer, to review the firm's first quarter results. David?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dane.  Good morning; I'd like to thank all of you for listening. I'll give a brief review of our results and then I'd be happy to take your questions.</p>
          <p>Our first quarter results reflected a more challenging operating environment than we have experienced in recent quarters. While a broad-based asset repricing across credit and equity markets negatively affected our performance in certain businesses, our core franchise remains strong. For the first quarter of 2008, net revenues were 8.3 billion.  Net earnings were 1.5 billion and earnings per diluted share were $3.23. The annualized return on common equity was 15%.</p>
          <p>Now I'm going to review each of our major businesses.  Investment banking produced net revenues of $1.2 billion in the quarter. First quarter advisory revenues were $663 million, down 47% sequentially, as the pace of closed M&amp;A transactions slowed meaningfully. Investment banking activity has clearly been influenced by broader market disruptions and an unclear economic outlook. That being said, the strength of our client franchise in investment banking remains undiminished as we rank first in global announced M&amp;A for the fiscal year to date.  Our investment banking backlog declined from the fourth quarter but is still comparable to 2006 levels.</p>
          <p>We advised on a number of important transactions that closed during the quarter, including Siemens Automotive's &#x20AC;11.4 billion sale to Continental; Abu Dhabi National Energy's $4.6 billion acquisition of PrimeWest Energy Trust; and CheckFree's $4.4 billion sale to Fiserv.  We're also advisor on a number of significant announced transactions, including Ingersoll Rand's $11.5 billion acquisition of Trane; Vivendi Universal Games' $6.5 billion merger with Activision; and Randstad Holding's &#x20AC;3.4 billion acquisition of Vedior.</p>
          <p>Underwriting revenues were $509 million, 31% below the fourth quarter. Equity underwriting revenues were $172 million, down 57% sequentially, while debt underwriting revenues were up 2% from the fourth quarter to $337 million. Equity financing activity declined during the quarter due to sharp price reductions, higher volatility, and increased uncertainty in global equity markets. Debt underwriting activity was relatively flat sequentially as broader credit market disruption continued to weigh on new issue markets.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we participated in a number of significant underwriting transactions, including the $6.6 billion three-part convertible notes offering by Transocean, the $4.2 billion convertible bond offering by Sinopec, and the &#xA3;318 million IPO by Hansen Transmissions.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to trading and principal investments, which includes FICC, equities, and principal investments.  Net revenues in this segment were $5.1 billion in the first quarter, down 26% from the fourth quarter. FICC net revenues were $3.1 billion, down 5% from the fourth quarter. We posted excellent results across our macro businesses with record quarters in currencies and rates and while not a record, very strong revenues in commodities. Currencies, rates, and commodities all benefited from higher volatility and increased customer activity during the quarter. Credit revenues were down from the fourth quarter as considerable client trading flow was more than offset by a broad decline in asset values. Credit results included a $1 billion loss, $1.4 billion before hedges, related to leverage lending activities.</p>
          <p>Mortgages' revenues declined significantly during the quarter. Market dislocation that began in the subprime asset class migrated to various assets including prime, Alt-A, and commercial real estate. Much of the pricing pressure we have seen is related to technical contagion and many assets are being priced by the market at levels which are significantly below the levels that would stem from a fundamental valuation approach. However, we firmly believe in the mark-to-market philosophy and continue to mark our positions to market clearing levels. As a result, we had losses of approximately $1 billion on our residential mortgage positions during the quarter, largely in Alt-A and prime. As it relates to commercial real estate, our net losses were not material.</p>
          <p>Turning now to equities, net revenues for the first quarter were $2.5 billion, down 3% from the fourth quarter. Equities Trading net revenues declined 5% to $1.3 billion. Our derivatives business was up sequentially, driven by higher customer activity and increased equity market volatility. Revenues from our cash equities business were solid but down from the fourth quarter while principal strategies results were down significantly.</p>
          <p>Equities commissions were $1.2 billion in the quarter, relatively flat on a sequential basis. The continued strength in this business reflects both robust customer flows and our increasing market share in the electronic trading business.</p>
          <p>Turning to risk, average daily Value At Risk [VAR] in the first quarter was 157 million compared to 151 million for the fourth quarter. Interest rate category VAR remained high due to elevated volatility in the mortgage market. VAR declined in the equity category as we reduced position sizes during the quarter. The decrease was more than offset by an increase in our commodity category VAR driven by higher volatility and an increase in positions as well as a reduction in diversification benefit.</p>
          <p>Let me now review principal investments where we recorded a first quarter net loss of $532 million. This reflected a $135 million loss on our ICBC investment as well as losses from other corporate principal investments. We produced very strong results in asset management and securities services with record first quarter net revenues of $2 billion, up 11% from the fourth quarter. Asset management produced net revenues of $1.3 billion, up 13% on $1.1 billion of management fees and $194 million in incentive fees.</p>
          <p>Assets under management increased to a record $873 billion at the end of the first quarter. During the quarter, assets under management increased $5 billion, reflecting $29 billion in inflows, partially offset by $24 billion of market depreciation. Net inflows primarily reflected inflows in money market assets partially offset by outflows in equity assets and market depreciation within equity assets.</p>
          <p>Securities services produced strong net revenues of $722 million, up 7% from the fourth quarter. This business benefited from higher customer balances.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to expenses.  Compensation and benefits expense in the first quarter was $4 billion, accrued at 48% of net revenues.  First quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.2 billion, a 9% decrease from the fourth quarter.  The sequential decrease was largely driven by lower market development, depreciation and amortization, and occupancy expenses. Occupancy expenses declined as the fourth quarter included $128 million of exit costs related to the firm's office space.</p>
          <p>Headcount at the end of the first quarter was approximately 31,900, up 4% from the fourth quarter. The sequential increase was principally driven by our acquisition of Litton Loan Servicing.</p>
          <p>Our effective tax rate was 29.5% in the first quarter.  The decrease in the effective tax rate was largely due to the geographic mix of revenues.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, the firm repurchased 7.9 million shares for approximately $1.6 billion. We currently have approximately 64 million shares remaining under the firm's existing stock repurchase authorization.</p>
          <p>To conclude, the current environment is clearly challenging. However, given the significant weakness in the broader market environment during the first quarter, we believe our results clearly demonstrate the value of the Goldman Sachs client franchise and business model as well as our culture of teamwork and risk management. We will continue to execute on our strategic initiatives conscious of the evolving market dynamics and focused on remaining nimble in this environment. We believe this approach coupled with global economic growth will allow us to continue to create significant value for our clients and shareholders over the longer term.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to thank you again for listening today, and I'm now happy to take your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question will come from the line of Glenn Schorr with UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Dave.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Glenn.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Maybe you could talk towards &#x2013; it's a two-parter. One is get it out of the way and talk to us how comfortable you are with your liquidity position and then maybe follow it up with how you're thinking about the distressed opportunities in the marketplace and how willing you are to take on &#x2013; I'll just call it for lack of a better term Level 3 assets and beef up those positions even though you are getting them at what you think is a great price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll answer both of them, Glenn. Liquidity, you've heard me talk over the years about liquidity being the single most important thing at Goldman Sachs. That's the case for us all the time. It's even more the case in times of market turmoil.  I would tell you that our liquidity position now is stronger than it has ever been before. In my I guess it's nine years of being CFO now, we have never had a stronger liquidity position than we have right now. Our global core excess, which is really our pool of cash and cash equivalents, which averaged in the $60 billion range in the fourth quarter, has been significantly higher than that for the entire first quarter and it's significantly higher than that now. Most of our short term financing is actually termed out. We have little rollover risk.  It's not zero, but it's little. And so we do finance most of our repos full term. We pay for that, but we think it's worth it. Our commercial paper is less than $5 billion, so it's very, very minimal.  And so we do everything we can to put our liquidity in very good shape, and it's, as I said, in as good a shape as we have ever seen.</p>
          <p>I'll add to that.  Even though you didn't ask it, I'll make it part of this question. I think the liquidity facility that the Fed has provided, the ability to access the discount window directly for broker dealers, I think is a very good thing and will help both our liquidity as well as liquidity in the market. One of the important parts of financing is to have diversification of financing sources. That is another source of diversification.  It is another way of financing assets. And while we have not used it yet, since it's effectively a day old, I would expect that I see no reason we wouldn't use it in the future.  We would use it in the future.  I think we will because it's another source of financing.  It's a good source of financing. So as I said with all of those things, I think our liquidity position is probably stronger than it has ever been before.</p>
          <p>So let me move on now to your other question. Times of distress are times of caution, but it's also times of opportunity. Purchasing distressed assets has actually been a business that has been a good business for Goldman Sachs over the years in various places. Our expectation is that we will see opportunities, and we look at everything on a risk/reward basis. If we see an asset, we do our best to value it. We do our best to decide what we think the risk is of holding it and what the returns are going to be. And if we see good opportunities, we would absolutely take advantage of them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, so ignore me when I ask you about the Level 3 assets next quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll remember that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you talk about &#x2013; you had 1 billion in the write-downs on the resi [residential] mortgage side. I think it's more than some expected. I am assuming it's Alt-A related. Can you talk about what you've got and how you have it marked and hedged in Alt-A land?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, it's mostly Alt-A, some prime. Basically all mortgage assets declined in value right up to the very top of the quality. So anything you were loaned went down in value. And so, this had mostly Alt-A, some prime, to give you a sense of what we have.  Just running through it at the end of the quarter, we had 12 billion of prime, 5 billion of Alt-A, and 2 billion of subprime. Now that's long assets only, so it doesn't take into consideration what hedges we have in place, what indices were short, what single managed were short against them. As I said, most of it was in Alt-A. Alt-A is probably of all of those the hardest to hedge. There's no direct index. You can hedge subprime with ABX. You can hedge prime with agencies, so there's better hedges for all of them, very little for Alt-A.  But you have to hedge Alt-A with a combination of the other indices. As with all hedges, there's basis risk that's introduced and there is probably more basis risk with Alt-A than anything.  Clearly with those losses over the course of the quarter, we were not hedged enough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, and I'm ending on an annoying one, sorry. Any interest in the Bear franchise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That has never been on our radar screen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks so much, Dave.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question will come from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Guy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Forgive me if you went over some of this.  The Lehman call went over a little bit. On the leveraged finance side, I saw that you I guess spoke to some reporters about a reduction over the course of the quarter. And it would seem that you had some fairly significant sales. We know what the price movement was like in the quarter. Essentially I guess the question is, can you help us reconcile what you sold, what you might have actually put on at very low prices, and how the marks reconcile to actual realized losses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, let me give you some numbers and tell me if this helps. Beginning of the quarter, we had $26 billion of unfunded, 17 billion of funded, 43 billion total.  Over the course of the quarter, we sold or reduced through cancellations about $20 billion. We put on $4 billion of new commitments. Obviously, put on at the current terms and conditions; leaving us at the end of the quarter, $9 billion unfunded, 18 billion funded, 27 total.  And so the $1 billion of losses; that's $1.4 billion gross, 1 billion net, is really a combination of where things were sold and anytime something was sold, anything we had, if it was sold below the marks, it was marked down to there. So we have our positions marked now where we think we can sell.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you; that helps, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us a sense for total assets and leverage ratios at the end of the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes; round numbers, if you want just gross leverage, just assets to equity, round numbers, our assets were about 1.2 trillion and our equity was about 40 billion, just to give you the round numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can you help us with the net on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you say net, what do you mean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Net of matched book assets as you look at the calculated net leverage ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I actually don't have those numbers in front of me, so let me come back to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that would be great. I didn't see any mention in the release of marks on commercial real estate finance assets. Obviously there was a pretty significant negative variability in the quarter there.  Can you give us a sense on your 19 billion or so portfolio at the beginning of the quarter what kind of &#x2013; how you thought about the marking process given that it doesn't seem like it was very material in the end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, those marks are done with the same level of diligence and vigilance as everything else is marked.  And as things moved, it was marked down. What I mentioned in my script was that the net losses on commercial were not material and that's because we had offsetting gain on hedges. As I said before to Glenn and it's surely the case with commercial as much, when you hedge commercial real estate loans, which are largely single name loans with indices, which is really the best way to hedge it, you're introducing basis risk, which we did. We had basis risk. But over the course of the quarter, really the indices in the single names moved in tandem, and so they largely offset -- we had some losses, but they were small. But it's something that we watch very carefully and I can't tell you that we will always get it right.  But on that basis, we did in the course of the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Lehman mentioned in terms of Alt-A hedging sort of a natural hedge from servicing. You have obviously added servicing capabilities during the quarter. Do you see that as a way of hedging your exposures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, we really have just gotten that servicing platform, so we're looking at it.  I think it's a tough way to hedge it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah -- fair enough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Alt-A is the hardest section to hedge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Can you just comment in the prime brokerage and clearance business first of all, are you seeing growth there that you can really tie directly to what happened to Bear?  To what extent are you able to accommodate incremental financing needs that are going to come to you at this point from clients who are displaced?  And then separately but also on prime brokerage, can you give us a sense for whether you're seeing any significant securities inventory growth due to seizure of prime brokerage collateral, or how quickly are you finding that you're able to liquidate collateral when you seize it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, our prime brokerage business has grown and continues to grow and I think that's not necessarily related to what's happening with our competitors. I think that's more because our business is pretty good, and I think our clients like the service we give them. We get balances both from new hedge funds and from current hedge funds all the time. So those balances have grown and continue to grow. And as they grow, we think that's good for us. Yes, we can handle what our clients need. We're careful on the financing terms. We have the appropriate margin in place, and over the course of the years, our losses there have been extremely small. As far as large growth in inventory assets, I would say it has been pretty minimal. I'd say it's not that often that we have to seize assets; and when we do, we're generally able to liquidate them pretty quickly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>I guess with respect to the PDCF [Primary Dealer Credit Facility] facility, which you talked about briefly, how significant of a benefit is this?  And specifically I mean do you look at this more as a funding facility to help you in terms of your repo financing or in terms of helping clients liquefy?  From a practical standpoint, how do you see this impacting funding</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would answer those two things as yes and yes. I think it's a very good thing. I think the purpose of doing it was really to help the market get more liquid. We think it should have that benefit. As I mentioned before, one of the benefits to us is diversification of financing. It gives us another source of finance for our assets. We were okay without it. We were fine without it. But with it, it's just that much better. And it's another source both for our own assets and if a client wants us to help them &#x2013; help fund them, it gives us another source of financing to turn around to.</p>
          <p>One of the things that had been going on in the market was that part of the lack of liquidity we think, and I think the Fed and the Treasury thought, was because of a lack of funding that was available, and this makes funding available to broker dealers like us to: A), buy assets; and B), fund others who want to buy assets. And so I think overall it's a very good thing. I think it will be very helpful to the markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So this facility helps a great deal in terms of short term funding.  What's your sense in terms of longer term balance sheet risk?  Do you think that the Fed ultimately is going to have to essentially buy up the liquid assets off of broker balance sheets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I know that they are very, very hesitant to do that, and we'll see what they end up doing. I think it's going to depend how the world unfolds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess to that point, what else do you think gets &#x2013; sort of facilitates or what is a catalyst for the transfer of some of these risky assets?  You've clearly &#x2013; you have sold loans off to your part during the quarter. Have you been buying some loans as well?  Are there any &#x2013; in any of these asset classes have you been committing capital?  Do we potentially see any kind of a two-way flow?  I think some of the other brokers have been buying where they see opportunities as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I told you we made $4 billion of new commitments in the loan market, so that's a commitment of capital. We make markets in everything. Across the mortgage industry, we have been buying and selling. If we see opportunities &#x2013; I would tell you we haven't seen that many opportunities yet. We're going to wait for the ones that we think are the most appropriate and then we will try and take advantage of them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How do you manage that relative to I guess the total size of your balance sheet and any focus you have on delevering?  I think the numbers you gave us have on a gross basis you are still at 30 times, which I think is pretty consistent with where you have been. Is there a target leverage ratio that you're shooting for and does that limit your ability to buy where you see opportunity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are always looking at risk and reward. You have heard me say in the past that we think looking at a gross leverage level doesn't tell you very much...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...because it depends on liquidity of the assets. It doesn't tell you anything about the risk. It doesn't tell you about what's hedged on the other side. It doesn't tell you about derivative exposure. And so we think that's a very minimal benefit.  One of the things that we look very carefully at is our capital ratios. Those are tied very much to risk and liquidity, and we make sure that those are always strong.  And in deciding what we're going to purchase, we look at what our capital ratios are. We look at our liquidity and we make our decisions based on that.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're going to &#x2013; it depends on what the world unfolds to be. I think given where we are right now, our capital is very adequate. Our liquidity is very adequate. If there were things that we thought were not earning an appropriate return, we would sell them. If there were things that we thought that we could make a lot of money from, we would buy them. We have no need as we sit here right now to shrink our business.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Prashant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the fixed income revenue, if we look at this pulling out the write-downs, it's very strong.  Can you just talk about some of the drivers there?  I don't know if you can quantify it, but how much was driven by just higher activity versus maybe the bid/ask spreads being wider?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Prashant, the activity levels across our macro businesses and some of the core franchise businesses of the firm were very, very strong. We mentioned that we had records in our interest rate products business and our currency business. We had near record results in our commodities business, so those businesses performed extremely well. I think that was part of what drove the success in FICC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of the Fed's facility, is that something that you would like to see or can envision end up being something more permanent, considering maybe some positive and negative consequences to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would &#x2013; sure, from our point of view, we would very much like to see it be permanent. I have no idea if the Fed or the Treasury have that in mind or not. But as I said before, it gives us another source of financing. It gives us diversification of financing, and that's always a good thing for us. And so certainly as I sit here now, I don't see the negative. I only see the positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fantastic. And then just on the asset management side of the business, anything specific on the equity AUM that drove the flows in that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean the outflows?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The outflows, the 17 billion, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say there were two things. One, our quantitative long equity business had what I would call challenged results over the course of last year, so some of the outflow was that. I think even more of it was a rotation of people's assets from equities into money markets given the environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just maybe longer term thinking of the competitive dynamic, just any comments on &#x2013; with Bear under a different entity, maybe the cost of leverage going forward, just a view on does the competitive environment change a little bit to your favor or not?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't see it changing very much. JPMorgan is a very strong, has been a strong competitor. I think all of our competitors out there and I could go through them are quite strong.

          <p>I'm sorry if I missed this too. I got on late. Did you guys actually say &#x2013; did you have any positive benefit of fair value marks on your own debt this quarter?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the Level 3 assets, it sounds like there was a broad discussion, but did you give the actual number versus the 69 billion you had last quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the number is going to round to roughly to 8% of our assets, which is up a little bit. It was, if you remember, 7% at the end of the third quarter, 6% at the end of the fourth quarter, and now it's 8%.  It has been running in that range, so it's going to be up a little bit. And most of it is stuff that went from Level 2 to Level 3 assets. Some of the commercial real estate loans became Level 3. That's really it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then did you talk at all about exposure to the monolines?</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All I would tell you is we manage our credit risks just like every other risk, where we are focused on companies that have had issues and you've all read about them as much as I have. And we have mitigants in place where we think we need them. And so our exposure to any of our counterparts including the monolines is something that's well within our comfort zone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then on head count, which I think you mentioned rose 4%, mostly on the acquisition this quarter, any expectations for where we should expect that to trend the rest of the year?  Can we get some sense of areas where you might be looking to trend versus areas where you're still looking to grow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Without going through specifics, in the specific areas because I don't really want to do that, our expectation as we sit here right now and it can certainly change if things get better or worse, is that leaving aside the acquisition, our head count will grow slightly this year. I would say low to mid-single digits is where we expect to grow.  And again, as we told you before, it will be greater growth outside of the US than in the US, but very modest everywhere.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. And then just this last question, given your comments on liquidity and how good it is right now; appetite for share repurchases given what you guys did this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will look as we start next quarter. We think there are opportunities for us to repurchase shares. You have seen where we have been running and I would expect to see things that are not terribly different from what you have seen in the past.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's growing faster outside the US.  You didn't see a meaningful change in the quarter. It's always hard to see quarter over quarter because it depends on where a loss might be, where a trading book that has profits might be. So it's not terribly meaningful to go one quarter to the next and say, 49, 51, 52. But the trend is definitely growing faster outside the United States with Asia being even faster.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I look at &#x2013; the one that is the most visible to you as far as the end of the quarter is the global core excess, which is really an amount of cash that's sitting there. And as I mentioned, it was in the mid-60s on average in the fourth quarter, and it has been &#x2013; I'm sorry, in the first quarter and it has been significantly higher than that over the last couple of weeks and remains significantly higher than that right now.</p>
          <p>Another metric that we look at internally is we look at the amount of our short term financing that is termed out so that we don't have significant rollover risk over the next day or couple of days or a week, and that is a very, very high number. And the third thing we look at is within that global core excess, how much is commercial paper because we think that's the &#x2013; probably the least good part of a global core excess, and it's extremely small.  It's less than $5 billion of the 80. So those are three metrics that we look at.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The repo market has been a market that has been there for a very, very long time. Despite that, we still try to term out a lot of our repos and we pay for that. So rather than having an overnight repo, we'll do one week, two weeks, a month, six month repos. And they cost more than doing overnight repos, but they're less risky. And one of the things I mentioned was looking at how we term out our repos. And we have a very, very high percentage for term.</p>

I guess I was just asking from the perspective of the &#x2013; for the marks to be fairly insignificant for you not to disclose them, I'm just trying to get a sense for why that is relative to declines we have seen in observable pricing metrics, and I appreciate that CMBS is only relevant for parts of it, particularly fixed-rate US.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it can be relevant for anything; there's just more basis risk. So you can hedge something that's fixed rate with floating rate.  You can hedge something that's floating rate with fixed rate.  You're just taking a basis risk in doing it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's why I said we're very careful about that. We're very cognizant. We have to be extremely nimble. But it worked pretty well last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's really, you chalk it up to the effectiveness of the hedging?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What about &#x2013; same sort of question in terms of your principal investments, private equity, distributions maybe geographically and by industry. It looks like there's only a little over a 3% mark in the quarter despite the stock market down 10%. I would have thought there would have been a higher correlation of market decline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends what you have. Our portfolio performed pretty well because we think we have some pretty good investments. It is geographically distributed. It is industry distributed, and we think that it showed the strength of some of the investments that we made.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Okay. Just in terms of client trading activity, any comment on the contour of flows during the quarter?  Did the quarter end as strong as it was during the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't &#x2013; clearly, as you know, markets deteriorated over the course of the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I don't see the client flow really changing much over the course of the quarter in some of our franchise trading businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then lastly just coming back to the repo market. Can you talk to the mix of the assets that you finance in repo market?  How much of this is mortgage backed?  What are some of the other key asset classes in there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We finance a lot of our assets in the repo market. There's a repo market -there are repos available for assets that range from certain mortgages to equities to obviously US governments. And the less liquid the asset, the more we care about funding it for term. And that's why it's very, very important that we term out a lot of our repos.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you finance any customer balances in the prime brokerage area ahd repo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so no prime brokerage assets are used to finance in any way the broker/dealer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it can't be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay, all right. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're welcome.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question will come from the line of Meredith Whitney with Oppenheimer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, David. I want to congratulate you for beating your own record on the brevity of opening remarks. I wanted just take you to a different track, if you would. I'm interested in what happened with the asset management and then thematically what's going on with asset management. If you could geographically break down where the flows came from, and if you could comment &#x2013; if there's any way possible you guys could &#x2013; you at Goldman Sachs &#x2013; could compete with attracting flows from what have typically been offshore accounts?  So comment specifically on emerging market flows, and then any type of classically offshore flows and then I have a follow-up after that, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. When you &#x2013; tell me when you say what's going on with asset management, what did you actually mean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean that you guys have very strong flows. It seems you're gaining market share from somewhere and I'm trying to figure out where.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I would tell you that in the quarter &#x2013; and again, it varies. Most of our flows are still from the US, although we still have some that are coming from Asia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. There's no larger story going on here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not yet. Not yet, although, as you know, we talked about that being an area of concentration for us is growing that business outside the United States.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is not my follow-up question but an add-on to the last one.  If you look at the destruction that has been caused in the last 8-plus months, I look at the ability to attract assets in emerging markets as really a jump ball issue more than it has ever been. Would you agree with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure it ever hasn't been a jump ball because I don't think there's anyone who is entrenched enough in the emerging markets to have that big an advantage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could you then extend it to what is classically offshore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think &#x2013; in Europe, someone like a UBS who has been there for several hundred years, has an advantage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That will be different this time with the emerging markets, where I think nobody is as firmly entrenched.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. That franchise is old, it's four years old, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And my follow-up is on operating leverage in terms of how to look at the rest &#x2013; the remainder of the year in a difficult revenue environment, how you plan to deal with what could be protected, negative operating leverage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're very cognizant of what's going on in the world. We need to be extremely nimble. But at the same time, we are in this for the long term, and we think it's very important for us to make our strategic investments in places where we have to do that. Unfortunately, I hate saying this, but the biggest lever we have in any given year is compensation. As you know, compensation is two-thirds of our expenses and year-end bonuses are two-thirds of our compensation.  And that is always tied to the firm's performance and it's the biggest lever we have for operating leverage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you, David.</p>
