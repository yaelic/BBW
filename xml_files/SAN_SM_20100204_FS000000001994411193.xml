        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. We're going to begin the results presentation for 2009. I'll be presenting chapter one, which I'll speak about the basic aspects of the group's management last year. And then Jos&#xE9; Antonio &#xC1;lvarez will give you a review of the group's results in the business areas. And finally, I'll conclude with some statements about our outlook for 2010.</p>
          <p>First, I'd like to say that Santander has once again had a very good year. In this chart you can see a summary of the group's trends and management over the year. I've divided it into four major sections.</p>
          <p>First, the group's continued ability to generate high results. The soundness of our business model and the management of our basic business drivers and the advantages of our diversification are reflected in our recurring profit, that is without capital gains, of 8.943 billion, a number which should put us again amongst the top banks in the world. As well as this ordinary profit, we have obtained 2.58 billion in capital gains, all of which we have voluntarily assigned to reserves to strengthen our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>The second major focus of 2009 is our balance sheet's strength and the group's solvency. We've ended the year with a loan loss provision level, including generic reserves, far higher than what we have at the beginning of 2009. At the same time, our non-performing loans have done better than expected. We've improved our core capital ratio to 8.6% and our Tier 1 capital is at over 10%. Moreover, we have a comfortable liquidity position with a very appropriate financing structure for our business model.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, generation of shareholder value. We will allocate over 4.9 billion to pay out for our shareholders, which is 2% more than in 2008. Remuneration per share, &#x20AC;0.6, represents a return of current prices of 5.9%. We have continued to increase our shares book value consistently. We compare very well in total shareholder return over various periods. And we are the most traded share on the Stoxx 50.</p>
          <p>Fourth point in this initial summary is that not only have improved our financial variables, but we have also and very clearly improved our competitive position in order to position ourselves more favorably for the coming years. I will discuss each of these points in more detail.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, attributable profit was &#x20AC;2.02 billion, similar number to that of the third quarter, which has enabled us to continue improving our quarter-on-quarter trend. As you can see on the chart, we've began 2009 with a 5% decline in the first quarter versus the fourth of 2008, a 4% fall in the second, flat in the third and in the final quarter we have increased by 13% in comparison with the same quarter 2008, so that our profit for the whole year was 1% higher at &#x20AC;8.943 billion, which is the target we had announced. These profit levels again are all recurring and ordinary. They do not include any extraordinary income derived from any divestments. And these are profits supported by all of our business areas.</p>
          <p>First point I should stress is the diversification of our businesses. The Santander and Banesto networks represent 26% of our profits, Brazil brings in 20% and the UK 16%. The rest, Retail Europe, Global Europe and Latin America generate between 11 and 16% of our profits. Lastly, Sovereign did not bring in any profit yet in 2009, but will do so in 2010. And this diversification reinforces our cycle resilience.</p>
          <p>In this slide you can see a snapshot of the trends of the last two years. If we focus on 2009, you can see that our retail units in Continental Europe have maintained stable earnings. In the U.K., we have seen strong 55% increase, 27% on a like-for-like basis without perimeter effect. Latin America has been affected by adverse exchange rates against the dollar, but at constant rates Brazil has grown significantly in the last few quarters with attributable profit growing by 27% in the year. And the rest of Latin America is affected by our exit from Venezuela, but on a like-for-like basis grew by 12%.</p>
          <p>Finally, I will also note the good performance of global wholesale banking in the year, especially in the first half, with very strict risk, liquidity and capital management policies. These profits keep us amongst the top banks in the world. On the basis of reported figures or consensus estimates, we will remain amongst the top three banks in the world by attributable profit to common shareholders. But even more importantly, we will be the only bank that will remain amongst the top seven during the last four years. I believe that this is the best proof of our resilience and the soundness of our business model in these extraordinary complex times.</p>
          <p>As well as these ordinary earnings, in 2009 we obtained extraordinary capital gains of &#x20AC;2.587 billion with the foreign breakdown from the exchange of issues 724 million, from the Brazilian IPO 1.49 billion, other operations including the sale of 10% of the Attijariwafa Bank 364 million. The total number is somewhat higher than the one we announced in September, basically due to our sale in December of part of our stake in Attijari.</p>
          <p>Also as we stated in the last results presentation where we provided initial estimate of their application, all of these earnings are used to strengthen our balance sheet and therefore have no impact on profits. The breakdown is as follows. To the generic loan loss provisions fund 1.5 billion; for the acquisition of properties &#x20AC;814 million, so coverage is now at 32%; an additional provision of 269 million for Metrovacesa at a very conservative valuation of &#x20AC;25 per share; 260 million allocated to restructuring funds for General Electric and Sovereign; and finally, 463 million are allocated to other funds for amongst other things, early retirements.</p>
          <p>Second point to be stressed in that initial chart is the strength of our balance sheet. As for loan loss provisions, at the end of December they totaled 18.5 billion after increasing in the year by 5.6 billion. Generic provisions amounted to 6.7 to 7 billion, of which almost 3 billion correspond to Spain, 1.4 billion to the rest of Europe and 2.4 billion to America.</p>
          <p>Regarding Spain, and given the -- in this part of the cycle, there were the largest fluctuations, we have this graph showing the trend in 2009 which I'll summarize. We began the year with 3.837 billion to which were added 1.5 billion from capital gains and 1.569 million were consumed ordinarily. On this basis, we would have ended the year with 3.768 billion.</p>
          <p>But to get those 2.907 billion, there were two impacts. The release of 274 million arising from lower volume in lending and a better risk profile, in other words a release which was not due to the deterioration of our credit quality, but quite the reverse; and the use of 587 million, partly because of substandard divisions due to a specific risk classification we have to carry out in accordance with the regulator and partly as a result of applying our own very strict internal risk criteria. These funds provide wide coverage of NPLs, which have maintained good quality levels in all our geographies.</p>
          <p>The NPL ratio for the group is at 3.24%. And by geographic area the breakdown is as follows. The NPL ratio for all businesses in Spain is at 3.41%, well below the 4.5% we envisaged at the beginning of the year and which we have been lowering in our successive results presentations. Santander U.K. is at 1.71% lower because of the higher mortgage component. And Latin America is at 4.25% after a fourth quarter with hardly no change. Also coverage for the group closes the year at 75% after improving it again in the fourth quarter. In order to explain this figure, you should bear in mind that the coverage ratio, particularly the U.K.'s but also Spain's, was affected by the weight of mortgage balances which require lower provisions as they have guarantees, which are not included here &#x2013; collateral which is not included here. In this sense, the residential mortgage balances in Spain and the U.K. have an average loan to value of 52 and 53% respectively, or in other words they have additional coverage via collateral of 190%.</p>
          <p>Santander Consumer Finance's coverage reached a level close to 100% after beginning the year at 86%, and Latin America closed the year with an excellent 105%, it was 108 at the end of 2008 with Brazil at 99%; Mexico, Columbia, Argentina, Peru and Uruguay all clearly above 100%. As a result, we compare very favorably with our peers, both at the group level and then the three major geographies where we operate, Spain, the U.K. and Latin America.</p>
          <p>The evolution of NPLs in the last few years and therefore the notable rise in the cost of lending has had a strong impact on the results obtained by banks. In this graph I will explain our management of return risk and why it is so different from our peers. There are two major reasons. First, our business model and once again, our diversification, which has enabled us to manage our spreads in a way that has provided a wide and stable spread against the cost of lending measured as total provisions over total loans.</p>
          <p>Second, the establishment of generic provisions and in the good times provide stability to our income statement throughout the cycle, since their use during the lower part of the cycle enables us to continue obtaining profits and capital. Combination of both affects our business model plus our large generic provisions have meant we have been able to go through this crisis whilst maintaining a net interest income over average total assets at a level, which is clearly better than our competitors. And this is a crucial driver in the soundness and the recurrence of our results, soundness and recurrence which are reflected in the improvement of our solvency ratios.</p>
          <p>We ended the year with the core capital of 8.6% and our Tier 1 capital at 10.1%, which has improved by about 1 percentage point in both cases in the year. Improvement in our core capital is due to around 80 basis points from free capital generation, 14 basis points from our script dividend in November where 80% of our shareholders opted to receive the second dividend in shares, about 60 basis points from a positive impact on equity of the Brazilian IPO and a negative impact of the use of consolidation on our acquisitions of around 40 basis points. So, we have solid ratios which give us a considerable cushion in the face of potential regulatory changes.</p>
          <p>And here I can tell you that on the basis of the current draft which is still very preliminary, we estimate that the new Basel II requirements will have no significant impact on our group's capital ratios. I'll remind you furthermore that in any case this is contemplated for 2012. Closer than that, in 2010, our budgetary scenario envisages further rises in free capital.</p>
          <p>Final aspect I'll discuss about our balance sheet is our financing structure, which more than adequately covers the need of a &#x2013; the needs of a retail balance sheet like ours. Our solid structural liquidity is reflected in the stability of our core funding ratio at around 75%. This ratio connects the bank's most stable funding, that is deposits plus medium and long-term wholesale financing plus capital versus total assets in the balance sheet. So you can see, we can more than comfortably cover customer loans in our balance sheet, 62% in December, and we are amply above our peers' average and the target of 70%. This soundness is the result of active liquidity management, which has been always present in the group, but which we have intensified due to the difficult environment.</p>
          <p>In 2009, as we announced, we focused on deposits which have increased by 21%, twice as much as lending. With that we've improved our loan-deposits ratio by 15 percentage points in the year and 26 percentage points since 2007. This ratio is closely monitored by every bank in the sector, but there are significant gaps, first because all assets must be financed but not just loans, and second because it leaves out basic aspects such as the deposit's stability or the relation between asset and liability maturities. In our case, we have very stable funding. Over 90% of our deposits are retail and over 50% are demand deposits, with lower remuneration and greater stability. Moreover, the average residual maturity of our issues is of more than four years.</p>
          <p>As well as this favorable structural position, we have two additional competitive advantages, our ability to issue both medium and long term, both from the parent bank and from a large number of subsidiaries, and a very significant buffer available in central banks. In short, both the group and its major units have a very solid and independent structural liquidity, as you can see in the appendixes.</p>
          <p>Third point in this initial presentation is shareholder value creation and there are four major aspects. We will propose in the coming AGM a dividend charge to 2009 earnings, which will put our payout at &#x20AC;0.60 per share, which is a total of &#x20AC;4.9 billion, that's 2% more than in 2008. In addition, our book value is at &#x20AC;8.04 per share after increasing further in 2009 with a 34% rise since 2006. Total shareholder return price plus dividends is well above our competitors, both &#x2013; long, medium and short term. In all of them we are in leading positions, and specifically in 2009 we were second. Furthermore, the Santander share was the most traded share in the Stoxx 50 during 2009 with an average of &#x20AC;860 million traded per day with the total volume traded in the year of about 218 billion.</p>
          <p>So far, we have just looked at the numbers. I will be explaining briefly how one of our basic pillars, active management of our business portfolio, has enabled us to continue to improve our strategic position during the crisis in some of the major economies and especially in those with biggest potential. Beginning with Europe, I'd like to highlight the enormous leap obtained in the U.K. with the incorporation of Alliance &amp; Leicester and Bradford &amp; Bingley to Abbey's solid organic growth. Today, with full integration to be completed in the year, Santander U.K. is already the best banking brand in the country and although there still a lot to do, it is firmly moving towards becoming a full service commercial bank.</p>
          <p>We have also obtained very qualitative progress in Germany. We've completed the integration of our new businesses, moved forward in capturing synergies and are working to establish global financing agreements with leading auto manufacturers. All of that consolidates Germany as the number one Santander consumer finance unit and as the seventh country in the group by profits, contributing for the first time to our recognition as the best bank in Germany in 2009 by The Banker.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, the most noteworthy country is Brazil. Here, we have combined fast integration which will conclude with the merger of our branch networks at the end of 2010 with a solid delivery of cost synergies of 1.1 billion reals, well above the 800 million we had initially predicted. Furthermore, we have successfully carried out the bank's IPO, which have enabled us to realize the value of our franchise and obtain funds to accelerate its growth in the coming years.</p>
          <p>Sovereign is another unit we have focused on in 2009, and we have obtained excellent results. We have launched an action plan to reduce costs and risks, with a sharp reduction in non-core assets, active volume and price management, and all of it with a very positive impact on our results. In our fourth quarter, we reached break-even and generated $4 million in profit.</p>
          <p>We've also begun to adjust the structures and the businesses in order to create a real retail bank, which will sustain business and profit growth in the coming years. And the best proof of the excellent management of the new units in the year are the total synergies captured, about &#x20AC;750 million, 130% over our target. And with that, these units have broken in 2009 about &#x20AC;1.5 billion in attributable profit for the group. But in order to properly manage our business portfolio, it is not enough to know how to acquire or manage integrations. You must also know when and how to sell, and in this sense in 2009 we completed the sale of our bank in Venezuela.</p>
          <p>After this summary of the basic management drivers, Jos&#xE9; Antonio &#xC1;lvarez will tell you in more detail about the group's results and the results in the different business areas.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. As usual, I'll be discussing the group's results in business areas first, then we will look at the results by business area, and finally our CEO will explain our outlook for 2010. Our income statement is only for ordinary profits. It does not include the extraordinary results that our CEO has just reported.</p>
          <p>Additionally and as in previous quarters, we have two columns, one showing the accounting results and the other, which does not include the impacts of exchange rates or perimeter effects. I think the income statement demonstrates our management priorities which we defined last year for 2009. Our income has been growing very successfully due to very active spread management. There's been no significant volume effect except in deposits, as we will see later.</p>
          <p>Second priority in our strategy this year was strong cost management. Our costs have basically remained flat at the group level, and the combination of cost and income management has improved our net operating income which has grown by about 20% without taking into account exchange rates and incorporations. And third &#x2013; active management of risk and recoveries is the third management priority in 2009. Provisions are still growing although the increase is less strong than it was in 2008.</p>
          <p>Net operating income after provisions, up 13%, which as we will see compares very well with previous quarters and is the best example of the strength of our underlying businesses. If we compare these changes with those we reported in previous quarters, you can basically see that revenues have remained solid, growing at around 10% consistently. Costs have remained mainly flat, also very consistent. And there is a deceleration in provision growth, although they're still growing significantly as we will see later. With these three factors, our net operating income after provisions has grown very strongly from a 2% decline in the first quarter to a 13% increase in the year.</p>
          <p>If we look at each of these lines in the income statement, starting with income &#x2013; commercial revenues, net interest income plus fees, you can see a very solid performance. Fees have been harder hit in the year, as we've said at other presentations, due to the environment and our operations with securities and mutual funds. But the trend is to see fees grow in the coming year and therefore our net interest income on the other hand to slow down its growth.</p>
          <p>If we look at it by areas, U.K. and Latin America show very solid trends whilst the Europe is showing stability in a very difficult environment. The second driver is cost control, which deducted the perimeter and exchange rate effects are flat, 50.4% as compared to last year. In all areas we see the effect of synergies, like Brazil minus 3.7% in cost. Also Santander Consumer Finance with a change in the perimeter, nevertheless the costs are under control, or the U.K. where costs remain practically flat. In this favorable &#x2013; this is thanks to the affect of synergies and also business as usual.</p>
          <p>The third point that I'd like to refer to is credit quality, and I will divide this into three aspects. First of all, provisions, then refinancing and number three, the performance of loans to developers in Spain as a very specific element, which is generating a great deal of interest in the market.</p>
          <p>In this fourth quarter, we made a greater effort in provisions. We have specific provisions worth &#x20AC;11.8 billion. This increase is generalized, although it has a greater impact in Spain. The Santander Network and Banesto Network have 900 million more in provisions. Consumer finance in U.K. and Sovereign have had a change in their perimeter, which is reflected in the provisions as well. Regarding generic provisions, we have released provisions, generic provisions, basically in Spain, and therefore in the P&amp;L we have a provision which remains stable, 2.3 or 2.4 billion per quarter, although provisions, specific provisions increase and generic provisions are released following the rules established in the countries where we have generic provisions.</p>
          <p>I was talking about the credit quality and the second aspect of this, which has given rise to a great deal of interest, is refinancing. The level of refinancing of the group is very low, 0.30% of the loans of the group, but &#x20AC;2.5 billion for the year, refinancing those positions with the delinquency we reached an agreement with the customer, and we have established the rules by which we will do this. The client must pay the ordinary interest and must add additional collateral, and they have 3 to 12 months to reclassify it as ordinary. 0.58% have been refinanced, 0.2% in the U.K. and in Latin America about 0.6%. It is important to point out that out of the total refinancing carried out in 2008 and 2009, only 6.5% of these went into arrears during this period.</p>
          <p>Finally, the third part with regards to credit quality is the performance of loans to developers in Spain, but before I go into the figures of the group I do think it is important to understand what we are talking about. First of all, the market figure of total developer loans is &#x20AC;324 billion for the industry as a whole. But this does not include the developer risk only. This figure is based on the aggregate of 10, 13 accounts which each bank sends to &#x2013; every quarter to the Bank of Spain. This closing loans to resident companies in accordance with the code of activity or CNAE. And Santander's share of this figure is 31.6 billion including a series of loans of financing and activities which are not developer activities properly speaking.</p>
          <p>For example, not from developer activities we have the tourism sector, the hotel business and these back operations, the real estate operations of insurance companies, that's included in that figure. And loans to developers for new construction, the exposure is 14.6 billion. What characteristics does this portfolio have at Santander? Well, it's very granular, more than 20,000 customers. We have a very low average exposure. We have low concentration. The 10 largest risk accounts for only 7% of the total of the portfolio, the biggest for less than 2%. In pure loans to developers, that has fallen by 13% in the last two years.</p>
          <p>And with regards to the NPL rate, the 31.6 billion has an NPL rate of 5.7% with a coverage of 77%. In this slide, you will see the NPL rate for the industry &#x2013; as an average for the industry which is at 8.7%. If we look on the portfolio of developer loans, the NPL ratio is 8%. I'd like to remind you that in loans to developers, the less given default, the expected loss is 30 to 35% which compares with current coverage of 61%.</p>
          <p>Now, let me elaborate on the main trends of the group's balance sheet once having gone over the income statement, and I would say that the trends reflect our point in the cycle, just as the NPL rate as could be otherwise. Our lending activity is not growing, it remains basically flat. The volume of growth of 56 billion is from the perimeter and the exchange rate, not because the business is growing, but nevertheless we see a growth in deposits because of the higher savings rates in the countries where we are operating. The combination of no growth in lending and an increase in deposits, the risk-weighted assets remain practically flat.</p>
          <p>And with regards to the balance sheet, which is grouped there under different items, and it reflects what we are. We are a retail bank. Two-thirds of our balance sheet are loans, financed basically with customer deposits, long and medium-term issues, and liability and equity. The rest of the balance sheet reflects the activities of ALCO, and also the fact that we are managing these subsidiaries and these are independent in terms of funding and thus we have an accumulation of cash in the consolidated balance sheet.</p>
          <p>If we now take a look at the different business areas, let me start with Continental Europe where income or attributable profit has grown by 7% in a difficult environment. Gross income has grown 5%. We are controlling our costs. They have gone up by only 1%, and our net operating income has grown by 6%. If we look at the different units in Continental Europe, we have the three large retail units, the Santander Banesto, Network Portugal and the Santander Consumer Finance Business, the three retail networks. Well, Banesto as well as Portugal are complete banks and the Santander network reflects the activity of our retail network. So the retail network has no ALCO and doesn't have any wholesale activity. So, the trends are very similar.</p>
          <p>In the bottom line, what we have is basically flat profits. Of course, here we made use of generic provisions as I mentioned earlier, and this gives us flat results. In Santander Consumer Finance, there we have seen an improvement quarter-after-quarter, a gradual improvement. We have the perimeter affect of course on the top part of the account, not at the bottom, but at the end the results fall 9.2%. But taking into account the nature of the business, we feel quite satisfied by this result. Outside of the retail unit, although I'll talk about wholesale banking later on, which has had 1 billion in net profit, 33% more than in 2008, although in the fourth quarter there its results have been weaker, but I'll talk about the reasons for this later on.</p>
          <p>With regards to the Santander Network, low growth of volumes with the exception of site deposits because we were very active in raising these deposits. We're a company we want to be your bank, lending falls by 5% in the year, and managing the spreads has been the key here. And other income on the contrary has fallen. Fees go down by 25%, affected by the performance of mutual funds and also insurance. Less insurance products have been sold, and part of those resources have been transferred to other products such as site deposits.</p>
          <p>Costs remain flat since 2008. Provisions, because of the release of generic provisions, remain flat. And risk management, if we see net entries that have grown in the last quarter, we see they've gone from 134 to 234 and this is because of one single transaction, a real estate transaction. Without that, entries would be 111, therefore they would follow the trend that we have seen so far. I could say more or less the same with regards to recoveries, where recoveries, they fell 16%, but they would go up to 77% if we did include that single transaction. So, this is distorted by one single transaction during this quarter.</p>
          <p>In the case of Banesto, I'm not going to say much because they already presented their earnings. The trends are more or less the same, 2.94% NPL rate, good coverage for that. And the net operating income increases by 3%. And this coincides with Banesto's data and at the bottom line, because these write downs are done at the group level when we present consolidated figures.</p>
          <p>The Santander Consumer Finance business, you can see the credit spread going up consistently quarter-after-quarter in the past two years, and this is the main driver of the performance of this account. The costs remain almost flat at a constant perimeter, which is another driver in the P&amp;L. We improved our coverage for NPLs. Last year, we said that we would close the year with an NPL rate of 5.5 to 6% and it's 5.39%, less than we expected. And also the coverage is 97%. The volume of entries is falling significantly, and this means that the provisions over net operating income are also beginning to fall. So we are very optimistic with regards to next year. In Portugal, we see low growth, although in the estimates it has grown 8%. Costs are under control and provisions have grown, but they're also under control, and net operating income after provisions has also grown.</p>
          <p>If we take a look at the United Kingdom now, Santander U.K. closes an excellent year. The figures with and without perimeter are very good, increase of the bottom line of 55% with perimeter 25% higher, or 55% on a like-for-like basis. Very good cost control and high credit quality, which is consistent in our business in the U.K. The reason for this, the performance of the spreads, growing, good control of costs. Our cost to income is 48%, which gives us a very good management of the "Jaws". And then we have credit quality, which is much better than that of the market because of the scarce presence that we have in the segment of higher risk.</p>
          <p>The balance sheet, well, your stock, we have 19% in mortgages in the U.K. The deposit stock has grown 15 billion pounds in the year to 12%. The volume of loans to companies grew 3% and this has two components, the core segments which are growing at 12% and the reduction in the portfolio that we said we were going to do when we acquired A&amp;L, which means that the rest is falling. In UPLs, unsecured personal loans, where traditionally they've had problems, well, this segment continues to fall so we're not interested in it. The NR portfolio, we said we were going to reduce it because this is not part of the core of our activities.</p>
          <p>In Latin America attributable profit was 5.3 billion, plus 11%. Net operating income is growing without the exchange rate at 25%. This allows us to absorb high &#x2013; the kind of growth in our provisions, and the net operating income after provisions grows 19%. The trend is very good. In the quarter, we see an increase in profits and it is the best quarter in the last two years.</p>
          <p>And if we look at the different units, the retail units, I should mention Brazil where the trend improved significantly. Well, it's improving everywhere. I remind you that Brazil at the end of the first quarter is growing at 13% the attributable profit, and that's growing at 27%. In Mexico we had seen falls of more than 25%, and we ended the year with falls of only 5%. In Chile we also had falls in the last quarter, since there was no negative inflation, that has improved the results significantly which had been affected by this cause in previous quarters.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, revenue growth now more than 20%. Costs, because of the synergies, is falling at 4%. There's been a significant increase in provisions, but net operating income after provisions still grows at 23%. In the quarter, our minority interests, we have obtained &#x20AC;738 million in profit, and the unit had &#x20AC;132 million in minority interest, which turns the fourth quarter into the best quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>How have these results been obtained? First of all, selective growth. There has been no growth in lending in the year, although it's starting to grow at the end of the year. Nevertheless, we grew 11% in individuals and 14% are site deposits, two of the more profitable segments, which have allowed us to increase our spreads. And a strong cost reduction, that requires no further comment. Then number three, provisions are under control. They represent 45, 47, 48% of the net operating income, and in 2010 we are already witnessing growth in Brazil and we think that growth is going to be much greater as the country grows.</p>
          <p>In the case of Mexico, it was a very difficult year. We have obtained with a 7% decrease in GDP. Mexico, the income has been affected by the credit card business in fees and spreads. Site deposits grow at 13%, also mutual funds grow. We have a policy focused on increasing spreads. Generation of income has made us very aggressive in costs. The costs fall by 3% for the whole year. And in risks the measures that we took for credit cards in the second and third quarters of last year, well we made strong provisions for credit cards. The net entries are going down and provisions are also decreasing, and this is a trend that we hope will continue in 2010.</p>
          <p>In Chile, I mentioned this before, attributable profits 783 million, 6% more than 2008. The inflation has a negative impact, minus 8%, which is offset only in part by trading gains. The costs remains flat, when in 2008 they were growing at rates of 8%. Provisions and net entries are going down, and provisions over net operating income is improving quarter-after-quarter. In 2010, we also see good performance in all activities. Argentina, good performance. In Venezuela we only have the first quarter there, because in the second quarter, we sold the bank.</p>
          <p>Sovereign shows a consistency decrease in costs, increase in revenue, provisions remain basically stable, $200 million per quarter. And provisions, the fund for loan losses is 6%. We are thinking still that we're going to obtain profits of $700 million in 2008, which will allow us to get a return on investment of 17%. In Sovereign, loans are falling. We said that there were certain activities there that we would not continue with, basically some types of loans. So, the loan portfolio as a whole has fallen by 11%.</p>
          <p>In the slide, you will see divided into different sectors. The most sensitive one that are real estate has a high NPL rate, although we have high coverage for that. As a whole, the NPL rate following the group's criteria is 5.35% with a coverage of 62%. And we have collateral for 74% of the portfolio. So we feel very comfortable with that. For 2010, we still expect provisions of about 200 million per quarter, basically in line or slightly less than in 2009. And here we don't expect significant decreases until 2011.</p>
          <p>With regards to deposits, good news here. First of all, site deposits are growing very well and term deposits, well there we have a very selective policy. On the right-hand side you will find the explanation. The costs of deposits have fallen from 1.7% in the last quarter, and this is because of better management and improvement &#x2013; and then the improvement in the income of the bank.</p>
          <p>Finally, in corporate activities, let me refer to variations over last year with the sale of CEPSA, the charge for Metrovacesa, which are against ordinary profit, 195 million. The cost of higher rental cost is because of the leaseback here in Spain, and there are some fiscal contingencies from the acquisition of property.</p>
          <p>I'm not going to talk about secondary segments. I'm only going to talk about Wholesale Banking where we have a fourth quarter which is weaker than the others in the year for a reason, this is a customer business, a part of the business that in the last quarter was weaker, is a part that we call interest rate and exchange rate coverage. It grows at 14% in the year, and the first half of the year it was growing at 64%. Corporate Banking continues to have good performance.</p>
          <p>Investment Banking, there were very few deals there. And Investment Banking is picking up, although it's still growing very slowly. The main difference is the income for exchange rate and interest rate hedging. The business continues to be focused on Spain, Brazil and the U.K. in our traditional retail banking activities for large corporations.</p>
          <p>Asset Management and Insurance, 9% of the group's income, attributable profit is &#x20AC;400 million, bad performance in mutual funds because of the fall of the volumes although they're starting to grow again. And in Insurance, the contribution is basically stable. Of course, it depends on the resource's policy between term deposit and insurance, which places the results either in commissions or net interest income.</p>
          <p>And after this overview of the different business areas, let me give the floor back to the CEO so that he can talk about our ideas for 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Before I finish the presentation, I wanted to give you our vision for &#x2013; our outlook for this year and review our management drivers. If we look at the year from a macroeconomic standpoint, we see another demanding year for managing banks. We expect an economic recovery practically in all the locations where we operate, although with different intensity, depending on the region. The growth forecast for Latin American and particularly Brazil at the head of the recovery, followed by the United States. On the other hand, the banking business could be limited by the situation and by the imbalances in some economies, more in mature markets, which will continue to face large de-leveraging, high unemployment rates, and the withdrawal of the stimulus packages of governments and the central banks. But nevertheless, we have a better starting point for emerging markets, which should not need to de-leverage, and these will be the first markets where we will see a normalization with a pickup in volumes, lower cost of credit and upward interest rates as economies recover.</p>
          <p>In this context, Santander has a solid position that we have shown throughout our presentation, and I don't want to say much about this. I would just like to underline that we will maintain our business model intact with a quality balance sheet, well provisioned, and without capital or liquidity restrictions, in order to be able to keep on growing and generate value. We will achieve these three basic management drivers which are revenues, costs and risks.</p>
          <p>In revenues, we'll adapt our management to the conditions of each market. The drivers here are volumes, spreads and fees. As regards volumes, we will see different growth rates by countries. In Spain, limited growth in loans and higher growth in deposits. In the U.K., a good trend, taking advantage of our competitors at this moment, and also with the support of the strength of the Santander brand, the Latin America growth will be higher, more so in Brazil with two-digit figures. In Mexico and Chile, we will be recovering the previous paces. Certain on the other hand, we see selective growth, both in loans, where quality will be the priority, as well as in deposits, where we will continue to focus on defending our costs.</p>
          <p>In spreads, we will concentrate on defending spreads in those countries where we are feeling the greatest pressure such as the case of mortgages in Spain. Nevertheless, in other markets, we expect better prospects, as in the U.K. from our position in the market, we expect stable spreads and business growth, or in Latin America, where we envisage, some stability in levels of high spreads. Lastly, we expect a recovery in fees, which will play a greater role in revenue growth. This recovery will occur, we believe, in all areas from mutual funds, insurance and also from more activities.</p>
          <p>In costs, we are going to maintain our track record of continuous improvement in efficiency, thanks to two drivers, on the one hand the flexibility and adaptability of our costs to the environment and to the evolution of revenues, and on the other hand from the synergies we will continue to obtain in 2010 from integrations that are underway. In both cases, the global technology and operations model of Santander will be decisive. And this will enable us in 2010 to increase our investment in new projects that will contribute additional revenues and profits in the future, and continue, nevertheless to improve our cost-to-income ratio to around 40% &#x2013; in other words, almost 30 percentage points less than in 2008.</p>
          <p>The third driver will be very active risk management. I want to stress the group's good risk management and the success of the measures taken in 2009, which have enabled us to end the year with NPL levels lower than those announced at the start of the year in the countries and businesses which are most sensitive to the current circumstances, such as Spain, the U.K., Santander Consumer Finance and Mexico.</p>
          <p>In 2010, we will go further at the global level, extending the recoveries model used in Spain to other markets, initially the three large Latin American countries. I remind you that the model sees recoveries as a business, which requires a management shared between risks and the commercial network with substantial changes in organization, incentives, mindset, et cetera.</p>
          <p>And in the case of Spain, we will continue to reduce the purchased properties. The launch of Altamira in Santander Network and Messina in Banesto for managing and selling these assets, together with the provisions made, enabled us, after the peak reached in the middle of 2009, where we surpassed &#x20AC;4 billion to end the year, with a net volume of 2.9 billion and therefore a coverage of 32%.</p>
          <p>These measures and others in the group's various units, coupled with high specific and generic provisions, will be decisive in limiting the impact of the cycle on the income statement this year. In an environment in which we see greater stability of our NPL ratios, with some markets already stabilized or starting to decline and others still slightly higher, as in the case of consumer finance, but that is because of the greater weight of drive, although less so than those suffered in 2008.</p>
          <p>And to conclude, as we have seen throughout the presentation, Santander faces 2010 from a situation difficult for our peers to replicate. We ended 2009 fulfilling or improving our goals and results, balance sheet strength and generation of shareholder value. And we enhanced our competitive position in our core markets. And we began 2010 with six growth drivers that will help us to meet our objectives.</p>
          <p>First of all, excellent commercial positioning, giving us the capacity to gain market share and defend or even improve our spreads. Number two, a healthy balance sheet, a fit balance sheet, and very much related to our customer business. Number three, strong presence in emerging markets with more solid macroeconomic data and a greater capacity to grow in the short term.</p>
          <p>Number four, contribution from the new units in Brazil, the U.K., Germany, Sovereign, which as envisaged will help to bring the incremental profit of the new units in 2011 by more than &#x20AC;2 billion. Number five, strong generation of net operating income, which absorbs the provisioning needs in each phase of the cycle and maintain the capacity to generate profits and capital. Number six, high generic provisions and a low-risk profile as a protective shield in such a difficult environment as today's.</p>
          <p>I do not exaggerate when I say that no bank in the world has all these ingredients at the same time. All of them will make Santander a bank with a winning model and with a solid base of recurring profits.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. We're going to begin as usual with all the questions that have come in over the Internet. And we will be classifying the questions &#x2013; well, taking the questions in turn by subjects, beginning with strategy. We've included strategy and regulation together, since there are various questions about the regulatory framework. So, we'll start with general questions for our CEO and then some more specific questions for our CFO. And the first is from Arturo Ramirez.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What opportunities do we see in the restructuring to come of the savings banks, especially in lending growth, spreads, and whether we see any pressures on customer fund spreads within that growth potential?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as for the savings banks, everybody knows that there is a restructuring of that sector in the way. And all we have to say about that is that we would like it to happen quickly, especially for the benefit of the stability of the market. We are seeing pressure on spreads, on customer fund spreads, but of course those are offset by a competitive advantage which we have, the Santander and similar banks, because we're seen as being especially solvent and solid, and that offsets the greater pressure that we see. However, as we've discussed although very briefly, our view is, from our bank, from Santander, to continue to grow our deposits. And so that's going to be an area where we hope to continue growing and gaining market share in 2010.</p>
          <p>Right. As for our dividend policy, our payout policy, there are several questions that came from Nomura, <mark type="inaudible" />, we expect our core capital to grow by 40 to 60 basis points, that would bring us up to 9% in 2010, and given the limited impact of Basel II regulations, what capital levels do we think are best? And this is connected with the dividend policy, whether we're going to retain a skip dividend in shares and what is our general payout policy, capital and dividends?</p>
          <p>Right. Well, we are clearly one &#x2013; or the bank which pays out more dividends in the international banking sector. We've given you the numbers in the presentation. We paid out about 4.9 billion in dividends to our shareholders in the year, and the bank has always, and I want to underscore that, that for the bank and its policies, it's essential to maintain that policy, that payout, that dividend. So we will continue to pay cash dividends, and we will maintain it at about 50% of the profits. That's the dividend or the payout policy, which of course will be defined every quarter, because that's the Board's decision. But the general policy is that one and that's not going to change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, capital, that was the other question, right? Whether we expect to be at 9% tier capital in 2010 and do we think that's the right level for Basel III?</p>
          <p>It's really hard to predict what the best capital level is. We feel that now the capital level we have, 8.5, 8.6, or between 8.5 and 9, is really very comfortable, but of course we're all, the whole sector, waiting to see what the regulatory framework will be. We don't think that that's actually going to affect our capital ratios very significantly. We have a capital ratio now which is, as I've said, very comfortable and we think that it's very appropriate for our business model. But again, we're waiting to hear.</p>
          <p>Right now, the industry seems to feel that between 8.5 and 9 would be the right level, and our business model is a business model where our capital structure does not need to be as strong as in other businesses, which are higher risk. Our risk profile is medium low, and so we feel that our capital structure is sensibly better than it was before these two years of recession. So really, we're very comfortable. We think it's the right level, and it demonstrates our solvency and our strength, and we always hope to be comfortable in this way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Staying with capital, there's a couple of questions from Ingnasia Agy from Aspeto Santo and Matthew Synthes from Hartbank about the jump in our core capital in the last quarter. I'd just like to remind you that the Brazil IPO and the script dividend both have been accounted in this quarter, and that's why there's been that increase in our tier capital, although we announced the Brazilian IPO in the results of the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As for more specific questions about regulations, there are several questions by Britta Smith from Autonomous, Antonio Ramirez from Keefe about DTAs. Fiscal assets, why have they grown so much between June to July, but especially in the last semester? Can we provide a breakdown by items? What do we expect to be the impact of Basel III? I think that question is probably from Peter de Honn.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. For DTAs, in the last 18 months, they have risen for several reasons. One is the perimeter effect. In this period, we have incorporated Alliance &amp; Leicester, Bradford &amp; Bingley, and all of the General Electric Consumer Finance business, plus Real, plus Sovereign, and they all had some DTAs in their balance sheets. Plus in the last part of the year, there has been an appreciation of the pound sterling and the real. So the value in euros of those assets has also grown for that reason.</p>
          <p>And finally, and that's another characteristic of Spanish banks, since there have been significant early retirement programs and generic provisions, these cannot be &#x2013; are not deductible until they are used up through specific provisions. You endow them, and that generates a tax credit for 30% of that amount. Since we have done these right down to the end of the year, I forget, it's about two-and-some billion for early retirements and so on, they've also grown for that reason.</p>
          <p>As a result, Spanish banks in general have quite a lot of assets in comparison with other banks because of our accounting standards in this country. As for our generic provisions, which are very unique to Spain, and, as I said earlier, they are not trending to or cannot be deducted until they used up a specific provision. So, as you endow and grow the balance sheet, you increase this asset class.</p>
          <p>The other source of these assets are early retirements. In Spain, in order to downsize, you need to go through the early retirement route, and these are not deductible until you actually pay out the wages. So basically, DTAs, at least at the Santander, are mostly from maturity differences. They're not losses deferred like other banks in the world. That's the major difference. And they are used up in a short period of time. In fact, in a maximum of four to five years.</p>
          <p>The other question or the other thing I wanted to say is that the volume we have, I don't know whether you can see it in the accounts, but definitely in the Annual Report, we have about 20 billion in our balance sheet right now, of which current assets, those that are going to be used in 2010 by presenting the appropriate tax declarations, are 5 billion, so another 15 will remain.</p>
          <p>Of those 15, those that are not connected or which do not depend on future profits to be materialized &#x2013; that's the other condition it seems that will be included in the Basel III draft &#x2013; are approximately 11 billion. And so that leaves 4 billion, which will be deductible from capital if the current draft for Basel III is approved, but it doesn't seem that's going to be the case. Of those 4 billion, you also have to subtract the liability we have for those concepts. It's not just tax assets but also liabilities. So the net we would subtract if the current Basel III draft is approved would be just over 500 million at most. So, that's why we said that the impact on our capital will be negligible.</p>
          <p>I might have gone on for too long, I hope it's clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, because really all three questions had to do with your field.</p>
          <p>There was a question about the final amount you would subtract from your core capital. That's 500 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's three questions from Brameedeth from Dyer Quinn about the same subject. What do we think is going to happen with NPLs in Spain? When will it touch bottom, both general and lending, and also developer loans? And what do we expect from our NPL ratios?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's already been answered to some extent in the presentation, but I will give the floor to Jos&#xE9; Antonio &#xC1;lvarez, so he can give you more details in a minute. We've been saying, and we haven't changed that view, that NPLs will continue to rise in 2010 and will reach a peak probably in the middle of the year, approximately. It's really hard to predict. But around then, we think in the middle of this year, 2010, NPLs will reach their peak. And thereafter, probably they will stabilize and probably will begin to go down slightly. Equally, provisions, where there's always a mismatch &#x2013; there's a 6, 8, 12-month delay, traditionally &#x2013; will reach their peak in 2010, at the end of 2010, perhaps in 2011. At least in the second half of the year, we will begin to see a drop.</p>
          <p>As for forecasts, I think we gave some guidance in the presentation. I'm looking for it. NPL in next year, yes, where it says risk management, which I discussed at the end. We've begun the year saying that we expected NPLs in Spain to be at 4.5%, but in the various quarters, we have revised that prediction downwards. And in September, when we presented the results, we said that we expect it to be below 3.5%. Initially, the prediction was 4.5, and in fact, we've come in at 3.4 at the end of the year. So, we are slightly below 3.5.</p>
          <p>And our forecast for 2010 is to remain just slightly below 4, but of course we will revise that every quarter as we've done traditionally. But right now, and there is a lot of uncertainty. It's not hard to predict &#x2013; it's not easy to predict NPLs a full year in advance, especially right now, but we do think, in Spain, we'll be below 4.</p>
          <p>In the U.K., we'll remain probably at around 2% as we close 2009. We were at 1.7 at the end of the year, maybe because of that business mix. We are increasingly bringing in businesses, SMEs, to our mix, and that'll probably increase. Since the mix will contain fewer mortgages and more commercial loans, we expect NPLs to rise to maybe 2 or just under 2 at the end of 2010.</p>
          <p>Santander Consumer Finance &#x2013; very influenced by drives contribution. If we subtract the drive, we don't expect NPL to rise overall in 2010, but of course drives contribution is growing because the business is growing, and so the NPL level in a business, which has a high NPL model, is going to be at 6, 6.5. So stability in anything that's not drive, and maybe the total rising slightly because of drive.</p>
          <p>And in Brazil, another important unit, we expect NPLs to be stable at around 5. We finished the year at 5.3. The business in 2010 will grow strongly, as we've said. And as Jos&#xE9; Antonio has explained, when he spoke about the units, we'll be growing strongly, plus our business mix in Brazil has a lot of individual customer loan component and consumer finance component. And so we might be around that level, but it won't really change very much with respect to the numbers of 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. There's a question &#x2013; a final question on strategy and regulation from Britta Smith from Autonomous, and she says, can we discuss our potential expansion via new acquisitions in the U.K.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's nothing specific, but obviously, in the U.K., we do intend to continue to grow organically, in principle, the standard way, and we're doing so. The Alliance &amp; Leicester and Bradford &amp; Bingley integrations, especially Alliance &amp; Leicester, have given us a chance to start growing significantly in the SME market, and we will continue along those lines. But of course, we will keep an eye out, as we should, to &#x2013; for opportunities that might arise in that market, in that field. We want to turn Abbey increasingly into a full-service commercial bank, so that our business model, which is well known, to apply that in the U.K. And so we will grow basically also in corporate and SME banking, which is where we're weaker. Organic growth, basically, but we will be open to any opportunities that might develop.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Moving onto risks, there's several questions about the real estate sector. And the first, very specific, from Navith Valmonte, how many properties do we have allocated, and what is the coverage or the provision level for those properties?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. The volume is at around &#x20AC;2 billion, and coverage is around 26%. For Spain, coverage is pretty similar. It's about 60%, 60 &#x2013; 65% of the total number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And developer loans, there are several questions from Navith Valmonte again. Mil Alha Alcala from BBVA, Ignasio Sedeza from JP, and Francisco Riguel about breakdown in developer loans. Well, some questions have already been answered, such as exposure and NPL rates and coverage evolution. What percentage is land? Do we want to give a bit more detail? Jos&#xE9; Antonio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think I gave quite a lot of detail in the presentation about this. The internal makeup of the developer portfolio has not changed significantly. As time goes by, there's a lot less building going on, so the percentage of finished project versus those under construction is rising, or under construction is rising.</p>
          <p>But really, the trend is for the portfolio to shrink over time. I think in the presentation we showed that there's been a 13% reduction, projects under construction dropping, projects finished rising, and the land percentage dropping, too, in our developer portfolio. Land percentage is rising a little, however, in the acquired properties, since we are selling units &#x2013; we're selling finished units. Of course, it's harder to sell land, and so the relative percentage of land there is rising. It was 33, 35%, and now it's just over 40, 45%.</p>

          <p>There are two more questions, Santiago Lopez about expected losses in the developer portfolio. You said that it would be at around 30, 35%. And Mil Alha Alcala from BBVA who is asking about exposure from shopping centers also in that portfolio. It's very small, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I don't have the numbers at hand, but reviewing all of our portfolio, we have 23,000 customers, highly diverse in the developer portfolio, and there are a few of those projects which are shopping centers.</p>
          <p>There is a big &#x2013; is there a big exposure to shopping centers? No. There is a small exposure to shopping centers in the final, same thing with resorts and also city council developments. Those are amongst the numerous operations we have in the developer portfolio, but there's no real concentration of shopping centers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's two questions, which I think have already been answered from Latero Ramine from BS. Breakdown of the growth in specific and generic provisions by areas and in Spain? There was a slide about that. There's another about Sovereign from Mil Alha Alcala, exposure to commercial real estate in Sovereign? That's already been answered too, in one of the slides.</p>
          <p>And there's a question, Britta Smith from Autonomous and Francisco Riguel from Chevreux, and Ignasio Sedeza from JP , who are asking again about any substandard provisions and coverage levels for those? I don't know whether Pepe or whoever wants to answer and give those figures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I seem to recall that the substandard figures are around 2 billion, 2.5. I don't remember exactly, but provisions I know are over 20, 22% on average.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Javier Vernatz from Casanichen is asking this final question on risks, about coverage in the U.K., whether it's not too low? And what do we expect to see in risk-weighted assets in the country? Are the volumes going to grow and the risk coverage, basically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. In the U.K. coverage in comparison with Latin America, where we have the highest, in Spain it's the lowest because of the mix. It's basically a mortgage portfolio and so expected loss is very low. In fact what is happening, the loss from housing units sold are dropping in the last month or quarter. I seem to recall that the coverage is at 21, 22% and the spot mortgages is at 21, 22%. And so it's appropriate and we're well covered. And so you get that number of 40-some-percent.</p>
          <p>As for risk-weighted assets, here there are two factors. Growth, we expect to continue to grow at the current rate, more in that mix, but we are reducing our securities in corporates portfolios which are not part of our core business. So we have two businesses which are going to shrink these two. Our securities portfolio has dropped by 5 billion and then our corporates by 1 or 2 billion, which will offset the growth we will experience in mortgages and other businesses. So if risk-weighted assets grow, it will be only very slightly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, moving on to &#x2013; one more about risks. No, I think everything has been answered about risks. Rocky Chandra from Barclays is asking about growth of NPLs in Spain, we've answered that, developer loans. There is a couple of questions from Patrick Lee from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale asking for very specific numbers on the evolution of generic and specific provisions, which we will answer you from Investor Relations when we finish and give you the exact figures, if you don't mind, Patrick.</p>
          <p>As for financial investments, there are a couple of questions about funding. The first specific question about the need in wholesale funding for &#x2013; in pounds in 2010 and '11, are we planning any issues? Will refunding become more expensive? This is from Antonio Ramirez. And in connection with this, comment from Britta Smith from Autonomous about macroeconomic developments, about our saving ratios in Spain and whether that's going to affect our cost of funding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Starting with the final question, what we are seeing and we showed in the presentation, is that the current point in the cycle in mature markets of course because wholesale funding is for mature markets, in our case for our Continental Europe business and the U.K. business and to a lesser extent almost hardly at all, Sovereign. In these markets, what we're seeing is a clear process of de-leveraging, shown by that ratio of loans-to-deposits. We have 32 billion growth in deposits and 8 billion reduction in loans. So, that's the point in the cycle in which we find ourselves where deposits are growing faster than loans. The group has wholesale issues with annual maturities basically on average I think the CEO mentioned it in the presentation of 4.5 years, about 25 billion approximately mature each year. And therefore, our needs for wholesale funding follow these same trends. These maturities basically between 50 and 60% as parent, 20% is Abbey. You know that we manage the liquidity and capital independently in each unit except in consumer finance, as we've been discussing. Maturity 50, 60% is the parent, 20% Abbey and the other 10% Portugal and a few maturities, basically small, in Chile or Brazil.</p>
          <p>As for whether funding is going to get more expensive, we're in a very volatile market. If we compare it with just a month ago, in January we issued in the group I think it was 7 billion in issues. Right now it is more expensive than a month ago, but if we compare it with a year ago it's a lot cheaper than a year ago when you will remember it was really difficult to place any three, five-year's issues below 30 to 50 basis points. Now it's lower, but it is more expensive than a month ago. So, we are in a comfortable funding position. Cost is high in comparison with the situation before the crisis, but basically half what it was a year ago. So far, we've been managing this successfully with our asset spreads management. In almost all geographies we've seen &#x2013; we've been able to offset the cost of funding and as you've seen with the account with the growth in our net interest income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as for funding, again, there's a question from Joe Davis about deposits and expected growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think our CEO has answered already deposit growth and what our policy is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And a question also Jeff Davis is asking about the 100 billion buffer we have in the Central Banks, he says the ECB, but what is the makeup? Do we have RBS'? And same thing about the size of our ALCO portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not the European Central Bank, it's Central Banks and that includes the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Fed in the U.S. for Sovereign. It is true that in most cases 70 or 80% it would be the European Central Bank.</p>
          <p>The makeup or composition; well, there's public debt of different countries of the Euro zone, more concentrated in Spain. Some mortgage secularizations, not too many, quite a lot of DS' and ABS', and also public debt in trading. That's basically it, and I think it's a normal composition with a significant weight of ABS' and MBS', but more on the side of the Bank of England, more so than in the ECB.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second was about the ALCO? Yes, there's a question regarding the size, but Ignasio Sedeza would also like to ask about the contribution of the ALCO and capital gains or capital losses associated to the U.K. subordinate loss &#x2013; debt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>ALCO is aside a contribution to the net interest income. Well, when I showed you the balance sheet of the group, I showed assets at value of sale of the ALCOs of 79 billion, if I remember correctly, for the group as a whole, &#x20AC;79 billion. Of course not everything is ALCO, and I would say 80 or 70% is ALCO for interest rate risk. There's a part included there to comply with the ratios in Brazil, but without that, without taking that into account, we have about &#x20AC;30 billion in the balance sheet of Latin America, basically Brazil, Mexico and a little bit in Chile and Puerto Rico, and 40 billion excluding the 10 billion that I mentioned in Brazil, in the European balance sheets, out of which for interest rate risk we have the 20 billion that I mentioned. That has not changed since the previous presentation, and in the balance sheets in Europe &#x2013; Continental Europe and Banesto Portugal.</p>
          <p>And the contributions; this portfolio has a carry &#x2013; it's a three-year portfolio, it hasn't changed very much and it has a contribution of 250 to 300. I'm referring to the parent company, 250 to &#x20AC;300 million in carry a year. In the other countries it varies. In Mexico it's 7 or $6 billion with a carry of 6 or 7 billion. These are the main ones. In Brazil, it doesn't have a carry. It's an investment of the surpluses of liquidity of the bank. Its mission is not to manage interest rate risk. And in Chile there's a portfolio of 3 billion whose basic mission is to try to hedge the effect of the low inflation rate or negative inflation rate. Those are the ALCO positions that you find in the balance sheet in the part available for sale. And we don't have held to maturity in the balance sheet. We have nothing of that at the group level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Funding &#x2013; two more questions about funding. Carlos Berastain and Carlos DeGrandi from BSCH. The maturity schedule, we already mentioned that, but he also asks about the needs for refinancing, how much of that has been done? And both of them ask about the &#x2013; what we expect to happen with the net interest income? Perhaps you'd like to answer by geographical locations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the presentation following the trend, because we are a very retail bank, so the important things are the trends in the balance sheet, and we have trends of lower growth of the net interest income. I mentioned this in my presentation in Spain where we think that the net interest income is going to become weaker. Fees will in part offset that. We have a situation of net interest income, which is basically stable in Portugal. Very good performance in the U.K. We showed high expansion of asset spreads, so we do expect the net interest income to do well in the U.K. In Brazil, not because of spread reasons but because of the growth in volume, a good performance there as well.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, in a situation where the loss of net interest income with credit cards has been quite significant, we expect a growth on net interest income but not too much. And in Chile, the problem of inflation is the key with not negative inflation rates as we have seen throughout 2009. We should see an expansion of the net interest income, but inflation as we see did have an impact in minus 8% in the net interest income in 2008. Finally Santander Consumer Finance, there has been a permanent expansion from the spreads similar to the case in the U.K.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Javier Vernatz has two questions. Casa Mardared also has a question. And then we will finish with the financial area with these two questions. One of them is the cost of the leaseback of the offices in 2009, is that in the corporate center in cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's about &#x20AC;80 million, but there has been a slight change because of that concept.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And there's another question related to what you were talking about, the net interest income. It's a question about spreads. What do you think is going to happen to the spreads? And there's a question about Latin America, Brazil particularly, what's going to happen with the spreads there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think this was mentioned already when we talked about the trends. In different &#x2013; with the cost of business areas there are very few questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In Spain, Matthew Ramingen from UBS would like to ask about the fallen insurance in Spain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Spain, we mentioned that in 2008 we sold lots of insurance, so this year comparatively speaking, were we're selling less.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Joe Davis would like to ask in the U.K. about the growth stabilization or fall of the income before profits before taxes in the U.K., what are the reasons for this and what is the outlook for profits before taxes in the U.K. in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess he's referring to the fourth quarter. Well, perhaps I didn't make myself clear in the presentation. In the U.K., let me put it this way, we have two businesses, the retail bank and then the global banking and markets in the U.K. The fall in the last third quarter also &#x2013; I also mentioned in the presentation that the last quarter in wholesale banking was weaker because of interest rate and exchange rates and part of that is in the U.K. And so in the U.K. the quarter seems weaker in terms of revenue, or the increase of revenue is smaller. And we're very optimistic about the U.K. We expect to grow there. We already have five years in a row of two-digit growth, and we hope that and we think that this is going to continue in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, very well. That's the end of the questions that we got over the web. Have you &#x2013; well, I've got few more questions. If you have any more questions later on, we will answer from the Investor Relations department. But I do think we have one or two telephone &#x2013; quick questions that come through the telephone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Yes, we have a question. We have a question from Alturo DeFrias from Evolution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alturo, please, we're doing very badly for time, so please be very specific in your question because we have to finish up here in two or three minutes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very well, then. I had two questions. I'm going to try to ask these questions very fast. The first one is, why do you feel so comfortable with the risk that you have in developers? Why do you think that it's going to be 30, 35% the loss? I thought it was going to be much more. Why do you feel so comfortable about that?</p>
          <p>And number two, if minority interests are subtracted from the capital according to Basel, the IPO in Brazil turned out to be very expensive because you lose 15% of the profit and you haven't improved your capital position.</p>
          <p>And my third question, well, I'm sure it's going to be very difficult for you to answer, but if there is a down rating of the Spanish Sovereign rate, how is that going to affect your business if the rating is downgraded for Spain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Your first question 30 to 35% of loss given default on developers, well that's our experience. We already have a certain experience selling property for Altamira, and the loss is right now less than 30%, I think it's 21 to 22. This is why we say that that is the loss we expect.</p>
          <p>And with the question on minority interests and the IPO, from what we know of Basel III, what is reasonable is for the minority interest to be discounted, if they're discounted from the capital base, not from Tier 1, they will be included there. And if they are discounted, it would also be reasonable to discount their risk-weighted assets associated to those minority interests. And therefore we think this is going to be the end of the story. But of course, we need to have the final regulation to see what the impact is going to be. So first of all, they're included in Tier 1 and we think that the associated risk-weighted assets are going to be discounted. And actually, we're working with a theory that in terms of capital this is going to cost us about 40 basis points more or less, these minority holdings. And then the downgrading of the Sovereign rating, because they would affect this, because 27% of our profits are in Spain and it won't affect this in public debt. Well, it does affect you because you might lose part of the capital gains, but that won't be too much unless we're talking about default, but we are thinking of a downgrade from, well, just a notch down. So, it might have an impact on the mark-to-market because we deduct that from the capital. So, the greatest impact would come from the business dynamics because the downgrades of the Sovereign ratings are developed to macroeconomic developments in the country. 27% of our business is in Spain. We are in an economic downturn and the bank or businesses in Spain are, in these circumstances, I think giving very good results given the circumstances.</p>
          <p>We have a last question over the phone. I'm told that we have received more questions but we will get in touch with you after the webcast to answer your questions. But the question we got over the phone, please could we hear the question please now?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from <mark type="inaudible" /> from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. <mark type="inaudible" /> from Fixed Income Research at Morgan Stanley. Admission debt to capital markets, you've been ahead of the curve in terms of tendering, exchanging for subordinated issues and locking in profits on those. With the changes in hybrid Tier 1 instruments under Basel III, can you comment if there's any regulatory pressure to get rid of those in fact core dates or to tender for them? And given that these instruments have proved pretty useless in a crisis, we're wondering if the regulator is keen for these strong banks like Santander get rid of them and ultimately replace them with new loss-absorbing hybrids, Just your thoughts on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the regulator when we decided to do a tender for these instruments, of course, we asked the regulator for permission to do that because according to Spanish regulations when an issue, if you want to amortize it you must get authorization from the regulator. So we asked permission but in no case did the regulator told &#x2013; he didn't tell us that we needed to do this. This was a decision we made because thinking about the current circumstances where capital hybrids have lost part of their perceived value, given the market situation and the fact that their capacity to absorb losses in the crisis was very low, we decided to do these tender operations and &#x2013; of Tier 2 in August and now we did it for these subordinates. As the CEO said, we're very well capitalized with core capital. We have a Tier 1 of more than 10% and I think that the total capital ratio is 14% therefore it was a decision &#x2013; internal decision that we made to improve even more the quality of our capital structure by doing these exchanges and this repurchase of shares and repurchase of the subordinate debt.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you very much. I have a comment to make. The 40 basis points of impact on minority interest is for the whole group. It's not related to the Brazil operation. It's for the whole group.</p>
          <p>And so thank you very much. That's the end of the webcast, and any further questions please send them to our department and we will answer them. Thank you.</p>
