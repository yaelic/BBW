          <p>[Starts abruptly]</p>
          <p>Afterwards we will take Q&amp;A. I will only do the introduction to start with which are the key messages. And I would like to say that we are pleased to note that our focused relationship strategy once again delivers combined with our New Normal plan.</p>
          <p>So, not only do we deliver increased customer activity, lending is up, transaction's up and number of customers have increased, we are also delivering on the New Normal plan with increased efficiency in cost, capital liquidity and funding. And that combination has proven to be sound in the sense that we have built income, we have contained cost and we have built capital and we increased core Tier 1. In that way, we are of course mitigating a lot of the regulatory effect for our customers and there is more to do, but we have already taken important steps.</p>
          <p>These were the key messages. I will now hand over to Fredrik Rystedt, our CFO.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christian. I will continue in the presentation with slide five. And as you can see, we are following in 2011 and Q4 our trend of a continued good momentum in our income line. We have increased our income since 2007 by 37% and continuously strengthened our customer relationship.</p>
          <p>The relationship customers on the household side has increased by 30% in that period and we are now at the end of 2011, a clear number one Nordic corporate bank in the last survey by Prospera ranking.</p>
          <p>We look at the financial results in our income statement. We had a record high income level both for the year as a whole and for the quarter. We kept our costs flat, so in the quarter versus last year and as we have said previously in the year, the growth rate in &#x2013; on the cost level has continuously declined throughout this year.</p>
          <p>Risk adjusted profits increased by 4% year-on-year to &#x20AC;2.7 billion. The net interest income for the quarter was also a record high. It increased by 3% and we had a volume increase by 2% and the lending spreads were up in both corporate and the household sector. As could be expected when interest rates fall, deposit spreads are slightly down and the treasury interest or net interest level is approximately unchanged.</p>
          <p>You can see the impact from all of these things on the next slide. And clearly, we've had a good volume increase on the lending side, producing good contribution to profit, also on the profits and particularly so on the household deposit. The lending spreads contributed quite significantly in the quarter, while deposits, as I mentioned earlier, declined.</p>
          <p>Turning to net &#x2013; to fees and commission income, we had a fairly stable development in Q4, but at a good and high level. The assets under management increased by 5%, to a large portion by performance in the assets under management, but we also saw flow income or flow in the quarter. Lending commissions were up by 4%.</p>
          <p>The biggest shift versus the third quarter is relating to the fair value line and you can see that on slide 10, so fair value improved by &#x20AC;395 million, and of course, that was largely due to very, very difficult Q3 and also a strong Q4. What is stable and remains stable is the customer demand and the customer parts of our items of fair value. As you can see it increased slightly in the quarter at a good level.</p>
          <p>The market's unallocated part was $221 million and of course that was a result of trading conditions. We had a good &#x2013; reasonably good quarter also in treasury and we recognized some fees from the life business that we couldn't recognize in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>The expenses is a very significant part of our New Normal plan and we have executed on a lot of different activities during the fourth quarter resulting in a flat cost development pretty much for all quarters and of course also versus the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>The underlying expense is up by 3% Q-on-Q, but this is quite normal. This is typically what we see on as a seasonal effect in Q4. The underlying staff expense is down by 3%, and of course, that's a result of the fact that FTEs is down by approximately 780 people compared to last quarter. The result of the good income and of course also a good cost control is a C/I ratio now it's just below 50%.</p>
          <p>And with those words I turn to Ari.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Fredrik. Moving to credit quality, page 12. As you can see in the fourth quarter, we took somewhat higher than expected level over the cycle loan losses, &#x20AC;263 million. The losses are coming from this kind of well known high attention areas namely from Denmark. I mean shipping or actually the market development during this second half has been deteriorating somewhat further and that means that we have taken down the value of collateral, so those <mark type="indiscernible" /> (6:09) customers we have in our books.</p>
          <p>There has not been so much new problem customers in these areas so that this increase is coming mainly from old customers and reduced collateral values. We know well these areas and now also we are addressing these issues with our workout resource but all-in-all with the credit qualities solid in our books that is also shown in and of course we might have <mark type="indiscernible" /> (6:42) migration which is happening in all the countries and all the business lines except in shipping.</p>
          <p>You can see the loan loss trend in page 13 where you can see that now these both costs in 2011 they were more or less at the level of expected losses over the cycle so that in that way the 2011 was quite close to the average year all-in-all.</p>
          <p>Impaired loans page 14 you see that actually there was not a very big increase in impaired loans. Impaired loans, it was only 5% also indicating that actually there were not so many new customers coming into the growth lines, it was more or less all identified customers. And then impaired loans ratio actually, was even a little bit down because there was a growth in the lending book. But then if we take a little bit more detailed look on where &#x2013; on the various markets and where the problems are coming, that 15 is showing impaired loans divided by country here we exclude the shipping, I'm coming to that a little bit later. So you can see that actually in Finland, in Norway, and Sweden the level of impaired loans has been very stable actually in some markets they are even slightly down. In Denmark there has been a slight increase in Q4 whereas in Q3 the development was stable but the biggest increase in Denmark in impaired loans happened in 2010 actually.</p>
          <p>Next page is showing that the same information in terms of loan losses. There also you can see that in Finland, in Norway and Sweden, yes, they were a little bit up from the previous quarter but still at a very moderate level. And the loan loss level in Denmark that was also up from the previous quarter such you can see, it was moreover at the same level as we have seen now for the past quarters.</p>
          <p>Turning to some more information from Denmark on page 17 this &#x20AC;118 million losses in the fourth quarter is divided between corporate and household portfolio as you can see. Those are now with the source of the majority of the loan loss, which has not been in Denmark, the corporate segment and the SME segment, which has been problem in the previous quarters so much more household customers, which is also the case in Q3.</p>
          <p>We have made a thorough review on our household portfolio in Q3 and also in Q4 benefit that now the collateral values are coming down in Denmark to the certain extent and we have increased the loan loss provisions. Perhaps it's worth to mention is to keep some kind of context to this that what is the volume of these customers in problems on the household side. We have in Denmark 175,000 mortgage customers and 740 of them have delayed payments more than three months. So that builds volume of these &#x2013; actually volume of these problematic household customers is relatively limited.</p>
          <p>Moving to shipping in the next page, you see that just the loan losses did increase. but as you can see from the impaired loans you can say that DSOs for the impaired loans were up in the fourth quarter, but then if you take a look on the absolute growth in terms of the impaired loans where you see the figure roughly &#x20AC;70 million and actually that comes more or less from one or two individual customers that is also indicating that in a way given one customer in <mark type="ph" /> this book (10:50) quite low of figures we have had can have a impact.</p>
          <p>And then finally on the shipping book on page 19, we give a little more information how we see now the various segments, but of course it's very important to remember that other total lending it's only 4% which is in shipping so that we have to put this special pension and resources in the context there. And still even with this level of loan loss in shipping is making profit. So that we have been able to increase great margins reflecting the increase recently in this area, but most of our problems and losses in Q4 they came from some tanker market, 80% of our losses in Q4 in shipping was from the tankers, where the global demand is low as we know where there is over supply in the market in terms of new ships coming in the marketplace. And those two factors are taking down the growth rates and then even though we have a very dedicated skilled work of resources, now in this type of market environment when there is a quite limited effect for shipping assets among investors and also quite limited EBITDA among banks if you allocate the lending to shipping cost projects, it's more difficult to plan this kind of successful uplift.</p>
          <p>But still the majority of our shipping loan fees, they recorded &#x2013; they'd be allocated with these &#x2013; the lowest areas, so that's even in this type of market environment, we do have shipping segments, which are performing very, very strong.</p>
          <p>And then, Christian, back to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I will continue on capital. And as you can see from slide 20, then we are indeed building capital year-by-year and actually we have grown the capital by 9.2% since 2006, adjusted for our dividend. So actually what you can say we are more or less building a 1% core Tier 1% per year, which is confirming our profit capability in the bank. And we can also see that rating migration has been positive as Ari alluded to and see that even in Q4 we have still positive rating migration meaning that we &#x2013; our credit portfolio in general, except as Ari mentioned, is doing well.</p>
          <p>The capital position is improving notably because we managed to keep the risk weighted assets unchanged, I will come back to that a little later. We have absorbed growth and we have absorbed Basel 2.5 and still keep our way unchanged, which I think is a good achievement, which means that the core Tier 1 capital ratio is built to 11.2. And as you can see, that's nearly one percentage point in one year, confirming this capability.</p>
          <p>Funding has been strong, we have an all month &#x2013; all through the year have access to all funding markets including the dollar market. So we have not in any sense been impacted by the turmoil except from the fact that the credit spreads of course have gone up somewhat.</p>
          <p>So, we are still, one of the banks with the absolute lowest funding costs. All in all, we delivered an ROE of 12.3%, which is a good number remembering the background and the marketplace and the economy and we keep the ROE target, which we formulated during the autumn of 15% under normalized condition at 11% core Tier 1, and then the dividend in line with the policy at 40%, which is proposed to the AGM.</p>
          <p>Few words on the updates on the New Normal strategy represented in the autumn at our Capital Market Day, it is the relationship strategy and the New Normal plan and is very much about a disciplined refocus, it's about cost and capital efficiency, so we have in each business area a clear focus on this, making plans on how to deliver this, which give consequences for each segment where we actually work to change the business model to improve ROE. There is cost element of course to it, so we have a cost plan, but that's very much a capital element and very much reengineering element in terms of getting capital funding and liquidity together in the right way to the right segment and that also boils down to each customers, we're actually &#x2013; an each individual customer we're looking through exactly how and what products to deliver in order to minimize the burdens of new regulation.</p>
          <p>And the New Normal plan has delivered and I have to say I'm a little proud that we actually delivered in recent quarters on these very difficult conditions. The FTE's are down as we have decided by Q2. It's down by 1100 people and we are well ahead of the plan to reduce by 2012. So of course costs are coming down, including other cost elements also IT, and we are confident with our target to keep cost unchanged for a prolonged period of time.</p>
          <p>Productivity is going up more or less no matter how you measure it income per employee business volume, number of customers per FTE and cost to serve. The capital efficiency is worth mentioning, more in more detail, so RWA is kept unchanged so the growth is around 7 billion, we have rating migration beyond 7, lending deposits 2.5 of nearly 4 and then we have RWA efficiency gains of 5, which is very much the easy wins to start with, where we have reviewed product segmentation and ensuring that we have the right clusters to produce right quality and data. Collateral agreements have been reviewed, registration, data sourcing and also development of capital light products, which will continue.</p>
          <p>So, all in all, absorbing the Basel 2.5 and still having the same RWA's as part of the year I think is part of our plan, but also a good achievement. And in this context, it is more or less clear that this ROE circle we have one the next one, what that means, but it's a general public debate around how much banks should make not least in the Nordic area and I'll tell you this of course that if we want to run a bank, which mission is to create great customer experiences. We have to be able to secure that they can finance their plans means that we have to have the ability to lend, which means that we have to be able to build capital and attract funding at a low cost, which requires that we deliver an ROE above cost of equity, which then of course feeds into the circle with great customer experiences and more momentum and the other way around of course won't work that have too low return, will not build capital and funding cost and destroy their customer satisfaction.</p>
          <p>Now this cost of equity is of course a good discussion how big it is, but those when I need an effort there are very few below 2011 and then some even higher. So of course there is a return on requirement on European banking and it's clear that today a lot of European banks are not delivering an ROE above cost and capital. So that is of course a reason for the whole developments towards business model with you and changing business model.</p>
          <p>We are rebuilding our business model, we are reviewing it as I said segment-by-segment, product-by-product and what we are doing is in reality enhancing ROE year-by-year. So we will on from operational efficiency increase ROE year-by-year in the coming years and then the 15% target is of course set up under normalized conditions, which is some growth and some interest rate level a bit higher where it has been.</p>
          <p>So the key messages we are delivering on our plans exactly as we wanted to. We have still kept our business momentum, we are lending money, we're doing a lot of transactions and helping our customers in serving the economy and we are mitigating the effect of the New Normal for our customers.</p>
          <p>Thank you. And I think we can now go through questions. Operator?</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will take our first question from Nick Davey from UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, everybody. Nick Davey from UBS. And thanks very much for taking the time for the call. I've got three quick questions if I can. The first is on liquidity. In your disclosure which you provide in the fact book surrounding your liquidity portfolio, there's been some significant moves in the quarter, it looks like you are holding a lot more cash now in U.S. dollars and in euro as well. Could you please just talk us through a little bit around your preparations for the <mark type="indiscernible" /> Bank's (20:30) request for an LCR by currency, whether this is something which is on your minds for 2012, whether you think this will be an important theme, whether you're there or already as far as a 100% LCR requirement in each of your major currencies?</p>
          <p>The second question is on Denmark, I noticed that you're growing &#x2013; your corporate booking 2% year-on-year and clearly you have somewhat a cautious rhetoric around macro available both really, most of it's in the household segment. Could you please talk about what you're seeing on the front book with regard to Danish corporate activity or through segments you're able to grow in and how confident you feel on the asset quality of the new business which is available?</p>
          <p>And then the third question would be on interest rate derivatives where there has been quite a sizable move in the quarter and also in the year, it seems like your interest rate derivative position has doubled to about &#x20AC;150 billion. Could you please talk us through, I guess the motivations behind this, does this change at all your interest rate sensitivity which, I believe your last guided level was around &#x20AC;500 million negative for a 100 basis points of rate cuts, could you please as talk us through interest rate sensitivity and that expansion in the derivatives book? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes maybe I could start with question one and three and we'll come back to Denmark last if that's okay, Nick. the liquidity, you're absolutely right that, it was actually not only U.S. dollars in fact it was also ECB that we had a lot of funds over the year end. And of course part of the story there was that we are able to attract to lot of short term funding and we actually did that over year end. In just anticipation of or you can say precaution or prudence and we've placed that on ECB.</p>
          <p>So it was just a precautionary method and that of course pushes that liquidity buffer gross so to speak out to a very high level over the year and that's not a natural state. You were referring to the LCR implementation there I think, which is a somewhat of a different story. But the short answer to your question is we're not compliant with LCR in its full shape and form, of course there's always a possibility that the definition will change there somewhat. But as we have alluded to also on the capital market there we have a composition issue were not issued, but a different composition suited level one assets and too much level two assets in the portfolio.</p>
          <p>We've also actually provided a number what it would cost it to become fully compliant and it's actually quite a small figure as you may or may recall from the capital market there about &#x20AC;45 million. So it was more year end and precautionary issues driving that that year-end affect that you saw there.</p>
          <p>If I just take the question three interest rate derivatives it has grown considerably during the year. And if you look at it may be two comments on that, first of all it very much correlated with the interest rate development, so a decline on the interest rate side and that has caused both sides of the balance sheet, of course, to increase quite considerably. So it is actually very correlated, it's not fully correlated because there is one other factor that's also caused an impact in that credit spread in the markets like that's also increased it again on both sides of the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>If you look at the balance sheet growth for Nordea and you compared it to our Nordic peers, what you will find is that the balance sheet has in fact &#x2013; grow not that much in non-derivative so the expansion on the balance sheet is actually been quite small in the non-derivative side.</p>
          <p>And if you look at it just derivative-wise, up until the &#x2013; or the first nine months because that's the only thing we can actually compare with then you can see that we are pretty much in line we are actually on place three or something in terms of derivatives. So this is just something that is happening to every bank and it basically correlated with the interest rates and spreads. Then Danish...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that you could describe this Danish Corporate segment, there was some kind of polarization ongoing so that those customers, corporate customers who have been weak mainly in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:17) segment some real estate companies, they are not recovering, they are, let's say, becoming weaker and weaker, but then there are lots of strong corporate customers in Denmark who have strong financial positions and actually even the outlook is relatively good as strong.</p>
          <p>And naturally, the qualities that are coming from these kind of high quality customers, we are doing lot and lot more business with our existing good customers, highly rated customers, but we also taken in selectively new customers which are highly rated.</p>
          <p>We have a clear this type of our principles that what is the quality of our new customers when we take in and that is also happy to say that we have a good success also in Denmark. So that means also that in way when we take a look on the average <mark type="ph" /> PD probably before (26:06), those in the Danish corporate who actually had said quite not improving because of these issues that our business is focused more and more to the highly rated customers and less and less on these are low rated customers, so that there are still good opportunities also to grow in a controlled way in Denmark. So at least I am not concerned about the quality of this growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. That's three very clear answers. If I could just push my luck and ask for one follow-up question, please. Fredrik, on the LCR point, I remember the guidance you gave about group LCR, is there any change in your thinking about any sort of impact to the P&amp;L by the proposals bringing an LCR by currency, and if I look at your balance sheet by currency and your fact book, I mean the &#x2013; your dollar loans for example have grown in the quarter, it doesn't feel to me at least like you'd be bridging a gap on the LCR in dollars, do you think this is an important theme for 2012 or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd like to come back to that, Nick, because in all fairness, as I said, it was actually not related and if you look at our dollar funding, which is been an issue, dollar funding generally is been an issue for lots of banks, first of all it's important to note that we have had a very good access to the dollar market and continue to have that also throughout 2011 so it has been a very, very strong thing for us in general. And it's also interesting because the main theme you can see is actually the balance between U.S. dollar pure lending and the funding we're able to attract. So we have much more U.S. dollar deposit and long-term funding than we actually lend in dollars.</p>
          <p>So in that sense, measuring from more balanced approach, we're actually in very good shape. So I think the LCR issue is less of an issue, but I will come back to you later during the year and talk a little bit about the LCR definition because it's a little odd here and I don't have any good information for you at this point.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll now take our next question from Matti Ahokas from Handelsbanken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. It's Matti Ahokas here from Handelsbanken. Three questions from me as well please the first two on shipping and third on life insurance. Obviously in the shipping side, you mentioned one of the reasons that you are increasing the provisions is that the lower, the collateral values have declined in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now when I look at the industry data, it looks like the asset values, the vessel asset values have actually increased now in the first quarter. Will this mean that you will actually have to write back some of the provisions you made on this basis or how does the mechanism work?</p>
          <p>The second thing on the shipping is, is the collected provisions. What was the change in the collective allowances within the shipping sector in the fourth quarter and what's the accumulated stock of the collected provisions in shipping as of the fourth quarter?</p>
          <p>And then third one, really quick one on the discount on the life insurance business in Denmark, did you do any changes on the discount rate methodology of discounting technical provisions in Denmark in the fourth quarter? And if so, what impact did this have on the profitability? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I start from these two shipping related questions, collateral values of course, if you are lucky you can get &#x2013; something back but of course as I explained that the market is now in reality very difficult for this type of transactions. There is some appetite within the industry which is, let's say, accelerated consolidation. But then there's a quite low appetite for financiers and investors to go in. And thereby in a way that the liquidity of these provisions the older ships, they are quite core typically on it. So, that I'm not expecting so much on getting recoveries back from these provisions we have made.</p>
          <p>When it comes to collective provisions in shipping, actually, we have to remember that the size of our shipping in terms of customers is quite limited so that we don't have so many clients, which means that that what we do is more &#x2013; is going to customer-specific provisions, because we are close to customers and act there whenever there is a need. So that we do have some quite smallish collective provisioning in shipping and it was not so much changed when you entered Q4, but the main approach is this type of specific &#x2013; customer-specific provisions because we know the customers and we know when to act and when to make provisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>Sorry, if I may continue on that note, what measurement do you look when you look at the collateral values. Is it some kind of public stuff or is that the case-by-case Basel valuation or how does that work when you say that you don't believe that the transactions will actually take place?</p>

          <p>We are always asking these type of updated valuation from these kind of reliable external parties, so that there are usually for more than one and then especially when we are talking about bigger customers with bigger fleets so that I think that we have quite updated and correct values, but these type of markets values, it's different issue if you have these kind of smaller shipping companies in defaulted situation with one ship or two ships. Then of course it's a little bit different issue what is the market value of all the ships specifically if it's old.</p>

          <p>I'll answer the third question and it was on life insurance and the discount rates in Denmark. And as I alluded to shortly in the presentation, if you recall from the third quarter we actually reversed the shareholder piece we had in Denmark relating to three of the four interest rate groups that we have in the Danish life portfolio. And there has been a change now in the discount rate as issued by the FSA and that has enabled us to take shareholder fee for two of those three interest rate groups. So, the impact on the fourth quarter was &#x20AC;29 million positive, so yes the answer is it's in line with the whole industry the FSA issued new discount rates.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good afternoon just two questions please. Firstly, just on now that we know that the outcome on regulation in Sweden, can you talk about more about how Norway and Denmark are developing and how you see that affecting your ROE target if you don't get harmonization and regulation between the Nordics? And just second question just back on Denmark again, just focusing on the household sector, what would see as your outlook for asset quality over 2012, if you see continued pressure in terms of unemployment? I mean would you expect gross impaired loan formation to increase, which you said wasn't a feature of the fourth quarter increase in loan loss provisions? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah may I should take the regulation part and now that was a brave statement you think we know regulation I think that is early call. I think that French and German Finance Minister may disagree a little. I think we actually don't know the regulation and I think this is a moving target and we will stay moving for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>We know the Americans are very much out on seven-plus <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:46) and we know now that Central Europe is waiting on nine, maybe even less and certainly has postponed also on too far. So I think that Sweden has made the statement we know and it is a political statement, they certainly believe that 12 is a good number. I have full respect for that, but I also had the strong feeling that we will seek a calibration towards the common number. And actually you may remember that with T20 at Korea, I actually decided that we should have absolute one number globally I think I wanted to avoid more systemic risk and they asked financial stability forward actually to make sure that that actually happened.</p>
          <p>So I'm sure that we will get a global calibration maybe not very soon but we will get it someday and so think that once country will go a 30% higher than big neighboring countries on capital is to me simply not realistic. So I don't think we know the regulation and I think with the most recent move from Germany and France I am quite certain that discussion will be more along the lines how much can the financial sector take and they'll keep financing the economy. And we have to remember that in Europe it's only the financial sectors that can do it, the governments are not a in position to finance anything expect their own deficit.</p>
          <p>So therefore we are in a situation where this is a moving target. I also don't think that LCR is a moving target based on recent discussions with the top officials and I certainly think NSFR is highly difficult to forecast, but the most likely scenario is we will have a level playing field that will be postponed somewhat by the main effects of Basel 3.</p>
          <p>So I think we stand extremely well on 11.2% and we will not change our target every quarter when regulators say something. I think now we will stick to this target. I think it's pretty well defined and it's not difficult to see what will happen if we have to go to 12% or 12.5% or 13% to recalculate that target it's not difficult but hat only mix around the other regulation NSFR is also important which will actually also change the R and not only the E.</p>
          <p>So I think all in all we don't know what will happen and this will be moving target for the foreseeable future. We will keep to our new normal plan, we will make more efficient on capital funding and liquidity and if we turns out to be a lower ratio we will of course deploy the capital or buy back shares and if it we turns out to be a higher ratio, then we'll just build the capital as you know with the capability we have to build nearly a percent per year and we I think we are absolutely fine and then a question on asset quality. Fredrik?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps, finally, I could start. In a way there are of course positive indicators as well as many negative indicators when it comes to household outlook in Denmark. Of course, the negative indications are we see somewhat increased unemployment rates. We see some dropping in the housing prices. We see the increased amount of forced sales in the house market. So that of course, from that context it's difficult to see that there would be a very quick this type of &#x2013; there is a positive trend.</p>
          <p>But then again, we have to remember that still there was this kind of very much positive issues you're seeing in this economy, that the GDP is still forecasted to be on the plus side. The public finances are stable and strong. And thereby we believe that that some, the latter part of 2012 and perhaps we may see some kind of signs of recovery. But all in all, perhaps during the next quarters will still be relatively weak, we will gain in terms of Danish household outlook.</p>
          <p>How does that &#x2013; this scenario impact on our loan losses? It's a little bit more difficult to say. As I said that we have now scrutinized our household lending between for the past two quarters. We have to remember that and then we have seen increased number of this kind of specific loan provision from certain over &#x2013; over leveraged household customers. But we have to remember that we have also quite substantial amount of collective provisions for the household book in Denmark. And of course then when we see that the trend, this negative trend may turn around in Denmark, then, of course, we'll start to see some kind of reversal, so from the collective reserves where we have been quite prudent so far that we have not used so much of our collective reserves. This is more or less we can't give out more precise outlook in terms of our credit loss fees, but it's very difficult to see that there will be a total collapse in Danish household.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. It's Ronny from KBW. A few questions from side my, first in Denmark, did you expect any charges coming from the change or potential change in the deposit insurance scheme and if so how much? And the second question on the LTRO are you intending to take up some in the second round? And again, if so, how much? And then lastly, on the cost outlook, and you confirm your target that you look for a flat run rate, I just want to confirm that it is excluding the restructuring costs from the third quarter. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it is being changed but I don't think any of us have the number right now but it is being changed from an insurance scheme to a paid in scheme, which will be some payments in the coming years, it's not huge, but we have to come back on the number, which we don't recall right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well actually we don't think &#x2013; we actually don't know that yet, we will come back when we know more on that issue, but if we take the second question on the LTRO the short answer we haven't decided. There are things that is of course positive in the sense that pricing is an attractive &#x2013; is attractive in that program and there are a couple of negatives first of all of course Nordea is a bank that is attracting significant and good funding from a lot of other sources and we have historically refrained from Central Bank funding. So that has been our general stance and we don't actually need it.</p>
          <p>And the third issue is of course we're still not 100% familiar with what kind of collateral will be allowed by the Central Bank for instance. So we haven't actually taken a decision, the only reason why we would want to do that is of course just for financial reasons, it could be such as financially. But we haven't yet decided. As you, the third question was a cost outlook and I can just confirm that it's excluding the restructuring.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So basically we're looking at, I mean, say, &#x20AC;5.1 billion for 2012 as you talk?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one last question if I may, in terms of de-risk rates, I mean you've done a great job bringing down your risk-weighted assets of setting regulatory impact. And you also helped still by a positive migration in the book. Have you run any sensitivities that you can share how this migration might change for the current book with a deteriorating kind of GDP outlook? What's the sort of sensitivities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have this kind of specific information &#x2013; I will not give that of course. We are running definitely <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:25) on various portfolios where we see these type of actual risk of weighting &#x2013; negative weighting migration.</p>
          <p>Then actually what would be &#x2013; we have not found this kind of meaningful outlook for the whole portfolio we have been more selective and thereby in a way that's not information I could now hand over to you that the amount would be for example, of course I would say that if there's a one that down rating for the whole book, what would be the impact on risk-weighted asset, but that's not so meaningful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well if you could share that that would certainly be interesting probably to most people on the phone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes but I &#x2013; I mean if you just look back in time maybe of course we've had a positive migration for 2011 and some negative 2009. So, of course, there is nothing that I would suggest a significant deterioration. So it's more the flattish, but we don't actually give forecast and of course it will depend on the macroeconomic development. And you have the historic numbers. So in the very severe year of 2008 and 2009 you saw the impact was clearly less than 10% in a very, very severe scenario. So, you actually have the sensitivity pretty much already.</p>

          <p>We will now take our next question from Chintan Joshi from Nomura.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Sorry I've joined late so I might have missed if you've already answered something. Christian, I wanted to take you up on your answer regarding recalibrating the ROE to meet the new regulation. Would I be wrong in thinking that if, say as we didn't did have a higher capital requirement then you would just price your products to meet your ROE target or is that viable in the current environment? So rather change your ROE target you change your pricing. That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is on Norway margin outlook, how should we think about margins developing there going ahead particularly on the household side?</p>
          <p>And then the third question is on your coverage ratio at the group level, it's been run down gradually now since 2009. And relative to your peers, it does look like a trend in run down. I'm just wondering if we have come to our inflection point where you'll need to build up the coverage ratio from here on. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The re-calibration I talked about was to get a common level of core Tier 1 ratios in Europe, and if we have a situation where it would be higher than 11, then we probably have to recalculate the target since we will not do that every quarter when regulators say something and you are right, there is a lot of pricing dynamics in this. There is a lot of regulation dynamics as I mentioned specifically NSFR is one that I think is being under question now in a way that we have to see how it spells out. So of course our funding costs comes into business volume.</p>
          <p>And so the dynamics means that it's more difficult to really calculate our target than just doing it by sort of rule of thumb by a lot of dynamics in this. So we will not change the target every time, I think the one we have done in the autumn is quite clear and will now stand until, we think of the regulation gets clear enough to redo it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But what would if the core tier 1 requirements are to be set at 12% or higher, would you still &#x2013; would you need to bring your ROE down or should &#x2013; could I assume that you'll still aim to target a mid teens ROE?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That depends the ROE or the Core Tier 1 ratio in the other countries because for that to work on different Core Tier 1 ratios and there is calibration that will come out different in the different banks and that of course doesn't make the dynamics of this. So this is a more complicated issue, so it requires we actually know where this ends up in our main -- the conscious countries where our main competitors are situated.</p>
          <p>So this is not very easy and it's also so that we have competitors in other countries where we are working with lower ROE &#x2013; with lower core Tier 1 requirements specifically and that is also making it more problematic to my calculation. So I think we simply have to say that we don't know yet where the Core Tier 1 will end up in Europe in the coming years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, should we take may be Norway your question was relating to the margin development in Norway and as you can see we had a pickup in margins in the household sector as your question related to in the queue, the fourth quarter and of course we believe that margin should continue to increase whether that will actually happen is a matter of competition and of course also funding cost, et cetera. But you can also see that margins are still relatively low in Norway. So again, it's difficult to forecast but of course we're striving to continue to increase the spread, interest rate spread.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I just extrapolate the current trends NIBOR is falling, mortgage rates aren't being cut and the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (49:18) was telling us that NIBOR should continue to fall further. So it all points towards the nice development, am I reading that correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think just because NIBOR is falling doesn't necessarily indicate a higher margin. As you know of course the margin is on top of LIBOR or NIBOR or whatever it may be, so it wouldn't necessarily &#x2013; I don't think it's possible to extrapolate &#x2013; it's 14 basis points in the quarter, so I think it's actually quite difficult to extrapolate that kind of development. As you go forward I wouldn't do that.</p>
          <p>Of course, we're always striving to ensure that we get a fair pricing and funding cost in general has increased and of course the capital requirements are increasing, et cetera. That is the case for all banks and all competitors in Norway, so fair pricing would indicate contingent margin increases and that's what we're striving for that's actually extrapolate that I would not do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I then move to your third question related to these loan loss coverage ratio, our loan loss coverage ratio, what usually happens when the downturn starts is that at least how we behave is that we start to build up these kind of collective provisions when we see that there will be problems in certain portfolios before we see these specific customers, where we start inter loans and then when the downturn continues then we feel more sophisticated okay what other customers and what is the more this can precise need for provisioning and thereby we are reducing collective provisions and moving those to individual provisions and this is more or less the normal behavior, which is fully okay at least from my opinion.</p>
          <p>Then again that &#x2013; one that's kind of more specific issue is that then if you take a look on our shipping coverage ratio, they are quite low, they are around 33 or something like that which is now in a way that shipping ocean of our allowances that has increased with the currently low coverage ratio, but that is also very natural because shipping lending is from the outset fully collateralized. And then thereby, the need of this type of higher coverage ratio is perhaps lower than in other parts of the portfolio.</p>
          <p>When this changed back to this type of, let's say, high-yield coverage ratios, difficult to say but this is usually what happens in this type of economic cycle.</p>

          <p>We will now take our next question from Sofie Peterz&#xE9;ns from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, and thanks very much for taking my question. I also had three questions.</p>
          <p>My first question was around asset quality in Finland, when I look at your NPLs quarter-on-quarter, they were up over 30%. But when I look at the loan loss provisions, they're almost stable. They only increase from 11 basis points to 13 basis points. Could you just explain what I'm missing?</p>
          <p>And then, my second question is around the Baltic loan loss provisions. They increased or they almost quadrupled in the quarter, and I was just wondering how I should think about that asset quality in the Baltic and do you expect the asset quality in the Baltic countries to deteriorate further?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, in terms of shipping with the overall collateralized values, are you asking for additional collateral from your shipping clients and also you mentioned that you have quite &#x2013; or you don't have that many shipping clients, do you, what kind of your largest exposure in the single group in the shipping industry? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think that I should start &#x2013; actually when we got this same question related to Finnish impaired increase a little bit earlier, and that is we have to begin that with more precisely because according to my information actually there is hardly any increase in the shipping, in Finland finish impaired loss, not at the gross level, not at the net level, so that we have to clarify this that I guess that you are comparing with the Q3 back to again Q4, but I don't recognize this increase myself, but we simply have to come back to this issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes it's from the fact that....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes it's in line with actually the asset quality is strong and it has not deteriorated. So that's in a way the reality. But I know the Baltics, yes, you're right, so that loan loss is increasing Baltics, but at least remember that in absolute terms, the loan losses were &#x20AC;12 million in the fourth quarter in Baltics. So that actually is a very small absolute amount and that can vary a lot between quarters, so that I would not say that this is an indication that now we see the next phase of deteriorated as a quality in Baltics. This increase in Baltics nevertheless is what we are talking about, the small amount that came from some household customers in Latvia and Lithuania and then few of these type of old corporate problem cases where also we have to increase a little bit our loan loss provision because the value of collaterals, they were down.</p>
          <p>Your third question related to shipping and can we take additional collaterals from these customers in growth lines, that maybe a little bit difficult because usually we &#x2013; when we grant a loan, we take all the collaterals there are which is asset-based lending we have of the shipping companies. So that usually, there is hardly any additional collaterals available, of course. Our &#x2013; this type of action always is when we identify a customer with potential risk customer in early enough than actually of course we are trying to get it in all what we can and improve our risk position with all means available. But usually perhaps this is not the source of additional security that can end in more collaterals.</p>
          <p>Then your last question was, was it so that what our biggest shipping client &#x2013; can you repeat that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I was wondering what your kind of largest exposure to single customer is in terms of equity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we don't &#x2013; because we have such a limited number of customers, it perhaps not prudent to give this type of information. But as I said that we have relatively limited number of customers especially those customers with little bit more meaningful volumes so that &#x2013; then of course perhaps that's an indication.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>We will now take our next question from Fridtjof Berents from Arctic Securities.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. I was just trying to pick up first the debate about the moving target, regulatory wise. It's for Mr. Clausen &#x2013; for me it's not a big question if it's 10% in France, 13% Sweden, so on, I will expect to get some cheaper funding for that over time, but my biggest worry is that, we really have no clue what's &#x2013; how they treat same exposures in different banks in our B models. And I just wonder how you see that from industries perspective that is very difficult to have really good idea about how the risk-weighted assets are measured on similar basis between banks within exposures that are similar?</p>
          <p>And my second question is, if you follow the debate in Norway regarding capitalization, it's obviously just quite hard pressure on the banks currently meaning also that we are in a period now where possibilities for picking up and taking more high margins, I would guess. So in that respect, how do you see that from your perspective, disciplined here or attempted to take market share in that perspective? Okay, thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay I can answer through the questions, just briefly first of all, of course, it's our absolute opinion that risk should be valued in terms of risk-weighted assets in the same way regardless of what kind of bank we're dealing with. So if you look at Nordea, at least now I think actually now and historically, we've had in comparing to at least some banks for the same loan loss history, we've had the high risk rates, may be partly because of, of course, the fact that we are exposed to quite a few different FSAs. So, in that sense, that may have impacted that negatively. But we fully share what you're saying there that there should be an equal treatment of risk rates regardless of where you are.</p>
          <p>So I think it's also the ambition to some extent by different FSAs to achieve that and hopefully there will be normalization over some period to come. Then the other question on the capitalization, you're right, I think it's a &#x2013; as it is the case in Sweden, a harsh discussion and debate in Norway as we speak. And of course we would strive, as I alluded to before, for fair pricing, taking regulatory changes in to consideration. Having said that, it hasn't actually happened in Norway yet. So, it's actually quite difficult to anticipate any sort of immediate change based on capital requirements like that until it actually takes place. Just generally speaking, of course, as we have claimed or said many times, our ambition is to achieve a satisfactory return on equity and not necessarily hunt for market share.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could I just follow up there, if you were in the FSA in UK gave the different banks a portfolio that the banks needed to run through their models and giving the risk-weighted assets on this different portfolio. If such a portfolio was given to you by the Swedish or Nordic FSA, would you be interested in also having such a portfolio &#x2013; numbers given out, so we could as analysts see the different numbers that a models we're giving, so we had to have a better feeling for which model were harsher than different model and other model and so on?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a very theoretical question, I'm not sure if you want to add Ari, but I think it's very theoretical question. As I said principally it's our perception right or wrong without actually having the ability to fully verify it, but of course it's our perception that we have high risk weight in comparison. There are many reasons for it, there are model parameters and other things, and as I say maybe we deal with plenty of stakes. It's an interesting &#x2013; I think what you're proposing is very interesting I think in practice. It's pretty much difficult exercise to some extent, but I think it needs to be done within local FSAs. They have more that ability to actually do that and to adjust for differences that may be hard to compare.</p>
