        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon and welcome to this conference call. I'm going to let Didier Valet, our CFO, to present in detail our results for the second quarter and first half of this year in a minute. Let me just say a few words in introduction. Clearly it's not a surprise, as you know, the environment remained difficult during this first half in the form of a persisting financial crisis, slowing economic growth and the spillover of the property crisis.</p>
          <p>Against this difficult backdrop, our retail banking activities performed well, with revenue growth of 7.1% on a like-for-like basis, and excluding the Euronext capital gain, versus last year. This increase can be attributed to the continued growth of our client base and our strong presence in countries combining both the solidity and strong potential.</p>
          <p>In our Asset Management business, which was, if you remember, impacted by the crisis and where we took in the first quarter of 2008 significant measures to ensure the liquidities of our dynamic money market funds. We have a second quarter, which shows improvement. These initiatives have paid off and we currently only have very limited residual outstanding assets in monetary dynamic funds, &#x20AC;3.4 billion, which are liquid at more than 75%. And we did not book any additional write-down this quarter.</p>
          <p>For Private Banking and Securities Services businesses, confirmed their momentum. Overall, Global Investment Management and Services generated a positive contribution of &#x20AC;107 million in the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>Corporate and Investment Banking, and the last important businesses, confirmed the enduring nature of its kind franchise in a very unfavorable environment. Client net banking income rose sharply versus the first quarter of 2008, plus 31.3%, and was down by 11.2% versus the first half of 2007, which was, as you will remember, a very high comparative base. Trading activity was satisfactory, generating almost a third of our half year revenues in this division.</p>
          <p>With regard to our exposure to asset classes at risk, we have strictly complied with the FSF recommendations, and they are collated &#x2013; we collated them in the supplements; you have full detail on that.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I would like to highlight the solidity of our capital position with a Tier One ratio in Basel I of 8.1% at end of June; 8.2 in Basel II, it is above our 8.0% target. And the core Tier One ratio of 6.5% in Basel I; 6.6% in Basel II terms.</p>
          <p>Let me now hand over to Didier for the presentation of our detailed results.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric. Good afternoon. I would like, on page five, to commence with the first half '08 results for Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale Group. Starting by pointing out that these results, of course, are being compared with H1 '07, which was a very high comparative base achieved in a quite difficult &#x2013; quite different market environment. And also mentioning that the first half '08 we are impacted by substantial non-recurring items that are detailed in the appendices.</p>
          <p>So for that, we will now commence with the sales performance of each businesses on an underlying basis, rather than on the previous basis. If we look at the half year net banking income for the Group, it stood at &#x20AC;11.3 billion, down 14% on a like-for-like basis compared to last year, and we stated for the non-recurring items that amounted to &#x20AC;1.2 billion. Net banking income would have been almost stable compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses for the full Group increased by 2.2% on a like-for-like basis, which reflect on one side the Group's ongoing investment in Retail Banking, Financial Services, and Private Banking, where we continue to recruit people to open branches, combined on other side with a tight cost management in the businesses which were affected by the crisis.</p>
          <p>As a result of this increase of the cost base and the impact of non-recurring items, the cost/income ratio of the Group for the first half stood at 70.9%, an increase by more than 12 percentage point compared to last year. But the sole naturalization of non-recurring items will lead to a cost/income ratio almost stable compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Regarding the cost of risk, I will comment on next slide, but you have an increase to almost &#x20AC;1 billion, which came for big part from the net specific exceptional location that we passed in the first quarter. And so other results, the Group net profit reached &#x20AC;1.74 billion, down 45% compared to H1 '07. The return on equity was 12.3% for the first half.</p>
          <p>On the next page, page six, a focus on the evolution of the cost of risk. We should mention that the cost of risk this quarter is clearly under control. Starting with the French networks, you can see that the modest increase by 1 bps, at 28 bps, compared to last year. The cost of risk remains stable and low. We don't see, at this stage, deterioration of the environment in France, and we're quite pleased with the mix in our businesses. You have to bear in mind that the income of property exposure or realty exposure of the French market is very safe compared to what you can find in other Anglo-Saxon countries, especially.</p>
          <p>International Retail Banking business, again, 1 bps increase. In fact, the performance is even better, because if we were to look at the same scope than last year, so excluding Rosbank, which has been included in our scope as from the 1st of Jan, the cost of risk excluding Rosbank would have been only 35 basis points, so a decrease compared to the 48 bps of last year. And Rosbank has a cost of risk which is slightly above 100 basis points, is totally in line with our expectations, regarding the mix and the country it is operating.</p>
          <p>On the Financial Services, 120 bps compared to 88 bps last year. This reflects again a one-time change that's come from consolidation. As compared to last year, we have now in Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale Consumer Finance the inclusion of the two Brazilian activities that we bought last year. And on the other side, we have also the dynamism that results from the development of SG Consumer Finance in emerging markets, especially in Central and Eastern Europe, which leads to an increase in the cost of risk, but also where we also are able to price much higher margin, which are compatible with these cost of risks.</p>
          <p>On the CIB, a last word, as you can see, last year we were making some write-backs of &#x20AC;31 million. We said that at some point it will end. This has ended in '08, and so we passed a new allocation for &#x20AC;77 million this quarter, an equivalent of 34 basis points, which is an ongoing normalization of the cost of risk. So as a whole, the Group cost of risk stood at 43 bps in the second quarter of '08.</p>
          <p>If you looked at slide seven, as I mentioned, the net profit of the Group stood at &#x20AC;1.7 billion. There is a robust base within this 1.7 billion, coming from our Retail Banking activities. So the French Network, International Retail Banking and Financial Services, which account for &#x20AC;1.4 billion of net profit, up almost 8% compared to last year. As Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric mentioned, GIMS division has come back into the black after the depreciation that we passed on the Asset Management division in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>And if CIB is modestly negative, this is mainly coming from the important non-recurring items that I will comment later. So overall, a very satisfactory performance. If you were to exclude all non-recurring items which impacted CIB, GIMS and the Corporate Center, where we booked a capital gain this quarter of &#x20AC;262 million on BankMuscat sale, the net profit would have been around 2.2 billion, equivalent to a return on equity of close to 16%.</p>
          <p>On page eight just to comment <mark type="audio gap" /> at the end of June, as Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric mentioned, so it stood at 8.1% under Basel I, 8.2% under Basel II, with a strong core Tire One component in both referential. What we can say that, the hybrid capital share or part of the total Tier One is limited at 19%. I remind you that under the French regulation, we have a maximum of 25%. In term of capital management, we have decided to neutralize the restricted share that we have granted to the staff this year. But we will not neutralize the valuation coming from the share employee plan, as well as the stock option. And last but not least, let's say we believe that the Group is well on going forward to reach the target of 8% for the full year.</p>
          <p>If we now have a look to the slide 10, which is a comment on the net banking income of each core businesses. There you can see that Q2/Q2 the strong base coming from the Retail Banking and Financial Services that deliver an increase of 6.1%, which is coming mainly from the strong performance achieved by the growth drivers International Retail Banking and Financial Services.</p>
          <p>GIMS already commented, the decrease of decline is limited to minus 6.3% if you adjust for the 164 million capital gain booked on Euronext sale last year, which is a commendable performance given the difficult environment for the Asset Management activities. And on the Corporate and Investment Banking, if we were to exclude the 1.2 billion of non-recurring items, the revenues Q2/ Q2 would be down by only 1.9%, which is a very sound performance. On the Corporate Center, already mentioned that we will bear a capital gain on the sale of BankMuscat for &#x20AC;252 million.</p>
          <p>On page 11, I would &#x2013; with some importance that in line of current environment where we have marked revisions of the economic growth forecast for developed countries, especially in the U.S., in the U.K. and Spain, and also questions on the increase in the risk coming from the real estate and Retail Banking markets are of the same country U.S., U.K. and Spain. It was important for us to reiterate the key elements of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale Retail Banking strategy.</p>
          <p>In Western Europe and developed country as a whole, we only have the Retail Banking network operation in France, which is a stable market. I mean to say, with retail growth on the medium term, economic growth, but which today appears to have better fundamentals than other countries. Also over the last ten years, this business, French Networks, has delivered revenue growth of close to 4 to 5% a year with record approaching GKs.</p>
          <p>At the same time, for the last ten years the Group has launched an expansion strategy which focused on building strong position in countries with high potentials. We have achieved that through acquisition of leading retail banks in permitting markets, to mention, Romania with BRD, Czech Republic with Komercni Banka, Egypt with NSGB and NIB Bank and Russia, of course, with the acquisition of Rosbank this year.</p>
          <p>As an alternative route &#x2013; an alternative direction or way to expand in these countries to retail networks, what's the financial strategy? When some countries where we believe these are the projects too high or where the market share available for sale was too small, we have decided to expand and consider lending. Just to take again two examples, this is a way we have decided to expand in Poland through the acquisition of Eurobank and in Brazil through the acquisition of Banco Cacique and Banco Pec&#xFA;nia. Overall, we do consider that Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale is particularly well positioned in the current more challenging environment thanks to, on one side its robust platform in France and also strong presence in countries with high potential.</p>
          <p>Let me turn now to French Network on page 12. The performance this quarter was good in term of both activities and revenues. If we look at the catalogue franchise, it has continued to grow with 23,100 net new accounts opening, more than 120,000 over the last 12 months, taking the total number of personal current accounts to 6.3 million as a total.</p>
          <p>In terms of commercial activity, the Life insurance group, for example, did performance well, totaling 2.3 billion in the second quarter. Obviously, this was lower than the second quarter '07, minus 4.1%. Basel performance is better than the one achieved by on average the bancassurance industry, which has reported a minus 8.1% decrease compared to last year. In term of mortgages, the production new business was high at &#x20AC;4.1 billion, declined by 7% Q2/Q2 and 4% H1/H1.</p>
          <p>Turning to the business customer portfolio, it has continued to expand. As you can see, we've been able to build more than 1,000 new relationship with prime SMEs compared to a little bit more than &#x2013; 900 last year. And the synergies with CIB continue to generate significantly higher revenues at 28% on activities like exchange rate hedging, development or lending to local development authorities. Overall, we should mention that the corporate loan book has continued to increase by 18% Q2/Q2.</p>
          <p>It is important to notice that this commercial momentum has been achieved against the backdrop of the challenging market conditions for the French retail market as a whole. On one side, all French banks have to face the increasing dilutive effect of book saving rates which is 100 bps in '08, 50 bps in February, and 50 bps additional in last week on the 1st of August, and I remind you that last year there was also an increase by 25 business points. We do estimate that this increase for this year will cost us approximately 3 percentage points off net banking income growth.</p>
          <p>On other side, the second impact on the whole banking industry is the sluggishness of the stock market, which has had negative impact on the financial conditions, which for the quarter have reported a decrease by 13.5% and the decrease is 10.4% H1/H1.</p>
          <p>Overall, this environment which is less favorable than in the past has resulted showing revenue growth for the quarter, excluding bank sale and excluding the capital gain on Euronext, of 0.9% compared to last year, and the cost/income ratio stands at 65.3%. This condition will continue to weigh on revenue growth at the French Networks in '08, and we do you expect an increase of the revenues in the 1 to 2% range excluding PEL/CEL and the Euronext capital gain.</p>
          <p>If we move now to page 13, just to illustrate or to highlight the good performance of our International Retail Banking franchise. This good performance reflects the success of the business model that combines calibrated organic growth and targeted acquisition. We have taken in this slide the example of five countries where we have some leading franchises, Czech Republic, Romania, Russia, Egypt and Morocco. Why these five countries? Because they enjoy strong growth, between 4 and 8% on average over the next four years, and you can see that on average these countries should grow by 7% in '08 compared to '07. The debt level are under control for most of these countries and there is a very young population, 60% of the population in the five countries is below 30 years of age.</p>
          <p>The chart of the table illustrates the rapid expansion of our five entities in terms of momentum, top line, evolution of the cost of risk and level of return on equity. And you can see that we have been able over the four years to increase the customer base by 1.8 million individual customers, to opens further 824 new branches, 25 in Romania, but also we have strengthened the networks in the other four countries. And the outstanding loan was up on average by 30% per year.</p>
          <p>This commercial momentum has been accompanied by a vigorous risk management. As you can see in the table, on average for these five subsidiaries the cost of risk was 33 bps for the period. I remind you and we confirm that a second time that we do estimate on average that International Retail Banking the cost of risk should be between 60 to 80 bps.</p>
          <p>Let me now move to the Consumer Lending business, which has also a strong growth driver and is well positioned in numerous countries. If we look at the development model of this division, we started from 30 bases in France, Italy and Germany. And in these major countries we are looking for partners that will enable us to reach a broader customer base. It is, for example, what we had done three years ago, a mutual partnership with Otto Group in Germany, and it is what we are changing the process to achieve through the recently initiated exclusive negotiation with La Banque Postale in  France to be a joint venture.</p>
          <p>As part of these major countries, we have a strategy to expand through greenfield operation of small acquisition in countries, emerging markets with a huge potential and we have taken three example; Russia with RusFinance, which was built organically and then strengthened by through acquisition; Poland, where we bought Eurobank three years ago; and Ukraine, where we had started greenfield two or three years ago. So slide show that the high figure for growth in outstanding loans and lending in these two countries are quite impressive, with total consumer credit outstanding increasing by 160% between end '05 and mid '08.</p>
          <p>This growth is not achieved at the expense of risk management. Firstly that SG Consumer Finance is benefiting from an important geographical diversification of its operation that protects us from being dependent one country. Secondly, we have a strong experience in term of current system that we are able to export and fully grow in new acquisition of greenfield operation. And last but not least, we have also a strong know-how in term of debt selection, which a key element in this activity.</p>
          <p>If we now look to the second quarter results of both International Retail Banking and Financing Services. International Retail Banking has continued to deliver a strong commercial performance, with additional more than 800,000 new individual customers over the last twelve months. This is on a like-for-like basis, also excluding almost 3 million customers that we have through the acquisition of Rosbank. As you can see, the increase in customer deposits and customer loans remained strong. And so, overall, the net banking income of International Retail Banking did increase by 14.2% on a like-for-like basis and more than 40%, including the change in scope of consolidation coming mainly from Rosbank. The cost/income ratio has improved at 67.3% and the return on equity was high at 38% in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking at the Financial Services, there we have specialized financing, which encompass to the consumer lending business and business finance. They have increased about 13% on a like-for-like basis Q2/Q2 entity business and 20% on a Q1 basis. The cost/income ratio stood at 58.5% and the return on equity was high at 17.5%.</p>
          <p>On the insurance business, as you can see in life insurance, there was a premium growth despite a less favorable environment. We have disclosed, for the first time, the embedded value of our life insurance business in France, which stands at &#x20AC;3.2 billion at the end of '07, and the increase in revenues was limited to 2.7% due to the poor market environment.</p>
          <p>If we look now at slide 16, and returns through the Global Investment Managements and Services, starting with Asset Management.</p>
          <p>Asset Management did book or did record this quarter net outflow of minus &#x20AC;2.7 billion. This came entirely from the dynamic money market funds outflows minus 2.3, which is much lower than in the previous quarter, as well as CDO minus 1.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, on the other side, and it's important to mention, we have been able to record inflows of plus 1.3 billion in equity product and plus &#x20AC;1.6 billion in more traditional money-market funds. The results of these outflows and of significant valuation affect versus last year, a total of 54 billion of ForEx and market effects. Assets under management stood at &#x20AC;309 billion at the end of June. Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric did mention that. The residual dynamic money market outstanding reached 3.4 billion. It was 11 billion at the end of '07 and we didn't book any further write-downs in the P&amp;L this quarter.</p>
          <p>The net banking income of the Asset Management division is down minus 25% on a like-for-like basis, reflecting on one side the decrease in the average asset under management and also more limited performance commission booked this quarter.</p>
          <p>If we move to page 17, there we have a continued good commercial momentum and new market outreach for the SG Private Banking franchise. We had very strong inflows of &#x20AC;2 billion, it's almost 7 billion on the last &#x2013; for the last 12 months, which is an accumulation rate of almost 10% which is quite high, so 11% for the quarter but little bit less than 10% for the last twelve months.</p>
          <p>Asset under management reached &#x20AC;72.2 billion. The decrease is entirely due to market effect compared to last year. During the quarter also, SG Private Banking was able to sales opportunities and we have let's say bought some &#x2013; stake of 38% &#x2013; 37.7%, in Rockefeller Financial Services, which is a way to be with a partnership with a strong firm active in family for ultra high net worth individuals in the U.S. and thanks to this partnership we will be able to expand in the U.S., but also in Europe going forward.</p>
          <p>We have also launched new initiatives, strengthening on one side the partnership between SG Private Banking and the French Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale network. Just an example, we opened regional center in Bordeaux and we will soon open something in Marseilles to strengthen the tie between the two business line. Also in U.K. and in Japan, we continue to open regional offices.</p>
          <p>The gross margin remained high for the division this quarter at 113 basis points, compared to 115 in first quarter and 114 on average for last year. Due to the solid performance of the credit activities and the credit activity and the strong performance of our treasury business. There was only a moderate 3.6% increase in net bank income compared to last year, due again, as I mentioned, to the negative valuation and ForEx effects on the assets under management over the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>If we move now to page 18 on the Security Services and Online Banking division. There was a sustained activity in development, starting with the custody and the fund administration. You can see that we continue to have an increase over the last 12 months of both assets under custody and assets under administration. We have consolidated over &#x2013; in the first half Capitalia business in custody that was both strong and <mark type="inaudible" />. And also the migration of the Pioneer funds has been successful in the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>Overall, SG SS is confirming its position as one of the top three European player in the custody activity, with more than &#x20AC;2.73 trillion of asset under custody. Boursorama did previous increase of last week, so it's not new news. But it has been able, as said, to perform relatively well in a market environment which was a little bit more competitive. And the banking offering of Boursorama continued to perform well with 4,500 new banking accounts opened in second quarter, for a total of more than 70,000 at the end of June.</p>
          <p>Regarding U.S., the operational integration of the <mark type="inaudible" /> from the merger between Fimat and Calyon Financial International progressed in second quarter. And you can see on the slide that Newedge has now positioned as one of the top three player in the U.S. market and it should be almost the same on a global basis.</p>
          <p>As a whole, the net banking income for SG SS and the Online Savings did increase by a little bit less than 12% on a like-for-like basis and we already commented on that. But for Newedge, the comparison little bit complicated, as 50% of Newedge in term of revenues is less than 100% of Fimat, so you have the figure which is let's say kind of structure effect.</p>
          <p>If we now move to SG Corporate and Investment Banking on slide 19, we can say that in the second quarter this year we've had good results. Of course, I have difficulty to review because of some non-recurring items. But if we exclude the &#x20AC;1,223 million of non-recurring items that I will comment later, you can see with revenues of almost &#x20AC;1.9 billion the performance is strong with limited decrease of minus 1.9% on a like-for-like basis compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Let me perhaps have a word on the non-recurring items. They can be split in two parts. On one side something which is coming mainly from accounting, which is a minus 501 mark-to-market value of the CDS. You remember that in the first quarter we booked 743% -- 743 million, sorry, positive item from this item. We mentioned at the time of the first quarter that most of this mark-to-market positive tend to zero at the end of the curve due to the modest again widening of the spread in June and in fact the net impact is only minus 501.</p>
          <p>Same accounting impact on the revaluation of financial liabilities of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. It was a plus 523 in the first quarter. It is minus 147 in the second quarter. So this is, and I would say, accounting and technical impact.</p>
          <p>And the write-downs linked to the crises, you have almost 400 million, 399 write-downs which are broken down as follow; minus 196 relating to the exotic credit derivatives portfolio, minus &#x20AC;98 million linked to monolines; minus 84 million linked to the asset purchased from the SGAM and minus &#x20AC;20 million linked to further provisions on the CDOs unhedged. We had &#x2013; as a cautious attitude, we have also had &#x20AC;176 million of specific reserves on the exotic credit derivative portfolio. So total cost of the crises this quarter of &#x20AC;575 million.</p>
          <p>A word on the operating expenses which were down 9.9% Q2-on-Q2. This reflects the effectivity of our cost base, especially as you should have in mind that the second quarter did include some costs related to the strengthening of our control procedure.</p>
          <p>If we now look to the client-driven activities over the last six quarters. We can see that in equity derivatives, we have achieved a very strong performance with, again, good revenue coming from the flow business which are only down by 10% compared to the first quarter. We confirm that we have some very strong position in the warrant market with little bit more than 50% market share on a global basis, we rank number two worldwide. In trackers, we have a 25% market share in Europe and we are second behind BGI. And so this is very strong position that we can build on.</p>
          <p>And with structured products, we have also steady commercial production at 4% compared to last year, which reflects the good positioning of the activities, which is geared through our institutional clients, which generated over &#x2013; more than 50% of revenues in first half '08.</p>
          <p>Regarding performance of new capital markets for the fixed income and commodity business, we have again record performance in the flow business, which is up compared to the first quarter. We have achieved a steady performance in structured rates and currency products, given market condition, up again 24% compared to the first quarter. And we have confirmed our top five position as international euro denominated bond issuer with a year-to-date market share of 6% compared to 5% at the end of the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Lastly, as the quarter provided further evidence, on the success of our cross-selling model, with in particular a solid contribution from the commodity and infrastructure financing. All-in-all, client-driven revenues were up by 31% compared to the first quarter and were down for the first half only by 11% compared to record level last year.</p>
          <p>If we move now to the Equity division, which &#x2013; it has achieved a very strong performance in a bear market. In fact, when we look at the client-driven revenues, it were &#x2013; they were strong, as already commented. And we have been also able to achieve a strong performance in the trading activities, despite the trend reversals seen in June in the equity market.</p>
          <p>So, overall, revenue increased by more than 44% compared to the first quarter and we are down limited 22% compared to a record level from the second quarter '07. If we look a little bit further into details, client revenues were 33% compared to the first quarter. Trading revenue also posted a strong performance at &#x20AC;284 million, sharply up compared to first quarter, and this is particularly done due to arbitrage activity, which were recovered especially in April and May.</p>
          <p>Overall, the revenue generated by the first half '08 illustrates the excellent performance of our equity derivative franchise. This confirm that the franchise is unscathed. And if we look at the strengths that we have been able to demonstrate, we have accounting which is focused on institutional investors, which represent more than 50% of the revenue in structured products in the first half. We have a solid and sustained market share in the flow business. We have been able to achieve high inflows in Lyxor over the first half, &#x20AC;5.8 billion. We have a modest 0.5 billion outflow in the second quarter linked to especially EITF. And lastly, we were able to attain the first half results to show that trading business of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale has a strong resilience despite the more stringent stress test constraints that have been put into place at the end of January.</p>
          <p>If we move now to the Fixed Income and Currency Commodities divisions, again, a steady quarter. As you can see, we are almost short of the record level achieved in the first quarter at &#x20AC;709 million. But we can say that the mix is even better, because we have a record level in net banking income; as I mentioned, driven by the strong performance achieved by the flow. But also by the structured, Fixed Income and Currency business.</p>
          <p>On the trading side, 270 is again a high level and we have been negligible impacted by the invasion of the euro yield curve at the beginning of June. Overall, this division posted a slight decline in net banking income compared to the first quarter, as I mentioned. And if we were to exclude the non-recurring items, the increase will be 77% compared to the second quarter of '07.</p>
          <p>If we move to the Financing and Advisory division, there is a mixed performance. But nevertheless, the revenues, as you can see, remained quite high at &#x20AC;406 million, a modest decline by 1.5% compared to last year. You have to bear in mind that in this division we have a strong dollar part in terms of revenues, and a strong increase by 44% compared to the first quarter. There we have recoded a strong performance in commodity and infrastructure financing, and as expected we are seeing a decline in everything linked to leverage and property finance activity.</p>
          <p>That finishes the presentation of our business results and I will now let Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric conclude it.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Didier, for this information. We tried to make our presentation shorter and, of course, you will find the same level of details as usual in the appendices. I just would like again to reiterate a few key ideas on the end of this first half.</p>
          <p>Clearly the environment, going forward, remains uncertain. Our central scenario is for a slowdown of the economic activity in the U.S. and developed Europe, particularly at the end of this year and beginning of 2009. But even in such a difficult environment we think we have a robust and diversified business model, which should carry on developing.</p>
          <p>Excluding &#x2013; let me just again highlight that, excluding the accounting impacts and the crisis related negative revenues as well, the exceptional capital gains, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale underlying business has produced this first half an after-tax return on equity of close to 16%. I think it is not that bad in such an environment.</p>
          <p>We have started to rescale the activities, the limited number of activities hit by the crises and we will continue to do so going forward. And at the same time all our teams are working hard on upgrading our processes and controls, as we committed to the markets.</p>
          <p>The third idea is that the financial strength of the company is strong, is solid, and we are, as Didier mentioned to you, sticking to our 8% Tier One targets with, of course, no new capital increase. In four, five year we have enhanced the management team of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. We have modified the governance and this transition has gone very smoothly.</p>
          <p>So all-in-all, in this uncertain environment I feel very confident that with the commitment of our 160,000 staff, that again our bank will be able to successfully approach its strategy in this more challenging environment, leveraging on our strong activities. Thank you for your attention and we are now ready to answer your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The first question is coming from Chris Malmer from Goldman Sachs. Please lift your handset before you ask your question.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a few questions on the Corporate and Investment Banking division, if I may. First one on the client revenue activities in this quarter, there is clearly a very strong bounce back. Do you sense now that you will return to kind of the potential of the franchise in this quarter? Or do you think there has actually been some boost from activity levels more reflective of the environment at the moment, i.e., high volatility clients are shifting around a lot of activity &#x2013; of their positions and hence you are generating lot of client business? Or do you think this is now a return to kind of the level which would be somewhat more indicative of where you should be going forward?</p>
          <p>Second question on the trading revenues within the Investment Bank. Have you now calibrated the risk levels and the risk appetite that will position where you want to be, i.e., again if we're looking at &#x2013; looking forward, these are the kind of trading activity contribution that we should expect, based on the risk capital that you have?</p>
          <p>Thirdly and finally, just on the Investment Bank, just to &#x2013; for our understanding. When you're marking the CDOs with underlying subprime of 2005 vintage, according to your slide on page five, I think it is in the specific financial information, 4% markdown you're taking there. I think there was some debate as to what can be used as a proxy for the '05 production, given that some of the '06 ADX indices include the '05 production, which may suggest different marks. Could you give us some idea as to how you are going to about getting to that 35% number &#x2013; 34%, sorry? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Chris. First of all, on your client revenue question. If we look at the breakdown by activity, clearly we have &#x2013; on the fix income side, we have had on the first quarter and on the second quarter quite a strong increase of our flow business. And clearly the flow business increased in Q2 '08, Q2 '07 by something like 36% on the fixed income side, and 10% between Q2 '08 and Q1 '08. I think this has been a key driver in the increase of our Fixed Income business. And it is clearly linked on one side to volume in the market, which has been quite sustained.</p>
          <p>But also it is a result of the investments we have made in the previous years on the euro fixed income side into developing and testing this activity. So I think that we have reached a level of revenue there, and we keep developing the activity, which can be to a certain extent recurrent and which is not only due to a spike in specific volume or specific clients. So there I think that things will keep development quite a little.</p>
          <p>On the structured business, on the fixed income side, we have a business which is mixed in a sense that the structured credit activity is clearly less active in 2008 than it was in the first half of 2007. But we see &#x2013; we still see a good level of activity on the interest rate side, on the fixed income &#x2013; on the client side, where we had a good level of business in the first half. And we start seeing some business on the structured credit side for restructuring of product. This is not something which can be reconstituted.</p>
          <p>So I think on the structured side, a level of activity which should adjust. I can still see progress made on structured credit and price, and it's too early to say whether or not we will be able to replace the produce of structured credit business by the new activity. But all in all on the fixed income side, the level of fund business which has been reached here is probably a good indication of what will happen in the future.</p>
          <p>On the equity and equity derivatives side, we have a level of activity which is quite good on the flow side, which has been increasing compared to last year, Q2-to-Q2, by 11%. On the structured product side, it is a little bit more difficult to see for as we have clearly the impact of non-accounting issues and &#x2013; especially D1 impact and others. What I can say is that we have a good level of activity on the inter show side, with relatively well spread business, which in terms of production so on an economic basis, show stable revenue between Q2 and Q1, and flexible revenue between Q2 '08 and Q2 '07 in terms of production down by 12%. There, I think that we should see when the situation settles down, naturally the business in the equity market stabilize and go back up, so it is not impossible to see higher level of activity. So I can still see a potential of increase there.</p>
          <p>Finally to conclude on the financing side. We have a level of activity for the first half which has been down 11% on the overall financing side. This is mostly driven by the leverage finance side, and which has been compensated by infrastructure finance, as well as securities and credit finance. I think that leverage financing is going to come back to the levels where we were basically in the first half of last year. Commercial and credit finance should have still a sustained level, but clearly the financial in the level of commodities and if commodities are quite on the downside, there will be lower level of activity. But infrastructure will remain quite dynamic in the medium term. So they net-net have here stable to slightly higher level of activity going forward, specifically helped by the cross selling, as what we have developed within our financing business is a strong cross selling platform, not only in terms of origination to distribution so with the fixed income side. But also in terms of hedging and pushing organic, active hedging with clients, which actually contribute and has been increasing quite sharply. On the cross selling side, we've been up quite a lot, actually, compared to the first half of last year. So all in all, I think the client activity we have is a good base and could be seen as a return base with the plus and minus correcting each other for the future.</p>
          <p>On your second question, the trading side, we have kept our stress test still low, basically. And if you go to page 41 of the supplement that we have communicated, you can see that the stress test is low. Actually we have not increased them since the first quarter. And if you remember, we said that the first quarter that we have decreased before there was an improvement, actually we have decreased our stress test, but we didn't notice that yet because we were not very comfortable with the market environment.</p>
          <p>We have not yet decided to reincrease our stress test, because we are still working on the implementation of communication measures and we feel that in this environment should not want to increase our stress test. Our VaR is stable to slightly higher, based mostly due to the fact of syndicated item on the credit side as well. So &#x2013; and we keep and we intend to maintain the level of risk where it is. You could see the VaR moving slightly <mark type="inaudible" /> stage. But on the stress test we don't want to move the stress test now.</p>
          <p>So what I could say that the level of trading business has been quite satisfactory on the fixed income side, as it was sharply up compared to last year. It's up on the trading side and the fixed income side by almost 64% between Q2 '08 and Q2 '07. And on the equity derivative side, it has been down compared to Q2 '07 by 36%, up compared to Q1 '07 by 70%, clearly because in Q2 '07 we had remember basically a favorable environment with levels which were <mark type="inaudible" /> stable, basically. I feel on the equity derivative side that the level we have achieved in Q2 is a level which can be seen as a good base. You know that there are usually more seasonable impacts on the trading side, especially in <mark type="inaudible" /> the first half in this year was slightly different. Usually the first half is more favorable than the second half because there is no more improvement in this year. It's not a normal year actually because of the derivative equity market.</p>
          <p>So to cut a long story short, I think the credit level where we are, are a good base as well as under &#x2013; on the finance side to look back &#x2013; to drive derivative equity. Finally, on your mark on your figure, if we go to the supplement page that we have which should be on page 49, you have the detail of the markdown that we have used for the &#x2013; for values to do it. And as you pointed out, we have written down our subprime '03, '04 and '05 by 30%. They represent to be 60% of the overall unhedged figure after write-down. And we have written down by 96% our '06 and '07 vintages, which represents only 2%, or &#x20AC;60 million of our hedged CDO, after write-down.</p>
          <p>So to look at the valuation and the cum loss which led us to such basically write-down. We have not changed the cum loss for the quarter. On the '06 and '07, if I may say, the cum loss we use is almost irrelevant today as we have only 60 million within our revenues. First, when we compare the write-down that we have made on the '06-'07 to the level of ABX, we are actually more severe than the ABX entity on those A and above, and the BBB and below. We brought down all the BBBs and brought down the A both by 96%.</p>
          <p>On the up side, we have defined the '05 cum loss as by &#x2013; comprising to the '06 and '07 looking at the level of the loans where were still outstanding. And you know that the cum loss is part as a percentage of original balance. So the 10% is in fact misleading. If you look at the level of flow in the outstanding, and they have been amortized by more than 60% basically they are speculate and 40% of the loan remaining on the '05 vintage. And if you look at the very last cum loss which is around 2%, slightly below 2%, it was 1.7% -- let's say around it' 2% -- you can see that tentative equivalent cum loss we have on our '05 vintage is similar to the cum loss we have on the '06 if you correct as well the loans outstanding.</p>
          <p>So, in fact, you should not take the 10% of face value, but prorate that basically to the cum loss of '06 and '07. And if you look at the behavior of the '05 vintage, there are two things to say. One, from the overall environment and second one for only CDOs. When you look at the evolution of the cum loss of the '05 vintage, it actually follows the evolution of the two sides in one vintage, and has been flattening in the last few months. So we have not the exponential movement that we see in the '06 cum loss. But we have actually some kind of plateau, which puts effectively right now below the '01 cum loss evolution. So one does not know what the future will be. But in fact you have something which shows that maybe there is a stabilization and we see that as well on the 90 plus days delinquencies, 60 days delinquencies and 30 days delinquencies where the rates remain more or less stable. And we see that as well on our own CDOs where we have got basically loans or RMBS being reimbursed at par for the '05 vintages, so which show that the entering RMBS are at least similar to them in some ways. So at this stage, in regard to any further negative evolution of the market, we feel that it was completely appropriate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To say a further word on what Jean-Pierre mentioned. If you look at the page three of the supplement for the financial study here on you will see that on the portfolio three, which is under amortization today the attachment point increased as a result of sale of the &#x2013; reimbursement of the RMBS '05 vintages. This means that we have to reduce the size of the CDO senior tranche that we do have, and the protection by the maintaining remain the same, so net-net you can see that the attachment point has increased from 35% to 37%.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon, everyone. I would have just two questions regarding Investment Banking. The first one will be on the exotic derivatives. Can we expect that the situation is fully closed and clean after the amounts of losses and the additional provision you made in Q2? And the second element regarding the Investment Banking would be can we expect more flexibility on the cost in the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maxence, good afternoon. And I will also let Jean-Pierre answer to the questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bonjour, Maxence. On the exotic derivates, we have had &#x2013; Didier mentioned we have taken two specific impact during the quarter, a specific reserve for &#x20AC;176 million and basically &#x20AC;196 million negative credit impact. When you look at the total amount of business which have been taken from the exotic derivative side, the amount since Q4 '07 to &#x20AC;488 million. So we have more impressive reserves than we see. But what we have done during the quarter is few things. First of all, we have reduced by &#x2013; by use of actions we have reduced the negative convexity of the portfolio. You know that this portfolio behaves a little bit like an option portfolio, and this portfolio by design has a negative convexity and we have reduced the negative convexity by half.</p>
          <p>So the sensitivity to, in this market movement will be smaller, and we have restructured some of the transactions. We started the second quarter with an exposure which was &#x2013; because we wanted to be protected against the widening of the spread. We were long protection, so short credit by 1.8 &#x2013; the equivalent of &#x20AC;1.8 billion of five year notional credit, if you combine basically the values of that  NBC nomenclature, 13.</p>
          <p>Clearly, we, as we said during our first quarter result, we said that the impact in terms of trading for our book will be lower than in the first quarter for the second quarter. It has been the case. And most of the loss came, I think, around the month of April where we had a very strong and short covering with spreads tightening up and basically the protection we had basically &#x2013; credit protection we had, short credit position we had, worked against us and this is where we lost most of our money.</p>
          <p>So what to expect in the future? First to all, this position is as closed the percent may be dynamically. But as I said, the sensitivity has been reduced and the sensitivity to market movement has been reduced by half.</p>
          <p>Two is that we kept, at the end of June, loan protection of &#x20AC;1 billion equivalent, so roughly half as well of what it was. We feel that it is better for us to have a slight loan protection on this portfolio, as clearly there is more volatility and more sensitivity when spread widens and the key answer &#x2013; the fact that we keep this position. So I think that the P&amp;L on this position will depend on the volatility of the credit market. If the credit market behaves in a relatively reasonable way, so with normal volatility, and not the extreme volatility we had on the first quarter, if you remember, on CMBX index we went from 30 basis points with 300 and back to 100, basically it's an extreme volatility.</p>
          <p>If we have lower volatility or normal volatility, the portfolio should perform reasonably well, and any negative P&amp;L impact should be on a much lower magnitude, which at this stage, I have not seen a huge volatility in the third quarter, for instance.</p>
          <p>It is not impossible, but we are working on that and we have already 500 &#x2013; around &#x20AC;500 million provision. It is not impossible that we might take additional provision to be prudent on the structure of the portfolio. But it can be to a much lower extent than the &#x20AC;500 million that we have already taken.</p>
          <p>So what I would say that under normal market condition, this portfolio is fully under control and more stress positioned. This portfolio could remain a bit difficult to manage from time to time. So it is much less difficult than what it has been during the first quarter.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, we have worked on our use adjustment, and there we have on one side clearly restructured the activities which have been directly hit by the crisis, the CDO structure in the U.S., the leverage finance activities, because clearly we show that the level of revenue will be lower, going forward. We are looking and we are proactively adjusting our head count base and we think the work that we are pursuing and we keep making adjustments in every activity, and specifically in the third quarter. We have to be careful within the adjustments we make, not to basically create condition where we might not keep the potential of growth for the activities which have the potential of performance. And activity, the underlying performance of the business has been quite satisfactory.</p>
          <p>So what we are doing in &#x2013; for restructuring of the business is what we want to do both in terms of head count and in terms of actually balance sheet and allocation of equity, as well as balance sheet, is to refocus even more than what we have today on the activities which are core for us. So that we won't impediment, basically, our ability to create future revenue and revenue growth while controlling our base, that is decreasing our cost base in terms of fixed costs, and reallocating our equity base making sure that we have a quite controlled, respected asset allocation as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Can I ask some more questions? The first one would be on the Asset Management. It's quite a long time that you haven't spoken about CCW. We were expecting for quite a long time that the move from the CDO business to a disparate asset funds; we have heard nothing about it. It will be quite interesting to see if it is not the reason why the GAM is not performing that well. And my last question would be on the leasing. We are looking forward on the end that you were doing some profit warning due to the leasing activities. I just wanted to check that you are still comfortable with the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Maxence, just a quick word on CCW. We did mention that they were in the process to launch some distressed debt maintaining funds. In fact, when we look at what we call alternative investment activity that is revenue they have collected &#x2013; they have gathered US$1.9 billion in second quarter. So the funds have been raised. Some of the fees will be positive when this would be invested. But that said, the money and the credibility of this revenue has been &#x2013; let's say has been funded by this net inflows. So that's it and you will see that flowing in the P&amp;L in the coming quarter.</p>
          <p>Regarding your question on the leading side, with the NW so this is more what we could have in ALD. In ALD we are very careful with the residual value policies. I think what is important to mention is that historically, we have been able to navigate quite well in all, let's say, adjustment in this market that took place in the UK in the early 2007 when there was a tax change, important synergies that also the diversification of ALD Automotive which was spread across the most country acquisitioners, let's say, in a very good position to evolve, let's say, this impact, this type of impact.</p>

But the question that I have relate to the cost of funds, the cost of risk, both in France and in Corporate and Investment Banking. As you see, we start to see a little rise in cost of risk, nothing to worry about. But just wanted to have a feel as to, can you give us a flavor about what is deteriorating exactly? What sector of activities, what size of companies, any particular geographies, and any particular orange signal we should be worried about that would sort of help in the forecast for 2009? Thank you.</p>

          <p>So good afternoon, Guillaume. I will comment on the French Networks and Jean-Pierre will comment on the CIB. Just on the French Networks, while you have seen that it was within the limit of 1 bps. You can say that it is the difference. Nevertheless, when we look a little bit more into detail in the portfolio, what we can see that on the professional and very small companies, let's say, we start to see some signals let's say of potentially evolution on the down side. Nevertheless, you know that we have very limited exposure to this segment. So this is not a big issue and this is something also you can look at in the bankruptcies that you can see in French economy overall. It's more like the professionals and the SMEs which have to be included on the increase side. But overall I think we are very pleased given the balance and the strength of the portfolio. And as you can see, net cost of risk did not move that much over that quarters. I will pass now to Jean-Pierre for the CIB.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Bonjour, Guillaume. On the CIB side, our cost of risk for the risk, as Didier mentioned, 34 basis points so we are going towards normalization. Our average cost of risk in mid cycle basis contributed above that between 50 to 55 basis points because to cooperative assets. So what we have seen during the quarter is basically for the &#x20AC;77 million, of course, some tension also on real estate side and small adjustment as well in our LVU portfolio. So that we feel a trend which should emerge, because clearly these are the two areas which can be impacted. But for the time being we said that for the first quarter we had some exceptional items which should not be made current, which has been the cast. For the time being I don't expect any major evolution from the cost of risk that we have shown during the second quarter. There is no major file on which we feel is being problem. I mean, we are not to working on any major file at this stage which should impact the cost of risk for Q3.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. The remaining question I have is on the growth in risk-weighted assets you have, I am talking about also the number on Q/Q is plus 8%. I was wondering if there is an idea what the run rate for the full year it's looking quite spare, in my view.  The other question is on the core Tier One ratio, and I am seeing variability. Between Q1 and Q2 you bank I would say 30 basis points. Obviously there is the growth in risk-weighted assets I just mentioned. But I have the impression that there is another explanation for this reduction in core Tier One ratio.</p>
          <p>And the last one is on the EPS dilution after the measure you just announced regarding non- consolation of shares for the stock option and the employees. Could we have an idea of the impact in terms of dilution we could have you regularly publish and this time in the annex slide in page 43 the number of share you have for the calculation of the diluted EPS where are we going there end of 2008 just because <mark type="inaudible" />. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Pascal. On the risk-weighted assets the average increase 5%, in fact, is a stabilization between 31st of March and 30th of June. The fact is that our <mark type="inaudible" /> December let's say we had no strategic impact of the call which had been restated at the end of March. So this is a major impact on the evolution of the risk-weighted assets, so it's an average that you are commenting. If you were to look in our presentation that we made at the end of June, you will see that there is &#x20AC;340 million that we had at the end of June compared to the level at the end of March which was disclosed in our special of the &#x2013; on Basel II. The increase is much more modest, so you should stop following trend in terms of evolution of the risk-weighted assets for the full year.</p>
          <p>Regarding your question on the core Tier One Basel II is 6.6%. So during the quarter you should also not forget that we had some goodwill impact coming from the small tranche that we bought on the Rosbank post the negative of the option in the first quarter. We bought additional almost 8% and this was &#x20AC;200 million approximately goodwill and that we booked in the accounts where it was deducted from both Basel I and Basel II Tier One and Core Tier One.</p>
          <p>And also we should mentioned that in term of Basel II, we had this quarter some deduction coming from the treatment for, let's say, unhedged CDOs, because the three of these five CDOs has been downgraded less than B, and as such we have to deduct, let's say, from the Tier One ratio 50% of the non-hedged, let's say, remaining exposure.</p>
          <p>So this is approximately &#x20AC;800 million that we have to deduct from Tier One ratio at the end of June, due to the downgrade of this three CDOs out of the five. So that's the second explanation. Then if we look at the number of shares, well, it's in the press release I guess, but the fact that we will not buyback our shares to neutralize, so the right issue for the employees as well as for the stock option is approximately 10 million shares that we will not buy this year. So you have to bear in mind that the total number of shares for the Group is at 590 million shares. So you have an idea of the impact of the non-buyback on these 10 million shares.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions coming back to Corporate and Investment Bank. Essentially, looking at the slide six basically, just wanted to understand how you calculate the fair value on the exposures that you have outside of U.S. residential? Clearly looking at the notionals of 2795 and the 13.5 million on corporate credits. Just to understand, how you measure the fair value and the outlook for that? Secondly, and kind of a border kind of industry question. What impact, if any, do you see from regulatory changes when addressed to market risk? And clearly there is a ball proposal out there at this point in time. And then finally if you could just provide us with some risk-weighted asset growth guidance for the Group as a whole over the coming quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Jean-Pierre, if you could start.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on page six of our supplement basically we disclosed the basically the fair value of the values of asset we have in our portfolio in short by monolines. And we have seen with our monolines no exposures, which are split between values, etcetera, U.S. RMBS asset base, the non-U.S. RMBS assets which can be split into values asset class like credit, corporate credit, reinsurance structure, the financing infrastructure and others.</p>
          <p>On the &#x20AC;545 million you know that you mentioned, basically these are sensitivity analysis which are made on the assets which are not U.S. RMBS, and there we use stress test by asset class which looks at the work impact that has been for relatively long period of time between 15 to 30 years depending on the asset class, which gives us basically the sensitivity that leaves us with the &#x20AC;545 million.</p>
          <p>In terms of evolution of the regulatory environment, I will let Didier comment on some aspect. I will just mention that on the securitization side there will be a certain number of mergers which will be approved by the regulators, which are probably going to involve the credit and structured credit product in the trading books of the banks. And one and the most likely one is probably to treat in the trading book of banks the structure of the credit country, the securitized countries which are under BB, as they are in the banking book. We said that it shouldn't form a negativity and 50% from the Tier One. Didier or Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric are going to comment on further evolution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric Oudea speaking. On the regulatory changes, there are works which are being carried out by the regulators on market instruments. But it will take time before there is any change probably not before 2010. There are works on incremental default or incremental event risk to again to try to take into account the credit underlying exposure behind certain market risk products. But as I said, you should not expect something quick on that side as far as I know. Yes, Didier, on the weighted asset.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the weighted asset growth, we don't have targets or guidance for the market. Nevertheless, we would have &#x2013; we will continue to have the select increase of our risk-weighted assets as we have done over the last quarter. I remind that the growth that you can calculate today is also concerning some change in the scope of consolidation in Rosbank, just for example, is approximately &#x20AC;10 billion of risk-weighted assets that came on board at the beginning of this year. So we continue to focus on our, let's say, selected growth strategy to expand in each of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So can I just follow-up with another question actually related to something that was mentioned earlier actually? Could you just explain to me again why the ABX '06 one, which I understand to be largely second half '05 vintage, trading at $0.10 on the dollar, why that's completely not relevant to your '05 vintage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Kinner, what we mentioned is two fold. First of all, the cum losses that we have taken, let's say, if you adjust that from the fact that the 10% is on the original balance and that today more than 60% of the original balance has been paid down, so it's the remaining part is only less than 40%. If you translate that into cum loss on the balance and you deduct the excessive cum loss which has already been recorded, we are, let's say, quite close from the '06 assumption.</p>
          <p>Second point in the '05 vintage, what we should mention is that the '05 production has been done in an environment where the real estate market price in U.S. will continue to increase. The redemption has started only by end of '06. But we have seen also that the equity position of loan to value at current market price of the '05 vintage is totally different from the one of the '06. And last but not least, we have also to look at what is taking place in our old CDOs and we did mention that we had in the second quarter approximately US$200 million of down payment excess value. So we're sure that in our view the difference of the 2005 vintage is different from the behavior of the 2006, and that's why let's say we have this different results compared to '06 &#x2013; '05 compared to '06.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Philip Richards from Execution. You have the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. I have couple of follow-ups on the money amount exposure. Can you just give a bit more detail on slide six. I am still a bit confused. You've got the 7.2 billion of the CDO. You are saying the fair value of that is 5.7, so you are implying about 20% markdown. Now that's we think on the vintages. But so how are you feeling about safe level going forward and you don't expect any further write-downs on that.</p>
          <p>And the second question is basically on the following slide, on slide seven, you talk about 340 million mark-to-market. Can you just say a few more words on what that is in the footnote? And in particular why that doesn't impact the P&amp;L base? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on your question regarding the calculation on the 20% fair value of protection before the adjustment compared to the notional value, again you have at the footnote the breakdown of the vintages of the <mark type="inaudible" /> and you can see that almost 80% of the exposure, again, is only vintages to a five of the four. So this means that in the &#x20AC;7.2 billion that it's only 3.8 billion are from that <mark type="inaudible" /> of asset. And within this &#x20AC;3.8 billion 80% almost is 2005 and before. So which means that also we have some mid prime and prime and other type of assets in the CDOs in the notional value of the &#x20AC;7.2 billion, so you have to take that into account in the calculation you make.</p>
          <p>The second point in your question was the footnote. Of the &#x20AC;340 million mark-to-market, let me explain or review with the hedges that we purchased on the monoline. So these hedges are CDS that we bought on strategic name, so it could be &#x2013; I don't know, can be ACFG, CG whatever. We bought that from banks, and so we have a nominal amount of &#x20AC;800 million at the end of June. Of course, these CDS are derivative instruments, so they are mark-to-market with the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>And looking at the evolution of the spreads on the monoline over the last quarters, let's say definitely, the mark-to-market of such CDS is leading to a positive elements in the P&amp;L. So the positive element is &#x20AC;340 million. We have neutralized these positive mark-to-market in our P&amp;L for the following reasons. We can't claim to have protection of &#x20AC;800 million nominal, if we take into cost we bought mark-to-market valuation of these instruments for the P&amp;L, because when the &#x2013; or if there is a default on one monoline, then it's 100 that we will book as a protection on the nominal. But it's 100 minus the mark-to-market that we have already registered in our P&amp;L. So to be let's say logic in our credit analysis, which is to take the nominal protection, so there is nominal protection in our fair value exposure we have neutralized let's say &#x20AC;340 million. It's not a double count, let's say, two items.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Antonio Guglielmi from Merrill Lynch. Sir, you have the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Just on Pascal's question on risk-weighted asset growth, there is 7.5% quarterly growth in risk-weighted assets under Basel II which is 5.6% under Basel I. I was just wondering what is explaining this two percentage point gap between the two different approaches. And secondly, back to the monolines. If you can give us an idea of the sensitivity of the growth to monocline exposure in the case of rising cumulative losses expectations? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So regarding your first question, in fact as I said earlier, on the risk-weighted assets the growth you have calculated is based on the average for the quarter, so being a fair end value. And in fact at the end of December so the starting point for the average of the Q1 we did not have in the risk weighted asset under Basel II. The increase in the risk-weighted assets is coming from the impact of the flows on the operational risk. So as the result let's say mechanically, the increase is a bit stronger than what you can have in Basel I, which I remind you is not an accounting view of operational risk.</p>
          <p>So that's the major explanation. Again, if you were to look and to compare let's say end of period, 30 of June and 31st of March, and the 31st of March was disclosed in the first quarter result and also in our special session regarding Basel II. You will see that the increase is very similar compared to the equity assets, it was just a bad effect into the change in methodology we have to include the impact of the crude in our calculation as for '08.</p>
          <p>On the sensitivity on the monoline, on the cumulative, it's a bit complicated. But I would pass that to Jean-Pierre.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We have &#x2013; sensitivity to the monoline exposure on the first line calculation we have made, and I am speaking from memory so I will come back to you with a more precise figure &#x2013; is between 100 to &#x20AC;200 million of sensitivity for 10% is closer to 100, from memory, than &#x20AC;200 million. You have &#x2013; but you know that the behavior of the sensitivity is something which is not cleanly up. But if you look at the evolution between the 31st of December and 31st of March, we had to change the cumulatives, and we had an impact of &#x20AC;500 million there, but with quite a meaningful change of the cum loss. Really for 10% move, it's something between 100 to 150. Once again, as Didier mentioned, it is important to look at the structure of the subprime component of the CDOs, ABS, we have hedged by monoline. It's almost basically 80% of all the vintages of '05 and before, 3% of '07 and 3% of '06.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now if you start from the &#x20AC;7.2 billion on page six, you can tell you have only 3.8 billion subprime, and so 80% of the subprime is all the vintage in '05. And again the sensitivities that Jean-Pierre mentioned, so it's moving the cum loss from 10 to 11 for '05 from 25 to 27.5 for '06 and 27 to 29.7 for the '07 vintages.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I just had a question &#x2013; two questions. Firstly on French retail. I mean, you mentioned the new guidance for French retail revenues of 1 to 2% growth. I was just wondering how is that the cost &#x2013; using the cost basis and funds given current inflation levels and whether you expect to be able to sort of hold cost growth to similar level or whether cost might be run higher rate than revenues?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just another question on the risky asset exposure, on page 34 of the supplementary data. I just wondered why you had split out the ABS portfolio purchased from GAM into ABS assets at risk. And then a sort of separate line for other GAM assets. Is this because you feel the valuation fluctuations will be much less on this sort of assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good afternoon, Natasha. So just a quick word on the French retail guidance of 1 to 2% revenues and the capacity that this will have first control in effect of this 1 to 2% increase. I guess, year-to-date the increase in the cost base of the French Network was 1.6% for the first half. We believe that this year we will have similar evolution of perhaps a negative effect between revenues and cost. Nevertheless, we confirm our target in terms of cost/income ratio reduction and we <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Second question, regarding your point on the GAM exposure. What we have done is just to comply with the discretion we have among French banks, in terms of D-7 reporting. On the GAM, as some of this exposure will be reported under the UPA RMBS, <mark type="inaudible" /> we have a fixed exposure between what is totally specific in terms of country and underlying, and what is the remaining part, which is again detailed in the appendix linked to the D-7 exposure, and you have the exactly the capacity. We build let's say the portfolio and its cost disclosed at the end March for the part which is in the &#x2013; the part which is in the corporate center.</p>
          <p>But it's just let's say a choice in terms of &#x2013; on one side what are the underlying assets and we to show the executive presentation, and on the other side the remaining part, which was linked to this asset conserved from the GAM's credit side.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This is Jaap Meijer from Dresdner. Couple of question. On your capital gains of corporate center, why is this not recorded as an extraordinary in your P&amp;L? It's an item of 260 million. I think you have done so in the past. On your monoline exposure, it seems to be jaw dropping at 23.5 billion. One thing I was not clear is how the 340 million actually neutralized. Is that sitting in separate provision and why is this not allocated to the monoline exposures? And regarding your provision that you have done for your monocline is, how do you rate a possibility of a default of each monoliner, like Natixis has done? You probably have seen it. And how much recoveries are you taking into account in case of a default? And relating to that actually, what are the risk of markdowns if conduits of close to 19 billion will be brought on your balance sheet, considering 23% is RMBS and CMBS? And one final question is, you've given the sensitivity for 10% loss for each year of any unhedged CDOs, but it stated as 300 million instead of 500 million published in Q1. Is there an asset or pre-tax issue or is this actually changed? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So starting with the question on BankMuscat, so in fact it's true that at some point we book that by gain on the asset. But it's &#x2013; when it is an operating asset, which is not the case of BankMuscat, it is a financial state. So as such it is booked as revenues, and so that's why it is part of the revenues in the corporate center for &#x20AC;253 million and we did adjust for it when we have met the indemnifying item. It is mentioned on the slide nine of the appendices, in both corporate centers for start and for the second quarter. Regarding your question on the &#x2013; I guess it was on the 340 million mark-to-market impact on the CDS we bought on the monocline, your second question, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on that I'd say you have two way to behave. Let's say, one is to take it in the P&amp;L, but then you have reduce the exposure. And so we will have a gain for &#x20AC;340 million. We will reduce, however, let's say 0.8 &#x2013; I will say 0.56 and at the end of the day we will have also to make further write-downs for the current amount of 340. So net-net it is exactly the same story, whether you take it to the P&amp;L. But then you have gross exposure which is more important and you take the additional mark or whether let's say you are neutralizing the P&amp;L, so it's exactly the same story.

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again we could, we could, but we believe that it's better to invest, let's say, from a credit point of view directly to the exposure in term of nominal. And then I'd say we have decided to neutralize some mark-to-market in the P&amp;L, which net-net is very same impact. But in our view from a risk assessment and from a credit perspective, it's much more let's say appropriate, if that's the point.</p>
          <p>Regarding your question on &#x2013; your next question Jean-Pierre will answer.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your last question on sensitivity of the conduits, basically we move from 450 to 300 in &#x2013; for last part because we have amortized almost fully '06, '07 in our conduit. Basically the sensitivity is reducing quite sharply because of that and now only on the '05 vintages as well as on the Alt-A. As you know we have said that, for the Alt-A we effect a cum loss which is two-third of the subprime, so reduction because of &#x2013; there is only 60 million additional markdown to take on the unhedged CDO in '07 and '07. On the conduit, if you look at asset within the conduit, we see that we have basically no exposure on our U.S. conduit to any RMBS assets prime or sub prime.</p>
          <p>The exposure on the RMBS conduits is mostly on the French conduits, as well as on our Australian conduits. For the French conduits we have 100% AAA assets and for the Australian conduit it is a mix between AAA and AA, we have 196% of AAA the other one 75% of AAA 25% on AA.</p>
          <p>And on the Ukrainian market the loans then said we are trying to conduit are reinsured by third party insurance. So we have not only the loan themselves which are as a collateral plus reinsurance. But &#x2013; and we are in the process of amortizing our Australian conduits as we want to reallocate basically our conduit activity mostly and refocus it mostly on our European conduit and our U.S. conduit investment...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry to interrupt. If you take those conduits on board on your balance sheet, clearly those will be under the value. So actually there should be a valuation loss basically if you take that onto your balance sheet and not risk of assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. They are &#x2013; on the conduits basically you have to look at the potential consolidation under Basel I and Basel II. There is no reason today for us to consolidate the conduit under Basel I. As you can see and it is disclosed in the Annex actually under the following page, which will be page 12, we basically own no commercial for U.S. conduits and we label part of &#x2013; small part of the commercial paper for other conduits which are well below the threshold of consolidation. And when we issue commercial paper for the European or Australian conduits, we basically sell them from the balance sheet basically and gradually sell them into the market. So we don't see any reason &#x2013; any risk at this stage of consolidation of our conduits until the end of the year, so until we are under Basel I.</p>
          <p>Under Basel II, the risk in terms of regulatory technical charge and change of the regulatory technical charge lead to consolidation and non-consolidation of the conduits, I mean, will give us &#x2013; the conduits when they are consolidated or not consolidated, we'll have exactly the same regular during capital charge. So basically next year we'll have only a balance sheet impact in terms of overall size of the balance sheet, but no regulatory technical charge.</p>
          <p>You asked a question about the sensitivity of conduits each &#x2013; when we are running sensitivity test. We do not do that regularly and had a meeting with the team actually last week to review the sensitivity test of our conduits and to look at the behavior of values asset class. You know that the conduit have value level of protection in terms of over collateralization, in terms of retained margin, basically as well that we keep. At this stage we undervalues <mark type="inaudible" /> or multiple finance of the probability of default for each asset class. We are taking two time or three times the probability of default.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding your last two question, I forget to answer on the cumulative issue, and also even default used for the monolines, you mentioned Natixis example. Let's say, while we will not disclose into detail what we have but, nevertheless we have also rationalized the write-off &#x2013; write-down that we made, and there is a same type of TDL TD analysis, and I would say we are not that senior, we like to see it, and if you were to look or to extrapolate their example on the monolines you will have a result which is close from the one we have published, and I encourage you to use this test for the market as a whole.</p>
          <p>Regarding your last question, which is the sensitivity of the mono &#x2013; of the CDO and hedge, the &#x20AC;300 million, which are down compared to the first quarter, in fact, it's quite an easy question &#x2013; it's quite an easy answer, let's say, we have our let's say a central scenario, which is based on the cum losses, and then as you mentioned &#x2013; as we mentioned we have to complement this scenario by comparing, let's say, the behavior of '06 and '07 vintage compared to the EBIT. And as we said, this has went down in the second quarter so we have made some additional reserve, let's say, to reflect this point, and that today they are 96% written down let's say in the end of June. As Jean-Pierre was mentioning, it is no longer a question. So which &#x2013; we had to push the cum loss from this to vintage. In fact, we will be at zero, and when you are at zero you have no reason to maintain the additional, let's say, reserve that we mention to make that go around with the market price. And so at some point when you are at 100% write off, you can no longer do anything to go further down, so that's the point that we on this to vintages, we are on a cruise to the end of the story.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Three quick questions. First question regarding consumer financing business, you focused on the increased cost of risk due to development in emerging markets. Could you give us any indication regarding what's the principal of the increase of the net margin which normally is symmetrical to these higher costs of risk, and what is the level of this net margin in these activities, I don't know, if it's increased? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>My second question is you have doubtful loan coverage of 60%, which is quite stable since 2007. Do you feel comfortable with the stability of this coverage, due to the current situation and due to &#x2013; it's hard what we can imagine, but we will now experience a degeneration of the economic climate at the worldwide basis? And my last question would be, how would you qualify the coming periods of the banking industry? Do you thing what we are entering after the subprime crisis to a more classical crisis, banking, more classical banking crisis, or do you think that we are entering a normal time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon. Regarding your question on the cost of risk and margins in the &#x2013; at emerging markets in consumer finance. Well, you have an illustration of that on slide 14, where you can see productivity, and provisions are based into total revenues, and which is 100% considered on average. Provisions represent approximately 20 to 25% of the revenue generation of each country, which as you know is a little bit more important, but we believe that the normalization will take place as we let's say moving to the model a bit more to cap financing for the recent acquisition of &#x2013; from Edge, and to less extent at KP. We are seeing exactly the same movements in terms of margins, let's say, if we have to look at the margin increase on the total of spending, we have seen for example 100 bps increase overall for the SG Consumer Finance division, which is coming mainly from <mark type="inaudible" /> which have double digit figure in terms of net spread.</p>
          <p>Regarding your second question on the nonperforming loans and their coverage, we feel comfortable with such coverage. Having in mind that also on the ratio that you can calculate from appendices, you do not include the portfolio based provisions which also are reporting in the accounts in the balance sheet for appropriately 1 billion. Revisions are more than that. So this is also increasing the coverage. You could calculate mechanically. Regarding the going forward evolution of the banking sector, I will let Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, again I think the environment first of all remains relatively uncertain. And the crisis we are facing with different ingredients, this crisis of real estate market in certain economies; the liquidity crisis, there is more liquidity today, but nevertheless the cost of liquidity remains relatively high. The inflation related to the oil price, and the agricultural commodities. These ingredients, if you wish, added together means a cocktail that has not been experienced in the past.</p>
          <p>So I think we need to remain cautious. The central scenario that our economists have in mind for the next 18 months is a slowdown of the activity in the U.S. and in Continental Europe. As I said, potentially you can translate that at the end of 2008 and beginning of 2009, and for example, they have in mind for the U.S. this year a growth of 1.6% and 0.7% next year; and 1.5% for the euro zone and 1% for next year.</p>
          <p>And potentially, with a pick up &#x2013; sorry, 0.5 for next year for the U.S. And so, if you wish, with a pick up potentially of the GDP growth in the second half for overseas improvement, if you wish, in the second half of 2009.</p>
          <p>I don't think that this kind of environment could be considered as a normal environment. If you wish, we are far from the group potential from the different countries. It means that you might see effectively &#x2013; so you might see again further deterioration on certain sectors for example in the real estate market in the U.S. or in the U.K. in our view, and again with certain elements of uncertainly like the evolution of credit for example in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Overall, when I look at the exposure of our bank, again, we are in, you can sense, in Europe exposed to France, and I would say that the French economy should be at the end of the day probably a bit more resilient than other economies. The outlook for growth in the U.K., Spain or Italy is not strong, and more importantly on the housing market and mortgage market, as you know, the origination process has remained sound.</p>
          <p>And with the banking sector overall, I think, we should fare relatively well with the crisis. So again that's our major exposure in Continental Europe. We are not exposed to the retail in the U.S., and as I've said, resilient market. And we are exposed in emerging markets where we can expect some slowdown also. And we don't believe in the decoupling if you wish of these economies, the emerging market economies through the western world, but nevertheless, overall countries which should do well, we have a spread of countries with economies which are not correlated with each other. What I mean by that, we have different economies, some of them with the benefit of strong commodity results, and overall, I would say compared with other countries, I think we are exposed to good countries in relative terms.</p>
          <p>So I think we need to remain cautious. 2008 will remain for Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale a year during which we will try to capitalize on our franchises, enhance our capital ratios, to take opportunities in 2009. I have the conviction that in this market there will be also a lot of opportunities, and again I would like us to be able to seize these opportunities.</p>
