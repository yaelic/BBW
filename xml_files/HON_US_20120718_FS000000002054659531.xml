          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Honeywell's second quarter 2012 conference call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Elena Doom, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning and welcome to Honeywell's second quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Dave Anderson. This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.honeywell.com/investor.</p>
          <p>We want you to note that elements of today's presentation do contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change, and we would ask that you interpret them in that light. We identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings.</p>
          <p>So this morning, we're going to review our financial results for the second quarter of 2012 as well as share with you our guidance for the remainder of the year. And of course, we'll allow time for your questions at the end.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave Cote.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Elena. Good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>It is great to be able to say again that Honeywell had another terrific quarter, capping off a strong first half. We had a nice earnings increase on modest sales growth, and it was driven by solid margin expansion.</p>
          <p>Margins expanded about 150 basis points or 80 basis points when you exclude the absence of prior-year payments to BGA customers, and that gave us a tailwind this year. That increase in margins, though, reflects our continued focus on driving productivity from our key process initiatives, conservative planning assumptions, and the proactive restructuring, all while continuing to invest for the future.</p>
          <p>Sales were $9.4 billion, representing 4% reported annual organic growth on top of good growth last year. This performance in a more challenging macro environment underscores the value of the diversity of opportunity across our businesses, short and long-cycle exposure, our products and services, and mix of U.S. and rest-of-world geographies. As expected, our short-cycle businesses posted slower growth this quarter with declines in Europe and slower growth in China. However, our long-cycle businesses, mainly commercial Aerospace and UOP, continued with strong performance.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share of $1.14 was up 12% year over year, 14% on a continuing ops basis. That was above the high end of our guidance range. Cash was also strong, having generated over $1 billion of free cash flow prior to pension contributions, and that reflects 115% net income conversion. And as I mentioned earlier, we did this while also investing for the future. We continued to ramp R&amp;D and CapEx investments, which will continue to drive future growth.</p>
          <p>We also funded approximately $25 million in net restructuring in the quarter or approximately $50 million on a gross basis. That brings gross year-to-date restructuring funded through operations to almost $80 million, adding to the existing opportunity of already committed projects that Dave will take you through further later.</p>
          <p>As we all know, the macroeconomic landscape is uncertain, and that's at best. However, we continue to expect more of the same. We're going to build on our execution track record. In Europe, we expect continued softness in our short-cycle businesses, specifically ACS and Transportation Systems. However, with our balanced portfolio of short and long-cycle businesses, that's helping to mitigate these near-term trends, as Europe is roughly flat on an organic basis year to date.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the Americas is holding up well, and the indicators we're tracking are still positive. The same is true in China with a modest uptick in our short-cycle businesses, helping to drive double-digit growth again in the quarter. Overall, we feel good about the diversified nature and regional mix of the portfolio, benefiting from our great positions in good industries globally.</p>
          <p>With all that in mind, we've outlined our second half planning framework, capturing the key variables that comprise the low, mid, and high ends of our new guidance range. Dave will walk you through more of the details shortly. But at a high level, we're raising the low end of guidance by $0.05 while keeping the high end unchanged, making our new EPS guidance range $4.40 to $4.55. This is, of course, supported by the strong performance we saw in the first half and a balanced view of the risks and opportunities in the second half.</p>
          <p>Turning to 2013, who knows what happens on a macroeconomic basis? However, everything out there suggests that continued conservative planning is best. We're positioning ourselves for another tough economic landscape while staying focused on the things that are within our control. That means continuing to execute on our key strategies for growth, sustaining our investments in new products and technologies, controlling our fixed costs through OEF or Organization Effectiveness, and making sure we deliver the savings from the roughly $400 million in restructuring projects that are still in process that we funded over the last couple years. These projects are estimated to deliver over $125 million of incremental savings next year.</p>
          <p>And of course, we'll continue to be cautious about adding people back globally. And as we highlighted in our March investor conference, we've made margin growth a bigger element of how we incentivize our people, so everyone is focused on it and we're delivering on it.</p>
          <p>Honeywell demonstrated in the last downturn that we're a company that executes well even in a tough macro environment, and we're doing it again this time. Segment margins are expanding more than we initially expected at the beginning of the year despite slower sales growth.</p>
          <p>For 2012 and 2013, we have focused on margin expansion as key to earnings growth as a way to leverage slower sales growth in a tough macro environment. So with sharp execution, benefits from seed planting and productivity initiatives, the tailwinds from proactive restructuring funding, and acquisition accretion, we'll work to offset low global growth, and that will contribute to the company's outperformance again in 2013.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Dave.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone, and thanks again for your participation on this morning's call. I'm going to take you through the summary financial results, starting on slide number four.</p>
          <p>As you can see, the businesses have done a really nice job of managing things within their control, and the results that Dave highlighted and are shown on this slide that really reflect that. Revenues of $9.4 billion were up 4%, at the lower end of the guidance range, driven in large part by unfavorable foreign exchange in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Regionally, we saw good organic growth in the Americas of 5% on organic basis. Europe was roughly flat. China was up 12%. And as everyone knows and has been experiencing, the Europe macro headwinds have been challenging. But Honeywell's balanced mix of long-cycle exposure is clearly contributing to the stability that we're having in Europe that began in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>The segment profit for the company was up an impressive 15%. Segment margins expanded 150 basis points to 15.8%, with expansion in three out of our four business segments. That represents approximately 55% revenue conversion for the quarter on a reported basis. And if we adjust it for last year's Aero launch contribution and the favorability this year compared to that same event last year, we actually had 43% revenue conversion in the quarter; tremendous productivity, disciplined cost controls in a slower growth environment.</p>
          <p>Now below the line and taxes were largely as expected. We funded approximately $25 million, as Dave said, in net restructuring projects in the quarter, which is going to benefit us in 2013. And in a few minutes, I'll walk you through an analysis of our proactive restructuring actions that we've taken since 2009.</p>
          <p>Our earnings per share of $1.14 were above the high end of our guidance, representing a 14% increase on a continuing operations basis.</p>
          <p>And finally, free cash flow of just over $1 billion, reflecting 115% free cash flow conversion, a solid result for the quarter; working capital contributed to year-over-year cash growth, which partially offset higher capital spending.</p>
          <p>So let's now go to slide five, start with the businesses with Aerospace. Sales in Aero were up 8%, 4% organic excluding the impact of last year's BGA launch payments. And as expected, we continue to see good growth in the Commercial businesses, partially offset by manageable declines in Defense.</p>
          <p>Commercial OE sales were up 38% in the quarter, 16% organic if you exclude the EMS acquisition as well as OE payments. Increases were particularly strong in BGA, up 25% organic, driven by continued healthy demand in the mid to large cabin aircraft segment where, as you know, Honeywell has an outsized share of content. And on the ATR side, we saw the benefits of growth in both Boeing and Airbus deliveries resulting from the ongoing ramp in production rates.</p>
          <p>Commercial aftermarket sales in total were up 9%, driven by strong spares growth as well as growth in the repair and overhaul business. And in the quarter, we saw our highest quarterly number of BGA spares volumes, with a record number of scheduled engine events.</p>
          <p>A couple other sub points relative to the commercial aftermarket; as expected, the ATR aftermarket is beginning to recouple to flight hours. Sales growth roughly half the pace of the first quarter in the second quarter, although we still saw more than 2x flight hour growth in our revenue growth in the second quarter. So with slower flight hour growth year over year and spares and R&amp;O volumes now above the prior peak, there is clear evidence that the restocking momentum that we experienced over the last year has begun to subside. And in the second half, consistent with what we have told you earlier, we expect ATR aftermarket sales to recouple to flight hour growth, and that flight hour growth we expect to be in the range of up 2.5% to 3.5% in the second half.</p>
          <p>On the BGA side, on the business and general aviation side, the aftermarket growth is also expected to moderate from high teens to high single digit to low double digit in the second half, following ten consecutive quarters of double-digit increases in spares activities and seven consecutive quarters of double-digit growth for BGA R&amp;O.</p>
          <p>On the Defense and Space side, sales were down 4% in the quarter. Higher international sales and the addition of EMS volumes partially offset Tiger program completion and lower T55 engine sales. Again, this is playing out exactly as we communicated to you and as we guided to you. We're now anticipating D&amp;S sales to be down approximately 4% for the year, better than previously expected as the business continues to execute very well on incremental pursuits both in the U.S. and particularly internationally.</p>
          <p>Aerospace margins expanded 260 basis points to 18.6% in the second quarter. Even when you exclude the impact of the absence of last year's launch payments, margins expanded 50 basis points approximately, driven by commercial volume growth, price and productivity net of inflation, while continuing to ramp investment in R&amp;D to support future growth.</p>
          <p>So with the highlights of Aero, let's now turn to ACS, slide number six. Sales for ACS were $4 billion in the quarter, up 2% on a reported basis, 4% organic, driven by volume growth, the favorable impact of acquisitions, primarily EMS, partially offset by foreign exchange headwinds. Now the top line performance was largely as expected, with good growth in the long-cycle businesses of ACS also offsetting the slower growth in the short-cycle businesses of energy, safety, and security as well, ESS.</p>
          <p>Now as a reminder, ACS represents about 50% of Honeywell's total European exposure. And while we've seen some variability month to month in the short cycle, we continue to convert the long-cycle backlog of both process and building solutions, which is resulting in roughly flat organic sales for the segment in the quarter in Europe.</p>
          <p>Now a little bit of highlights for each of the businesses; ESS up 1% organic, reflecting continued solid growth in security, scanning, and mobility, largely offset by lower sales in ECC, S&amp;C, and also our safety products, driven by weaker overall end markets in Europe. Now we expect more of the same for ESS in the second half, but with the benefit of better comps given the profile of the second half of 2011.</p>
          <p>HPS sales were up 8% organically, solid growth across most regions, particularly the Americas and Middle East. New business activity in HPS was also strong. We saw orders and backlog both up 10% organically in the quarter.</p>
          <p>For BSD, that is the Building Solutions and Distribution business. Sales were up 6% organically. That was driven by strong backlog conversion globally; and also Americas Fire and Security distribution sales, which were partially offset by slower growth in energy and commercial retrofit projects here in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Now turning to margins, ACS expanded margins 50 basis points in the quarter to 13.3%, 35% sales conversion, driven by productivity improvements, mainly benefits from prior period repositioning actions, disciplined cost controls, acquisition integration benefits, particularly those acquisition integration benefits driven by EMS; so very good conversion, very good margin expansion for ACS in the quarter in the face of some challenging macros, particularly European short-cycle macros.</p>
          <p>Now slide seven, Performance Materials and Technologies, revenues of $1.5 billion, up 10% reported, 4% organic, led by UOP and Resins and Chemicals; record segment profit and margins for PMT, 22.6% operating margin in the quarter. UOP continues to execute against record backlog with favorable industry conditions globally. And as expected, UOP saw more measured growth in the quarter with sales up 10% year over year, supported by higher licensing activity, partially offset by lower refining catalyst sales.</p>
          <p>Further, we continue to see robust orders at UOP. They were up strong double digits in the quarter, providing further foundation for future growth. However, we anticipate, and this is very important and consistent with our prior guidance, that year-over-year sales in the second half for UOP are going to further temper as we lap more difficult comps due to the large catalyst shipments that we had last year that don't repeat this year and, of course, the completion of the Petrobras FEED [Front-End Engineering Design] portion of the contract. And again, as a reminder, UOP revenues in the second half of 2011 were up 36% in the third quarter, up 36% in the fourth quarter; so very, very tough comps.</p>
          <p>Now Advanced Materials for PMT performed very well despite strong competitive pressures globally and the regional economic headwinds, particularly Europe and Asia, offset by strong growth in the U.S. Sales for Advanced Materials were up 10% reported, roughly flat organically in the quarter. Plant execution was strong across the board. R&amp;C benefited from higher ammonium sulfate sales. And also caprolactam volumes were strong despite softer market conditions in China. Now weaker end demand in Europe and Asia contributed to lower sales in fluorines, which was partially offset by more favorable sales in the Americas. And overall for the second half, we expect Advanced Materials year-over-year sales to improve, again largely here driven by comps, in this case easier comps, in the second half of 2011, setting up for a little bit of growth in 2012.</p>
          <p>So overall, a really great quarter for PMT, record profit margins despite the headwinds from the phenol plant acquisition and also from R&amp;C pricing. Plant reliability has been very good. PMT has been actively working on executing high value growth opportunities as we look to expand capacity and capability across a number of product lines.</p>
          <p>With that, let's go to Transportation Systems, slide number eight. Now Transportation sales were $900 million in the quarter, down 9% reported, 1% organic, with growth significantly impacted by the lower euro exchange rate. That represents solid performance for Transportation in the face of challenging European macro headwinds, including EU light vehicle production, which was down in the range of 10% in the quarter, and also continued weak automotive sales and aftermarket conditions in that market.</p>
          <p>Turbo sales were down slightly on an organic basis versus last year. New launches, including higher turbo gas penetration in North America, allowed us to perform well in what has become a difficult environment for this business.</p>
          <p>Regionally, Europe was down 7% organic. China was also down again as a result of lower commercial vehicle sales, although we think we've seen the end of the CV destocking in China. We saw sequential growth in the second quarter over the first. We also saw good performance in the U.S., up 16% organic, as well as strength in Japan and India.</p>
          <p>Segment margins for TS were 12.7%, down only 30 basis points, as material and HOS productivity levers more than offset by inflation and the impact of ongoing projects to drive operational improvement in the friction business.</p>
          <p>So now let's turn to slide nine, where we want to give you a minute just to give you an update on our restructuring progress, which was one of the big focus areas, as you know, over the last few years, particularly last year as we deployed the CPG gain. On slide number nine, this is a chart that highlights the over $800 million of restructuring that we've done and funded on a proactive basis since 2009. It provides some important insights on the geography and the status of the projects as we plan for the second half of this year and look forward to 2013.</p>
          <p>Now starting with a regional view on the far left side, you can see Europe has been the recipient of a significant portion of the restructuring dollars over this time period, representing roughly 55% of the funding pool. This has and will continue to better position Honeywell for the current economic situation. It really does put us in a position to significantly improve the cost structure going forward.</p>
          <p>And as Dave mentioned earlier, we funded an additional roughly $80 million gross in new restructuring projects in the first half of this year. These actions were funded through operations. However, the majority of the actions taken since 2009, as you recall, have been funded via one-time gains. It's also important to point out that a large number of these projects, and that's really the second bar on the graph, are still ongoing, many of which are in Europe and somewhat longer payback as a result.</p>
          <p>So we expect approximately $150 million in incremental restructuring benefits in 2012, no change there. And on a preliminary basis, we see approximately $125 million of incremental savings in 2013 from projects that have already been funded. So a good demonstration of the proactive cost management and seed planting for the future that will help us drive margin expansion and earnings growth over the coming years.</p>
          <p>With that background on the restructuring, let's turn to slide 10 and preview our expectations for the upcoming third quarter.</p>
          <p>In Aerospace, we expect continued good growth in the Commercial OE and aftermarket, partially offset by modest declines in Defense and Space. And we expect the ATR aftermarket to track slightly ahead of utilization rates as we lap more difficult comps in 2011. In ACS for the third quarter, we expect a modest uptick in ESS, driven by better year-over-year comps coupled with continued good growth in Process Solutions in BSD as they continue to convert on strong backlogs. We expect a sequentially weaker third quarter in PMT, driven by the normal fluorine seasonality, lower R&amp;C pricing, and as we mentioned earlier, UOP timing. Finally, TS is expected to have another tough quarter, driven by euro exchange headwinds and lower EU light vehicle production declines, partially offset by continued good growth in the Americas as well as the benefit of new launches.</p>
          <p>So in total, we're planning for sales in the third quarter for Honeywell to be in the range of $9.4 billion to $9.6 billion, up 1% to 3% reported, up 4% to 6% excluding foreign exchange; so similar to what we saw in terms of our actual results in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 11, what we've shown here is a comparison now of the third quarter 2011 to the third quarter 2012, and we've done this given the complexity of last year's gain and gain deployment geography.</p>
          <p>So just a little bit of background, again, on this slide; we want to remind you of these geography challenges today in advance; so as you prepare your analysis of the third quarter and as the reported V-percents for income from continuing ops and net income are actually reported in October, it's going to give you a better basis to understand those results.</p>
          <p>So let's go through the highlights of this slide. First of all, you recall that in the third quarter of 2011, we had a $177 million gain on an after-tax basis related to the gain on the sale of CPG reported, and that was reported in discontinued operations. You can see it down in the chart in both the first and second columns in terms of the income from discontinued ops in the first column, and you'll see the deployment of that in the second column. I'll explain that in just a moment.</p>
          <p>We also had a sizable OPEB gain in the third quarter of last year, which was reported in continuing ops. So both, importantly, were fully deployed in continuing ops, as you can see in the center column. So that repositioning and other actions, which also included a small amount of redeployment into segment profit which was related to employee health savings account funding; that was about $30 million. The total of all these actions, the gains and the redeployment, resulted in no impact to EPS in 2011 other than the tax favorability that was generated in the tax rate, which was about $30 million or a $0.04 benefit, which was offset then in the fourth quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>So moving to the right, looking at the operating performance in the third column, you can see that the net income of $832 million and EPS of $1.06 on an adjusted operating basis provide the basis for comparison purposes when you look at our reported numbers, our guidance numbers, and then eventually our reported numbers for 2012.</p>
          <p>So now our third quarter 2012 EPS range guidance is $1.10 to $1.15, so that reflects 4% to 8% growth in the operating earnings on sales growth of guidance of 1% to 3% reported. And again, the geography challenges presenting today in advance so you can prepare your analysis, we're clearly available to talk to you about this and provide more color and more visibility and more transparency on this if you need it as you prepare your reviews of the third quarter for Honeywell.</p>
          <p>Slide number 12, let's now go to the 2012 financial guidance summary. With the first half of the year behind us, we've revised our full-year guidance for 2012 on slide 12, reflecting the strength of our first half results and also what remains for the year. Here are the highlights. While we expect to have continued foreign exchange headwinds in the second half, we'll have some disparity to our normal EPS linearity due to the tax rate differences that we've had quarter over quarter this year versus last year.</p>
          <p>We're raising our earnings per share outlook for the year. Let's review some of the highlights. We now expect sales to be in the range of $37.8 billion to $38.4 billion, up 3% to 5% on a reported basis, 4% to 6% organic. This reflects an adjustment of approximately $200 million attributed to euro foreign exchange headwinds, as we've now incorporated a lower euro assumption of $1.25 in our outlook at the midpoint.</p>
          <p>Now despite the adjustment to sales for the full year, we anticipate segment margins in the range of 15.4% to 15.6%, above our previous estimate, driven by continued strong sales conversion and disciplined cost controls. And as Dave referenced earlier, we're expecting EPS in the range of $4.40 to $4.55, which reflects an increase of $0.05 from the low end of our previous guidance.</p>
          <p>So on a continuing ops basis, adjusted for CPG, we see earnings up in 2012 full year 10% to 14%, no change to free cash flow planning. We're planning conversion now for sales of 100% of net income excluding any pension contributions or NARCO-related payments. We think our guidance demonstrates our confidence in the ability of Honeywell to execute in this environment; as well as it represents, we believe, top tier performance among our peer group.</p>
          <p>Not much new relative to our second half assumptions. But for D&amp;S, which is tracking ahead of previous expectations, we now expect that down 4% to 5% in the second half versus down 5% to 7% previously.</p>
          <p>Let's take a couple of minutes now on slide 13 to walk through some of the key sensitivities impacting the second half outlook and, therefore, the full-year guidance. So what we've set out on slide 13 is the highlight of some of the second half factors that would cause us to come in above or below the midpoint of our guidance range. We think the midpoint reflects the reality of the environment we're in today, in effect the base case assumptions that we're using; noting that at the end of the first half, we're clearly at different stages, with some things running ahead of expectations, like UOP; and other things running slightly behind, like Transportation Systems with harder, tougher than expected European macros.</p>
          <p>So there's no telling exactly how it's going to play out, as Dave said. However, taken collectively, we think we've given you a relevant framing of the key drivers, including the items on the high end, where certainly any one of them is very possible despite the macro environment.</p>
          <p>So starting with the commercial aftermarket for Aerospace, what we've said is we expect that growth to moderate in the second half as we recouple to flight hours. We've seen some slowing growth in ATR flight hours year to date. We're not expecting further slowing, so the outlook here depends on how fast that recoupling occurs. Further, we've seen strong BGA aftermarket performance, driven by record engine maintenance events year to date and RMU sales over the past several quarters. Again, we're expecting growth there to slow in BGA aftermarket based on more difficult comps, although the timing and the rate of that is still unclear.</p>
          <p>UOP, as you know, is a big needle mover. Performance has been stronger than expected year to date. However, we know events can be lumpy, with the timing of a few shipments being a significant swing factor. The other area we're watching closely in PMT is caprolactam pricing, as we see pricing come in since the peak last year, driven by softening global demand. This is something that can move around a bit, so we've included it here as a key driver.</p>
          <p>And finally, as you can see, a pretty wide range for the euro, which we think is prudent, centering on the midpoint of $1.25; but again, who knows on that, but we think that's a relevant range for planning purposes.</p>
          <p>So with all the headlines out there, it's easy to look on the downside. But at the same time, we want to be realistic about the strength of execution that we've had and also some of the highlights and strong points that we're seeing in our businesses.</p>
          <p>So with all the puts and takes considered, we think this represents a balanced view of the remainder of the year. And as Dave mentioned earlier, we'll continue to leverage the cost side, but remaining disciplined as well as overall SFIL flexible.</p>
          <p>So finally, let me make a couple of summary points before turning it back over to Elena for Q&amp;A: obviously, a strong start to the year for Honeywell; second quarter performance again ahead of expectations, adding to our performance track record. However, that's not to say this wasn't challenging, with a number of our short-cycle businesses continuing to face headwinds, particularly in Europe. And we expect this environment to continue for the remainder of the year and into 2013.</p>
          <p>The good news, though, is the Honeywell playbook is clearly working. All the businesses demonstrated strong operating leverage, outperforming their industries because they were well positioned, having continued to invest in growth and productivity in both the previous downturn and the subsequent recovery. And clearly, those investments are paying out.</p>
          <p>We're going to make sure we stay flexible. We're working with our business leaders to make sure we have a plan for both the downside and the upside scenarios. The restructuring actions that I highlighted are going to continue to be a big theme addressing the cost side of the equation. And as we showed you, with a healthy number of projects that we're still executing on, that will deliver benefits in the second half of 2012 and big benefits in 2013.</p>
          <p>And again, as Dave said, we're in the process of setting the stage for 2013. Importantly, we've got a forecast backlog for the year end this year of over $15 billion, slightly higher than where we ended 2011, and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1, which clearly implies another healthy growth year in our long-cycle businesses in 2013.</p>
          <p>And meanwhile, we continue to plan for a tough macro environment during 2013, with global growth around 2%. However, we're confident with our strong global franchises, our balanced portfolio, our focused cost discipline, we're going to continue to outperform again.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me turn it over to Elena for Q&amp;A.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the short-cycle Europe component of it, can you give a little color on how you saw that progress through the quarter month by month and maybe into July? Have you seen things get worse in the last month or two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say it has been pretty consistent, Shannon, in terms of the rate of change there. In Turbo we saw what I would call, Dave, was a fairly just steady erosion of the order rates, but in line really with what we expected. So, Shannon, I would say really it has played out as we expected and as we talked to you at the end of the first quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We never expected much, as you know, Shannon. Fortunately, we planned for it. Unfortunately, it worked just the way we expected.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then one of your low end components of the guidance framework, you talked about project delays as a risk at UOP. Either there or elsewhere, have you seen any evidence of people putting things on hold given the current macro, and how is that factored in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not yet, but we certainly don't want to preclude the possibility that it could happen. So we just wanted to factor that into our thinking, but we haven't seen it yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shannon, just add to Dave's point, we've seen continued strong activity. I've referenced the strong orders and backlog for UOP. So knock on wood, those projects will be financed and we'll execute against those. But the overall macros continue to be very favorable in that business.</p>

          <p>Hey, Jeff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave, you mentioned that margins are trending better than expected. And obviously, a lot of what you've been doing to improve margins has been ongoing for a while, the restructuring, now the comp change. Is there anything in particular, though, that's jumping out to you that's actually driving the better performance? Is it better drop-through on restructuring? Is it mix? Is it just everybody is pulling the oars the same way better than they used to? Is there anything that stands out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd point to two things. One is we're doing the stuff that we always did. And a lot of that seed planting finally does come to roost at some point, whether it's the restructuring work that you've done, the new higher margin products that we've invested in; that all works.</p>
          <p>But the second thing is I would say having the &#x2013; putting in the growth plan the way we did and making margin rate one of the components of it, that has certainly helped to get everybody's attention and focus even more on a lot of that, again, making sure that we've got the results of all that seed planting that we did. And of course, the important thing to do is make sure that we're still investing for the future, doing that seed planting that's going to make sure that we make not just this year but next year, the year after, et cetera. But I think all of that together helped really just take it up a notch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could add, for PMT I think we did see some favorable mix in UOP, driven by some record level licensing and stronger petrochemical catalyst sales in the quarter, which contributed nicely to the margin side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say in terms of the fundamental changes, Jeff, I think the things I was referencing are the overall drivers and why you can continue to expect it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, that's encouraging. Can you elaborate a little bit on the comment on China? Everybody is really reading the tea leaves here for any sign of stabilization or inflection one way or the other. How convincing was it or important was in it your view, and what kind of follow through are you seeing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For us, China, as you know, has been a focal point for ten years. We started off from a weaker position, as you know, but we've been accelerating rapidly, and we've got about 12,000 people there now, so the opportunity for it to just continue growing. Starting with the macroeconomic side, yes, they are going through some difficulties now. But at the end of the day, GDP is still growing pretty well, and we're able, given our low share, I think we'll just continue to grow very well, and you saw it in the first quarter and second quarter. We expect that will continue.</p>
          <p>I'm one of the guys who believes that China is going to continue to make the right decisions. They'll have their ups and downs, of course. They're going through a down now. But overall, we expect that China is going to continue to do well, and we'll do well within that macroeconomic framework that they're developing. I think you've got to bet on them. Historically, they've made the right decisions. I think you'll continue to see them doing that now, whether it's how they talk about the SOEs [State Owned Enterprises], what they talk about in banking, what they try to do to manage the real estate inflation that they've seen. I think you should bet on them, not against them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to add a little bit, given the importance of it, Jeff, just a couple numbers which I think help. We had mentioned &#x2013; David mentioned the growth that we've experienced in the second quarter, 12% organic. It's 14% for the first half. And what we've seen and the theme has really been &#x2013; the underlying factors there have really been continued strength in our long-cycle businesses. So that's again really reflective of those favorable macros and the business positioning, the business positioning that was done and the investment that was done in terms of globalization that we've made.</p>
          <p>The second thing is that we saw sequential improvement one quarter to second quarter in our short-cycle businesses in nearly every one of our businesses. And we also saw some notable pickup. It's not a trend, but we saw a notable pickup in June. And we've seen and in discussions with our business leaders, they're seeing clear evidence of anywhere &#x2013; you could call it either stabilization or improvement in terms of what they're seeing in terms of their markets. So we think that we've got it prudently planned for the second half. But to Dave's point, it's really viewed more over time. And from a macro standpoint, this is going to continue to be a huge opportunity for Honeywell and becoming a Chinese competitor, executing like we are with our technologies to deal with the macro trends, the very favorable macro trends that will continue to play out there. I think that's the way you want to look at it.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Scott.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you talk a little bit about cash reinvestment here? I don't think there have been any comments made about M&amp;A pipeline or buybacks, what you're doing here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The story really hasn't changed for us, Scott, the same sort of thing. We're going to make sure that we pay a very competitive dividend, recognizing the significance of that to our investors that we're a good cash generator.</p>
          <p>On the M&amp;A side, same thing; we always keep a very full pipeline of opportunity, more than we have money for, so we can be very selective about what it is we want to get because, as you know, price makes a difference. You don't have a strategy regardless of price. Price makes a difference. So we're going to continue to stay very disciplined in anything we do there. And when it comes to buybacks, same thing; we'll continue to be opportunistic with what we think makes sense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's move on to PMT. You've had a few great years there. Obviously, Andreas has done a great job. But at what point do you struggle to continue to grow without making some of these bigger investments like a new caprolactam plant or flourines or putting the multi-hundred million dollar investments in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, we're going to be running into some of that over the next two or three years. And I view this more as opportunity than a problem because what we've been able to do in that business to really build on what was a good portfolio is just unrealized. Our possibilities there continue to grow. That's not going to change. However, none of those investments are the sort of thing that will break the bank when it comes to how we think about our cash flow and our cash deployment. None of this stuff is untoward or creates any kind of cash crisis for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I think I get it. Aerospace, can you give us a ramp &#x2013; either one of the Daves, or give us an idea at least of how RD&amp;E ramps the next couple quarters and then into 2013? Just give us a sense of where that spend goes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The R&amp;D spend, and what we've got increasingly, obviously, is higher R&amp;D spend, Scott, this year, as we mentioned. When you look at the second quarter results for Aerospace, it really was favorability in terms of volume favorability as well as strength in productivity, really offset by &#x2013; partially offset by higher R&amp;D.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've only got $1 million, Scott, in the quarter of higher R&amp;D spend, and that's starting to level off given what we've seen in previous quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that comes down in 2013. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the absolute level is going to stay high. I think the rate of increase is going to continue to moderate because we saw the big increase, as you know, 2011 compared to 2010, further growth in 2012 compared to 2011, and we'll see some moderation of that growth in 2013. But it's against the backdrop of a very robust pipeline of wins and successes that we've had. It's an opportunity-rich environment in Aerospace. And we just continue to face significant opportunities.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning, guys; question I guess following up on Scott's question regarding the Aerospace margins. You mentioned that you're going to have much more tempered aftermarket growth. Should we expect to see, be able to hold these levels in terms of margin performance the back half of the year, just comments or a little more color on the mix there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We expect Aerospace to continue improving margins, just like all the businesses. I wouldn't expect to see degradation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think the guidance, just to add to that, Elena, the guidance that we've given for Aerospace in terms of full-year margins remains absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And actually, I think we have some upside relative to our full year as far as Aerospace margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a very good point. When you look, Peter, at the guidance that we've provided in terms of stronger margin expansion for Honeywell for this year in terms of the guidance that we just went through for 2012, really a lot of that strengthening is attributable net of some other adjustments that's attributable to Aerospace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. And then just on Defense and Space, your orders are coming in modestly better than expectations. And you said the back half of the year looks like a mid-single-digit decline versus what I think you previously expected. Can you give us a little more color on what you're seeing there? Was it just one particular program?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really a number of things. The way Mike Madsen I think would describe it is a series of singles and doubles. He's just really executing very, very smartly against a set of opportunities, frankly, that really are available to us both, again, domestically and internationally. There's a lot in the aftermarket. There's a lot in key offshore markets, Peter, and that's really what we're doing. There's nothing we would point to in terms of any major program win or...</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To summarize Dave's point, it's just better execution in an area that we didn't really focus on as much as we could have in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just related to that, there's an expectation that you're going to see another long Continuing Resolution starting in October. And there's obviously the looming threat of sequestration. I don't think anyone really ultimately believes that will happen, but have you done any advanced planning in preparation for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, because you just can't know. After what we saw happen with the debt ceiling, you can't assume that reason is going to prevail. So it's important to be able to plan accordingly. The good thing about our situation is it's not really &#x2013; none of our businesses are solely focused on defense generally. It's the same products, the same services, just going into a different sales channel, which gives us a lot more flexibility than others might have. So, yes, we're fully prepared in the event that happens.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Steve Winoker from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning and I'd echo the nice quarter comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First question just on the pension contribution impact from the ERISA and highway funding bill, can you maybe talk through a little bit of how, in any way, does this change what you're planning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It doesn't really affect our planning. It affects our obligations. So what it does is it reduces the required ERISA-based funding over the next three to five years. But in terms of what we're planning, we're going to continue to be prudent here, to be out in front of this in a low interest rate environment. We think it's smart to be able to do it on that basis. So it certainly is a favorable event, but we don't see it as changing our basic plan of being prudent and being smart and basically measuring this a quarter at a time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the difference between what's required and what's smart here is we've tried to always stay on the side of what's smart, and we'll stay there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right. And the second question around the currency, the FX impact, I know you &#x2013; clearly we see the translation side of this, a bit on the transaction side. Maybe talk about at what point &#x2013; how strong does the dollar have to get before you start to think about a real legitimate competitive impact of this, or is it just too far away to even bother with?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You've got to think about it, but I don't see something here if it [the euro] went to $1.10 or something like it used to. I don't see that having a big impact on us competitively around the world because we're everywhere as it is. So it's not something I worry about, let's put it that way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Even at $1.10?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right, and then maybe just a question to follow up on the contingency actions and the ESS range. Contingency actions, how quick can you &#x2013; if things start to materialize through the quarter and you talk about implementing these things within the second half, is it really a fourth quarter set of outcomes here, or do think you actually get third quarter runway on actions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what Dave &#x2013; maybe I'll answer it this way, is what Dave has asked each of the business leaders to have, and this is nothing new, is to have in their top right-hand desk drawer the steps that they would take in the event of &#x2013; fill in the blank &#x2013; in terms of volume decline or assumption change. That's just smart and, we think, executed very well and came out stronger as a result of the 2008 &#x2013; 2009 downturn. We've put that into our playbook and enhanced our capability and our leadership plan as a result. So I think the fact is we've got the response to be able to do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just lastly, the ESS range seems relatively tight versus everything else. And you mentioned that it's comp based at the low end. Anything else that gives you comfort on a relative basis sort of in that 2% to 4% range for page 13?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I get the point. Yes, I'd say there's a range of possibilities there, and the 4% is as likely as the 2% depending upon how the second half evolves, so it's tough to know. I would say one of the things that we do have, as you know, is last year was a very warm winter. And as a result of that, comp is lower in some of our key product lines. So if it doesn't develop that way this year, that will make a difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, okay. Thanks, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Stephanie, we have time for one last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our final question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks for squeezing me in, Elena. Dave, you've been pretty vocal on the fiscal cliff. You had the op-ed last week in FT. You were on CNBC, I think, talking about these issues. Are you seeing anything in your short-cycle businesses in the U.S. that is prompting you to become incrementally more bearish on the impact of the impasse?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say it's tough to know how things are going to evolve in a political environment but, as you know, I've been very vocal about CEOs need to speak up here because just seeing how the debt ceiling discussion evolved a few months ago, none of us in the business community ever expected that they could be that reckless overall. And as we look at the fiscal cliff, that's an even bigger looming issue, and it's important for all of us to be speaking up now to make sure that politicians get it, that this is not just a political advantage issue they're dealing with, but they're dealing with lives of a lot of people as they to-and-fro on this stuff.</p>
          <p>So I think that's one of the things that's contributing to uncertainty amongst all companies when it comes to &#x2013; do you want to hire, do you want to invest. So I think there's a greater chance of an overall slowdown if we don't start to see some thoughtful movement and discussion about what are they actually going to do. So I would say it's less of a specific Honeywell item than it is an overall tone that starts to evolve in the economy if everybody starts thinking they could be reckless again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's clear. And then just if I just look at your second half buildup by business, I think it's on slide 10. You've been pretty &#x2013; sorry, on slide 12. I think you've been more cautious on &#x2013; sorry, slide 13. You've been more cautious on European LV production than consensus, but you're looking for second half to be flat to down 5%, which I think is a bit more positive than consensus. I'm just wondering what's driving that more optimistically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Consensus historically hasn't been all that accurate, as you know. It seems like if global GDP is growing 3% to 4% a year pretty consistently, the forecasts look pretty good. When you run into something where it varies one way or the other, they're not very good at handling let's say the variability in something like that. So we find that second guessing where it's going to go has actually been more productive than relying on those consensus forecasts. It's why in the first half we prepared for something that was worse than what everybody was saying, and I think we were right. And in the second half, we think it's reasonable &#x2013; one of the reasonable outcomes here is that it could be flat. So we're going to continue to plan for &#x2013; think of this as a decline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so that's consistent with the original plan. And then just finally, you called out ammonium sulfates and caprolactam as drivers of strength in PMT. Now those are your two most levered businesses to the U.S. nat-gas price. I'm wondering how much of a benefit was the lower input costs in being competitive against some of your global competitors in those businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not that big a deal. We already have, as you know, an extremely good cost position in that business. It does get enhanced some with natural gas pricing being low. But it's going to be &#x2013; our cost position globally is the best in the world, and that's not going to change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really, Nigel &#x2013; it's really a function now of the global economy and the demand drivers there. Obviously on ammonium sulfate, the overall continued growth in terms of agricultural demand, the team there has just done an outstanding job of developing new customer, new markets, so we'll just continue to do that. But as long as those macro factors stay positive, as Dave said, we're very, very well positioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that is very clear. Thanks, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thank you again for your participation in today's call. I'd like to turn it over to Dave Cote for his closing remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>As you might expect, we're very happy with how we've performed in this difficult environment. We expect that difficult environment to continue and think that's the right way to plan. But you can also expect that we'll continue to outperform, and the root cause is the same as it has always been. Planning for a difficult environment is, of course, an important element. But just as important is all the seed planting we've done over the years in new products and services, new geographies, and process initiatives. And we're going to stick with that game plan. We'll continue to plan conservatively and we'll continue to invest in the seed planting that positions us to perform well in good times and the tough times.</p>
          <p>So we're pleased with what we've been able to accomplish and we look forward to a lot more in the future. And for Honeywell, the best is still yet to come. Thanks.</p>
