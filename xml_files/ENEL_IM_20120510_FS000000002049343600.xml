        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Luca Torchia speaking. Welcome to the First Quarter 2012 Results Presentation for SpA Enel.  Today we are here with the Chief Financial Officer, Luigi Ferraris, who will make the presentation and then a Q&amp;A will follow.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. Let me hand over to Luigi.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Luca and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to our first quarter 2012 results presentation. First, as usual, I would like to start by doing a quick analysis of the general macroeconomic trends in the areas in which we operate.</p>
          <p>Mature markets in Europe continue to experience low growth rates, with stagnating and decreasing GDP, as well as lower industrial outputs. This trend is expected to continue during 2012 as well. In particular, electricity demand evolution during the first quarter of the year has been weak in areas like Italy and Spain, showing declines of about 1.9% and 1% respective.</p>
          <p>In contrast, emerging markets are experiencing a general higher macroeconomic growth mainly sustained by a very important demographic expansion, urbanization process and resources availability. In particular, Brazil, Chile and Colombia are showing electricity demand growth ranging from 4% to 7%. Let me also remind you that our assumptions for our industrial demand are positively impacted by increasing electricity demand in the last parts of the period.</p>
          <p>I will now give you an overview of our key financial highlights on slide number three. Group EBITDA decreased by 2.2% versus the first quarter of 2011. This is mainly the result of the increasing contribution of our Latin American division, which has been more than offset by decreasing Italian operation, mainly Generation and Energy Management division, as forecasted in our industrial plan presentation.</p>
          <p>Group net income amounted to &#x20AC;1.180 billion or 1.4% less versus the first quarter of 2011, mainly as a result of the above-mentioned lower EBITDA, partially compensated for by the positive contribution of the capital gain obtained by the placement of the 5.1% Terna stake in February this year for a total amount of &#x20AC;180 million. Net of these effects, Group net ordinary income equals to &#x20AC;1 billion. Net debt has increased during the first quarter 2012 by about &#x20AC;1 billion to &#x20AC;45.6 billion. I will provide more details on this later on as usual.</p>
          <p>Now, moving to slide number four. Net operating profits decreased by about 4% mainly due to the combined effects of lower EBITDA and higher depreciation versus the first quarter of 2011. Our net financial charges stand at &#x20AC;635 million registering a decrease of &#x20AC;103 million versus the first quarter of 2011. This variation is mainly the net effect of the following: higher interest charges of &#x20AC;80 million due to the combined effects of higher gross debt and the increase of its average costs. Our normalized average annual cost of gross debt stands at 5% versus 4.8% of the last year. This has been more than offset by the decrease of &#x20AC;183 million in other interest charges mainly as a result of the previously mentioned pre-tax capital gain of about &#x20AC;180 million from the Terna stake sale.</p>
          <p>Finally, Group's tax rate in the first quarter 2012 has been equal to 35% in line with the first quarter of 2011. Taking out the above-mentioned effect of Terna's capital gain, the recurring tax rate has been about 38% and this of course includes the effects of the Robin Hood tax. On a normalized basis, our annualized tax rating is about 35%, 36%.</p>
          <p>Let me now update you on forward sales on slide number five. In Italy, we have hedged about 90% of our 2012 production at an average base load price of &#x20AC;75 per megawatt hour and about 45% of 2013 at an average base load price of about &#x20AC;78 per megawatt hour. In Spain, we are fully hedged for 2012 and 30%, 35% for 2013 at an average price of about &#x20AC;56 per megawatt hour for 2012 and &#x20AC;55 for 2013, excluding mainly ancillary services and national toll remuneration.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, we are 75%, 80% hedged for 2012 and 60%, 65% for 2013. In Slovakia, we are 100% hedged for 2012 and about 40% for 2013 at an average price of &#x20AC;55 per megawatt hour, for 2012 and &#x20AC;52 for 2013.</p>
          <p>Let's now have a quick look at how our overall EBITDA evolution on slide number six, now as usual I will go through the EBITDA of each of our divisions in detail, starting with Generation &amp; Energy Management Italy on chart number seven. Overall, divisional EBITDA in the first quarter 2012 was equal to &#x20AC;450 million declining by &#x20AC;118 million or about 21% versus the first quarter of 2011. This was mainly the result of a decrease in the generation margin of &#x20AC;81 million, mainly caused by lower hydro volumes and lower clean spark spreads partially compensated for by higher margins on coal thanks to higher output equal to 3 terawatt hours.</p>
          <p>This has been partially compensated for by the positive results in trading and gas margin and a decline of other items of &#x20AC;80 million in which the positive contribution of the ancillary service has been more than offset by some positive non-recurring items which affected the first quarter, 2011.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to the EBITDA evolution analysis of the market division on chart number eight. EBITDA totaled &#x20AC;176 million, roughly maintaining the same strong level of profitability of last year. This has been possible thanks to the small decline of &#x20AC;5 million in the free market unit where lower electricity margin has been compensated for by higher gas margins and volumes sold both in electricity and gas and has a slight increase of &#x20AC;2 million in the regulated electricity market related to higher prices and margins partially compensated for by the ongoing reduction in volumes sold to the regulated market related to the liberalization process.</p>
          <p>Moving now to slide number nine on domestic Infrastructure &amp; Networks division, EBITDA in the first quarter 2012 amounted to &#x20AC;954 million, a decrease of &#x20AC;30 million or 3% less versus last year. This is the net result of the following: The positive effect of &#x20AC;6 million in the energy margin mainly thanks to higher number of clients which increased by about 100,000 units versus 2011, connection fees in line with the previous year as we are still connecting the backlog of 2011 solar photovoltaic capacity and a decrease in other items by &#x20AC;34 million.</p>
          <p>Moving now to slide number 10, on the International operations, EBITDA decreased by &#x20AC;26 million versus last year and it takes into account the perimeter effects of the assets sold in Bulgaria during the second quarter of 2011. Excluding this effect, EBITDA increases by 1.3%. In particular, Slovensk&#xE9; elektr&#xE1;rne recorded an increase of &#x20AC;17 million mainly thanks to higher volumes and prices.</p>
          <p>South and Eastern Europe recorded a decrease of &#x20AC;54 million explained by the above mentioned perimeter effects of Bulgaria and lower results in Romania for &#x20AC;22 million mainly related to connection fees and lower energy margins. France and Belgium decreased by &#x20AC;14 million mainly due to lower prices effect. And finally, Russia increased by &#x20AC;25 million thanks to the generation supply activities which accounted for &#x20AC;11 million and &#x20AC;14 million respectively.</p>
          <p>Before analyzing the remaining divisions, let's have a look at SeverEnergia which is consolidated through equity method into our numbers. Let me also remind you that SeverEnergia is a joint venture between four large industrial partners: Enel with a 19.6% stake, Eni, Gazprom and Novatek. The fields owned by SeverEnergia through its subsidiaries contain a large reserve base located in an area where 90% of the Russian gas comes from. The fields are well-connected to existing infrastructure leading to lower production cost.</p>
          <p>Gas production started from Slovensk&#xE9; field in April this year, we expect production to ramp up quickly with the development of the second production train from the Slovensk&#xE9; field at the end of 2012 and the startup of two other fields at the end of 2015. By 2016, the fields will produce more than 15 billion cubic meters of gas, and by 2020, we expect to reach production plateau at over 30 billion cubic meters of gas per year out of which 20% pertains to Enel's stake. Let me also remind you that the current total book value of our stake in SeverEnergia equals to &#x20AC;305 million.</p>
          <p>Let's now focus on Endesa results on slide number 12. First, let me remind you the numbers we report in this slide and in the following one are the results of the application of Enel Group's accounting principle which might differ from Endesa's principle due to local standards.</p>
          <p>The Iberian division has recorded an EBITDA decrease of &#x20AC;26 million. This has been the outcome of a decline of &#x20AC;5 million in the liberalized business, mainly explained by the increase in energy costs related to the higher level of Spanish fuel prices versus last year and higher commodity costs as well as the decrease in the last resort tariff, partially compensated for by higher prices to final customers.</p>
          <p>Regulated business decreased by &#x20AC;47 million mainly due to lower distribution revenues after the recent changes to the regulatory framework. And finally, other items were &#x20AC;26 million mainly related to lower personnel costs.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to Latin America on slide number 13. The Latin American division has recorded an EBITDA increase of &#x20AC;87 million. This has been mainly the results of the following: A decrease of &#x20AC;83 million in the generation business, mainly due to lower margins in Chile and Argentina partially compensated for by higher volumes and prices in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru; an increase of &#x20AC;82 million in the distribution business, mainly thanks to higher volumes distributed in all the countries in which we operate; and finally, an increase of &#x20AC;67 million in other items mainly related to the positive one-off item of the Colombian patrimonial tax which impacted the first quarter 2011 results for an amount of &#x20AC;109 million.</p>
          <p>And now let's review Enel Green Power on chart number 14. EBITDA decreased &#x20AC;11 million or 3% versus first quarter 2011, and it takes into account the fair value revaluation of net assets in Seattle and Salt Lake plants' expropriation which impacted positively the first quarter 2011 by a total amount of &#x20AC;39 million. Excluding these effects, EBITDA increases by about 8%. In particular, Italy and Europe declined &#x20AC;4 million due to lower hydro production in Italy, partially compensated for by higher volumes in the rest of Europe. Iberia and Latin America increased &#x20AC;17 million, many thanks to the result of higher prices in Iberia for &#x20AC;12 million and Panama for &#x20AC;5 million. North America increased &#x20AC;13 million thanks to higher volumes partially offset by higher OpEx.</p>
          <p>As far as our net debt is concerned, you see on slide number 15 that net of discontinued operations, overall net debt stands at &#x20AC;45.6 billion. The &#x20AC;988 million increase during the period is mainly due to higher CapEx and the usual negative seasonal effect evolution of the working capital, which recur every first and third quarter each year, mainly as a result of the group billing profile. Our liquidity position amounts to &#x20AC;27.4 billion and allow us to cover maturities throughout 2014. Please refer to the annexes for further details. Moreover, cash in from the tariff deficit securitization this year has contributed &#x20AC;1.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Now to conclude, as you have seen all throughout this presentation, first quarter 2012 results were solid and very much performing, despite an ongoing unfavorable economic scenario, particularly in Western Europe. In the light of this, we are well-positioned to match full year 2012 targets even considering the most recent regulatory changes in Spain.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention and now let's open the Q&amp;A session.</p>
        </plist>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. We start the Q&amp;A to remind you that we have people connected both from the web and conferencing in via mobile and fixed phones. And this time the first comes from Javier Suarez, Nomura. So please Javier, if you hear us you can start your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Luca. Many thanks and good afternoon to everyone. The question is just &#x2013; the first one is just related to your target for the year 2012. The Spanish government has obviously announced some changes in the remuneration for some of the activities of Endesa. You have mentioned that the company has the capacity to reiterate the 2012 target that you presented in the last strategic presentation. Would you be so kind of giving us some details on which division should be compensated for the damage suffered because of these regulatory changes in Spain? Which is the &#x2013; and a related question is, which is the space that the company see to react to additional regulatory changes in Spain and how this could affect to the taxes for 2012?</p>
          <p>Second question is on the cost of financing. I think that in one of the slides of the presentation you have mentioned that your cost of debt should be at around 5%. I just questioned myself is as a consequence of the last downgrade in the credit rating, we should not expect an increase in this cost of financing through the year 2012?</p>
          <p>And the third question is on one of the slides that you have presented, you have shown the details of the prices that you have locked for the year 2012 and 2013 is in the slide number five, I just was questioning myself if you can give us also some details on the margins spark spreads and dark spread that you are expecting to get particularly on the Italian and Spanish market? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Javier. Let me start with the second question. The cost of financing was 5%, well, we do not expect any increase during the course of the year. And we have not been penalized by the most recent downgrade of Standard &amp; Poor's since we believe that this possible downgrade was already factored in the spreads that we have used in the past, namely in our last issuance, which I remind you are, had been placed at the cost which was on average lower than 5%. So we feel confident that the 5% will be stable, which by the way is lower than what we have given as guidance during the course of the business plan presentation.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the margin that we do have in our forward sales, of course, we have to refer to Italy namely the Generation &amp; Energy Management business. We have reported during this year, as I mentioned during the Generation &amp; Energy Management presentation, a reduction in our spark spread, clean spark spread in the region of capital euro, so this year we are running at say &#x20AC;6.96 that's what we have in our backlog. And if we look at the full year guidance, we should be more or less in the same region. So I would say something close to 6%.</p>
          <p>On the other hand we have positive news when it comes to the dark spread, which has been higher than originally planned. We are running a dark spread in the first quarter results in the region of &#x20AC;40 plus per megawatt hour, &#x20AC;45 per megawatt hour. And this is the result also of the incremental production that we had during the first quarter of this year. Because let me just highlight that during the first quarter of this year we had in Italy in the generation field in Energy Management division something close to 2 terawatt hours of lower hydro production which have been more than compensated by an increase in our coal production which has ended up with 3 terawatt hours plus versus last year. This, coupled with favorable commodity costs allowed us to have a dark spread in the region of say &#x20AC;45 per megawatt hour.</p>
          <p>When it comes to 2013, well, we said also during the course of the business plan presentation, we see spark spread which could stay in the region of &#x20AC;5 per megawatt hour, and we see dark spreads reducing a little bit in the region of &#x20AC;35 per megawatt hour. This of course is very much influenced also by the weather condition because should we have a dry period, we might have additional opportunity and additional positive results. Having said that those are the guidance that we expected in the numbers and for now I would say we are there or even better when it comes to the dark spread.</p>
          <p>So where do we expect an improvement in our division? We expect to do better in Latin American operation. I think you have seen the solid sector results that we reported in the first quarter. In particular, in the distribution business, the natural growth of these countries is contributing to the improvement of our results. We expect it to be better even in the International division as well and also I would like to stress the positive performance of the market division in Italy.</p>
          <p>So, if we look at our results at the end of the quarter, we compare this with what we have projected. Of course, we have an advantage that we think should be enough to balance the most recent regulatory decision adopted in Spain. Of course, this is not taking into account the possible future decision that might occur in the next couple of months.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Luca and good afternoon to everyone. Just quick two questions. The first one is on the net debt. You have explained perfectly what is happening on the quarter and the increase on the net debt. Basically here I would like to know which is the reference level that you will expect for year-end when you recover that part on the negative working capital as you have experienced during the first quarter?</p>
          <p>And the second question would be looking to international activities, particularly France and Belgium because we have seen during the first quarter quite a weak performance versus last year. And I wanted to know what is going on there, if you are seeing a lot of pressure on margins, is basically thermal spreads, is supply activities, if you can tell us a little bit what is happening there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Well, let me start with your first question. What do we expect in terms of net debt at the end of the year? We confirm our target of &#x20AC;43 billion. This will be the result of the action that we are planning to do, also on the disposal plan that we are going to finalize during the course of this year as a first step. Second element is that the usual recovery of the working capital in the last part of the year. So we are fully in line with our projection. And for now we feel that we should be able to confirm the target of the year-end and the cost would not be &#x2013; will be in line of 5% as I said before.</p>
          <p>When it comes to France, well you know that in France we have the availability of both capacity and access to the final markets. The reason why we are seeing some reduction in margin is due to a decrease let's say in lower prices which as usual we have already sold forward last year. So we are in line with our business plan and with our target of the year. There are no major surprises and this is purely I would say price effect. And of course a reduction in the margin taking into account that we have capacity available also from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (26:41) on the basis of the agreement that we do have.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have now Alberto Gandolfi, UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. It's Alberto Gandolfi of UBS. I have four quick ones in terms of &#x2013; well, actually three because the first one is part of the same question. Talking about the free cash flow generation and debt, the operating free cash flow is only &#x20AC;1 billion in the quarter and I guess the explanation is really the working capital swing. Can you please elaborate on how much was that in billion euros?</p>
          <p>And effectively, moving on now to some non-recurring items, I didn't quite get in GEM and Networks the &#x20AC;80 million negative and the &#x20AC;34 million negative, those were negative swings, but how much is in absolute terms the non-recurring items that we saw in Q1 2012 for these two divisions?</p>
          <p>And then a third one, in terms of &#x2013; we've seen some develop &#x2013; some improvements in Latam versus what you had been projecting, but there's also couple of negatives, namely demand particularly in Italy but also in Spain. It seems to be much lower than the one you have been assuming in your industrial plan. How &#x2013; that doesn't seem to show through your numbers now, but are you worried for the rest of the year were this trend to continue?</p>
          <p>And very, very last on the big picture. We are reading a lot about the separation between Eni and Snam. We're reading a lot about the potential reform of the gas market. There could be changes on import pipelines, there could be longer term changes on the infrastructure. Can you please elaborate what's the latest you've been hearing from the government? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alberto. Let me start with the first question. The operating cash flow in the first quarter has been correctly as you said &#x20AC;1 billion. What happen in the first quarter? We have the impact of this so-called billing per file at a Group level which is equal to &#x20AC;1.6 billion. Then we have a decrease in the accounts payable as a result of again of seasonal payment that we normally do in the first quarter since, as you can remind, in the last quarter of the last year we had an increase of our CapEx spending we sorted out with an increase of the payable and then in the first quarter we normally do the payment, and this could be in the region say of &#x20AC;1 billion.</p>
          <p>So altogether, if we would like to normalize the cash flow, we should talk about something in the region of &#x20AC;2.5 billion, &#x20AC;3 billion per quarter. And that's what we normally project by the end of the year and that will allow us to, as usual, to meet the target.</p>
          <p>Non-recurring items, so if I understand correctly your question, the first one regards Infrastructure and Network. Infrastructure and Network, there is a negative &#x2013; you are referring to the minus &#x20AC;34 million, other, if I am right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, here, we have an increase of the cost of personnel for, say, &#x20AC;12 million, &#x20AC;15 million which is due to the increase of the unitary cost which has not been as usual offset by the decrease in our workforce. Of course, as you can imagine, the change in the regulation in Italy is also going to affect the possible action of reducing the personnel cost and this, by the way, has been fully implemented and reflected into our business plan numbers. Therefore, in this first quarter, you see this increase but you still do not see the action that we put in place in terms of in-sourcing activities that will become operational by the end of this year and fully operational next year. So there is just an increase in the unit cost of personnel.</p>
          <p>And then we have some other minor items including a change in the perimeter due to the sale of our majority stake in the distribution business in Northern Italy, in Valle d'Aosta, a lovely skiing area, where we had a 51% stake in the distribution pieces that we have sold and this is equal to &#x20AC;4 million, &#x20AC;5 million. So if you put all together these minor items, you reach this &#x20AC;34 million.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Generation &amp; Energy Management Italy, well, the non-recurring items, if you want to call so, were in the area &#x2013; in the other in 2011 and in particular what we are talking about is the following. I was referring to a positive refund of CO2 emission credits for <mark type="ph" /> Slovensk&#xE9; Elektr&#xE1;rne (32:07) power plants that we received last year. That was a portion of free allocation of CO2 certificates and a green certificate portfolio optimization. In other words, we sold last year some green certificates and this basically is the region of this change in the line, other, and I would say these are the most important elements.</p>
          <p>Then you mentioned electricity demand Italy and Spain. Well, if I may you are not exactly right when it comes to Spain. I would say that more or less we are in line with our full year 2012 budget guidance which is minus 0.8% versus 1% actual that we foresee now. On the other hand, you're right, in Italy, the evolution of the electricity demand is worse than originally expected.</p>
          <p>Now it is too early to say if this trend will continue and I would say that when it comes to 2012 the decline in the electricity demand should not impact our performance in Italy. And also thanks to our forward sales strategy, I feel comfortable to say that 1% decline is something that we can still manage thanks to our forward sales strategy and our competitiveness of portfolio assets that we do have namely the coal, they hydro, so it is still manageable. Definitely, anyway, we are facing a weakening of the market condition in Italy, but if we talk about 1% worse than originally planned will not be an issue for us.</p>
          <p>The last point was referred to the gas in particular to the Eni and Snam Rete Gas. We commented many times, our view is basically still the same. So, what we're talking about here, there's a change of course in the property. Snam Rete Gas is &#x2013; as you know, the mission to manage the transportation or the fundamental change could only come if we are going to increase the storage capacity. It's not an issue of increasing the transport capability, the fundamental point if we want to see a structural change in the gas market is increasing the availability and the liquidity of the spot market because in this way, we do not have flexibility as of today.</p>
          <p>As of today, even in these days, we're &#x2013; we have a very weak level of gas consumption both for residential purposes, industrial and for the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:09). That level of the liquidity of the spot market is in the region of 10%, 15%. So, still marginal. The fundamental change will come if we see an increase in the regasifier and in the storage capability.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Antonella Bianchessi, Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Just one quick question on the generation market, you have hedged everything, you sold forward entirely your volumes as far as Italy is concerned, you made &#x20AC;450 million in Q1 despite the drought. Can you update on your guidance for the full-year 2012? You gave &#x20AC;1.3 billion on the back of the higher load factor of coal. Do you see any upside on this front? Then the second question always on the generation. I wonder if you can tell us of any progress, any things you are doing to renegotiate your gas contract with Algeria, if there any discussion ongoing and if you expect any sort of news flow on this front?</p>
          <p>And the other thing is on the debt. You have &#x20AC;9 billion of cash in your balance sheet so is this &#x2013; can you clarify when you will need to come to the market with additional financing if you think it's going to be something like 2013 or 2014 onward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Antonella. Well, I think that's &#x2013; this stage is too early to update the target of Generation and Energy Management, Italy. Let me also remind you that we have benefited over an extraordinary February month because of very extreme weather condition, which have determined an increase in the activity of our ancillary services for an amount higher than originally expected.</p>
          <p>For sure today, I feel confident to say that the &#x20AC;1.3 billion is definitely a floor. It's definitely a solid number. But I would like to wait June results to eventually provide you with any update.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the negotiation with Algeria with regards to the gas supply, well, they are ongoing. Of course, I cannot tell you today what is going on. I hope in the next months to be in a position to update you about possible improvements, but I would say that it's too early to say.</p>
          <p>Last point, debt and in particular liquidity, well, it is true. We have &#x20AC;9 billion of cash available but also &#x2013; let me also remind you that we have built this liquidity position in a quite recently at least the March 31 books reports a level of &#x20AC;9 billion which was the results of our funding activity equal to &#x20AC;9 billion which ended up with the issuance of our bond retail that we cashed in during the month of March. Debt liquidity, of course, will be used also to manage the cost of debt.</p>
          <p>So we have some flexibility now that we can use in order to optimize our level of cost of debt by repaying some credit line without, and I think this is very important, without changing our liquidity profile. As I said before, we want to keep our coverage of next maturities beyond 2014 still there. And therefore, we will manage to use this liquidity on a very careful basis in order to optimize our cost of debt. When it comes to the possible need of issuing bonds in the future, we do not need, because of what I said, we are fully covered up to 2014. As usual, not now but in the future on an opportunistic basis if there would be favorable market condition, we could decide to talk to the market again, but for now it's not in the agenda.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Susanna Invernizzi, Barclays.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Just a couple of follow-up questions. First of all, on your net debt guidance I would like to understand which sort of flexibility you have to meet your guidance in case we might see a worse than expected macro environment or there may be a worse than expected working capital trend. So what is your CapEx and if you have any flexibility on that point? And the second question, if you can please remind me which other level of average cost of debt you have actually included in your guidance to compare it with the marginal cost of debt we see today? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, where are the flexibility in case of a further deterioration of &#x2013; of a deterioration of the net working capital? Well, we still have some flexibility in our CapEx profile in the second quarter of the year. That could contribute to eventually balance some deterioration of the working capital that, by the way, for now we do not see in our activity.</p>
          <p>I would like also to remind you that we have been working very hard to select a portfolio of customer, let's say, less exposed to the fluctuation of the crisis. But of course, I mean in tough times we have to be ready to have different option. One option is working on the CapEx side. Of course, we cannot do more on the working capital because if there will be a deterioration on that side that will have to be managed.</p>
          <p>Let me also remind you that we have secured our customer base through our factoring ability, so we already sold forward. We put in place a program, which is going to last for the next three years. And therefore I feel I would say protected at this regard. The average cost of debt, the guidance that we have in our business plan is in the region of 5.2%, 5.3%. That's what we have in our business plan. So 5% is slightly better than originally planned.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We have now questions coming from Enrico Bartoli, Fidentiis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good evening. Three questions, if I may. I'd like to go back to the coal production, the load factors from coal in this quarter. I understand that you don't want to comment on the guidance for GEM for the full year. But this high level of load factor was it included in your expectations in March? And could you elaborate if this situation is mainly due to the low hydro production in the quarter or you think that is going to continue over the next quarters?</p>
          <p>Then second question is related to Spain. Could you update on the discussions, if you have any, with the government there about the reform of the electricity market? What do you think that the main threat could be from possible measures by the government? And, finally on Slovakia, I saw that your forward sales prices is going down next year. Could you elaborate a bit on the reason of this trend please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start with the second question about the discussion with the authority and with the government in Spain with regards to the second wave of regulatory changes. Well, I'm not in a position to say &#x2013; today to anticipate any possible outcome. For sure, our position is quite clear. We believe that we have already paid a very high contribution to the rebalance of the tariff deficit through the first wave of regulatory decision taken by the government. When it comes to the second wave, we believe that actions should be aimed at, again, increasing the tariff and cutting subsidy somewhere else and not in the distribution business or in our business where it's &#x2013; we believe that it's very important that a company like Endesa continue to invest in the country for the benefit of the country itself. Having said that we expect that there will be a decision by the month of June &#x2013; by the end of June. It is very important that the decision is taken quite soon so that also the CapEx program can be properly addressed.</p>
          <p>Load factor in the first quarter when it comes to coal, well, definitely what we have seen in the first quarter I would say can be considered a peak because we have had to use a huge quantity of coal capacity because of the lower hydro conditions. So I don't believe that this is going to be repeated unless we are going to foresee much of a further low in hydroelectricity. In the month of April, we have seen a partial recovery of the dry season, and so we expect that this hydro production could increase. Anyway, the load factor has been high quite in the first quarter of this year. We are talking about equivalent hours of 6,400 hours which means 70% or something like that, which I think is very, very high, higher than planned in our business plan in our budget.</p>
          <p>Third question about Slovakian prices, well, when it comes to the volume, we have of course hedged our expected output in line with our plan and with our plan, internal policy. When it comes to the price, the decline that you have seen is the result of the evolution of the German market. Slovakia is very much depending in terms of price definition, on what is happening in the German markets and this is basically what we have reported here and this is in line with our business plan as well.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Good evening. Two questions if I may; the first one is regarding the ancillary service market in Italy. You commented that in Q1 the performance was flat. I think that in your guidance you were expecting the ancillary service market to weaken materially during the course of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Anna Maria, sorry to interrupt you but we lost for a while. So, would you mind repeating the question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The first question was regarding the ancillary service market in Italy. I understand in Q1 the performance was flat and in your guidance you were actually expecting the numbers to be down. Can you just give us an indication what are your expectations at the moment for the year? The second question is regarding Endesa liberalized business performance. The results reported by Endesa for Q1 basically show a flat performance and in the plan you have a significant decrease for the rest of the year. So can you give us an indication what are your expectations there and as well what is the operating impact you expect? And, also last question, going back to regulation in Spain, do you see any risk for the Ireland remuneration in the upcoming re-discussion with the government? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start with the ancillary services margin. You're right, in the first quarter of this year we have seen an improvement of something close to &#x20AC;70 million which we consider for now not repeatable during the course of the year. That's why one of the reason I feel in a position to say that we have to confirm the target of the entire year, even if &#x2013; for now I would say it can be considered a floor, let me repeat it. What we do instead in terms of full year, I would say that normally we range from &#x20AC;400 million, &#x20AC;450 million. That I think could be still valid. Of course, it's less predictable than we used to see in the past because of the volatility that we have now in the Italian market because of the increase in the solar photovoltaic capacity and because also of the weakness of the demand. So, there is more volatility than in the past in the generation business. But, we believe that &#x20AC;400 million, &#x20AC;450 million is something that we can consider still reachable and that's what we have factored in our numbers.</p>
          <p>Endesa's business performance Q1 has been quite solid. Why should they further decline in the second part of the year? That, if I understand correctly, is your question. Well, first of all, in the first quarter we have also recorded the effect of the positive decision of the Supreme Court with regards to a bonus sociale and that is something that, if I'm not wrong, is in the region of &#x20AC;100 million that we would have passed. And, in the second, third and fourth quarter, we should see the full impact of the regulatory changes adopted by the government quite recently. On top of this, there is also a &#x20AC;40-million one-off item that will not be repeated in the following quarter. That's why we still believe that there will be a decline in line with our budget expectation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Ireland regulation, well &#x2013; we are, of course, waiting for the final decision. We do not have evidence that that could be part of the decision, but of course, the regulator is looking at every possible solution to reduce the tariff deficit. We do not expect it will be part of his decision but I cannot rule out a deficit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just to clarify on the bonus sociale &#x2013; so you &#x2013; you didn't book it this year and you actually booked back the bonus sociale off the last few years, is that what you said?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have included in the first quarter &#x20AC;30 million, something like that, of bonus sociale. We have not included the past, but we paid last year, which is something in the region of &#x20AC;100 million. That will be included in the report, in the coming months, very likely. And on top of this, we also had other non-recurring items in the region of &#x20AC;40 million to &#x20AC;50 million that we do not expect to be repeated. That's why, this &#x20AC;80 million in some way do not allow us to say that we are going to have the same performance in the future quarters. So, for now, we confirm the full year budget guidance that we gave in the business plan, even including, as I said before, the effect of this new regulation.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Roberto Letizia, Equita.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good evening. I'm just wondering if you can clarify something on the dark spread, if I got the number correctly you are indicating an underlying dark spread for 2012 in the region of &#x20AC;45, but then you're driving next year to &#x20AC;35, so &#x20AC;10 less, regardless of the fact that you even have &#x20AC;3 additional in the hedged price for next year. So it's a &#x20AC;13 impact, which I struggle to justify it on the underlying commodity market, nor in an eventual additional cost on the CO2. So, if you can just please better describe what are the dynamics below the &#x20AC;13 reduction in the dark spread on operating? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, let me be a little bit more detailed in answering you. First of all, the guidance &#x2013; the price guidance as I gave you, &#x20AC;78 per megawatt hour, is referred to 40%, 45% of forward sales. And most of these forward sales have been done in the past. And we do not expect they are going to be repeated. So, if we look at 2013, full year price is &#x2013; we should expect a reduction in the wholesale prices. That's why we are not going to have &#x20AC;78, but we are going to have something less. And that would be the outcome of the activity that we are going to develop in the coming months. And if we look at the forward curve today, we cannot see &#x20AC;78, but we see very likely &#x20AC;74 per megawatt hour.</p>
          <p>Second, when it comes to the dark spreads, I mean, you're right the commodity is expected to be declining in the coming months. The very, very, I would say positive, dark spread that we have recorded in the first quarter of this year is also the results of this incremental production that we have done because of the specific situation of this quarter. And therefore, we cannot consider &#x20AC;45, &#x20AC;46 per megawatt hour dark spread as the rule.</p>
          <p>We are expecting for the full year 2013 dark spread, something lower, in the region of &#x20AC;40 per megawatt hour. That's what, basically, I try to tell you, so we have to split between what is already in our backlog and what could be the evolution of our full year dark spread, coal/gas price.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Just a follow-up question in the switch from coal &#x2013; from gas to coal, which is already happening despite the low hydro production. How are you managing to divert the gas? Because I understand you're under take-or-pay conditions? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, gas has been already done. We have already diverted some gas to other markets. For instance, in the Eastern parts of the world. So, we're already acting in this way in order to manage also, or to improve, the flexibility of our portfolio. And, in particular, we have done this by managing our Nigerian gas supply, which has a very competitive price, and that allowed us to transfer this gas at a good price, as you've seen also in our results. So, we've been able to manage the reduction in the load factor of the gas combined cycle that we have seen in the first quarter of this year. Let me remind you that our gas combined cycle are running at 20%, 25%.</p>

          <p>Yes. Hi. Sorry. Just a follow-up &#x2013; was very quick and was on the generation business in Italy. You claim you are fully hedged on carbon. Is it correct that &#x2013; so you have zero cost in the P&amp;L right now for carbon? Or are you using any CDMs and having to mark-to-market? So how does it work the accounting exactly? Thank you.</p>
