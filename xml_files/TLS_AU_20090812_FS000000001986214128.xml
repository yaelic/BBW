      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. My name is Ben Spincer, Director of Investor Relations. I'd like to welcome you to Telstra's results for the Full Year 2009. In a moment I'll hand over to our Chief Executive and CFO to run through some of the numbers and then obviously, we'll have an opportunity to take some questions.</p>
          <p>We have people here in Sydney, we have people on the webcast and people on a conf-link. We'll take questions both from the floor here and also from the phone after David and John have spoken to you.</p>
          <p>So without further ado, I will hand over to Telstra's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. David Thodey. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ben. Well, good morning. And my great pleasure to be here to deliver the Telstra 2009 results.</p>
          <p>Let me start by saying we have delivered very strong results that are in line with guidance and despite the tough conditions, we will be maintaining our dividend, which we think is a good result.</p>
          <p>We have achieved everything we committed to do in 2009, and our business remains focused on our target of $6 billion of free cash flow for 2010. We remain optimistic about our business. The demand for our products and services remained very strong right across the market despite the downturn. So despite these tough trading conditions, we are growing top line and bottom line. And as John keeps reminding, we have a very strong balance sheet which we're delighted about.</p>
          <p>So I think the strategy we took four years ago has really delivered tremendous results, but we are entering into a new stage. We've really got to drive the benefits from the incredible investment we've made in transformation. Now that's both the IT transformation, but also the network transformation. And I want to stress that because driving operational benefits, real value from those investments is critically important and it's got to be across both areas.</p>
          <p>Telstra's transformation has been long. Look, it is complex, but it's been a very, very interesting journey. And I think as I reflect on the business that I've been in here now for 10 years, it was a very necessary transformation we had to go through, because it has really set us up as we go forward now, I believe, for the next 10 years.</p>
          <p>But a critical part of this, and something I've talked about quite a bit, is that we have to focus on customer service. Customer service is not just a catchcry, it's about the fundamentals of what it is to run a good business. Good customer service means that customers don't churn. Good customer service means that we are able to drive increased ARPUs and drive increased penetration and share. So as we move forward, customer service is going to be something that we have to focus on to drive shareholder value.</p>
          <p>The economy is slower and we do have regulatory changes and also the NBN that are on the horizon. And as we've looked at that, we have had to implement some specific strategies to make sure that we're ready to compete aggressively in the market. Later on I'm going to discuss the national broadband network, but I want to start by saying that we share the vision that the government has for a Fibre To The Premise solution. And we share the view of the government that we have to engage. They're willing to engage and so are we. But we are engaging based on one premise, and that's about driving shareholder value, protecting shareholder value, critically important for us as we go forward.</p>
          <p>So what I thought I would do today is to discuss four things. Firstly, I want to go through our results, give you a bit of perspective on that. John will give you all the details. I do want to talk a bit about how we see the market and our demand out there in terms of responding to the market conditions. Then I want us to look at what our priorities will be for the next two to three years. And then also talk about our guidance for the next 12 months.</p>
          <p>So let's now turn to our results for the last 12 months. As I said, we have delivered strong results and it has been in difficult times. We believe we have got a solid foundation as we move forward into this year. Sales revenue was up 2.9%, total revenue up 2.7%. And if you normalize for the KAZ sale, it was a 3% growth, which was right on guidance. Of course, if you look at the normalization of the KAZ, it does not impact either the EBITDA growth or the EBIT growth.</p>
          <p>Expense growth was just 0.6%, and I've got to say expenses are being measured very, very tightly. And of course, labour costs have been declining, which has been a key focus for us as we have run the business.</p>
          <p>Now declared final dividend of $0.14 coupled with the paid interim dividend of $0.14 is now substantially covered by our free cash flow and our free cash flow was up another 13% to $4.4 billion. Profit after tax was up to 10 &#x2013; by 10.3% and our margins reported, on a full year basis, were 43.2%.</p>
          <p>As I said, we believe these are strong results in a tough economy and we have delivered on what we committed which was our guidance. John is going to take you through more details on that later on. What I want to turn to now is to give you some colour across how the segments performed &#x2013; the customer segments &#x2013; and also the product portfolio. So let's have a look at that.</p>
          <p>At a retail level, our growth was 3.4% and on our international portfolio it was 14%. This more than offset the declines in our wholesale business.</p>
          <p>Let me just go through very briefly, just a few highlights of each of the customer segments. Firstly, the consumer group, led by David Moffatt, had a strong year. Their second half was stronger than their first, but I want to stress, David and the team have been working diligently as they have rolled out the new CRM systems, all the training, the education, process changes has been an enormous focus of the whole team as you know really driven out the transformation systems. I can't stress how important this is, because you have got to do that while continuing to add value in the market, drive out the differentiation, put out the packaged offerings. David and the team have done a tremendous job in this and then to see a slight growth in the second half was very pleasing.</p>
          <p>Also, we have been driving out all our program around the T[life] stores. This is about changing the retail experience. T[life] stores are a tremendous feeling when you walk in there. They've got a good feel about them, there's &#x2013; we are attracting customers in there, and so this has been a key of part of building our distribution capability. T[life] is a critical part of our retail presence in the market. So the consumer group, strong result at 3.1% and I'm confident as the team, consolidating around the new core systems, that we're going see improvement as we move forward.</p>
          <p>Now, to the small business market and Deena Shiff, 4.7% growth. This is, I think, a tremendous result. As you know, small business is the heart of Australia, and they've had it tough over the last 12 months. There has really been a lot of pain out there and Deena and the team have really responded well. Remember, one of the big differences for us in the small business market is our tremendous coverage in the market. The team has an enormous reach right across Australia, working with TCW and Brett Riley. This has been a tremendous partnership and something we've got to continue.</p>
          <p>We are seeing some changes in the small business market. They are taking up more wireless products, wireless data especially, up nearly 31%. And we are starting to see small businesses adopt IP more fully than we have in the past. IP access was up 44% year-to-year, so you are starting to see some changed dynamics as small businesses are starting to do things more online, starting to really have a greater need for doing things while they are on the move.</p>
          <p>So it's quite an exciting time for the small business group, but I want it to be considered small business hits are tough. But we are very committed to this market. We are committed to building long-term relationships with small business right across Australia, because it really is the heartland of Australia and what we do. So a strong result, not as strong as the previous year, but we think a very good result.</p>
          <p>Then the Enterprise and Government group, led by Nerida Caesar, who, by the way, I should quickly say, ran the Wholesale group just for a month and she &#x2013; before that she was running the National Sales group, had 2.9%. But when you normalize for the KAZ sale, her overall results were 5% year-to-year. In the Enterprise sector, that's a very, very strong result.</p>
          <p>Again, seeing quite a bit of change in that market. The adoption of wireless products are very strong, especially wireless data. One of the interesting statistics in the Enterprise market is 44% of our mobiles revenue is actually coming from wireless data. I think that's probably a world record. But you can see the changing dynamics in the Enterprise as they are doing more and more in the face of their customers, so we have got people &#x2013; more people out there doing things on the move and our Next G network really does hit a very nice sweet spot.</p>
          <p>The other big thing is around IP access growth. That was up 23% and that follows the trends we had in the prior year, up to $582 million, and we are seeing very strong adoption of IP. Now remember, IP is like the heart of a business, because that's what connects every branch, every location, it's about how they transact their business, so this is exciting. And IP and, of course, we are going to see Voice IP, further applications, cloud computing in this market, and, of course, I am very familiar with that market.</p>
          <p>So we are encouraged by that, and, of course, we had strong sales results in that market, as you see. Strong wins at CBA, Australian Catholic Network with the Catholic Church. So we are very pleased. We had sales of $1.1 billion, that's net incremental sales for last year, so very strong result. So right across that retail segment, 3.4% growth, very good.</p>
          <p>Sensis, I have got to say, world-class performance, 5.8% growth. As you know, we have talked a lot about this business and when you look at the directories business around the world, there is no directories business like it. And so Bruce Akhurst and the team have really done a tremendous result.</p>
          <p>Print directories grew in a weakening market, with an 8.2% increase in white pages and yellow print revenue growth. That is outstanding. White and yellow online sites have experienced strong growth, with white pages up 107% and yellow online up 15%. This business remains core to us. It is a very strong business. Bruce and that team continue to move that business forward, managing the complexities around print and classifieds and they are doing very, very well. So, a very strong result.</p>
          <p>Paul Geason, now running the Wholesale group, has come in after a year of negative growth last year, which was primarily driven by the continuing ULL bill, which you would have expected and also DSL revenue declines. This was expected, we planned for it. And we are delighted we have kicked off the year with a very strong win with AAPT, which has been a longstanding customer, and I think positions us well as we look forward.</p>
          <p>Let me now just talk to international because that's an important part of the portfolio. While 90% or 91% of our sales revenue is domestic, international operations continue to grow and it's very important for us as we move forward. Let me just make a few quick comments. SouFun growing at 29% in local currency. The other China assets PCP, Autohome, Sharp Point, ChinaM all are meeting the expectations. I was up there just recently, had a good review with the team up there, and we remain very encouraged about those investments. ChinaM and Sharp Point provided combined revenue of about $50 million, but the interesting point was EBIT of 32% for the first five months. Very strong result.</p>
          <p>TelstraClear in New Zealand delivered in local currency 2.3% growth, so we're pleased about how that is performing. You will see in the accounts there is some normalization if you take out Trans-Tasman, but in local currency doing very well and competing strongly.</p>
          <p>And, of course, in Hong Kong, CSL New World, it's a tough market in Hong Kong, but we have invested in the Next G network. It's a world-class network. It's probably the fastest wireless IP network in Asia at the moment, and we believe Tarek Robbiati and the team are well placed as we move forward into this year.</p>
          <p>So, you can see across the segments strong results, and we're competing vigorously, and we are also focused on serving our customer.</p>
          <p>So let's now turn to the product portfolio, and let me just give you a few highlights. John will pick up little bit more of this later on, but I do want to give you a little bit of the colour here.</p>
          <p>Firstly, mobile services revenue growth 10% with wireless data up 31% to $2 billion. This is a very strong result, very strong result.</p>
          <p>Notably, 30% of our domestic sales revenue is now wireless, mobile retail SIO's are up 9%, 3G SIOs up 45%. And I want to stress the movement of our base across to the Next G network is very important. Wireless broadband SIOs are now over 1 million, we had a 99% growth year-to-year and mobile ARPU blended was up 4.8%.</p>
          <p>Now, a very important inflection point happened this year. And I want to talk a little bit about that because it's important. Mobiles revenue now is bigger then our PSTN revenues. That is the first time in a year that we've ever had that happen. So we are now $500 million of mobiles revenues greater than our PSTN revenue. So we're very pleased about our mobiles revenue and we think that this is a good base as we go forward.</p>
          <p>In terms of IP and data access, again this portfolio is very important for us as we move forward. We have seen 8.1% growth and that is driven off our growth last year, so we think this IP platform is going to be a key growth platform as we move forward. What's interesting as you look at that is the IP access growth was 25%, so as you're driving out more access SIOs then you can drive out your usage on top of that. So another great year for the IP access portfolio, IP portfolio and, of course, it's about managing the traditional legacy product as we migrate to the new IP platform.</p>
          <p>PSTN growth, well, I should say decline of 4.9% was sort of line with what we expected. What's important to note here is that the retail revenue decline was 2.5%, so coming back to the wholesale decline that's where we have seen this migration across to LLU and the DSL decline as well.</p>
          <p>Fixed broadband with growth of 16% with &#x2013; was driven by primary ARPU increases, 2.3 million retail broadband SIOs. ARPU increase was 6.5% so we're up to $57.7 as more customer taking premium ADSL2+ and cable extreme plans. So, what we're seeing in that broadband portfolio is people migrating to the faster speeds and we're seeing the ARPU increase, which we think is a good outcome. But I do want to stress, we're going to manage this share and revenue growth very, very carefully in terms of profitability as well.</p>
          <p>I do want to mention Mick Rocca and the team, who are driving out Managed Network Services. Besides doing all the hard lifting out there in the field, Mick and the team are doing very well. One key part of the portfolio is this Managed Network Services portfolio, which Michael has taken responsibility for. We have seen 5.3%. Now what this portfolio is, is the managed services. It's around managed WANs managed radio, IP telephony and all of the new set of managed services. This we believe will be very important for us as we go forward, both in the enterprise market but also in the business market. So, we see this as a platform for growth as we move forward.</p>
          <p>Now to media and content, 9.8% growth. As I've mentioned, this was underpinned by the Sensis growth, which had strong growth, but also our media business is doing very well. It is continuing to meet expectations. It generated almost $100 million of domestic revenue last year.</p>
          <p>Now, this 42% increase across BigPond and our Next G customers is an important element to focus in on, because we are seeing our customers wanting to load down more movies, more music, more games, more news and more sports. So, this is very important, because we're stating to see a change as customers are really wanting to engage with different types of content and this is a focus we have to have as we move forward.</p>
          <p>Finally FOXTEL, which continues to deliver very strong results. They have got great momentum and we're delighted with their strong results. Double-digit revenue and EBITDA, subscribers up and churn down. FOXTEL is a very strong business. Our content continues to provide us with a great platform as we move forward.</p>
          <p>So there are the key highlights of 2009. I want to stress, this is a strong result and I want to recognize the executive team and all the Telstra staff. They have done exceptionally well in a tough condition. We started the year not expecting the global downturn. We have managed through that. We've adapted to the situation and to come out with a year at 3% growth, normalized for KAZ, is very encouraging. Plus free cash flow growth 14%, plus the profit growth, we are very encouraged and I do want to recognize the team today.</p>
          <p>Right, let's talk about demand in the market because that's important. And I just want to touch on a few highlights because sometimes you forget, as you look at what the fundamentals of the business are like, you have got to look what the market is doing. Now just a few things to highlight. Firstly, 24 million services we have right across all our platforms, they grew 2% year-to-year. On a base of 24 million, that's encouraging.</p>
          <p>Broadband customers, as I mentioned, reached 5 million for the first time and, as I said, wireless broadband customers up 99% to 1 million. We have had tremendous growth in this IP platform. Remember, as you build the platform, you've got to build and attract all the access points from your customers, so you have got to be out there selling these products. IP MAN and IP WAN up 31% and 21% respectively. And then when you put across that the Managed Network Services, that's a very strong result, and we think positions us very well competitively. But the demand for these products is strong.</p>
          <p>Mobile data revenue, as I mentioned, 31% year-to-year growth. Internet advertising revenues across Australia and China for the first time hit $0.5 billion. Traffic on our mobile network is doubling every 19 &#x2013; not let me say it again, the traffic on our mobile network is doubling every 19 months, 11 billion mobile minutes and 8 billion calls on our fixed network: these are strong results. So when you look at across that on the demand, the need for communications products and services as is strong. It has been impacted by the economy but we think the underlying demand is strong.</p>
          <p>Now from a market share perspective, we estimate that we've held share across fixed voice, revenues and SIOs. So we think we've held share there. However, we think we have had a slight loss in our mobile SIOs and revenues.</p>
          <p>Now, I want to just pause here for a moment because this is very important. We are balancing share and revenue with profitability. We look at this every month. It is a trade you always do and we are going to optimize this to the best for our shareholders. You can spend a lot of money attracting a lot of customers and get top-line growth. To drive revenue growth and profit growth is what we are focused on. The number one objective with customer service is for this company, profitable revenue growth, not growth at any cost. And I want to stress that because this is a key focus for us as we move forward.</p>
          <p>So as you look at that strong demand, let me just turn now to the tremendous cornerstone of our strategy, these two networks Next G and Next IP. Sometimes you've heard the rhetoric around Next G and Next IP. And sometimes I don't think it's really reflected. The incredible asset that we have, these two networks &#x2013; integrated networks are the foundation of what the core of this company is about. You know when you look at the numbers now there's been a significant change, mobile fixed retail, IP and data access now contribute 44% or $10.2 billion of our domestic sales revenue. That is significant, that is significant.</p>
          <p>So, as I also said, we're seeing strong growth in wireless broadband, and as I said, broadband is 5 million. I could remember three; four years ago that was a dream. So, we have had significant change.</p>
          <p>But we are seeing this change in our product portfolio. And we think, within the next three to five years that, coming off these platforms, about 65% of our domestic revenues will be off these platforms.</p>
          <p>Now, this is very important to understand. So the aggregation across mobile, fixed retail, broadband, IP, and data access, that reflects the very strong demand for these products and services and has been the catalyst for the revenue mix change.</p>
          <p>So, two world-class networks provide the foundation for our growth as we move forward. And also we are in a unique position. The integration of wireless and fixed, two next generation networks, really does position us in a sole position in this market. And more and more we are seeing our customer saying, "I don't care if I'm connected wirelessly or from a fixed environment, I want the same experience."</p>
          <p>This is very important in terms of our strategic position. And then when you add in the content and what we're doing in terms of media, I think we have a very strong platform to move forward.</p>
          <p>So, just to summarize that section, demand for our core product remains strong. We're encouraged by that and we are going to continue to manage the best in share and profitability will move forward.</p>
          <p>Now, I want to talk about the priorities as we move forward. And as I introduce this I know that you may be you're saying, "Hey, David, you've been in the job 90 days. What's your strategy going forward?"</p>
          <p>Before I get into priorities, I want to just signal, we've had a complete review of our strategy, a refresh of our strategy under way for now two-and-a-half months. We've been going through from the basics looking at what we need to do going forward, very importantly working with the management team and with the Board. We are going to share with you the result of that strategy review, refresh in October at the Investor Day.</p>
          <p>What I want to talk about today is the priorities that we set going forward, and they fall in to fall. Number one is customer service. I am going to talk a lot about this today, because it is so important for this company. We are committed to delivering a strong, differentiated customer service.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I will come back and talk a little bit about each of these in a movement, operation improvements. I've already said, its one thing to do a transformation, it's another thing to drive the value from the transformation. You put in new IT systems, it does not mean that you immediately get benefits. Its hard work, very hard work, because you've got to get down, redesign processes, you've got to train people in the new systems. And we are absolutely committed to doing that.</p>
          <p>In many ways, while l will never say the John McInerney, the hard work is yet to come, because the IT guys have done a tremendous job. But in many ways, the work is still ahead of us.</p>
          <p>In the transformation work is now moving in the business as usual. Because the IT systems are there, we now need to drive the value from them right across the business. So, that's going to be our focus to really drive value from this new IT architecture.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> to have product differentiation, the integrated products and innovation remains at the heart of what we do.</p>
          <p>This is very important and our aspiration, our objective to be a world-class telecommunications company has not changed. Not just the best in Australia, but the best around the world.</p>
          <p>See, if we can truly leverage off this wonderful fixed infrastructure, the mobiles infrastructure and these wonderful assets we have in Sensis, we are in an incredible position. We have incredible scale and real differentiation.</p>
          <p>So if we can take that and really meet customer needs, we believe that we can move this business to a whole new dimension. But it is also about pricing for value. While we want to be the best, we also want to be able to justify the premium we charge in the market, not just because of the Telstra brand, but because it's a differentiated experience, because we can actually articulate the value that we bring. So, very important as we move forward.</p>
          <p>And then, of course, regulation NBN, this is a critical part of what I am doing. This is all about getting regulatory certainty for this business as we move forward and protecting shareholder value. As I said, we continue to talk to the government and we are trying to look to see how we can help them realize their vision for a Fibre To The Home. But as I said, our focus is on our shareholders and our fiduciary responsibility.</p>
          <p>Now, if we can do these four things, we think we can really drive good growth as we move forward and also strong shareholder value.</p>
          <p>So let's just move on. I wanted to <mark type="audio gap" /> a bit of time.</p>
          <p>So let's talk about customer service firstly, because as I said this is at the heart of what we do and I think many people might say, "Hey, this is a personal mission of yours, David." Well, here it is that I got to stress this <mark type="audio gap" /> this is about good business, it is about good business, because if you deliver good service, customers stay with you, in fact, they are very forgiving.</p>
          <p>We've already taken a number of steps around customer service and I am spending a lot of time on this myself by talking to customers, responding to customers and talking to people around the company because it touches every part of our customer.</p>
          <p>These things aren't going to change overnight. It's just that our company is too big to see instantaneous change, but we've started the journey and I can't stress how important that is. This is not theory. I have been around too long and the management team has been around too long. It is about tough work. It's about every time a customer contacts us so they have a good experience. From this is, people sometimes say well, that's already seeing ready results but if you don't get customer service right your results go the wrong way. So we are taking a number of key actions. I just want to quickly touch on them.</p>
          <p>We've already put millions of dollars into China. <mark type="inaudible" />, specifically, in terms of the call centres and the retail shops. This has been an enormous project and don't underestimate that you have got to train people to deliver good customer service, you have got to train them with the new tools, so you actually deliver a differentiated experience. So now we can talk to a customer and have all their products and services in front of the consultant as they are talking to the customer.</p>
          <p>Also we've taken some bold moves. Customers have problems and the one thing when you got a problem is you want someone to respond quickly. We've set new targets across the business for every complaint that comes in, our target is to acknowledge it within 24 hours and respond in some way with a solution or with a great action plan within five working days. This is important because it serves to change the culture and the dynamics of the company, very important. Also, we have set a target for all Telstra employees and a bonus around customer satisfaction.</p>
          <p>Now let me just talk about this for a moment, because this includes all our call centre staff, every technician, every engineer, right across the business. Now what this is about is measuring them, measuring us on the voice of the customer. This is not an internal measure. We will be doing surveys to determine what our customers say about our service and only then will we recognize that performance, very important.</p>
          <p>We also made a few organization changes. We have got new centre for customer service and satisfaction and also we put in place a customer satisfaction counter which I share. So these are important organizational changes, just signalling the change.</p>
          <p>Also we have got to have some quick wins, because you got to get momentum. We have already looked at one of the critical points for many of our customers is when you move residence. So you are moving with your PSTN service and your broadband service and often you have had to talk to different parts of the business, try to get that coordinated. Immediately we looked at that and we said okay, how can we get one person out there to get that done, get you online and talking as soon as possible and David and the team and with Mick Rocca have done a tremendous job in doing this. So this is all about speed, about responses, about really driving out for our customers a differentiated experience.</p>
          <p>These may be small steps. But I want to stress these are important steps in the terms of long term program. We got a long way to go. But we are very committed to getting to the end of this journey. And we will talk more about that because this is important. We are going to have to invest in this to get the results that we need.</p>
          <p>Okay, let's now turn to operational improvement. As I've already talked about that, we've done a tremendous amount of work in the IT area and we still have got some legacy products to exit as we go forward. So we've got to keep driving this up and we have still now moving into that stage from &#x2013; we have talked about transformation. Just moving into a business as usual stage. I don't want to, in any way, imply we don't have a lot of work to do, because the team is still working very, very hard. But now it's about driving the benefits from this.</p>
          <p>I want to give you some statistics, because you can see up here on the chart, you can see this progression across the last few years. As of last weekend, we have 9.2 million customers across on the new platform, and we're getting better and better at doing it. That's tremendous result. The guys worked all weekend and very encouraging. Also 17.8 million of our services are now moved across from the old platform to the new. And so, we are starting to see the real benefits driving out. When you drive &#x2013; still working with two platforms makes it very difficult. We've got to get that work finished as we move forward.</p>
          <p>So we think that's &#x2013; over 70% of the services were migrated and customers &#x2013; we still, as I said we still have a bit more to do but we'll work through that. So we've got to get this consumer migration finished, and David and John are focused on that. We do need to start to move into this OSS layer. For those who know the technical side, this is very important. This is about enabling, making the team to manage the networks better. That allows you to do remote diagnostics better, about reducing the number of truck rolls.</p>
          <p>Very important as you put in that management layer across the business, and of course, extending the abilities of the Seibel platform, the CC&amp;B platform is critically important right across the business, so Deena and Nerida are looking at that as we move forward. Also, John keeps reminding we've got to turn off the old legacy systems, and he's done a great job of doing it <mark type="audio gap" /> reducing &#x2013; really sunk capital, get rid of it, move forward and John and the guys are doing good job with that.</p>
          <p>But I can't stress enough. This is not easy stuff. I've been around too long, I've been involved in too many IT and network transformations, there is nothing easy in here. Easy to talk about, but harder to do.</p>
          <p>And I've got to say, I do not know a better IT transformation. I've looked at banks over the years, I've looked at big retailers who have come out with big statements around IT transformation. When John will talk about it later on, that we're within $200 million of what we estimated in terms of the overall transformation program. That's very good and we now got that platform out there.</p>
          <p>So, I do want to give credit to the team. We have got more work to do, we do and we'll get that done and it's about setting this platform for the future. If you can get this right, it gives you the ability to be faster to market and really drive out the changes and deliver the benefits that we have talked about, so very important.</p>
          <p>Let me talk about the third one, quickly because this has been at the heart of what we have done and this is being about the engineering guys and the product guys really building differentiated products, you know, integrated products that really give true innovation.</p>
          <p>Now one of the great challenges that we have is providing a unique experience across fixed and wireless. This is a seamless experience. This is sort of like the strategic Holy Grail, and we are making progress, tremendous progress in this area because this drives true differentiation and integration.</p>
          <p>You can see on the chart there, you know the common interface across all these platforms, so they will be able to have ease of use. It is so difficult about one click, one touch but this is about simplicity. It's about making the experience stronger. So when you've got that foundation, an integrate platform of Next G and Next ISP, plus putting across this content and a great user interface you have a tremendous differentiation and then this is whether you're at home, you're on the move, you're in the office, no matter where, you are overseas, common experience, common interface, which drives a true end-to-end experience.</p>
          <p>Now critical to this is our relationship with Cisco and Microsoft, and you've already seen some announcements in this area. We think they &#x2013; that relationships &#x2013; those relationships to be very important as we go forward. But I've got to stress our objective is to keep customers connected, that's what we're trying to do and to drive usage, because if you have people connected then they drive usage, they use content. What's the outcome of that? Well, lower churn, more usage and satisfied customers and shareholders. It is what it actually gets back to. So over the six, next six months you're going to see some exciting announcements from us. We are very enthusiastic about this product differentiation. So very important part of our priorities as we move forward.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn to the fourth one: NBN and the regulatory environment. Now as many of you know, a couple of months ago we made a very important decision, and that was to get back to the table. That is, we wanted to talk about the issues. And we have a firm belief, if you're not at the table, well, you can't talk about the issues. So we're engaging constructively with government at the moment. We're going to work through this. It's going to be methodically. It's going to be with integrity and absolute transparency, because we've got to drive a good outcome for our shareholders, also our customers. So, as we really strive to meet their needs, also the people of Australia and look at what the government's objectives, we're going to get to an outcome.</p>
          <p>Now, I want to just be clear. The implementation study has only just been kicked off, and it probably won't be completed for what, six, nine months. So it's very hard to get full visibility of all the issues. So it's very hard to get definitive statements, but it's going to change, it's going to change by the week, by the month, and we are going to be in continued dialogue with the government to see how we can get to an outcome that are in the best interests of all parties.</p>
          <p>But, the final determinant for me, for the Board, for the management team, is about protecting shareholder value. We had no other objective. Customer service is there, but it is all about protecting shareholder value. So I cannot stress it enough, that's the way we have discussed it with the government. The way we talked about it, and the way we'll move forward.</p>
          <p>Now let me talk to regulatory environment. During the same time as the NBN announcement, the Commonwealth also issued a discussion paper, that many of you would have read, about the possible futures around regulation of our industry and specifically of Telstra. The government received many submissions about options, and have that canned as many options and is considering what options they are going take.</p>
          <p>It is &#x2013; indicated already that the outcomes of this review, once they are determined will result in legislation and we believe that legislation will be introduced before the end of this year. Our submission focused on two key things <mark type="audio gap" /> anything else this company needs regulatory certainty. That is what will give us the environment in which we can move forward with certainty. So you know the extent of these regulatory changes and I can't really comment further, because we don't know what it would be. John, will actually go through some of the scenarios and he will talk a bit more about that. But I suggest we remain actively engaged with government and talking through the options.</p>
          <p>So I just want to summarize: they are the four priorities we've got. And we believe they are in the best shareholder interest as we move forward where our customer service driving operational improvement, product differentiation and also addressing NBN and the regulatory environment.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to 2010 guidance. Now, we have spent a lot of time discussing guidance. It's a tough economy and I think you would have seen from many announcements already, it is very difficult to give you certainty about the future. But we felt it was important to try to give you some sense of what we say the trajectory is like as we move forward. I want to start by confirming, we will continue to grow top line and our bottom line and we are focused on our target of $6 billion of free cash flow.</p>
          <p>We've looked at the challenges in the market. And we have already spent a large amount of time looking at how we can best respond to these market conditions. We have looked at product differentiation. How we can drive out real difference in terms of our distribution strategy. Looking at services, technology inflection points and, of course, managing costs in a mature and careful way. We are very mindful of our outlook and it's really impacted by four things. Now John and I will talk about this but it's very important that you get these parameters.</p>
          <p>Firstly, the economy is likely to continue in a slow &#x2013; slowish environment. We may see some growth later in the year, but as you look forward we don't see significant change and of course unemployment is the thing that probably hits us more than anything else.</p>
          <p>As unemployment flows through we see that in calling patterns. We've also, as I've talked about, experienced some price driven competition. Now we are very considered about our response to that, a lot of people would talk about that. But we are about profitable revenue growth. So, we are very considered about not going after the top line growth at any expense.</p>
          <p>Also we've seen some delay that we've talked about before in terms of the benefits flowing from the IT transformation. We think that we are behind and we won't see as much as we had expected in 2010. And as I've talked about we've got to get this customer experience right, so we've got to invest.</p>
          <p>So they are the four parameters that we, and we have looked at our guidance. I'm very confident about the future. I'm confident about our growth and I'm confidant about our bottom line results, so we're going to contain &#x2013; continue momentum as we move into 2010.</p>
          <p>We managed cost very well in the second half of the year of last year and we are going to continue to do that. We're going to be considered about what we spend our money on. We're absolutely committed to the target of $6 billion of free cash flow.</p>
          <p>However, it's got a slightly different revenue mix than what we had anticipated. Both in margin and in CapEx, these are all changing therefore we've given you some change in our guidance. This guidance excludes the impacts of any unforeseen changes from the regulatory environment, NBN and any unexpected outcome from the ACCC review of our declared services pricing.</p>
          <p>So let me summarize before I pass on to John. We are focused on three things going forward, and we remain confident about them. Firstly, financial results. We are going to grow top line and bottom line, and our free cash flow equation remains very, very strong.</p>
          <p>Customers. Customers are at the heart of everything we do. We are focused on our customers, and we want to provide to our customer an experience that they value. Also, the National Broadband Network and regulatory environment, I've just already spoken about that, but we are committed to remaining open and in dialogue as we go forward, but we are focused on shareholder value.</p>
          <p>I also mentioned that we are currently doing a refresh of our strategy. We will take you through that in October. We think this is an exciting part as we start to plan out our next three to four years.</p>
          <p>So I want to finish by thanking the executive team but also all the staff at Telstra. They have really worked incredibly hard, driven very strong results in a very tough environment and I can't stress how pleased we are with the results. We think this is a very strong result as we move forward. We remain confident about the future. Despite the economic downturn, the demand for our core products and services remain very strong.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me now pass to John Stanhope who will take you through these in more details. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David. I know you all want to get to questions quickly, so I'll be as quick as I can be. I am delighted to tell you we have reported in line with our key financial objectives or guidance for the fiscal year '09. And these results are great achievement, given the impact of the &#x2013; on the Australian economy of the turmoil in the global financial markets, something none of us have really experienced before. And as I've said previously, we continue to be resilient, but not immune to the economic conditions that we are in right now.</p>
          <p>First, I'll take you through the key numbers as David has referenced some of those. Sales revenue grew 2.9% to $25.4 billion, and total revenue grew 2.7% to $25.5 billion, and if you adjust for budgeted revenues not received due the sale of Kaz which was sold in April, you may recall, the total revenue grew by 3%, which was in line with our guidance from February.</p>
          <p>Tight control of OpEx continues with operating expenses up just 0.6% for the year, and down 0.5% prior corresponding period in the second half. So that's reflecting our determination to reduce cost.</p>
          <p>EBITDA was up 5.1% or $0.5 billion to $10.95 billion with margins expanding by one percentage point to 43.2%, and EBIT rose 5.3%, which is above the upper level of the guidance that we gave, which was in the range of 3 to 5%. So, that's to our EBIT now $6.6 billion for the year.</p>
          <p>And profit after-tax and minorities rose 10.3% to $4.1 billion, the higher profit after tax relative to EBIT occurred during &#x2013; due to 17%decline in finance costs due to the fair value adjustments that occur under IFRS.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow continued its upward trajectory due to higher EBITDA and reduced CapEx. And we have maintained our final fully franked ordinary dividend at $0.14 per share, bringing the total for the fiscal year to $0.28. That dividend is now substantially covered by free cash flow, which is another key financial milestone for the company.</p>
          <p>Let me now talk a little bit about the guidance. I'm proud to provide this guidance for fiscal year 2010. It demonstrates we are leveraging the transformation investment made over the last four years, and we remain firmly fixed on our target of $6 billion of free cash flow in 2010. And this is consistent with my comments back in February that we expect it to be towards the low end of the previous or the old 6 to $7 billion target.</p>
          <p>The target now, we should note, includes around a 500 million cash outflow or cash contribution to our pension fund. That was not originally in the plan way back four years ago. With respect to the other guidance measures the old five year CAGR guidance set in 2005 were obviously too broad a guidance range for 2010. So we, therefore, simplified our 2010 guidance, whilst retaining the detail from the original objectives and with the text at the back of my presentation, a reconciliation to the old objectives so you can have a look at that.</p>
          <p>In 2010, we expect to see low single-digit revenue growth and EBITDA margins will remain tight. And in these difficult economic times, I'm delighted that we continue to see the top line growing complemented by bottom line growth. One point to note that this is sales revenue guidance to be consistent with our EBITDA margin calculations, not the total revenue growth, as was the case in prior guidance.</p>
          <p>For 2010 we expect EBITDA margins to be maintained. There are three primary reasons for this being lower than the original targeted margin of 46 to 48% in fiscal year '10. Firstly, the economic slowdown is clearly impacting the business with falling usage levels for PSTN, which is high margin as we all know, and mobile voice calls; secondly, we are gaining greater than excepted growth in lower margin products, such as broadband and IP; and thirdly, we see a slight delay and I did mention this in February, in realizing the benefits from the IT transformation.</p>
          <p>And there is a fourth, we could have cut costs steeper, I guess, but we are now very conscious of the customer experience that it needs improvement. And so to make radical cost cuts while we are trying to do that was not sensible or responsible to do.</p>
          <p>Importantly for our shareholders, the strong revenue growth we have seen over the last few years means that absolute EBITDA in 2010 should still be close to 1 billion above the November 2005 consensus level and we are 500 million above the actual fiscal '05 EBITDA level. With DA &#x2013; D&amp;A, depreciation and amortization, around 4.5 billion, we do expect to see EBIT grow next year in the low single-digit range.</p>
          <p>We expect accrued CapEx of less than $3.8 billion in fiscal 2010, which equates to around 14% CapEx to sales, as was our guidance previously. And I want to briefly comment on the overall cost of the transformation program as this seems to be a little misunderstood.</p>
          <p>I remind you that the overall spend on the entire transformation is around 200 million and there is a mixed change within that total number of transformations. Remember, it's not just about IT &#x2013; or about, it's about 2% of the original transformation project. This is a relatively small incremental cost over the huge five year project. Result &#x2013; today really isn't the time to go into the detail of this, but we'll talk about it in detail at Investor Day. And I actually know where the capital was spent, the change in mix from IT network and so on. And the cost layer comes out, I will do that in October.</p>
          <p>All of the guidance that we're giving here of course, it does as guidance here excludes the impact of the any government regulatory review or NBN outcomes and any unexpected outcome of the ACCC wholesale pricing determinations. Now they are all important, and we have in our guidance made some allowance. However, it's along the lines of what we expect and we could get an unexpected outcome.</p>
          <p>So, let me move on: product mix continues to evolve as retail unit's leverage the transformation investment in the Next G and the Next IP networks.</p>
          <p>Mobiles, retail broadband and IP and data access are growing while it is <mark type="inaudible" /> as customers need &#x2013; as the customer needs evolve. And they change the talk spending habits. Since the start of the transformation, the proportion of revenue from PSTN, and you can see this is in the pie chart, has declined by 10 percentage points to just 25%. While mobile revenue increased by 6 percentage points to 27%. And so that's what I mean by the surprising exchange that we experienced. This year we again achieved double-digit revenue growth in mobile services at 15.9%. Revenue growth in fixed retail broadband grew 15.9% and 8.1% revenue growth in IP and data access and 5.8% revenue growth in Sensis. PSTN revenue declined and that decline continues at 4.9% and it's mainly due &#x2013; it's kind of a combination of things substitution to other calling products but also just lots of use &#x2013; lower usage from the impacts of the economy.</p>
          <p>In terms of product profitability on products that over the last 12 months, we've seen improving margins in mobile, fixed internet, IP and data access, and Sensis with declining margins tracking declining revenues in our PSTN business.</p>
          <p>The way forward is in these new product areas is for us to keep getting economies of scale, which is obviously our objective. Given their growing importance, I want to give you some more colour on mobile &#x2013; with mobile and data and some &#x2013; and IP access, which is the next slide.</p>
          <p>Mobile data grew 31% with annual revenue now in excess of $2 billion, almost double the amount of two years ago. Note that we have slightly rebalanced how we report the breakdown of mobile data, try to simplify this. Wireless broadband now constitutes cards, the UBS dongles and embedded modems while mobile browse text in what we call non-messaging data. Wireless broadband revenue surged 69% to $587 million, with SIOs up from 526,000 to reach over a million at the end of June. And other non-messaging and data revenues increased 19% to 547 million, which you can see on the left hand graph on the slide.</p>
          <p>And during the SMS volumes grew 28%, so SMS continues to grow to 9 billion, that's quite an amazing number. While, MMS volumes grew 40% to nearly 70 million and that includes video calling.</p>
          <p>And the next IP network is also delivering with IP access revenues up 25% to 667 million and IP MAN internet revenues increased 38% to 321 million in IP WAN revenues climbed 19% to 267 million.</p>
          <p>And IP access revenue now exceeds legacy data revenues. So you can see the shift away from old technology to the new technology and us leveraging our investment on Next IP. Our investment in the Next G and Next IP network are really clearly showing dividends.</p>
          <p>Just briefly on the segment, so I just want to mention performance of each of three retail units, to highlight the momentum in the second half in particular. And our consumer business unit had a very solid performance with sales revenue up 25.1% and EBIT contribution up 3.2%.</p>
          <p>The second half revenue growth actually exceeded the first half growth and that was a great achievement given the second half included the impact of the deteriorating economic circumstances, continued aggressive competitor pricing and the integration of BigPond access into the retail units. The transformation of the retail channel via T[life] store rollout and the stretched resources that were in consumer given the migration of millions of customers into the new IT systems. So that performance in a fairly difficult year, I am sure David, must been have been really great for consumer.</p>
          <p>In Telstra business, Telstra Business Group achieved total sales revenue growth of 4.7% with operating leverage continuing to grow. The growth has also achieved despite a significant slowdown in growth in the second half in mobile and PSTN.</p>
          <p>In the fiscal 2010, we will do more to take advantage in the business segment of Next G and Next IP and we believe the churn will fall over in the next 12 months in the segment, while our fixed broadband market share will again increase in this segment.</p>
          <p>Enterprise and Government business unit had a great year as you heard David passionately speak about with the revenue growing 2.9% to nearly $4.8 billion and EBIT climbing 5.2%.</p>
          <p>And underlying revenue growth in the two joint segments taking out the Kaz sale, was 5%, so underlying performance was 5%. We have had many contract wins as David referenced helping to ensure the further momentum and growth and those included the Commonwealth Bank was up to a $1 billion over the next 10 years.</p>
          <p>Let me just touch on the global stage. Our international businesses generated more than $2 billion of revenue in fiscal year '09. Our CSL New World, as you heard David say, was hit by a very tough economic conditions in Honk Kong where there is already a very strong competitive market. It did have in Hong Kong dollars double-digit declines in revenue and EBITDA, a result from falls in voice revenues and volumes of handsets sold were down. However with the significant investments that we focused on in CSL in the year just passed, we expect &#x2013; it is well &#x2013; well we know it's well positioned for growth going forward.</p>
          <p>TelstraClear produced a solid performance, reporting a growth of 2% despite the impact of the ongoing New Zealand recession. And the consumer business inside TelstraClear grew revenues nearly 20%, while the Enterprise and Government group in New Zealand 1 million new customers.</p>
          <p>Our China assets continue to experience very positive growth rates with SouFun delivering in local currency revenue growth of 29% and EBITDA growth of 55%. And we are also very pleased with the integration of our purchases in the online and mobile content spaces. Auto, home and the computer equipment verticals are also performing very well. So those investments are proving to be doing very well.</p>
          <p>Let me rerun our expenses quickly. OpEx growth of just 0.6% was comfortably exceeded by sales revenue growth, so good growth margins if you like. Our expenses are under tight control and operating leverage is emerging from the transformation investment with more to come. So, yes, while there is some delay, and I mentioned that back in February, we are still on the path of leveraging that transformation.</p>
          <p>So, I'm going to go over each category a little bit. Labour costs, first, they fell by 0.6% to 4.1 billion, mainly due to the reduction of 2,881 FTEs or full-time equivalent staff during the year and that now brings the reduction to 11,665 since 2005, and so you'll remember back then we mentioned 10 to 12,000 as the likely product reduction from productivity improvement.</p>
          <p>So achieved that objective for full year really both figures of course as we always do get &#x2013; to get to the reference point exclude the impact with all acquisitions we've made since then or divestments we've made since then. In the second half of the year labour costs fell 4.2%, and this is important and the labour reduction gives us a good run rate therefore going into 2010.</p>
          <p>Labour costs would have declined even further that is by 2.3% had it not been for the calculation we had to make for long service provision which bounces off a 10 year government bond rate, a lower discount rate causes the value of long service labour obligation to increase. There were further reductions in FTEs in the coming year, although they will be smaller than in recent years. And we will do, in terms of staff, what we have to do to deliver the improved customer experience that David has spoken about.</p>
          <p>Let me talk about the directly variable costs, they increased by 2.5%, but still met our objective of maintaining the sales revenue growth at or above the rate of variable cost growth. And the cost of goods sold fell 5.54% to 1.9 billion mainly due to lower use of handset subsidies. We were vigilant in the management of subscriber acquisition and re-contracting costs with the blended rate decreasing by 12% from $158 to $139 in fiscal year '09, and this was assisted by the increased use of our mobile repayment option and lower subsidized postpaid volumes. So it was a combination of rate and volume.</p>
          <p>The reduction in cost of goods sold was offset by a $185 million increase in network payments. 84 million of that was due to FX impacts, and 76 million of that was due to just increase in traffic volumes, terminating on other networks, be it offshore or domestically.</p>
          <p>In other category, service fees increased 14%, primarily due to arise in the PayTV expense, but of course that has a offsetting PayTV revenue. Service contracts and agreements and other expenses, service contracts and agreements tends to get bit of focus, so let me talk through those. We achieved a 0.4% or $21 million reduction in service contracts and agreement expenses, and the other expensive categories. Leading the decline was promotion and advertising, it fell $78 million or 17%, as we adopted a more targeted go to market approach in our promotion and advertising.</p>
          <p>And discretionary costs fell 12% or 53 million due to our tight cost control through the year and with double digit declines in things like travel. So we're using our own technology, Telepresence and so on, to cut down our travel bill and legal costs reduced and the transformation training wound down as well. So we spent a little less on the transformation training.</p>
          <p>Importantly, the service contracts and agreement costs, they did continue to increase nearly to 2.4 billion and partly due to higher call centre volumes being handled by our industry partners. Now we did say back in February that we were experiencing higher call volumes as we move through this migration.</p>
          <p>And yes, we've had to use our industry partners more to help us with those volumes as we went through that customer migration. However, service contracts and agreement costs fell 2% in the second half, so we're starting to see the volume peaks reduce and getting back to where we want the trajectory to be.</p>
          <p>Bad and doubtful debts increased by 15% to 289 million, probably not surprising in these sort of conditions. We had higher aged debts and insolvencies due to the economy. And we had some transitional issues as well with our IT systems and we were unable to make as many outbound calls and so on.</p>
          <p>However, the total impairment and diminution cost fell 4% as we improved our stock management and we had follow our stock writedowns and we have better turns, so far much better management of our inventory.</p>
          <p>Let me move on to CapEx and depreciation and amortization. The accrued CapEx was 4.6 billion or very close to it, which was in line with our guidance range. The CapEx continues to track lower for the transformation peak or from the transformation peak in fiscal year '07. And this year it still included relatively high levels of Cap &#x2013; IT CapEx, but it's still on the decline. And it includes in part the upgrade of the HFC in Melbourne, which we announced earlier in the year.</p>
          <p>The downward trajectory will continue with accrued CapEx expected to fall to less than $3.8 billion in fiscal year '10. Depreciation and amortization climbed 4.8% to 4.4 billion this year and the D&amp;A included 172 million for the accelerated depreciation of the network at CSL and New World, now that will &#x2013; has been now fully depreciated.</p>
          <p>David has spoken about the regulatory review, and so you know our position, but I just do want to talk a little bit abut this. There is one area where there probably remains confusion and misinformation that of our functional separation or impacts on our business.</p>
          <p>There are lots of flavors of operational and functional separation. Some represent a tightening of the existing ratio whilst others require an almost complete unwinding of our IT transformation. And as I've said in Hong Kong in March, our estimate of the impact of the base case, so light touch if you like, functional separation is around $0.04 per share and that's an NPV calculation, not an EPS impact. And these are mostly one-off costs and not an ongoing burden.</p>
          <p>While more &#x2013; whilst more extreme separation would be probably enticing for our competitors, it could take five years or more to implement and would be a major disruption for Telstra and inside of the company, but also a disruption for us in serving our customers.</p>
          <p>It's something that's got to be kept in mind with respect to regulatory and legislative changes. And in our regulatory submission in June, we acknowledged the concerns expressed by the government and the ACCC about the current telecoms environment, especially the pursuit of lack of equivalents in transparency.</p>
          <p>But we also did not overlook NBN and made the point that any changes or remedies to the current regime must assist, not impede the transition to NBN. The NBN &#x2013; that NBN can proceed in a timely fashion we believe is a crucial issue. And Australia must learn from the lessons overseas where onerous regulation of legacy assets can stifle investment and innovation. And can take a long time and be a huge distraction from what now is the main game we believe, the NBN.</p>
          <p>Let me quickly go through free cash flow, it is growing strongly. Free cash flow increased by 13.2% to 4.4 billion this year. The operating cash flows were 9 billion, while investing cash ouflows were 4.6 billion. The decrease in investing cash outflows were mainly due to the operating CapEx as the transformation CapEx continues to decline.</p>
          <p>I just have one thing, I guess, some persons in this room would say, "Okay 4.4, you are talking about six, how do we get six billion from that point?" Let me hit the question before you ask it. It will come from about $1 billion lower cash CapEx of that, while the remaining 600 million will come from EBITDA improvement. Improvement in working capital and some lower tax payments as we realize the benefits from some R&amp;D claims that is related to our transformation, tax R&amp;D claims.</p>
          <p>Financial parameters and interest, let me just touch on those. In terms of financial parameters, we remain at the stronger end of our target ranges for each. Debt servicing or net debt to EBITDA is 1.4 times versus our target of 1.7 to 2.1 times. And our net debt gearing ratio is at 55.2 versus target of 55 to 75. And EBITDA interest cover is 9.6 times versus our target of more than seven. So strong financial position. And our borrowing costs fell as the average effective interest rate on average net debt fell from 7.3% in fiscal 2008 to 7.1 in fiscal year '09. So spreads increased, but base rates for borrowings declined.</p>
          <p>So let me conclude with the some message we've been making for several years. We remain firmly focused on delivering the financial outcomes of the transformation; in particular we are aiming at delivering six billion of free cash flow in fiscal year '10. That is what we believe our shareholders value the most. The mix of the top line growth margins and CapEx to get to that target has moved slightly over the last few years as the customer needs have evolved and the economic slowdown has occurred, also impacting a whole lot of parameters. But we are firmly fixed on delivering that target of 6 billion free cash flow.</p>
          <p>So, thank you. And we we'll now take some questions, both David and I.</p>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll take &#x2013; as I mentioned, we'll take questions both from the floor here and from the calls, so the first three questions from the floor and then we will go the conference call. When John is seated, first question will be Ian Martin [ABN AMRO].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. David well done, first up, you've come out on the front foot regarding expectations for next year, looks quite positive. Except in a couple of the instances I'd like to ask about. One is the EBITDA margin outlook that you want to maintain margin at the 43.2% roughly, but in fact, it was 42.2 in the first half '09, 44.2 roughly in the second half. Should you be maintaining it at that higher level in the 44% range if not pushing to 45 is first question.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the free cash flow targets, I mean you've emphasized that and well done to you on doing that and maintaining that target. But the question now should be well what's going to happen to that cash flow and your outlook statement says that significant excess free cash flow and all the flexibility that that brings. I just wonder what the options are there and why we haven't perhaps been more positive about some of that cash now coming back to shareholders?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks, Ian. Let me take both questions. Firstly on the EBITDA margins, we did reflect on this a lot. We &#x2013; as I said, we are seeing a change in product mix and that's sort of -- we want to try and make sure we manage that carefully.</p>
          <p>Economy is slower, so therefore revenue &#x2013; we just want to be considered about what we're saying going forward. And then of course we want to leave some investment in terms of customer service.</p>
          <p>Yeah, I'm aware of where the EBITDA margins finished for the year, and we just think it's probably using a word that John's used before, considered margins, but if we can push it hard it will, but we just think that's the right place to start.</p>
          <p>Cash flow, well, yeah, we have got options and we are going to continue to look at what options we've got going forward. And again what we do with the cash is something we will discuss with the Board and as we go through that we're going to continue look at where we need to invest. And if something good comes up &#x2013; but let me assure you, if we can give more back to shareholders we definitely will, but we're just going to leave that open for now because we want to continue to get the strategy behind us, give us &#x2013; and give you some sense of that in October as we go forward. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll just follow-up on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there some risk with some of that cash flow might in fact flow into NBN Co in return for some equity there, but ultimately into a vehicle that Telstra wouldn't have control of?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ian, as I said, we've not factored anything in there, because it's so hard to know what the trends are there, but we will work through it and see where we get to. That is an option, but the only way we'd ever do that if we think we are going to drive an improved shareholder outcome. I can't stress that enough. That's the only sitting we've really got. If we do that, we'll come back and talk, but that is not on the horizon at the moment. John, do you want to make any comments on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think you covered it really.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Sameer Chopra from Deutsche Bank. I had two questions. One is you know in terms of depreciation currently the business is doing about $4.5 billion, how do you see depreciation playing out in the future, because DNA is running above CapEx, when should we be &#x2013; when should we start factoring a pull back in depreciation? That's one for John. One for you as well David, you spoke about some of the strengths in your products and segments. If you was to look out say three years out, which products and segments do you think can keep sustaining that level of growth, what are you most optimistic about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me ask John to handle the depreciation one then I will handle the growth ones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Sameer, look, you got to remember that the spend that we have made on IT is large, and that had short amortization periods, so five, six years. So, you won't see D&amp;A go down for a while, and I have said this a number of times. It will hover around the 4.5 for a few more years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The growth trajectory of one of the key products unquestionably wireless. Wireless is a very compelling proposition and you've seen this ability to grow wireless data, which in many instances has being incremental. So, that's a critical trajectory. The growth in broadband, there is an insatiable appetite for broadband access both in IP, but also in the residential market. The critical area is how you drive value from that. So I think that's a very strong trajectory for as we go forward irrespective of what happens around NBN.</p>
          <p>And thirdly we do see strong opportunities in this managed network services area. We think that in the enterprise and in the business market network based applications, network based services, the intelligence within the whole cloud environment is playing uniquely into the strengths of the Telco and then -- I say that as a guy who has worked in the industry a long time. So they are three trajectories.</p>
          <p>I would also like to mention the online world. We are seeing some very encouraging signs there and we are just going through that at the moment. The China portfolio, tremendous growth. Now obviously China, you've got to be careful, there is risk in doing business there. But in terms of the online verticals and what Bruce is doing within Sensis, I think set us up well for the future, certainly the four key ones that I would be looking at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

          <p>Thanks and congratulations.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Richard Eary from UBS. Just a couple of housekeeping points. John, you mentioned on the tax side that you thought there was obviously going to be a reduction in the tax into '010. You paid 1.6 billion in tax this year. Can you just give us a feel in terms of what the R&amp;D benefits are going to be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not -- I won't give you a precise number but its north of 100 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. Just with that in mind, I mean presumably when you give the guidance 6.5 billion in free cash flow, free the pension top ups and you add back the cash CapEx of about 3.8 and then you add back the tax, clearly you are getting to somewhere between 11.5 and 12 billion in EBITDA. Is that fair to state?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are pretty close.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just on Sensis, there was obviously comments that you are pretty happy with the way the business is moving. Clearly, as we are now moving into sort of the end of this year when we do the pre-bookings, is there any feel that you can give us in terms of how that business is tracking in terms of the pre-booking or pre-sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me give a couple of comments then I will pass to Bruce. Yes, look there is no question. The economy is tighter. I think as I have spoken to Bruce, we have talked about the campuses. It's been more challenging, but Bruce and the team have a quite unique proposition.</p>
          <p>Remember they go in with a proposition about saying, if you advertise in Yellow Pages, this is the results we can give you. And while it's been up and down, I think the guys are feeling considered about it. I don't think it's been a runaway year, but Bruce, do you want to make a comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think we are very happy with the product range and the new products, the voice products, the online products, the China products, they're all doing very well, White has had a great year and that's continuing on.</p>
          <p>The print products are a bit slower this year than last year, so we are seeing, reflecting right across Australia in the advertising industry. We are seeing market share growth. We are seeing retention of customers and more growth in customer numbers. But, yes, it is a little bit more subdued we're seeing just the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that fair to say Bruce, that the print numbers are down year-on-year in terms of pre-booking to date?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know that we're giving those forecasts, are we?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, but I think that to reflect, we'll probably reflect on how the economy is going, would be the best way to go, because small business base really reflects what's going on in the economy and they are pretty considered about where they are putting their money. But we remain confident about the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one last question on international. You touched on it a few times in the presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know whether you can give us a feel in terms of your thoughts on how Telstra International looks in the future and give us maybe an update in terms of SouFun and IPOs front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. Firstly, I will give you more detail as we finalize this &#x2013; the three to four year strategy. Obviously, if you look at Australia, first of all, that has always been our focus. I mean, that's where we drive most of our revenue, our profit from. So we will have very strong focus on Australia, but over the years we need to continue to look at how we can expand the business. So, it has always been a part, right back from OTC days to now, a critical part of our strategy. But it is only a relatively what, 10% of our revenues, so it's only small. So in relation, so it will play a part in our ongoing strategy, but it's &#x2013; the question is how. And that is the big question. So you got be very considered about where you go.</p>
          <p>Secondly, in terms of SouFun, yeah we have been pleased with the businesses in China. We are learning a lot about how to do business in China, and it's not without its challenges, but the financial results have been really strong. So, we continue to have a strong team up there. Bruce and Justin are spending time up there &#x2013; John is on the Board and we are continuing to watch that very carefully and &#x2013; but remember it &#x2013; relatively it's a small part of the business but a very fast growing part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And to you question about the IBO, I mean, we haven't made any decisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are still considering the IBO so its &#x2013; its market determined and its all sort of things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it is an option as we go forward, it is an option.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I will now, go to the line and take couple of question from the phones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank. First question comes from Christian Guerra from Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks for your time. Three questions for you this morning. Firstly, just on the E&amp;G and the SME business. We saw a big slow down in the second half in terms of revenue growth, with E&amp;G falling to 1.9% from 3.9 in the first half, and on the business segment falling to 2.2 from 7.2%. Just wondering if you could talk about what's driving that, whether it's the economy or whether you're losing share?</p>
          <p>And also if you talk about the impact on your margins given that &#x2013; I remember back in last fiscal '03 when E&amp;G got crunched, your margins got crunched as well. Secondly, just on the cost saving targets, John, you've talked in the past that you intended on targeting 5 to $800 million cost reduction by fiscal '10. I'm just wondering what the new numbers look like, and also whether you're confident of margin expansion into fiscal '11 like you highlighted or had you highlighted at the investor day last year.</p>
          <p>And my third question is on the NBN. Clearly, you can't say too much at the present time, but your fixed broadband subscribers went backward in the past six months, which clearly has impacted &#x2013; has implications for the demand equation with the NBN. Just wondering if you could talk about that please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you want me to take the first one. John, I'll leave you the second one. Okay, Enterprise &amp; Government and TB, two different stories. Firstly, the half-to-half on TEG was primarily driven by the KAZ sale. And I think if you normalize for that, it's roughly about the same. So enterprise and government, tracking well, and the sales pipeline is strong as we move into the year. So we don't see any real risk in there. In fact, on the margin side, I'd say, as strong as I've ever seen them. So that's one.</p>
          <p>On the Telstra Business side, in the SME market, I think it is a more reflection of the market rather than sheer loss. It is just tough out there. We've seen &#x2013; it's not so much a loss of &#x2013; due to churn, it's more either being cancellations or usage that's really where we've been hit. So, I think that really reflects the market, now in terms of the margin impact on it, yeah, it could be some there which is sort of reflected in our considered view around margin going forward but I think it would be just appropriate to say its just the market, the small business market, is tough. But our share and our presence there is as strong as I've seen it for many, many years. So John, I mean, do you want to comment on that, and well the second one there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think you are right about TG and TB &#x2013; let me take the -- Christian &#x2013; the cost saving, the 500 to 800 clearly the '09,'10 guidance we have given indicates that I don't expect all the 5 to 800 to be achieved and some of the reasons we've already given for example, we don't know want to cut too deeply because we want to improve the customer experience, well that's one reason. With the product mix is another reason, you might recall in the 5 to 800 I think I'll put up a chart that had the &#x2013; level of DVCs, that we expected those DVCs are a little higher because of the product mix change.</p>
          <p>There is -- I've mentioned there has been a delay in the transformation cost out -- I think at this point in time, I think it was probably about 100 million we won't get just for some circumstances that has occurred in &#x2013; doing the transformation and I'll explain more about that in October. And there is about 150, that has been defered -- so delayed and that was the delay that I signalled in February. So when you add those two there is 250 in the 100 to 800 that is some delay, some not occurring and the DVC impact is reduced as well. So that fundamentally is the to &#x2013; what's happened in 2010 in our guidance. To your question about 2011, therefore, I do expect improvement in 2011.</p>
          <p>So let me have a go on this fixed broadband question, Christian. Firstly, as I said broadband growth was up 15.9%. We had very strong growth in ARPU. So we have had a mix change to the high speed plans. Now yes, while we had 20,000 growth in subscribers over the full year it was a challenged market and this is a classic example where we are trying to get the share, ARPU profitability mix right. We're looking at that one and we'll just continue to determine what the right outcome there, but 15.9% growth in revenue across that is very strong and improving profitability. I think that's a very strong result. However, I am conscious about our share. So as NBN, but remember NBN, well, Tasmania, then there's a while to go before NBN may be out there, but we are very conscious to make sure that share and profitability is just kept in balance. But yeah, a very important focus for us and the team are working on it so watch this space.</p>

          <p>All right David, I am sorry but my question on the fixed broadband subscribers was more about the implications for the NBN economics, if the subscriber growth is going backwards. I mean, clearly, that's got to be a bit of an issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay, now I would say that I think that our subscriber numbers are probably reflecting a bit of a decline in share. I think the overall broadband numbers are probably increasing in the market. But the question &#x2013; you're right to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just slightly. It's not &#x2013; the defnitiely the growth in the market's come back a bit. But what's very important is, what will customers pay for high speed, and that's what I think is the big question? And so, sorry, I got that, sorry, wrong, but that's very important.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll just give you a bit of a reference point, Christian, our ARPUs have increased and whilst there has been I think 20,000 increase in SIOs overall. So that includes wholesale. So retail fixed broadband has increased far more than that, so it's about 140 in fact, 140,000. But just we've seen an extra 82,000 people go up to 20 megabits per second. And that's very important to continue and grow the revenues, and that's how you get the 15.9% revenue guidance.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Next question from Alice Bennett from Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, got a couple of questions. Firstly, just on the mobile business. You referred to chasing I guess profitability rather than market share. Just wondering if you can give a sense of what has occurred with your mobile margins over the last six months?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just on the HFC upgrades, if you could you just give a little bit of an upgrade there, how you're proceeding in Melbourne and whether you're still intending on proceeding to the other cities outside of Melbourne?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, just on Sensis, really very good result, particularly on the White Pages, I know you've talked about it a little bit, but can you just give us a bit of a sense of exactly what's driving that? Is it increased use of color or how are you getting that growth in the print business?</p>
          <p>And just on the Sensis, just wondering if you could give a sense of whether there's a vast difference between the regional and metro print publications? I guess, I'm trying to get a sense of whether the online penetration in regional markets has made any difference to your print businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start off on the first one, then I'll pass to John on the margins, because he &#x2013; I think he'll give you a better sense of the margins. Firstly, I said the balance between share and profitability is what we're managing. For example, there was enormous subsidies in the market around iPhone for the last six months. We took a considered view about what our subsidies were in the market. And as you saw, SACs are down, and we are very carefully managing that.</p>
          <p>Now, we do think that the whole proposition around PDAs is very strong. But we're going to have a balanced view about that as we go forward, because we have learned over the years, even back to when I ran the Mobiles group, you can get a bit carried away with just driving top line growth. However, so when you look at our results, 10% growth at the revenue line and our tremendous growth in terms of subscribers, 33% of data, this group was up. Now, in terms of the margins, John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The margins have grown. Mobile margin is about 37% EBITDA margins. And last year, I think we probably totalled over 36%. We've actually got a far better economic model to work out margins these days. And probably, we're a little bit overstated last year. So in actual effect, the margins have grown more than 1% '08 '09, '07 '08, but they are at 37% now so &#x2013; and have grown.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to answer your question, it's all about balance going forward, but as I -- we do not want that share to get away on us. So we'll just manage it carefully as we go forward month-by-month, quarter-by-quarter. And that's the wonderful thing about some of these new systems and the retail out is we are getting better at doing that as we go forward.</p>
          <p>In terms of HFC, yeah, we are committed to that rollout. We have got the team working on it now and we're excited about seeing what we can drive from HFC. We've got some good product fill, maybe just putting 100 megs out there really doesn't mean a whole lot. You've got to have things for it to use, changes the experience. So we are committed to that roll out and we think it's going to be exciting to watch and see how it performs. And we've got some good plans in that area.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of Sensis, let me ask Bruce to comment because Bruce is out there, hustling on the streets every day and so Bruce why don't you give some colour to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look it's a great product that customers love. Everyone is using it. And we have spent a lot of time being able to explain that value proposition to customers. So there hasn't been any particular magic about it other than really understanding what that value proposition is, how we bring buyers and sellers together. And how &#x2013; if you want to be in business in Australia, whether it's in metro or regional small business, you've got to be in the Yellow Pages. And if you are in the Yellow Pages, you are then online, you're then in mobiles, you're then on 1234, you are then in MSN's Bing, we've now done a syndication arrangement with Google. We have increased the reach of your yellow advertising by about 25% over the last 12 months. So it's a much, much stronger value proposition.</p>
          <p>In terms of how the particular products within that portfolio performed in the last financial year, Yellow Metro was slightly negative, Yellow Regional was slightly positive, White Metro was quite strongly positive and White Regional was not quite as strongly positive.</p>
          <p>So we are seeing solid maintenance of the print products overall. Overall print was positive but the metro areas were under pressure, but the growth that we are seeing is coming from all of the product extensions into these new digital formats.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Bruce. Yeah I just want to add just a -- maybe an editorial commentary. I have been incredibly impressed. I didn't know the Sensis business as well. But the level of sophistication that they have when they talk to a customer about the value that that print product drives is quite outstanding and what's different to just putting an ad in the paper or putting just something out there on the fly is we can track the response rate and therefore the return.</p>
          <p>I don't know many other products that can do that and that has been the incredible difference we've seen in Sensis over the last two years and I think that's great credit to the team. You don't &#x2013; it seems great, it sells excellent. So just I think a great result. So I hope that answers on the HFC, that upgrade on the HFC, I think we've covered that. Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. I have two questions on wireless broadband. It's great growth in subs of course, but it's come at the expense of ARPU, which is obviously what most would have expected given the $80 you were getting before. But is 62 or thereabouts, kind of what, you were expecting it to settle at? Or should we expect that to continue to fall or what is -- what's your view on that product and where the pricing will go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me make a few quick comments and then I'll pass to John because he's got the detail. You know, look &#x2013; there's been a number of factors. Yeah maybe we put out a prepaid product this year that definitely pulls that ARPU down, maybe price competition. Well we think we're getting into the right ballpark it will be a matter of the mix. We obviously are focused on driving contracted customers as we go forward, we think the prepaid product is good. So around that, John, do you want to comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's primarily driven by going into prepaid wireless broadband. It's been proven very popular and obviously the mix change has changed the ARPU. If it continues to be as popular as this, yeah, it can go down a bit further.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I agree, I mean it is a wonderful proposition there is now up to a million subs now which is great and we are looking forward to seeing that grow and of course, we still think there's lots of life left in that Next G network as we go forward.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just on the &#x2013; the kind of balancing to that is that more and more smart phones will come into the market and so you'll have more take up of wireless broadband, so absolute growth will still be strong.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much. I have two questions. Firstly is it possible to get <mark type="inaudible" /> could you give us a rough number for EBITDA &#x2013; 500 say, and I was just wondering if you sort of quantify that <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the new presentation slide, they're saying, the reconcilitaion slide, it looks like the revenue growth and the EBITDA &#x2013; revenue growth and the expense growth is pretty much in line with previous target. But the EBITDA growth is only 1 to 2.5% so thinking what happened there, what are the drivers there?</p>
          <p>And lastly David, you mentioned a number of times that protecting shareholder value in any discussion with the government, obviously management has talked about the <mark type="inaudible" /> of around 18% previously. I was just wondering is that still the basis for discussions for the new network, please? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The third question around the ---</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The third question I got.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question was around the trends in the EBITDA growth in 2010 being somewhat below prior expectations, and the explanation for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, I think I went through it in my presentation that we've had this DVC mix change or product mix change which has increased the directly variable costs. And so &#x2013; and then when you have, you pay <mark type="inaudible" />. And that being a high margin product set then that's what's happened to EBITDA margins. The growth in EBITDA has also been impacted by the cost explanation that I just went through. EBITDA growth would have been greater had there not been a delay in the cost of IT transformation realization. So all those things have accumulated, if you like, into the EBITDA growth and the EBITDA margin situation.</p>
          <p>The third question, about 18% return, look, we haven't &#x2013; we are a long way off discussing what detail of NBN might look like. And at the end of the day, and you might have picked up in our tone today and what David has said, and what I have said, that it's &#x2013; this about protecting shareholder value. And in protecting shareholder value that could mean &#x2013; a return that actually results in that protection. So we aren't locked into the numbers is what I am really saying.</p>

          <p>It's Phil Campbell from Citigroup, just a couple of questions for David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The first one was, I just want to try and check from the presentation this morning, I am kind of picking up probably three subtle, but important changes since you've taken over. The first one is obviously a greater emphasis on customer service. The second one is this focus on market share or end margin mix and the last one is obviously the NBN, where you are actually talking more friendly with the government. So the first question, I just want to check whether there are any others that may I have missed, or if those are the three ones that you think are valid?</p>
          <p>The second question is just, may be you can give us a little bit more information on the first two. So in terms of customer service, is that a case of customer service levels have declined to quite a bad point, or is that a case of trying to make sure the service levels are at a high level as we go into NBN environment?</p>
          <p>The other question is on this margin, on the market share mix. I kind of understand the background for that, but again like in mobile you'd think with Hutch and Voda doing a merger, you might have actually thought the opposite and thought maybe you'd be more aggressive in that space. So a little bit more background around those two things would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, in terms of subtle messages, I was trying not to be so subtle, customer service is critically important. Now you say, why? It's &#x2013; when you go through a big transformation, there's always impacts. But this is something that is at the heart of what we do. Remember the number of customer interactions every day, and our front of house, in terms of field technicians, we think this is an incredible opportunity to really differentiate. Now, but before I go there and talk a little bit more, the only one you've missed in terms of the first three was product differentiation. This is &#x2013; and the integration across Next-G and Next IP. This is very important and has been a continuak theme. So that is four, it's actually more than three, it's four.</p>
          <p>Then coming at customer service, so, yeah if you've seen the TIO complaints in our industry, not just Telstra, our industry has gone up. Our share of the complaints going to the ombudsman are about the same. But we've got far too many. I think if you go back over 5 to 6 years, it's been a significant increase. That's not good for our industry. It's not good for Telstra, it's not good for our customers. And I'm not going to put up with it. And let me also say, I do not need an ombudsman to handle our customers. It is such an indictment on our industry and on Telstra. So, that's the reason and but more than that, if I can reduce churn and I can differentiate, you know the numbers: every customer you save, it's far better than trying to acquire one. So, we're about reducing churn, and if we can hold our customers longer, that is good for our shareholders. So very simple.</p>
          <p>Now the second one was around the share &#x2013; the mix segment. Yeah, I'm not quite sure how to answer that one in the sense that that's always been a priority for us. In fact, when we've talked about differentiation and value, we've always been very considered about that mix. Maybe it's got a little bit more prevalent now, because we've seen people putting a lot of money into the market to try to &#x2013; attract subs and we're conscious not to fall into that trap.</p>
          <p>That doesn't mean we don't want to be competitive, we don't want to have a premium around value that is justifiable and clearly articulated, and we will move with the market. But it is a very considered mix, and we've learnt over the years to be better and better at this by every day, by every week, by every month and that's what I think is probably the bigger change. So at any one time, we'll see sort of up and down, but we're about profitable revenue growth, profitable revenue growth. So I hope that gives you some colour and we can talk more about it as we go forward.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>We got four more hopefully very quick questions from the floor. We need to move on to the media calls. Mark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes good morning, well done on the results and if I may say also congratulations on a far more credible set of forecasts, particularly around the EBITDA margin. Three areas I'd like to touch on briefly: revenue, OpEx and CapEx. On the revenue side, I was wondering if you could be a little more specific about the composition from new services into your growth expectation and in particular into the second half. Presumably by then, the DOCSIS 3 upgrade is complete and we should see a range of new products coming through, particularly in broadband. So what proportion of your revenue growth guidance is contributed to from new services?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep, do you want to give us all three?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, in relation to OpEx, you've spoken about further head count reductions, I'm wondering if you can quantify that? Also in relation to the cost overruns in the IT transformation program, my understanding from speaking to IT people at Telstra is that there are still major issues. There are certain functions in Siebel, for example, that take five long &#x2013; five times as long to perform as in the old legacy systems. What are your expectations about the future dimensions of cost overrun, what sort of contractual protections do you have, and what is the magnitude of that in the year ahead? And then that leads to my third question, which is more CapEx related, and that is actually about where we are in the CapEx cycle?</p>
          <p>And in particular, what is implied by the technology transformations that have occurred, and the substitution of purchased equipment for leased equipment, and in particular are we seeing a truncation of the CapEx cycle? So while everyone is focused at the moment on a reduction in FY10, as we go forward, the replacement times, for a lot of the network and IT equipment and software, may in fact be much shorter than historically, can you comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me have a go at the revenue one, and then I will get little bit color from John as well. Firstly, your supposition that we have got to drive more from the new products is right. The flow through of that into the specific numbers, we probably need to come back to you and give you some color. We do have a lot of focus on how to drive out from the HFC upgrade, but also some of these integrated products, in the terms of the home of the future and also the business of the future. And I said, driving that growth from off the platforms is critically important. We are sort of in the mid 40s, we think that's going to go significantly up as we go forward.</p>
          <p>So, yes, very important. Also, some of the managed services areas as well are important, also in terms of content. I think, do you have any specific numbers John, because I don't have it off the top of my head.</p>

          <p>No. I mean, we are excepting, obviously we are expecting growth in the newer products that we have today, wireless broadband and so on. But I don't have a proportion of the growth going forward off the top of my head.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't we, we can probably come back and sort of &#x2013; we just haven't done that calculation. But obviously, you have got PSTN is going to go down, we got to keep driving that up.</p>
          <p>Then let's talk about the OpEx head count on IT transformation, and let me have a go at it, and if the guys down in the front might be able to help me out, they can. Firstly, look, we are not giving any guidance specifically on head count. But I do want to stress that this business is always moving.</p>
          <p>We're a technology company. We're about using technology to drive productivity. Therefore, we are very focused on how we can drive productivity or the skills mix is the other thing, because we are seeing some of the old skills we don't need. I mean, especially this, as we start to move people more online, what we are going to do with the people who have traditionally taken calls? So yes, we do expect, over time, to drive productivity improvement, we must do. That's at our heart. But where we are sort of &#x2013; we did forecast, what was it &#x2013; was it 12,000 people out &#x2013; 10 to 12. We're not putting forecasts out there, but let me assure you, our focus on productivity remains as strong and as vigilant as ever.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of the wonderful Siebel roll out, look, I'm going to share a little bit of experience here and then John or David might want to comment. A lot of people ask me about Enterprise and Government. Well, why do they come across here &#x2013; and I tell you why, because we did it in 2002. We put Siebel in, no one had somehow managed to, so think about it, but we did it. I can remember what happened. We put it in, and the first release was an absolute failure. The way we had to pull it out and put back in, and I think it took us something like 15 months of just working every application, trying to get the processes right, some instantaneous benefits from. And some took us a good while because we had to redefine the way we did the transaction.</p>
          <p>Siebel is a wonderful product. It gives you a look of flexibility which &#x2013; but it takes time for people to get the value from. So I'm not concerned about driving the value from Siebel deployment at all, absolutely not. I think it will take us time and that's partly what we're affected. I don't think there's any necessity for any recourse to anyone, because we are going to drive the value from the product. But it just takes time. And when people stand up and say, you drop a new release in of CRM and you get instantaneous business, well, it's just not true. So that's where we are focused. So, no, we do not have any recourse to anyone. David, do you want to put any colour or John? Because these are the guys who are doing it and they're running it all every day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, the average handling time for an agent to serve a customer changed a little bit through the deployment as people got used to it. It was as big a change as we're ever going to in any 10 to 15 year period of time at front-of-house. So everyone had to be re-trained in all new processes while we were simultaneously migrating customers et cetera, et cetera. There are certainly a couple of things that might be up and down in terms of the relative individual components of how you serve a customer. But overall, our average handling times are trending right back down to where we want them to be, and they are right on track. So with that comes the benefits that we need.</p>
          <p>But as David has indicated, the focus is now in investing on the customer experience, solving their problem first time, making those kind of changes. The Siebel system helps us enormously to do that because we can see the entire customer record in one place. And we can serve the customer for all of their needs, which we couldn't do before. So this is definitely a major step forward for the company and for the customers particularly, as a result of what we are doing, and for our agents.</p>
          <p>And I will finish with the comment that we did a survey, a pulse survey, of our employees through the middle of this, which was for us to test how things were going, and employee engagement went up 2%. So from my point of view, I'm totally satisfied that we haven't yet finished all of the benefits that are going to come from the releases that are yet to conclude. But once we put the whole package together, it's going to be a terrific result for our employees, our customers, and ultimately the shareholder.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, let me quickly, just another editorial comment. One of the great things we know is done is that the benefits from the CRM now sit with David. So in his plan for this year and for next year, he has to realize the benefits, both in customer service and in the productivity benefits. So I don't want to just leave it out there, it's difficult, it's not straightforward. So I &#x2013; we still lot of work to do to get it better there and get the real value, but now the work starts. John, do you want to talk about capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will. I just have another comment about IT, we're all experts in IT. But on the cost front, you made the comment about cost overrun, what I commented on, realization of benefits. But and there's lots of rumors out about cost overrun. In October, I'm going to take you all through how much CapEx and sweepstake and where. There are things in this IT transformation program and spend that when we started, weren't in there. For example, Big Pump wasn't in the transformation, and now it is. That took some more money. So there is a whole lot of things that I will go through to detail the spend. And it will become clear to you that this isn't &#x2013; and yeah, there is a little bit more complexity. Yeah, we did spend some more money as we come to the realization of the more complexity. But I'll take you through that in October.</p>
          <p>CapEx, life cycle and so on. We foresee over the next few years to be around 14% CapEx to sales. And as sales goes up, that means therefore the CapEx will go up slightly. And we think that that we will cope with what I would call a normal evolution.</p>
          <p>Now, let's say LTE comes along well, all right, or 4G Mobile or whatever you want to call it. There will be a kick up. There is no doubt about that. And there may be a time when there are other technologies that come along that cause a kicker, but right now, the next few years and LTE is not tomorrow or next year, might be not the next year after that. So over the next three years I'm confident about our 14% CapEx to sales. But you are right &#x2013; there will be some technology life cycles that give a kicker in the CapEx as always happens in this industry, by the way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just to clarify, so that's 14% for the next three years John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and that's what I have said, around 14%. I said I am confident unless something comes. If LTE has to come forward for some reason, I'm wrong &#x2013; but failing that sort of thing happening, it should be around that.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys. Laurent Horrut, JPMorgan. Just had a question. And given your EBIT growth guidance now and assuming sort of, you don't have single IFRS adjustment in 2010. And am I right, do you think that your impact could actually be sort of flat from under 4.1 you just reporting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am not expecting it to be flat, but I am not expecting to be as high as it is this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess, just on the IFRS adjustments, do you expect them to, you're reporting 900 million interest cost this year, you know, normalized level would probably be more like 1.1. So what is...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The debt maturities &#x2013; well, as they wind out...right</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your favourable gain, fair value gain will decline, and so next year, the gain will be less and less as we as we get profile...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So we should trend back to 1.1. Okay. And a very quick second question. I guess it's looking back at the transformation plan, when you, when it was outlined five years ago, there were three objectives: revenue growth, acceleration, OpEx reduction and CapEx reduction. And I guess, it will be hard to argue that you haven't been successful in the revenue growth acceleration objective. So we'll give you full marks for that. It's less clear to me what is actually delivered in terms of structural benefits on the OpEx on the cost base and on the CapEx side because I do remember years where Telstra was actually spending only 14% of sales. And I do remember that in 2005 the margins were 47%. So I'm just looking for &#x2013; I think we spent 5, 6 billion of incremental CapEx above what should have been spent, would have be spent otherwise. What are the actual structural benefits that are going to sort of last beyond 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me give a perspective of this, John can comment. I think you're right, I think we're yet to see the flow through of the benefits from some of the IT transformation. But remember, next year mixed IP enormous value in terms of just the operations in that business, there's been a lot of value. But in terms of the IT transformation we're yet to see the flow through. We've done a lot of investment training, getting people to get used to these new systems, new bills &#x2013; I mean, it's an enormous job. When you put a new release of the software out, the incredible amount work of just looking every plan, every iteration. So we, as John said, we think that is delayed, and we think it's out in the future, but we had no option. We had no option. It was as the businesses was getting more complicated, the systems were getting harder and harder to manage, too many legacy systems. We had to do it. But yes, we've now got to drive the benefits up. So, still work in progress.</p>

          <p>Andrew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Andrew Levy, Macquarie. Just a quick one of the functional separation slide, could you just give us an idea on for the BT and the telecom New Zealand models, what's implementation versus ongoing operational impacts, if you had to split it percentage-wise, so like CapEx versus OpEX?</p>
          <p>And the other, the other part was I guess, do you have any assumptions in there on market share shifts or product shifts because of the separation, if it was imposed on you or is &#x2013; would that be a separate factor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's a separate factor. The latter is not factored in. The large functional separation, we saw a range from an adjudicator, which is &#x2013; was part of a solution and then you could sort have the adjudicator plus transfer pricing, you could have the adjudicator plus transferred pricing plus petition systems. And as you go up that &#x2013; both forms of separation cost you more and it takes you longer. The $0.04 or 500 million that I talked about, the $0.04 NPV is down at the bottom end. We have some petitioned systems, right. So, it's transferred pricing, it's &#x2013; we hadn't thought of an adjudicator back then, so it's quite a light touch. And then you can get right up to the other end, a very expensive, unwinding of the IT systems in order that you've got complete separation. I mean that's what I'd say, much below not a lot of time.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now the thing I'm trying to get a feel for how much is sort of upfront CapEx and money you'd have to spend directly on the systems and how much has been ongoing? You know if you've got, either site can...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>The bigger ones. Yeah, the full-on sort of &#x2013; I'll give you a range. 800 billion, right, and ongoing 50 to 100, right, so it's in five to six years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just that last point. Should you have something for changing competitive dynamics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, when you think about it, I mean it's still in a retail market, it's just the cost of being in that market. So the cost to operate goes up, right. I don't know that it affects your going to market all that much.</p>

          <p>Last question, Sandra.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sandra McCullagh, Credit Suisse. David you, I wonder if you could quantify the customer service comments you made, so if you could give us some idea of what the lower-than-desired customer service is costing you in terms of churn and compensation for customers, so what's the potential prize at the end of this customer service improvement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good question. Firstly, I'm primarily focused on getting rid of the unnecessary work. I think there is too many repeat calls coming into the business, too many transfers, we are having to respond to too much, so I think there is enormous opportunity to reduce work, in sort of the 5 to 10% type range. That's work element as you go forward. But the critical thing is if you can just move churn by 0.1, 0.2% the benefits to us go straight to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>So now the sorts of things. I don't need to move churn very much to get an enormous benefit. We are still working though some of it but we've got some internal targets, which we've set but now we will see that may be we will talk about that at the end of the year, but very important, this is not just a nice feel good thing, may be one business results for us.</p>
          <p>Thanks very much. We will conclude there. I will turn the call back to David if he has got any final closing remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>No. thanks very much. Great. Thanks for your time, we will be obviously talking to a number of you over the next few days but we've finished with strong results and looking forward for the next year. Thank you.</p>
