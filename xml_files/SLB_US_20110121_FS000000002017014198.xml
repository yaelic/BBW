          <p>Thank you, Julie . Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited fourth quarter and full year 2010 results conference call. Joining me for today's call are Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>Before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request. We will welcome your questions after the prepared statements.</p>
          <p>And now, I'll turn the call over to Simon.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.85 per share. This is an increase of $0.15 sequentially and $0.18 compared to the same quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we recorded $0.09 of charges relating to the repurchase of certain bonds and other merger-related items. We anticipate we will continue to incur merger-related charges throughout 2011 as we continue the integration of Smith.</p>
          <p>The Q4 results include a full quarter of activity from the acquired Smith companies as compared to only one month in Q3. We have continued to make significant progress on our integration during the quarter and while the transaction was dilutive to the quarter's result by approximately $0.05, we continue to believe it will be breakeven by the end of the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Turning to the business segments, Oilfield Services fourth quarter revenue increased 9% sequentially, while WesternGeco revenue increased 17%. The legacy Smith businesses contributed $2.5 billion in revenue to the quarter.</p>
          <p>Approximately 25% of the growth in Oilfield Services was attributable to the traditional year-end surge in product and software sales. The remaining increase was largely due to the continued strong Well Service performance in U.S. land as well as revenue generated from the early payout of an IPM gain-share project in North America.</p>
          <p>Oilfield Services pre-tax operating income of $1.3 billion increased 21% compared to the prior quarter, while the pre-tax operating margin increased 224 basis points to 22.1%. This increase was largely driven by the strong performance in North America where margin improved by 6.6 percentage points.</p>
          <p> N Am margins grew 658 basis points to 24% led by U.S. land. The early payout of the IPM gain-share project which contributed approximately $0.02 to the fourth quarter earnings per share accounted for just over two percentage points of the North America margin improvement.</p>
          <p>International margins improved sequentially by 49 basis points to 21.9%. This improvement was primarily driven by a more favorable revenue mix in the Peru, Columbia, Ecuador and North Sea GeoMarkets.</p>
          <p>In the Middle East, pre-tax operating margin decreased as the effects of year-end product and software sales were not sufficient to offset the impact of the weather related delays in Australia, start-up cost in Iraq, and an overall less favorable revenue mix.</p>
          <p>Sequentially, WesternGeco pre-tax operating income increased by $73 million to $113 million, and pre-tax operating margin increased by almost 12 percentage points to 20.2% on account of robust Multiclient sales.</p>
          <p>The legacy Smith segment, particularly Smith Oilfield Services performed very well, contributing $275 million of pre-tax operating income to the quarter's results.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 23.1%, representing an increase of just over two percentage points compared to last quarter. This increase was primarily driven by the fact that we generated a significantly larger portion of our earnings in North America in Q4 as well as the continued impact of the Smith merger.</p>
          <p>We expect the ETR for the full year of 2011 to be in the mid-20s. This reflects the planned mix of activity between North America and the rest of the world as well as the full-year impact of the Smith merger. However, I continue to remind you that we can experience volatility on a quarterly basis due to the geographic mix of business.</p>
          <p>We ended the quarter with $5.5 billion of cash and investment on hand and short-term debt of $1.7 billion. Net debt was $2.6 billion at the end of the quarter, as compared to $3.5 billion at the end of Q3. This improvement reflects very strong cash collections in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1 billion of CapEx, $449 million of stock repurchases and $200 million contribution to our retiree medical plan.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we issued $1.3 billion of 2.75% notes due in 2015, and subsequent to the quarter end, we issued $1.1 billion of 4.2% notes due in 2021 and $500 million of 2.65% notes due in 2016.</p>
          <p>Yesterday our Board of Directors approved a 19% increase in our dividend, which brings our annual dividend to $1 per share. This increase reflects the fact that we have not increased our dividend over the past two years and is consistent with our intention to return excess cash to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Along the same lines, we will continue to be opportunistic and aggressive when appropriate with our stock buyback activity. Throughout all of 2010 we spent $1.7 billion repurchasing 26.6 million shares at an average price of $64.48, despite the fact that we were blacked out for a significant period as a result of the Smith transaction.</p>
          <p>CapEx for all of Schlumberger is expected to approach $4 billion in 2011 as compared to $2.9 billion in 2010.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I just want to remind everyone that starting next quarter, our primary segment reporting will be based on our group structure. In this regard, shortly after this call we will be publishing an update to the pro forma financial information that we release in early December to reflect the Q4 and full-year 2010 results in this new format. This information can be found on our website.</p>
          <p>And now I will turn the conference over to Andrew.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Simon and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Schlumberger fourth quarter revenue was $9.07 billion versus $6.85 billion in the third quarter of 2010 and $5.74 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009. These figures reflect a full quarter of activity from the acquired Smith businesses.</p>
          <p>In Oilfield Services, North America activity remained strong through growing demand for services in liquid-rich plays and from seasonal improvements in Canada. Improved pricing and the restructuring efforts that we began in April continued to contribute to margin expansion, particularly for Well Services activities.</p>
          <p>Results also benefited from the accelerated IPM gain-share on the sale by the customer of a project on land in the U.S. which clearly demonstrates how this business model can create value.</p>
          <p>Outside North America, activity improvements in the North Sea, West Africa and Middle East and Asia GeoMarkets coupled with strong year-end product sales, particularly for software, more than offset the combination of continued weakness in Mexico and the seasonal activity decline in Russia. While this was balanced to some degree by the rapid ramp up of activity in Iraq, which did not yield equivalent profitability as it was impacted by heavy start-up costs.</p>
          <p>At WesternGeco excellent fourth quarter Multiclient sales were mostly due to the enhanced quality of subsalt imaging products in the Gulf of Mexico. While the acquired Smith businesses continued to outperform our original expectations with revenue synergies through the acquisition increasing in each successive month of the quarter.</p>
          <p>This quarter's report is particularly rich in technical success. Whether through the continuing market penetration of leading services such as the Scope advanced logging-while-drilling measurements, Scanner wireline technologies or ACTive coiled-tubing services, the integrated nature of the portfolio underscored considerable success.</p>
          <p>Scanner services, for example, are being boosted by the commercial introduction of the latest family member, the Dielectric Scanner. As a unique industry service capable of measuring saturation in a variety of reservoir applications, the service completed a two-year pilot project in Saudi Arabia targeted at reservoir monitoring where 35 logs have been recorded in various fields both on land and offshore to assess water flooding sweep efficiency as an aid to field development planning.</p>
          <p>The results show the technology capable of determining oil saturation independent of water salinity while achieving efficiency gains over previous monitoring methods and have now led to the service being considered for use in heavy oil and shaly sand environments.</p>
          <p>In reservoir production, active real-time coiled-tubing services saw growth, particularly with the ACTive conveyance of wireline flow scanner production logging technology and with fiber optics continuous measurements of temperature and pressure along the well bore. Expanding deployment of integrated technologies such as these confirm conveyance-enabled wireline services to have exciting growth opportunities particularly in horizontal and extended reach wells.</p>
          <p>It is, however, in the drilling portfolio that displayed some of the most exciting successes. These included the completion of the remote three well exploration project offshore Greenland that used Schlumberger technologies combined with Swift and M-I SWACO products and services as well as Geoservices mud logging.</p>
          <p>In Brazil a similar combination of services helped one well record substantial increases in rates of penetration while meeting all the directional drilling goals. In this case the integrated nature of the bottomhole assembly demonstrated how technology optimization can impact performance in the high-cost deepwater drilling environment. A third such operation offshore Indonesia further confirmed the value of integrated bottomhole assemblies.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to mention the inauguration of two new Schlumberger facilities in Brazil to support what has become one of the fastest growing regions in the world. On November 16th we opened the Brazil Research and Geoengineering Center in Rio de Janeiro and the following day our latest new generation operations base in Maca&#xE9;.</p>
          <p>The new research center is designed to promote the integration of geosciences and engineering to improve hydrocarbon production and recovery from the complex deepwater reservoirs and pre-salt carbonates offshore Brazil. The center also houses a new WesternGeco Geosolutions Center dedicated to processing of the revolutionary single-vessel full-azimuth Q-Marine services that have now penetrated all the major offshore areas around the world.</p>
          <p>As we look forward to 2011, it is important to remember that the primary driver of our business has always been and will remain the demand for oil and gas. For oil, 2010 turned out to be the year of the second largest demand increase in the last 30 years. The consensus for customer demand in 2011 shows a further healthy increase.</p>
          <p>Oil prices have moved into a range that will encourage increased investment, particularly in exploration which remains the swing factor in operator's budgets. While we do not anticipate any substantial recovery in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we do expect a marked increase in deepwater activity in the rest of the world. These factors, coupled with increases in development activity and production enhancement in many other areas, promise stronger growth rates as the year unfolds.</p>
          <p>For natural gas, demand recovery has been less marked. Increases in supply of both unconventional gas in the United States and liquefied natural gas around the world will limit the progress of prices. Nonetheless, activity in the United States is likely to remain strong, at least through the first half of the year, due to the commitments necessary to retain leases, the backlog of wells to be completed, and the contribution of natural gas liquids to overall project economics. Increased service capacity, however, will negatively affect pricing at some stage during the year.</p>
          <p>Overseas, the governing factor on gas activity, particularly in the Middle East, will be the ability of many nations to use gas as a substitute for oil to meet increased local energy demand thus freeing up more liquids for export. Elsewhere, the long lead time necessary to execute large gas projects for LNG exports will ensure that a certain level of activity is maintained.</p>
          <p>Unconventional gas resources will continue to attract considerable interest outside North America. The leading activity will continue to be in conventional gas in tight or low permeability reservoirs and in coalbed methane development. There will be exploration activity around the potential that shale gas offers in many other parts of the world.</p>
          <p>Increased activity coupled with greater technology needs of higher exploration, deepwater spend and tight gas, particularly outside North America, will make 2011 a stronger year for Schlumberger. The importance of risk reduction and the minimization of drilling cost make the acquisitions of Geoservices and Smith major contributors to our future growth in this scenario.</p>
          <p>Thank you, and Julie, I think we are ready for questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And we'll go to the line of Brad Handler with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Brad.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess the first question I would just love to hear a little bit more on how &#x2013; on what was a very impressive revenue growth number in the U.S. land market, or just a little bit more color, if you would, on sort of utilization of assets. If you could comment on capacity increase and then on pricing, that would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the biggest contributors in Q4 as opposed to Q3 were still efficiency gains in activity with some contribution, though not huge, from increased capacity. So it really was more the results of the restructuring efforts. In terms of price, the Q4 effect was less than the Q3 effect. So it really was the results of the restructuring effort, much greater efficiency and much better utilization that led the improvement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very impressive. Okay. Perhaps as a follow-up, stick with the same part of the world, could you offer some thoughts on the Gulf of Mexico and your outlook? I know you spoke to it a little bit in your comments, but your outlook for the next couple of quarters, specifically, and then also as we move into the end of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we anticipate any major return to work in the first half of the year. I think we may see a few rigs come back. But we still think that there are a number of issues that the operators really need clearer resolution on before they are in a position to apply for new permits. And we anticipate that in the second half of the year the rate of increase will accelerate. But we're not &#x2013; we don't think we're going back to anything like the 33 rigs that were drilling when the moratorium started.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you assume that -</p>

        <plist>

          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In 2012, if you're asking do I doubt the future of deepwater Gulf of Mexico absolutely not, and I think that our Multiclient sales are a very good proxy for the fact that there is still a huge interest in deepwater Gulf of Mexico. But until some of the questions around the regulation and the definition of liability and the definition of what constitutes well containment are settled, it's difficult to know exactly who the client base is going to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Good morning, Andrew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Kurt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, you referenced obviously on your commentary, the IPM project in North America and you put that impact in the commentary as well. So I'm just curious here, can you elaborate a little bit more on this IPM gain-sharing project? And can you elaborate more on how this business model has evolved for Schlumberger and how can we think about that impacting Schlumberger differentially compared to its peers as we move forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the project in question was in the Bakken. The owner of the project was a private equity. So therefore we did absolutely everything. We invested our services as our share of the investment. And normally we would have been paid out on the ratio of our services over the balance of the whole project life. But the agreement contained a resolution in case of the owner selling the property, which gave us the same multiple on our invested services cost as the seller obtained on his sale.</p>
          <p>So what I'm saying is that it is unlikely that these projects get sold very often, because it's far more likely that they continue for long periods of time, particularly outside the United States where they tend to be with national oil companies rather than with private investors. But it does demonstrate how &#x2013; where our technology allows the customer to create considerable value in a short period of time, how we can share in it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So in the context of that, as we think about this from a financial community standpoint, it's something that could recur, but is something that is -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. It's something which is providing a new income stream in Schlumberger, which is not particularly visible yet because it's not big enough, but at very satisfactory returns. The only reason you saw this one in one quarter was because the operator sold it. And overseas, particularly, it's unlikely that operators, particularly as they're national oil companies, will sell them. So the gain will be spread over the contract life as opposed to coming in one quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I may, just on a follow-up, in U.S. you referenced, again, some concerns about potential pricing pressure in the market. How would you characterize your conviction in that perspective? And is it something that we could be looking to update and change maybe on a quarter-on-quarter basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean I don't &#x2013; I've been wrong on North America so often, Kurt, that I'm reluctant to say too much. I don't think there's a huge risk to activity in the first half of the year. I do think that pricing momentum is going to slow, progressively. But at the point where it tips over, I suspect it's going to depend on when the capacity out there is sufficient to address the current activity. And it looks as if that's in the second half of the year, not the first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks, Andrew.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So can you talk a little bit about what could &#x2013; your thought process around why 2012 and -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For all the reasons I gave to Brad earlier. Firstly, there is &#x2013; while some of the regulations have been defined, some of them haven't. The need for environmental assessments and spill containment capability is on the way but is not yet there. And it's not yet, I think, necessarily clearly understood how the operators are all going to share that. I think that the operators are not going to commit until they're pretty sure of the framework within which they are going to operate. And I just doubt that for rank exploration we're going to get that clarity in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if we look elsewhere in the world, what do you see as the most prospective exploration bases at the moment and whether it's seismic activity or well testing or any other of your exploration-oriented services, are there any new basins that could in 2011 pick up the slack from Gulf of Mexico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean when we look at &#x2013; let me answer you &#x2013; that another way. When we look at deepwater in 2011, the number of effective rig years added &#x2013; so this is not the number of rigs added, it's the number of rig years, which is the number of months they're actually drilling, right? Is much &#x2013; is substantially greater than in 2010. And if we look at &#x2013; if I look at &#x2013; if I leave aside Brazil where everybody knows the story and you can to some extent make your own estimate of how many rigs will actually get added, then I think the most prospective area we're going to see in terms of deepwater exploration in 2011 is West and East Africa and to some extent remote Indonesia.</p>

          <p>If I may ask a third question, what are your thoughts on WesternGeco in this context? Is the fact that the Gulf of Mexico is a bit of a vacuum maybe this year a problem, or is the international momentum strong enough -?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think momentum in proprietary seismic outside the United States is sufficient to absorb capacity, but the lack of the Gulf of Mexico is going to slow pricing. We thought we would get pricing momentum back early this year. We are now thinking that if we do get it back it's going to be late this year. The big question, I think, on seismic for 2011 is if there is prospectively a large lease sale at the beginning of 2012, then Multiclient could be very strong in the second half of this year.</p>

          <p>If I could ask a question on fracing as it relates to a comment you made earlier last year about drilling geometrically versus drilling geologically. The frac market has been essentially geometric as well. But there is evidence that that market is perhaps migrating more towards an intelligent model faster than the shale drilling market in North America. Could you talk about that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; and the trend of geometric to geologic activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you have to assume that over time that you call it geologically, but geologically what we're trying to do is to drill in such a way that we can identify the place where we want to have completions instead of geometrically completing it, because we don't really know where the sweet spots are. Or we can't classify them well enough to do it otherwise.</p>
          <p>I think that progress is being made. I think that this is going to go faster outside the U.S. than inside the U.S. for the reason that a lot of the environmental concerns and the infrastructure concerns that can be addressed in the North American market cannot be addressed overseas and therefore people are going to be a lot more careful and we definitely are seeing that. So over time, yes, I still believe that completions will be designed geologically as opposed to geometrically, that drilling and measurement will become a tool to reduce the intensity of fracs, but we're not there yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But those markets are essentially trending in tandem as opposed to &#x2013; it strikes me that perhaps the completions market with microseismic and variable staging is perhaps moving more towards an intelligent model faster than -?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't think we would include microseismic in that, because microseismic is a so-what service. In other words, it's done after the fact. What we're talking about is services that are rendered before the fact in such a way that you design the completion to minimize the footprint and eliminate the fracs that &#x2013; the preparations that a frac can never produce anything.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are seeing a very considerable increase in business associated around the design of EOR programs, particularly in the Middle East. Shell is very active, particularly in Oman, in EOR. And the programs that we have with Shell are around services where our capacity to do characterization with downhole tools can be matched with Shell's knowledge of how the reservoir behaves. And I would say that the collaboration at the moment is linked to two very specific services and going forward we'll see how it goes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. Andrew, you talked about exploration as a swing factor in operator budgets. Is that something that you're already seeing and is reflected in your current outlook? Or would you view it as upside as you see demand, oil and gas demand or I guess oil demand continuing to improve and confidence improving as the commodity price holds up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you &#x2013; it's a little bit of both. I mean, I think everybody noticed that Total made a public statement about the amount of exploration they were going to do. And when we visit potentially strong exploration GeoMarkets at this point in time, we find customers making a lot of inquiries that they weren't making three months ago. So a lot of it will be second half year.</p>
          <p>And why is it the swing factor? It's a swing factor because it's the only thing they can ramp up quickly. They can't ramp up big new development projects quickly because of the amount of engineering that's necessary. And therefore the swing factor is exploration and to some extent trying to enhance production from existing fields.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay great. That's very helpful. And unrelated follow-up, on the CapEx side, a decent increase, but less than I might have thought given that you'll have a full year of Smith. Is that a function of better asset utilization and synergies between the two, or is that something that we could see under upward pressure either because opportunities materialize or cost inflation or just -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So firstly, we always &#x2013; will we review CapEx particularly in the CapEx intensive segments every quarter. And any CapEx that we authorize in the end of March, for example, will hit the end of the year. If it's beyond that, it's 2012.</p>
          <p>You have to remember that Smith is not a CapEx intensive business. There's not a CapEx intensive business nearly to the extent that Schlumberger is. So you can assume that the bulk of the increase is Schlumberger, not Smith.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. And then the second line of inquiry, if you will, is North America. And not going to pin you down here with regard to when exactly margins roll. But I guess in terms of your expectation here, using '06 to 2008 before the world came to an end as an analogue, when we had the capacity growth and then the market became more balanced and then margins over kind of '06 to '08 normalized if you will, and if I look at Schlumberger, specifically your margins peaked out at 30%, 31% in North America and then over two years, basically regressed to kind of a low 20s range. So it wasn't a collapse but it was a normalization -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just say it was a lot better than previous cycles, Bill.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Indeed. And those were good margins even in sort of a normalized state. So I'm wondering is the expectation this time around for a similar evolution or are you looking for something more dramatic with regard to a margin response based upon all the capacity that's coming?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No the impact &#x2013; so the impact on capacity. I mean you mentioned that, sensibly, that you think that pricing momentum is going to slow. And the implicit statement there is that margins obviously, that momentum is going to slow as well. And at some point they're going to roll. And I guess what I'm interested in is your perspective with regard to the evolution of that margin roll. Is it a normalization, or is it a more dramatic reduction in margins over time? What's your expectation, at this stage?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Andrew, I'd like to just get your thoughts on the progression of margins internationally, just when you think about there are three drivers, right? There's pricing, volumes, but then there's also mix that can be impacted as you up sell technology. Just give us your thoughts on where you are on the pricing front but also where you are on the product and exploration cycle, seismic has been picking up but you did mention in the commentary that you had a poor mix in the Middle East?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The fourth quarter is traditionally not a great mix in the Middle East because of the artificial lift in completion sales which obviously have lower margins than our measurement technologies. I think that international margins, bidding international markets on large developments will remain for comparable technology extremely competitive, because everyone wants to grow overseas. But the higher the oil price is, the more people are in a hurry, the more the exploration they do, the more that we are going to be able to upgrade our technology sales.</p>
          <p>And if you remember, I think I said publicly on several occasions that we actually did slow technology introduction a little bit in 2009, 2010 because we felt that the pricing environment was not such that we could realize the full value. I think you will see in 2011 and 2012 the rate at which we introduce that new technology, particularly towards the end of this year and even more importantly in 2012 is going to increase considerably.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just a follow-up on a comment you made earlier on one hand you have exploration which oil companies can pick up quickly but then you also have work on mature fields, which I know goes back to the root of IPM. Can you comment on what you're &#x2013; are you seeing IPM bidding activity on these mature fields picking up and what type of growth rate could we expect as we look out over the year?.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think &#x2013; IPM tends to be a huge project or nothing. So is the dollar volume of projects on which we're bidding much higher? It's much, much higher and &#x2013; but actually how many deals we will land and what effect it will have on 2011 is very difficult to put a number on. So I have absolutely no doubt we will land a couple of big deals. But I suspect they're more likely to be significant in 2012 rather than 2011.</p>

          <p>Andrew, I was hoping perhaps you could talk a little bit about, just in the short term how we should think about the progression in the Eastern Hemisphere as we look at fourth quarter to first quarter, with product and software sales not recurring in 1Q and more intense weather in Russia, and say the North Sea causing some seasonal disruptions there. How do we think about the progression fourth to first quarter either top line margins Eastern Hemisphere as a whole or maybe some sort of cents per share that you could attach to that? Perhaps that's a better question for Simon?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We don't give guidance, Bill as you know, but we won't be at all surprised if the earnings &#x2013; EPS in Q1 is lower than in Q4, because of the seasonality of both the Russian market which you know is very large for us, the weather effects of the North Sea and the absence of the sales &#x2013; the product and software sales that we have in Q4. And the big number there of course, is that Q4 is always the highest quarter for Multiclient seismic. And &#x2013; which did extremely well and Q1 will be much lower than what's typical.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thank you for that color. One additional question, I know we've essentially reiterated our outlook as it relates to an expected/unexpected kind of breakeven expectation on Smith by fourth quarter '11. In the past you've quantified the cost savings related to this deal. I think we've heard more positive commentary about revenue synergies here. Anything, Andrew, in terms of mix that's changing your outlook and how you get to breakeven and at some point do we start getting a little bit more quantification on the revenue pull-through or revenue synergies you see from the Smith deal?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just a quick question for Simon right off the bat, in your release you had mentioned a $0.05 gain on inventory adjustments. I assume that was mostly in North America. If so did that contribute to the sequential margin gain this quarter in North America? I'm just trying to get a handle on how sustainable these margins are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. This is actually related to the Smith integration, it's not only North America, it's total, and it is a step up in inventory that it gets amortized over the period of the consumption of the inventory. No, it has nothing &#x2013; it has no impact on the sequential gain in North America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And Andrew, I just want to move on to the Middle East. In your comment &#x2013; in your statements you were talking about gas in the Middle East. And it's pretty obvious we all know that the region is short of gas. But there doesn't seem to be a sense of urgency over there on the part of the NOCs, how do you see this playing out over the next couple of years and how much of a catalyst could this be for your business, do you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You cannot be talking to the same NOCs as I am, David, because without mentioning names, we see considerable urgency and worry, which is reflected in, for example, in a lot of exploration work that we're doing in one country and the fact that we are heavily participating in a gas development in another country. So I don't know where you got your information but I don't see it at all that way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And one other question, just in terms of market dynamics in the Middle East. If we go back and we compare it now to really '05, how do you see the kind of overall competition kind of playing out? It seems like some of your competitors have used that downturn to build out capacity. Are you concerned at all about share losses, or do you think that the gas side can more than make up for any kind of capacity that's been built up out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first you're going to have to identify the share losses for me, because we don't see them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't make press releases every time we win a contract. And it's not &#x2013; the spectacular announcements that have been made have been in markets where we didn't participate very much anyway. So we don't see any significant share loss across the Middle East. And in fact in one or two of the new programs, we see significant share gain.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I guess my first question will be on the international shale here. A commentary on this, on the opportunities around this sort of dominated your press release and your spoken commentary here this morning. Can you talk about the expectations here maybe in the areas of the regional growth and maybe how this may affect your expectations of relative growth in mix, say D&amp;E versus completion services?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was very careful to say in the commentary that the principal activity in unconventional gas, not shale, unconventional gas in the international market for the next year or so, is going to be in tight gas, that is low permeability formations. That is pretty general across the Eastern Hemisphere, particularly in North Africa, the Middle East, to some extent in Russia and coalbed methane, which is essentially Australia.</p>
          <p>The international shale gas activity which is going on at the moment can be classified very much as exploration activity as opposed to development, because for the reasons I mentioned before, there is no way that overseas people can mobilize the land or the infrastructure or the environmental constraints the same way as in the United States. And therefore they are going to be much more careful before they go into full scale development.</p>
          <p>In terms of unconventional gas or shale gas exploration overseas, we have a very high participation. The essential places where this is taking place at the moment are Poland, Argentina, India, Algeria and China. And tight gas would be the Middle East and Russia and to a certain extent North Africa.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's big D&amp;E laden activity still?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, you're not going to get me to say that the international market is going to go to the same fracing solutions as the U.S., because they won't.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Appreciate that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So yes, it's drilling and evaluation at the moment. Fracing will always be a part of it and therefore fracing is important once they've done their D&amp;E to see how these wells are actually going to flow but it is not going to be on the scale of the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I appreciate that. My follow-up is an international pricing question. When you look at your current spare capacity and notionally that of your peers, how long do you think it will take to absorb this capacity to a point where pricing becomes a material contributor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, I have always said that it doesn't depend on the capacity. It depends on the rate of acceleration in activities. Therefore for significant pricing traction in services that all the principal oilfield services companies can provide to take place would require a much greater activity increase than we see at this point in time, and I suspect that if it does happen, it's going to be because oil prices are sustained around about $90 to $100 into 2012.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Andrew, you've highlighted a number of times that new technology introductions will accelerate in late 2011 and in 2012. I generally think of new technology just introduced over the last five years accounting for about 30% of revenue in any given year. Is this in the ballpark for Schlumberger? And is that revenue mix of new technology for Schlumberger, whatever that is, meaningfully below normal right now given the downturn in 2009 and in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's been meaningfully below the normal. And therefore the acceleration in the rate at which we introduce will be a meaningful increment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is that 30% figure in the ballpark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. Switching to Mexico, still seeing weakness in that market, are there any signs of a meaningful recovery in 2011, and what do you see the implications of the performance-based contracts in Mexico being for Schlumberger?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there is &#x2013; in my mind there is considerable uncertainty around how the PEMEX budget gets spent in 2011. I don't think it's necessarily going to be exactly what was laid out. And therefore we remain very cautious on the overall level of activity in Mexico. We think it will be good in the south. We think there will be some improvement offshore. But as far as the north is concerned, we are quite reluctant to be anything other than very conservative.</p>
          <p>In terms of the performance contracts, the only ones that have been let out so far are so small that I don't think they're of great interest to us and possibly not the other service companies. I think the first wave will probably go to local Mexican companies. And obviously we will be bidding with local Mexican companies to provide the services necessary to execute the contracts. I think that the first wave is to test the system and the really interesting ones will come later.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, could you give us a little bit of color on what you're seeing specifically in Iraq and Russia? On Iraq, obviously you had high start up cost in Q4. Do you expect that to continue into Q1 as well as Q2, and thoughts for margins as we progress through the year, generally? And then on Russia, activity growth, outlook for 2011 and color on the Eurasia asset swap, the alliance and where you're getting traction in the region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on Iraq, we &#x2013; our revenue in the fourth quarter was closer to 50 million than 10 million. We have three rigs drilling for BP. We are currently mobilizing three rigs for ExxonMobil. We are providing services to a number of other customers on a call-out basis and a discrete basis. And we have inherited some business from Smith in Kurdistan. So we will have further start up costs in Q1. But we are optimistic that we will breakeven in Q1 and be profitable in Q2. And we will with careful contract management, have an ambition to be in double-digit margins by the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. And on Russia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Russia, western Siberia will have a better year. Sakhalin will have some slowdown because basically one of our customers is doing a six month rig move. And the rest of it, eastern Siberia, I think we will continue to see some good exploration and development in some of the new fields. So overall, Russia will have a better year than it did in 2010 but not a gangbusters year because of the slowing in Sakhalin.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then as an unrelated follow-up you mentioned in the press release that you're seeing revenue synergies from Smith and specifically you mentioned drill bits and Brazil. Where else are you seeing revenue synergies as far as by product line or region and are you seeing traction with PathFinder internationally?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Andrew, in the press release you talk about stronger growth rates as the year unfolds. How should we think about the trajectory? I think that comment refers to international growth and related to your comment earlier about pricing being tied to the pace of growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that the best proxy for the growth rate going through the year is going to be the rate at which you see offshore rigs either coming into service as new builds or being contracted out of the existing fleet. Because as I said in answer to an earlier question, we can see a lot of inquiries, but the rigs don't yet have contracts. So it's likely to be second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. So a little bit of second half weighting. You've also mentioned several times the expectation of increased exploration activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You've made these comments, forecasts before. It doesn't seem like they've necessarily come to fruition in the past. What's your confidence level on this increase in exploration activity -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was extremely confident last year until Macondo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Macondo, as I've said before put significant delays all over the world not because people abandoned programs but because everybody wanted to check their rigs before they proceeded. We think most of the Macondo delay is behind us outside the United States and that the number of rig years from new builds in 2011 is significantly higher than in 2010. So my confidence level is the fact that I hope to God we don't have another Macondo and the fact that &#x2013; so that the inefficiency that came overseas because of Macondo has been absorbed and because the number of new deepwater rigs that's being added is higher this year than it was in 2010.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could add just one more question directed to Simon. You gave us a 2011 tax rate guidance. I wondered if you could give us a sense just kind of rough estimate of what the pro forma tax rate for Schlumberger would have been if you had owned Smith for the entirety of 2010. The question is really mid 20s seems like you're kind of expecting North America contribution to be at or maybe even slightly above what it was in 2010, which doesn't seem to be consistent with the other commentary. But I don't have a pro forma for the combination with Smith.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Geoff, I don't think you can conclude on our growth rates and from a tax rate, but let me &#x2013; to answer your question, obviously, if we had Smith for the whole year it will be higher, because Smith is a U.S. based source income. We do see the mix. I mean, as you know the U.S. source income during 2010 increased gradually. So in 2011 we'll continue at the same pace, and obviously that's a result of the increased effective tax rate. It's both the mix of revenues, not only from North America but other places as well and the Smith.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I shouldn't really relate -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, I said it's hard to reconcile where the growth rate is coming compared to the tax rate that is the element of Smith, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. What I was saying is we shouldn't assume that higher tax rates necessarily means higher North American contribution?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, because of the heritage Smith. The other thing, Geoff, is that Simon will of course be gradually restructuring throughout the year in such a way that we try to minimize the effect of the fact that Smith was a U.S. company. It is very difficult for him to predict exactly what the tax rate's going to be this year.</p>

          <p>I guess, Andrew, I'd just &#x2013; I guess close with North America margins, the nice improvement in the quarter. And even excluding that one-time win. But you're still below your largest competitor. Is there still more upside do you think? And then I guess secondarily &#x2013; or do you need a &#x2013; because you guys are so strong in the deep Gulf, need really some normalization before you can get margins back to the mid 20s or maybe even better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We still have upside certainly through the first quarter. You are probably correct in that for us our margins to be considerably better than our principal competitors we need the deepwater Gulf back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And there's a little bit of your normal, whatever, skepticism, about sustainability in North America in the comments. As you're allocating CapEx here to some of these bigger plays with a fairly, pretty robust budget for '11, are you &#x2013; is there a kind of a contingency for the second half that you're going to wait and see in certain areas before putting additional frac crews or directional crews into specific markets, or that might even cost you a little bit of share or I'm just wondering how you're handling -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we got caught out on the way up by our organization and we have reorganized in such a way that we understood &#x2013; we now thoroughly understand what we're managing and how we're managing it. And you can assume that the true test of the systems that have been put in place will actually be on the downside rather than the upside. So without wanting to tell you exactly what we plan, I can tell you that we have a very robust planning system to deal with any roll over in activity in North America.</p>

          <p>So you think you have more flexibility in terms of managing your fixed costs?</p>
