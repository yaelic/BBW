        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. Before Marcus take the usual details into our 2010 financials and the outlook for the coming year. Let me share with you my prospective on the E.ON conference today. I have been appointed as CEO, roughly 12 months ago. The times and the general economy was just recovering from very severe crisis. The negative impact on the energy industry came with certain time lack that was not less pronounced.</p>
          <p>Equally, the recovery within the sector will take time especially since an increase in demand alone will not be adequate enough. We at E.ON are convinced that our sector is undergoing a radical change, a change which requires new answers and new approaches, which then and only then continue to offer plenty of opportunities in the coming years.</p>
          <p>The changes driven not only by the general economic development which among others will lead to a different balance between developed and developing regions, but it's equally due to a changing political and regulatory environment. The long-term drivers of growth however are obvious. Climate and environmental protection limited both our fuel resources and a growing energy consumption worldwide.</p>
          <p>That said; capturing the value arising from those drivers will require far more than successfully reaping the benefits from eventually rising prices and spreads. This is why we developed a new strategy, a strategy to be executed by a new and very determined team, which reaches far beyond the bottom.</p>
          <p>A new strategy based on a completely revised organizational setup, which will significantly increase the activity and transparency of our group. In the nutshell, our game plan is based upon first, it could be positioning on the value change; second, a clear view on the prospects of individual geographic regions and their potentials; thirdly, the performance and excellent culture as a primary driver of activity shaping our own future; and forth and lastly, an investment philosophy, which recognizes that the capital scales and valuable resource. The transformation that we have in front of us is not without risk if you turn over. However, for the benefit of our shareholders, our customers and employees, we're determined to make that a traceable and tangible success.</p>
          <p>We closed the year 2010 successfully broadly inline with expectations. 2011, from today's standpoint, mark the bottom in our earnings development. The following years thereafter are expected to show higher profits year-by-year. Based on the excellent position of our conventional generation fleet, our growing investments in renewable generation, E&amp;P in Russia, will increasingly shape our bottom line. The potential recovery of prices and spreads is down an additional upside optionality on top for our current communication expense.</p>
          <p>The portfolio management activity that will support our transformation, will lead to a loss of earnings in the near term. However with the recent divestments, selectively pursued to maximize value, we have regained our financial flexibility and further divestment proceeds will be reinvested into E.ON's future. We will not put assets into the ground if they are not needed.</p>
          <p>However, if we see plenty of opportunities and needs for our skills and competencies, and have therefore no reason to change our communication and targets with respect to our overall CapEx program.</p>
          <p>After this general scene setting, let me now quickly comment on our current financial situation. E.ON's operating 2010 results are in line with the outlook the we have given throughout the year. Despite the &#x20AC;800 million negative impact from earlier disposals, adjusted EBITDA ended up 3% higher than the prior year, adjusted EBIT rose 2%.</p>
          <p>On a like-for-like basis, excluding those disposals, EBIT of the ongoing operations would have improved by more than 10%. For me, this demonstrates the strength of our underlying operations. I would also like to point out the development in our new markets, adjusted for one effects &#x2013; one-off effects. An example, the 2009 contract renegotiation in Italy and profits comp out to A2A, the EBIT in the new markets up over 50% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Adjusted net income is 4% lower than the prior year. This is driven by higher minority interests and a one-off item leading to higher interest expense. As announced at the Capital Market Day, we propose to pay out a dividend of &#x20AC;1.50 per share. This corresponds to a payout of 59% of adjusted net income is therefore within the range we've always announced.</p>
          <p>I'm also very pleased with the continued positive development of the operating cash flow, up &#x20AC;2 billion to &#x20AC;10.6 billion. Thanks to these strong operating cash flow as well as disposal proceeds. We reduced the debt factor to a very satisfactory level of 2.8 times including disposal signed within 2011, the debt factor at pro forma level would even further go down to 2.5 times.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you in this respect that the EBIT &#x2013; that the E.ON's debt factor is based upon economic net debt. The pure net financial liabilities amount only just over half of the total economic debts with the remainder mainly the asset retirement obligations being of a very, very long-term nature. This should underline the point I made earlier. Our balance sheet is in order. The absolute amount of debt has seen its peak last year and we can now consciously develop the group forward in line with our strategy.</p>
          <p>This brings me to the 2011 outlook. We expect adjusted EBITDA to come out between &#x20AC;11.2 billion at &#x20AC;11.9 billion, 10% to 15% lower than in 2010. There are some large negative developments affecting the earnings this year. The introduction of the nuclear tax in Germany, negative margins in gas supply and sales, the decline of power prices and spreads as well as the absence of positive one-off effects in our German regulated activities.</p>
          <p>On the positive side however, we are well on track to <mark type="inaudible" /> PerformtoWin program, also the investments in Russia in renewable generation and in E&amp;P are also increasingly paying off. So 2011 would not be an easy year. The environment is challenging and we are going through a transformation phase to make E.ON a better company and a more attractive investment in the medium-term. I have however, no doubt that we will be successful. This is also why we set a minimum dividend of &#x20AC;130 per share for 2011 and 2012, which was already recognized in the markets. Beyond this, we have no reason to change our 2013 targets of achieving an adjusted EBITDA of more than &#x20AC;13 billion before portfolio changes.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to chart two, based on our strengths and competencies, we have set out our new strategy and discussed it with you on November, 10. The strategy is based on four key pillars. In Europe, we will move away from being integrated across the entire value chain towards a more focused portfolio centered on competitive businesses.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we will develop the group from a Eurocentric position to expand selectively outside Europe.</p>
          <p>Third, individual efficiency programs need to be transformed into a sustainable performance culture. And fourth, change from capital-intensive business models, the solutions that create value based on leveraging our competencies not solely our capital. We are now focused on delivering on this strategy. Within a few months, we have already made tangible progress that we had discussed along lines of these four strategic pillars.</p>
          <p>Okay, change to chart number three, last week, we reached an agreement to sell the business of Central Networks in England to PPL for an enterprise value of &#xA3;4.0 billion including the transfer of &#xA3;0.2 billion of pension provisions. Central Networks is still a well performing distribution business. As part of our strategic review, we have also sell fiber, so that we are the best owner, whether we have enough opportunities to create additional value.</p>
          <p>Let me point out three key areas in this respect; first, financial flexibility, the freedom to invest and optimal cost of capital. The last distribution price review requires Central Networks to invest &#xA3;2.3 billion over the next five years, making the business overall free cash flow negative in all medium-term years.</p>
          <p>We see however capital allocation as a key value driver. This business leaves no room to maneuver. No opportunity to choose the best projects based upon the respective risk-return profile. A few of the investments are mandatory.</p>
          <p>Second, the opportunity to outperform and to keep an attractive corresponding margin is limited. We do not have the full opportunity to make the best use of our skills and assets.</p>
          <p>Third, value creation within the group is partially dependent on leveraging synergies, synergies across regions or functions; this is not possible in this case due to strict <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Overall, this transaction has been executed at excellent conditions. At outstanding multiples, at the right point, in time and supports us in swiftly executing our strategy. Following the sale of Central Networks, we nevertheless remain an important player in the UK market. With an installed power production capacity of roughly 10,000 megawatts and retail activities with almost 8 million in power and gas clients. Our activities in the UK continue to be a very influential part of the overall E.ON Group.</p>
          <p>Turning to chart number four, with our focused European position, we target to free up around &#x20AC;15 billion of capital by the end of 2013. More than half of the disposal proceeds will be used to reduce debt. The remainder of it will be redeployed into more value creating activities mainly in renewable generation and outside Europe. In only four months, since our Capital Market Day, we have achieved close to &#x20AC;9 billion of disposal proceeds, &#x20AC;4.9 billion Central Networks, &#x20AC;3.4 billion our state gas firm, &#x20AC;0.3 billion for the disposal of our utility distribution network. And another &#x20AC;0.2 billion for a number of smaller transactions. On a like-for-like basis, the transactions achieved so far would reduce 2010 adjusted EBITDA by roughly &#x20AC;700 million and adjusted net income by a good &#x20AC;100 million. The corresponding debt factor would be 0.3 times lower.</p>
          <p>Let me now turning to chart number five show a view of two key operational topics for the EU. First comment on the European generation environment; second update you on the status quo of our gas business, especially the long-term contract renegotiations. And a reduction in demand caused by economic slowdown and new productivities initiated before the crisis, as well as new renewables have lead to a quite substantial oversupply in many European markets.</p>
          <p>Various political decisions and plans sometimes in contradiction to developments in other parts of the world have further influenced the energy system and increased the challenges for the European generators. Here, I'm thinking about the sustained increase in intermittent renewable generation and as well as uncertainty around the future carbon market.</p>
          <p>Combined those developments have not only depressed spreads, but they also called for very different skills and assets in order to outperform peers and to generate value going forward. However, next the obvious state, there is always light. The market situation may not be as bleak as some suggest. Many commercial plants are currently only covering their fixed cost by selling the CO2 certificates that have been allocated for free. This will not be possible in &#x2013; any more after 2013, when all CO2 certificates will be optioned. As a consequence, we believe the closures of conventional capacity might well come earlier and be larger than one might anticipate.</p>
          <p>They will come earlier, because plants subject to the LCPD might well close ahead of 2015 deadline and they will be larger, because some plants not subject to LCPD will become uneconomic as of 2013. What I outlined, is illustrated our graph, which sums up non-retirements of conventional capacity until 2015. Mainly due to LCPD plus the conventional capacity, which will pass the specific age until 2015, which is 45 years for coal and lignite and 32 years for CCGTs and 50 years for other gas plants.</p>
          <p>We at E.ON are constantly assessing the economics of our own plants. The decision to open or close a plant is not taken top down but bottom-up in a very granular fashion. Looking at the risk return profile of old plants in the portfolio context, ranking them within the OP merit order. Let me be clear here. We are not waiting for the market to rescue anything. We have to take the market and act accordingly. We are absolutely convinced that especially in this environment, skills and assets are absolutely crucial to perform. Let me give you a few examples on that, that the value shift from the special energy markets, which is <mark type="inaudible" /> towards the reserve and balancing markets. To capture this value, you need a very flexible fossil generation asset, coupled with fast and efficient processes between the assets and the kind of dispatch and optimization function.</p>
          <p>Operational excellence either via cost leadership, in our land for thermal plant or we're ensuring a high availability of outright assets, <mark type="inaudible" /> decisive competencies to operate in this environment. Our generation fleet as well our organizational setup, which involves a superior trading organization with seven days, 24 hours presence to capture value across the entire optimization period make me very confident that E.ON will operate successfully in the years to come.</p>
          <p>Now a few comments combined with chart number six, on our gas business. Overall, our gas operations developed favorably in 2010. Marcus will take you through the effects in a minute. In spite of growing earnings in our upstream division, 2011 however, might experience a significant impact from the negative gas or Spread power wholesale business. In effect, we have already seen in the fourth quarter of the preceding year.</p>
          <p>With respect to the electricity long-term contracts, the new round of renegotiations that have been triggered off as October are well progressing. But we have not yet reached a conclusion with the key counter parties. If necessary, we will trigger arbitration as soon as possible in line with our contractual rights. However, nothing forbids the parties to then continue their discussions at parallel with arbitration, quite the contrary. We remain confident that commercial discussions with the producers will eventually yield positive results.</p>
          <p>I would like to emphasize once again that the negative margins that we are currently making in supply and sales are predominantly the result of a pure timing effect. The price we process allows both parties to adjust the price of the LTCs to changes in market circumstances. The basic principle is that the buyer must be able to market the natural gas economically. Accordingly, the price review mechanism ensures that the price risk rests with the producer making it profitable for the buyer to take the volume risk. Once the price review process is completed, the newly agreed price formula will be applied with respect to all the gas taken since the start of renegotiations. Due to the retroactive effect the price adjustments, the main risk of the importer is the temporary negative margin for the period in between price of use.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless it remains very difficult to reliably estimate the timing and final outcome of the renegotiations. The ongoing discussions are very serious for those sites. Still I continue to expect that those contractual relationships, which have formed the backbone of many years of successful partnerships with mutual interest involved, will support an acceptable solution for all.</p>
          <p>In terms of guidance, we expect global gas to achieve an adjusted EBITDA of between &#x20AC;700 million, &#x20AC;1.2 billion in 2011, down from &#x20AC;2 billion last year.</p>
          <p>Our E&amp;P business will continue to show good earnings momentum, as we will benefit from the start of production of <mark type="inaudible" /> in the second half of the year. However this will be partially offset by regulatory pressure on the earnings of Open Grid Europe, formerly E.ON Gas Transport.</p>
          <p>All in all, the main reason for the decline of earnings <mark type="inaudible" /> is the move of supply and sales from a small profit in 2010 to a substantial loss this year. Depending on the further progress of the current renegotiations, a loss of around &#x20AC;1 billion may be realized in 2011 and is including in our forecast and outlook.</p>
          <p>For 2013, the guidance provided at the Capital Market Day remains unchanged. Strong progress in E&amp;P, some regulatory pressure continuing on Open Grid Europe and a return of supply and sales to a normalized level of earnings. This return to a normal level of earnings would be the result of such renegotiations and does not assume a recapping of gas or oil prices nor does it include any compensation for past losses.</p>
          <p>The second pillar of strategy looked on chart seven, is our expansion outside Europe. In this respect, I would like to discuss developments in Russia and our preparation for entry into two additional markets. Russia had delivered a strong result in 2010 and I expect this development to continue.</p>
          <p>Since the 1 January 2011, the Russian market has been fully liberalized. This is excludes the retail markets, which will remain regulated and which represents about 20% of the national demand.</p>
          <p>Last year, the Russian government also finalized the framework for capacity payments. For all advance, the capacity fees cover the fixed cost, significant improvement in the prior situation for efficient capacities. But for the balance built since 2007, the capacity fees do not only cover the fixed cost, but also the capital costs including an adequate and fair return on investment. The capacity framework together with the free energy market is really a system, which is supportive for investments. There were some more recent statements from the government that caused concerns in the market, but in our view, they neither changed the big picture nor our financial projections. More important is that we remained at the forefront in terms of new build. We have already spent more than 50% of the EMR &#x20AC;2.3 billion for investments and we acquired a majority in OGK-4 in 2007.</p>
          <p>In November last year, we commissioned the 400 MW Shaturskaya CCGT, and this year we'll start up the 800 MW CCGT and so both as well as a 400 MW at <mark type="inaudible" />. As a result, we expect a further strong increase of adjusted EBITDA this year, from a little shy of &#x20AC;400 million in 2010 to between &#x20AC;500 million and &#x20AC;700 million next year &#x2013; this year. We also remain confident of achieving between &#x20AC;800 million and &#x20AC;1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2013. So, all in all another example of value crystallization within our group.</p>
          <p>Since our Capital Market Day, we have not stood still on our strategic goal to enter two new markets outside Europe, in addition to the existing operations in Russia and our new build in North America. As a reminder, our strategy for entry into such two new markets rests on the following guidelines.</p>
          <p>First, we will focus on conventional renewed power generation. Second, we do not simply want to bring capital on the table; instead we want to combine our expertise with the know how of local partners. Third, we only prefer to take commodity exposure if there is a way to manage it. This is seldom the case in emerging markets and therefore we will need to limit commodity exposure in our new ventures outside Europe. And last but not least, any new activities based upon a very disciplined investment approach with adequate hurdles to ensure on appropriate return on capital.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile a highly capable team sourced from various E.ON units is intensively working within this business and reports to Marcus. It has already carried out a pre-selection among a very large number of potential markets and shortlisted a handful of markets for further analysis.</p>
          <p>In addition, the team is looking at how local needs can be met by E.ON's capabilities. To conclude, entering into two new markets outside Europe will represent a commitment for many years. And this commitment will all time require investments of several billions. These aren't the kind of decisions to take lightly; we are thus giving ourselves all the time necessary to carry out a profound analysis before committing any capital and communicating it.</p>
          <p>Turning to the performance on chart eight, constant attention to improving operational performance is the third pillar of our new strategy. We are determined to establish a new performance culture; however, we first want to deliver on our previous commitments. This year we'll see the completion of PerformtoWin, a plant launched in 2008 to improve adjusted EBITDA by &#x20AC;1.5 billion until the end of this year.</p>
          <p>The initiatives taken in 2009 and 2010 have already improved adjusted EBITDA by &#x20AC;1.1 billion on a recurrent basis. We are therefore fully on track to deliver &#x20AC;1.5 billion of performance improvements in 2011. And the majority of the improvements will come from projects to optimize sales processes and margins such as <mark type="inaudible" /> in the UK, efforts to reduce service and overhead costs, and better commercialization of storage and transmission capacities in the gas business. As part of our new strategy, we want to move away from single programs such as PerformtoWin. Instead we want to foster a performance culture across the whole group that will continuously generate performance improvements.</p>
          <p>As I said in my introductory remark, we recognize performance improvements and efficiency enhancement as well as the keys to lead us to drive the bottom line. Independent of where the power price or the gas margin stands. And the first step, we have put in place a new organization, a leaner organization geared towards more efficiency, transparency, and control. Along with the new organization, we are changing the way our businesses are steered. The Sierra will be based on centrally monitored KPIs to reflect the main drivers of long-term value creation. The KPIs that would be used to steer each business have been defined and targets that has to be made against those are signed accordingly. Among others, this will significantly enhance the internal discussions moving away from debating the finances of individual legal entities towards focusing on operations.</p>
          <p>We have communicated that we target another &#x20AC;600 million sustainable efficiency improvements on top of PerformtoWin by the end of 2013. Within this &#x2013; about one third will come from procurement optimization.</p>
          <p>Let me now conclude my opening remarks for today. Since we presented our new strategy about four months ago, we have already made some tangible progress. First, we executed major disposals at very attractive conditions, this addresses a debt leverage and we can now fully focus on profitable gross.</p>
          <p>Second, we do not want to rely on the support from rising markets and are determined to control our own future. This is why we need to make a performance culture an intricate part of E.ON's DNA. The developments in 2010 and the outlook for the coming years make me very hopeful that we are on the right track. And third and finally, 2011 will obviously be a challenging financial year. While that it does not come as a surprise to us or you, and accordingly our conviction and optimism for the future year has not changed. This is why we reiterate the dividend of 150 per year for 2010 and have set and are committed to a minimum dividend of 130 for 2011 and 2012.</p>
          <p>Marcus, now over to you and the last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The investors, the analysts, Johannes already summarized the key numbers in his part. So let me go straight to the reconciliation of adjusted EBIT at group level on chart 11. The retail business in the UK is up by &#x20AC;0.3 billion, this is largely driven by higher volumes and improved margins as we explained throughout the last year. As expected, the very strong performance of the first half and especially Q1 lost a little bit pace during the third quarter and weakened in Q4. What remains though is still in a very nice positive sales cycle compared to 2009.</p>
          <p>In our German DSO business, we've see &#x20AC;0.5 billion improvement over last year, of which &#x20AC;0.2 billion have a one-off character. We &#x2013; here we recovered costs that we incurred in 2009. Based on our hedging strategy, we realized higher wholesale prices for 2010. As you know, this was probably peak year when you look two years back and two years forward. Hence, we see a better asset optimization result in energy trading related to our power portfolio.</p>
          <p>As mentioned by Johannes earlier, we continue to implement PerformtoWin, the program added &#x20AC;500 million as an improvement in 2010 with highlighting clearly are the &#x2013; is the earnings momentum in Russia, will be more than tripled our EBIT. As negatives I'd like to highlight in particular, the impact from disposals. We lost &#x20AC;800 million due to disposals made last year. We have to sell our German &#x2013; we had to sell some German power capacity, our high voltage grid, as a consequence of our EU commitments and furthermore, we disposed off Th&#xFC;ga.</p>
          <p>Please also note once again that E.ON U.S. Midwest, which we used to own until mid of last year recorded as discontinued operations in both the 2009 and 2010 numbers. One remark to the underlying economic performance, if you adjust 2009 for the EBIT contribution from those assets that we sold, the 2010 EBIT was actually up 11.4%. In 2009, we had a known &#x2013; we have the known one-off effect of &#x20AC;200 million in Italy from the renegotiation of unfavorable power contracts.</p>
          <p>And also in the last quarter of 2010, we have an addition of &#x20AC;0.1 billion nuclear decommissioning provision in Sweden and then finally in our gas transport business compared to 2009, we lost &#x20AC;200 million.</p>
          <p>So much for the overall overview, now let me go straight into the segments over to page 13 starting with Central Europe. Overall, the 2010 financials were impacted in this market unit by lost deconsolidation effects. Transfer prices not reflective of the highest toll fair prices and one-off in the regulated business. As a result, EBIT was down 2%, here are the key reasons why Central Europe West dropped by &#x20AC;572 million. The deconsolidation of power plants in Germany had already heavily effected the first nine months. For the full-year, the effect now amounts to &#x20AC;390 million. The drop by &#x20AC;147 million in the nuclear fleet is caused by a mix of higher maintenance costs, higher expenses for revisions slightly increased depreciation and a reduced equity result. In France, the 2009 figures included the positive one-off effect from a provision release, which was not repeated in 2010. That was one of &#x20AC;90 million. Newly commissioned power plants with an attributable capacity of 1.2 gigawatts added around on &#x20AC;100 million.</p>
          <p>Let me make one remark to generation business of Central Europe. The high average achieved price &#x20AC;68 per megawatt hour in the outright portfolio in 2010 does sit in the trading division. Central Europe has transferred its 2010 generation volume to energy trading in 2007 at the then prevailing 2010 forwards. EBIT then hedged a lot of the 2010 outright volume during the course of 2008, at obviously much higher prices. This already gives you an indication of why we will see the opposite effect in 2011. I'll come back to this when presenting the outlook for 2011.</p>
          <p>Central Europe West regulated is up strongly by 21%. Higher distribution network revenues in both power and gas are the main driver. Also we see in 2010 delayed passing on of higher transmission grid costs, around &#x20AC;200 million. This is clearly a one-time effect. On the negative side, we recorded the deconciliation of transpower and then over to Central Europe East, that improves mainly because in a number of markets in particularly, Hungary and Romania, we see the recovery from the crisis. In addition, we do have some minor positive translation effects.</p>
          <p>Let's move over to Pan-European Gas. As expected, earnings from the fourth quarter could not continue the strong momentum of the first nine months, which were up 19%. Given the known situation in our gas wholesale business, the fourth quarter showed negative earnings. Nevertheless, for the full year like-for-like earnings were basically flat year-on-year. Keep in mind that you got the consolidation.</p>
          <p>The non-regulated business is up &#x20AC;216 million, primarily due to our E&amp;P position. In upstream, we recorded &#x20AC;102 million positive price effects. Volume effects, which are a minus &#x20AC;48 million at the nine-month stage just neutral for the full year. The Russian gas field Yushno Russkoje contributed &#x20AC;78 million compared to last year. And in total we see a &#x20AC;400 million EBITS in our E&amp;P business.</p>
          <p>Supply and sales in absolute terms is still positive for the full year. Here the combined price and volume effect is plus &#x20AC;85 million. This includes the relief of an &#x20AC;80 million provision, which was booked in Q4 2009 and could be released in the first half of 2010. The key negative driver in supply and sales is the price effect i.e. the gas oil spreads. As a consequence, we left &#x20AC;420 million in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p> Starts are stable with the contribution, as we've communicated to you slightly north of &#x20AC;0.4 billion. The regulated business is down by slightly more than &#x20AC;200 million, mainly driven by the German gas transportation grid.</p>
          <p>In the UK, we booked an increase in adjusted EBITS to &#x20AC;0.9 billion. As expected, we saw a further slowdown of the positive earnings momentum during the first two quarters of 2010 due to a very strong Q4 of 2009. EBIT is still up 37% year-on-year, but remember the corresponding growth rate was 180% up at the half-year results.</p>
          <p>Regulated, next to currency translation, the regulatory price increase drove earnings at Central Networks. And then non-regulated in our part is up 71%. However, in the second-half of 2010, the non-regulated business added only &#x20AC;50 million on top of the roughly &#x20AC;500 million at half year.</p>
          <p>Let me now move over to Nordic. In terms of operating performance, Nordic had a good 2011. The slightly reduced EBIT growth has to be seen in light of the fact that it includes a one-off increase of the nuclear decommissioning provisions of &#x20AC;120 million, which was booked in Q4 compared to 2009. EBIT is also benefiting from currency translation effects. Non-regulated earnings are down roughly &#x20AC;50 million.</p>
          <p>We generated 5.3 terawatt hours more than in 2010 than in 2009. Main driver behind this improvement was nuclear power generation with an increase of 3.6 terawatt hours. Also our CHP and <mark type="inaudible" /> contributed to the increase with 1.5 terawatt hours. The higher nuclear volumes generated &#x20AC;100 million of additional earnings. This is partially offset by volume induced higher taxes for our nuclear generation. The hydro generation benefited from higher transfer prices. These positives were compensated by the increase in nuclear provisions. The regulated business was up &#x20AC;73 million, mainly based on higher network charges and high volumes resulting from the colder weather. Don't forget, Nordic heating is primarily a power market.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBITs of energy trading on page 17 is up 26% to &#x20AC;1.2 billion. As I explained in the context of Central Europe, the main driver for the absolute high profit number is the timing of the transfer of generation volume from our power generation businesses to energy trading.</p>
          <p>Optimization is up almost &#x20AC;500 million, as you know certain gas procurement contracts originally transferred to E.ON from the UK are being optimized by energy trading. We added &#x20AC;76 million compared to 2009 on these assets. For those of you who are very detailed analysis, Q4 of 2009, had an especially strong result from that optimization. This was why the nine-month result for 2010 showed a higher improvement over 2009, then is the case for the full-year numbers. As expected, the core portfolio more than recovered from a slight dip in the third quarter to deliver an improvement of &#x20AC;178 million.</p>
          <p>And then finally the power portfolio benefited from higher prices. Prop trading lost slightly north of &#x20AC;100 million in 2010. The trend of the first nine months continued in Q4. However, for the first two months of 2010, I can report to you that that looks a lot more promising.</p>
          <p>Over to new markets. New markets increased by 5% to &#x20AC;0.9 million on a like-for-like basis, i.e. adjusted for the 2009 contract renegotiation in Italy and for the &#x20AC;50 million of profits, which is cast out to A2A also in Italy. New markets were actually up over 50%.</p>
          <p>Climate and renewables benefited from higher installed capacity, 640 megawatts of higher capacity after year-end and 50% increase in output to now 8 terawatt hours for the full year. Those assets in the U.S. that we run on a merchant basis are still suffering from the low power price environments. Hence, they are still basically break even.</p>
          <p>Russia has delivered a superb 2010. Hot weather and the pickup in industrial activity have improved spreads and volumes. Also middle of the year the liberalization rate increased from 60% to 80% and since the beginning of this year, we are at 100%. As Johannes has already commented upon, we expect a strong momentum in this business to continue also in 2011. The key driver though will now be the new plants that come on stream. In Italy, we have 2 of 4 mentioned effects that inflate the 2009 results.</p>
          <p>Adjusted for those two effects together make up for &#x20AC;260 million, the Italian business is actually up by 8%. Spain continues to hold up against a fairly tough market environment.</p>
          <p>Let me now move further down in the P&amp;L, our net interest cost for 2010 would actually have been flat had we not incurred a one-time minus &#x20AC;126 million charge caused by the future prepayment into the renewable energy fund created by the German government. Our payment into this fund can be used as an offsetting amount post 2016. However, the time value of money disadvantage needs to be recorded today as an interest charge. Net bookings were again substantial in 2010 and added up to &#x20AC;2.9 billion. The main item this year was clearly the sale of the gap pressures. However, to remind you, we also had a gas permit tax in 2009 resulting from our swap into our stake in <mark type="inaudible" />. In total the 2009 bookings were even higher mainly due to the disposal of generation capacity.</p>
          <p>Other non-operating earnings were up &#x20AC;0.4 billion, here the biggest positive this year was to mark the markets of derivatives, which was &#x20AC;1.6 billion higher than last year. Clearly the big negative effect in 2010 was the asset and goodwill impairments for our assets in Italy, Spain and France that we reported about in Q3 of 2010.</p>
          <p>Over to chart 20. The effective tax rate is down from 25% in 2009 to 22% for the full year 2010. This is related to the various effects in the non-operating results, mainly the tax-free disposal of gas comp. The tax charge on the operating result which leads to our adjusted net income has rather increased to roughly 26% which is closer to the our average guidance of 27% we have been getting. This is mainly due to less earnings from participations, which are already taxed, such as Th&#xFC;ga.</p>
          <p>The result from discontinued operations include beyond U.S. Midwest, the 2009 result was burdened by the settlement cost for WKE, this reasonably unfavorable coal contract we had was in 2010 we rerecorded a roughly &#x20AC;900 million in common charge for that business in the context of the disposal. Minority interests are substantially up this year, better results in the German DSOs in our Russian power biz and some one-off effects in our Eastern European markets are the reasons for this.</p>
          <p>Over to chart 21. You all are familiar with the reconciliation of adjusted net income. The reason why it is down slightly more than what we had expected i.e. we've always been telling you it's between minus 3% and plus 3% and now we're down minus 4%, is the &#x20AC;126 million interest charge that I spoke about earlier. We had not anticipated to sign a contract with the German government on future payments into a federal renewable energy fund in the format that was then created in the later stage of the year. Other than that, we are perfectly in line with our plan.</p>
          <p>Let us now move on to the cash flow and indebtedness. Operating cash flow is nicely up by 24%, now clearly exceeding the &#x20AC;10 billion mark. Why is that? EBITDA is up by &#x20AC;400 million in addition, certain items of the 2009 EBITDA had no cash impact, such as the release in provision against the unfavorable power contract in Italy. The net effects of these non-cash items and EBITDA as such that we see another &#x20AC;0.2 billion increase in '10 versus 2009.</p>
          <p>In PEG's Gas storage, we have a net investment largely price driven of &#x20AC;800 million, which was partly compensated by other positive working capital effects totaling &#x20AC;0.4 billion. In 2009, we had the MEGAL fine burdening our cash flow that was obviously not repeated in '10. The last loss position is tax related. In 2009, we had a &#x20AC;300 million tax repayment for tax audits of earlier years, whereas in 2010, we actually received &#x20AC;700 million reimbursements.</p>
          <p>Chart 23 reconciles the development of economic net debt. CapEx for 2010, came out of &#x20AC;8.3 billion, which was around &#x20AC;1.7 billion below our original targets for March last year. And dividends are clear, divestments include the sale of the German TSO Gazprom shares that we sold directly to Mexican loan bank not yet all the entire position, because there will be cash due to forward sales in the market that we have made.</p>
          <p>The U.S. Midwest is obviously included in the number of smaller transactions. I have already explained the operating cash flow, pension obligations increased due to lower interest rates that were applied. Germany will now use 5% and the UK 5.4%. The item other includes &#x20AC;0.4 billion for the purchase of shares and SNES, which under IFS must not be shown as investments since we already fully consolidated SNES. In addition, there are &#x20AC;1 billion of negative translation effects in the valuation of debts in non-euro currencies.</p>
          <p>That completes the review of the 2010 financials. So let me now comment on the outlook for 2011 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Chart 24 presents the expected ranges for 2011 for our two main reporting metrics, adjusted EBITDA, &#x20AC;11.2 billion to &#x20AC;11.9 billion, adjusted net income &#x20AC;3.3 to &#x20AC;4 billion. These numbers are based on a constant portfolio, any disposals such as Central Networks may impact those numbers.</p>
          <p>How to interpret the range? This is not worst case &#x2013; best case, but simply speaking, the remaining uncertainty you always have when you put together a plan. I mean, when you look at the breadth of the range its actually fairly in line with the ranges that we have reported in the past.</p>
          <p>Before I highlight the main operating effects leading to reduction in EBITDA compared to 2010, let me give you the key components that should allow you to reconcile the adjusted net income guidance. Depreciation will be around &#x20AC;4 billion. To calculate our net interest results, please take into account our interest charge on the nuclear decommissioning and pension provisions, that is typically around &#x20AC;900 million. A reasonable interest income on our liquid funds, for example 1.5% on say, &#x20AC;10 million and an average interest rate of around 5%, it's actually slightly lower than that on the gross financial debt, which stands yet around the &#x20AC;30 billion mark.</p>
          <p>Also we have around &#x20AC;3.5 million of financial receivables, which turn up &#x20AC;150 million. Minorities, we expect to be lower than in 2010, in particular in the German DSOs, as I will highlight to you the profitability there will come down but also because in some of the Eastern European markets, we will no longer have the one-off effects that we booked in 2010. So we expect minorities to be around &#x20AC;200 million.</p>
          <p>We expect the tax rate to increase to around 30%, given lower participation income, which is already taxed and the rising EBIT contribution from our E&amp;P business with carries a higher tax charge on EBIT, given the tax advantages granted for CapEx. By the way this is not a surprise to us and the number that I would use at least for the coming few years. This should enable you to do your own modeling.</p>
          <p>One additional comment on the development throughout the year, the first quarter will see a more substantial earnings decline, as we are working against a very strong first quarter 2010. Remember that in particular in Pan-European Gas supply and sales business and in UK retail, we had exceptionally good results in Q1 of 2010.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, most of the negative drivers for 2011, such as losses in gas midstream, lower hedge prices and others will be affected throughout the entire year. Hence Q1 will see a sharper decline than we expect for the full year. In Q2, a substantial portion of the nuclear fuels that we will most likely incur.</p>
          <p>Chart 25 spells out the main changes between '10 and '11 as it relates to EBITDA. There are a number of positive effects; PerformtoWin adds the remaining &#x20AC;400 million so that we reach our total target of 1.5. Russia will continue to benefit from liberalization, in particular, additional capacity in our E&amp;P business, prices and in particular volumes will add another &#x20AC;200 million compared to 2010, a highlight that clearly will be where its start of production at <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>And then we plan to contribute to work on the performance and margins of our German retail business. We see now we contribute more due to additional capacity. Unfortunately, the negative effects will clearly outweigh the positives. The two main issues are depending on the further progress of the current negotiations with our gas suppliers, a loss for the sales and supplies segment of around &#x20AC;1 billion, which may be realized in 2011.</p>
          <p>The second biggest item is the nuclear tax, which will hit us with &#x20AC;900 million. The outright power contribution, we expect to decline by around &#x20AC;400 million. The results in our German DSOs will drop by around &#x20AC;400 million, first we lose the one time recovery of the pass through of cost from nine and 10 that will not be repeated and secondly we expect slightly lower revenues.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at the new segments. Chart 26 pretty much speaks for itself. You will recognize the points mentioned on the previous slides. Key points to highlight on this slide is probably just the swing at the energy trading and the optimization business. And the reason for the sharp decline is purely internal. The transfer margin i.e. the delta between the shipped price and transfer price were hugely profitable in 2010 and will be negative for the biggest driver mainly the German outside power position in 2011. This has nothing to do with poor hedging or even speculative trading, but it's only a result of internal transfer pricing.</p>
          <p>You'll also see an exaggerated good results in the generation business. Once again, the 2011 volume has been transferred to ease at the forward prices for '11, we observed in 2008. At these prices &#x2013; had these prices were exceptionally high, each would technically incur a loss.</p>
          <p>Global gas, I believe Johannes has talked sufficiently about this matter in his part of the presentation and I'm sure you will have some remaining questions on that one.</p>
          <p>On slide 27, we provide you with the main changes from 11 to 13 positive, our additional savings of &#x20AC;600 million that Johannes mentioned again. The increased generation capacity will give us another &#x20AC;700 million in EBITDA compared to '11, and our Russian business where the new capacity issued at around &#x20AC;300 million. And is a substantial EBITDA, which will come from E&amp;P <mark type="inaudible" /> with being done at peak production.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, also we're highlighting we expect to bring gas supply and sales business to normal margins. While the pricing environment does not yet allow the new investments to fully contribute as planned, you can see that the CapEx we deployed will support our earnings space. This combined with the performance measures; allow us to deal with the material challenges and position us from the commodity markets and unforeseeable political interference with our business.</p>
          <p>On a negative side, with regard to prices and spreads, we will take the hit largely already in '11. However, the assumptions used for the following years suggested further decline in our outright and spread position. The main additional point however is the full costing of CO2 certificates, not new to you that should cost us around &#x20AC;900 million at today's forward prices. All-in-all, we see the profitability level, i.e. EBITDA roughly at the 2010 level. This is the core portfolio measure.</p>
          <p>Chart 28 gives you just an update on how our key planning assumptions compared to prices we observed in the market. As you can see, we are broadly speaking, in line. This is not meant to provide you new guidance; it's just meant to help you reconcile our numbers and track that with sort of their reality check in between.</p>
          <p>Over to my last chart, 29, where we present an update on our investment plan for the three years 11 through 13, we plan to invest &#x20AC;18.6 billion by now. These numbers assume today's portfolio again i.e. Central Networks included. And you can see, we continue to rigorously screen our CapEx with the objective to only allow those investments that appear to be value accretive even in today's environment &#x2013; pricing environment.</p>
          <p>However, the right-hand chart also stresses the point that we do have a number of investments we are obliged to make from a regulatory point of view. This is reflected in the increasing share of our regional units. Their share goes up mainly because of investment into generation that comes down, which is not the case for the investments in the regional units. Having said that, the sale of Central Networks will have a substantial impact on those mandatory investments, we do expect around &#x20AC;1.7 billion as a reduction from the &#x20AC;18.6 million total number.</p>
          <p>That concludes my remarks on the financials and we are obviously now happy to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So, we're coming to the Q&amp;A and in order to ensure a smooth and efficient process, I would like to ask you to limit your questions, pronouncing clearly <mark type="inaudible" />. Operator, we are ready for the questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from <mark type="inaudible" /> from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon everyone. I've got a lot of questions but I will fully focus on two elements. The first one is on slide five. The European generation environment. Very interesting slide, but you fall short of mentioning any commitment on your side to reduce capacity. So obviously the question is are you going to make the first move <mark type="inaudible" /> bold last week and actually gave us a number that they may take away from the market. So they made the first move, are you going to make the second move? Obvious question.</p>
          <p>The second question is on slide 13. Can you help us understand the number, the &#x20AC;302 million, which you highlight higher network revenues due to regulation in power? It's a big number, &#x20AC;302 million; maybe you can help us understand that number because I'm always under the impression that regulation is getting a bit tougher in Germany in the media. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll start, Johannes <mark type="inaudible" /> with your first question on possible retirements, on mothballing of plants. I am not a stranger to the situation; I have seen the situation in 2000. At that time, E.ON decided on a let's say, a big bang decision and announced the retirement of 5000 MW predominantly coal-fired plants, smaller coal-fired plans and even some of the nuclear. Looking backwards, we clearly analyze that and I don't think we came out as a winner of that situation because all of our competitors could then maneuver around us and position their plants differently and capture value that we perceive is the exposure of being very obvious loss and gave to the competition. So we will this time not be clear, let's say, a big bang decision, we will go through an annual process looking always on the plants that are at stake in the next five years and then take a strategic operational decision on such.</p>
          <p>So yes, you should be prepared that probably the first time within this year this process will be done and some results will come out. But we will try to keep our cover and position it the best way to create the most value. I don't think it will be helpful for our investors, if we behave differently. It might be good for the market but not good for our investors if we behave differently and therefore this will be officially on a case-by-case basis based on an annual study and not a big major study and a big bang decision.</p>
          <p>And the second question..?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your second question, you are &#x2013; just referring to Central Europe West regulated, the first bullet point, the &#x20AC;302 million, that includes the roughly &#x20AC;180 million of recovery of cost that was incurred in 2009 and could then be passed through in the tariff during the course of 2010 and then roughly &#x20AC;120 million improvement in the lost tariff. It's not the case that regulation always only goes one direction, unfortunately however we do observe it very often too in Germany to go the wrong direction but in 2009 that was not the case.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the first question. Our next question is coming from <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I have a first question regarding the <mark type="inaudible" /> spend and the legal dispute in Germany, which has started. Have you have any views on that &#x2013; what is going on in terms of timing, can we expect news through here, from the High Court this year ? What are the nuclear players doing here, are they in a wait and see mode?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the answer is pretty clear. We're not even conscious of the constitutional challenges. The government is the subject of the claims that have been filed by some states. Actually all the states that filed the complaint, don't have any nuclear power stations and don't have any administration at stake. Still they have a standing in court. We keep being extremely optimistic. I think case law of the constitutional court, younger case law is in our eyes rather clear and we don't think that a negative decision is likely.</p>
          <p>Obviously, we have done lots of legal studies and provide those to all parties involved to defend a court and other than that we have actually to wait and see a little bit. It's far from certain when the court will hear the case, the constitutional court is totally free and it will later decide which case it likes to hear. I have seen some things that we were directly involved in where they've waited 15 years to even hear the case. The subsidies on German coal took 15 years until the court first heard the case. At that time it was meaningless because it was pretty much decided what the outcome would be. So who knows what's the constitutional court will do. We don't really know, what we do is we cover our end of the deal.</p>
          <p>As you are aware, the nuclear tax, we never signed on to. We never accepted and we will protect our right against that tax and we will file claims against tax payments and then everything will be at stake and let's then wait and see what a new government will do, everything is uncertain including a lot of financials. That's the best <mark type="inaudible" /> investors; not more we can do and otherwise we are careful how we place our investments in lifetime extension. So we don't increase exposure and be careful in the way we place it, I think the best we can do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Patrick Hummel from UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, Patrick Hummel from UBS. Two questions please, the first one is regarding the gas wholesale business. I'm just wondering if you can give a bit more color why you're actually quite confident to have a better profitability situation already in 2012, we've heard some comments from <mark type="inaudible" /> last week that '12 could be worst than '11? So I'm wondering, where your optimism comes from, is it maybe including a potential one-off kind of gain that you would have on a re-track adjustment that would be included in your view that 2012 can be better than 2011?</p>
          <p>And the second question is regarding emerging markets, you said that you've now short listed five countries, I'm still wondering whether you are in line with your time schedule, because taking into account the final decision-making processes plus the lead time for a new plant investment et cetera, make it seem quite aggressive or optimistic to have already an earnings contribution that is meaningful in 2015 here, and I'm not talking about those investments that have already been decided of course? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay <mark type="inaudible" /> the first question on the long-term contracts this is obviously our assessment of the continuation of the renegotiations. And what I could indicate is that not all discussions continue on the same speed, some are faster, some are somewhat slower and more complex, some parties have a more obvious view on the situation and some are more open to settle on a meaningful way, and some direct it a bit little further along, because they try to place their position in different format. I believe, what we indicate is that we feel comfortable that some substantial decisions will be taken in 2012 and we've already delivered something, while the reserve, the opinion that some may still not finally settle and be in arbitration at that time. But we believe that in all likelihood and we're quite confident on the 2011 will be the trough, and it would be mostly surprising if that will be different and that is obviously based on our insight on the talks.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you just said, sorry to follow-up, but some important decisions will be taken in 2012, i.e. next year. So I'm just worried, because your 2011 guidance for the gas wholesale business is not necessarily the worst-case. If you expect agreements to happen in '12, how could '11 earnings benefit from that or did I miss anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's &#x2013; obviously not, if something happens in '11 and something would already impact '11. And we believe that things will happen, some things will happen in '11. What we indicated, obviously, we have more than a handful of significant partners that we have to deal with and we believe that something with someone will start to happen now and some thing might happen somewhat later. And that's all we can and we want to say now, because obviously we don't want to jeopardize the continuation of some talks and risk them while we speak, but you can take an indication that there is &#x2013; there is &#x2013; things are moving, it's not all dragging along, it's not all slow, there is more going on than is visible on the outside.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">

          <p>With regard to your question on outside Europe, and future investments there. I think we've said it on several occasions. Yes, we do have sort of this aspiration to have a 25% EBITDA contribution in 2015 from those markets. We've also always said that that includes Russia and the U.S. where we have businesses. Nonetheless there is a &#x2013; not all of the 25 can be filled from those two markets. Hence, there are other that &#x2013; we are striving to make investments in two further regions. We are today not in a position to report more about where exactly that will be. We will do that when we have something tangible to say. We will, quite frankly, also not go out and say, we've now identified country X and country Y, we don't yet have any specific project there but this is where we want to go, because this is like in an M&amp;A situation, not a terribly smart move.</p>
          <p>You can assume that we are talking to people in a number of regions as we speak. And we don't want to sort of weaken our position here. No final decisions have been made. We obviously are mindful of the fact that it will be very difficult to reach this 2015 target given the approach we want to take, which is one of predominantly organic investments. Now having said that, if we end up at 22% we're also not going to kill ourselves.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from <mark type="inaudible" /> from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Good afternoon. Two questions please. The first one is in on slide five on the power generation market. You say that you see more upside than downside as to prices and spread. I mean, can you give us an idea of your horizon, when you say this is? How you are looking on a one year, three year, five year view? That's the first question. And I mean, does it impact your hedging strategy? You've sold about 40% to 50% or 30% to 40% of your spread output for 2013. Are you holding back? Or are you just proceeding in line with previous years? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And the second more technical on the tax rate; you are guiding to 30% in 2011? Is there any reason why we shouldn't be using this number for 2013 or are you still happy for us to use 27% you were suggesting in November? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, there, the hedging is proceeding at normal speed. There is no deviation from our traditional trajectory on that. The horizontal low docility retirement expense for the market is in the time spent between two and five years. But I think we will see significant movement probably in the first half of that period. So that is the time horizon we are analyzing. And we have pretty clear view on all coal-fired plants across Europe on all &#x2013; we have roughly an insight in the efficiencies of our competitors. And therefore, I think we can assess the situation beyond our own plants. That is one of the reasons why we are careful in blurting everything out, because we'll just weaken our own competitive situation if we pre-maturely talking on the things. But we are moving, this is not just theoretical, this is not just a market analysis. This has a deep impact on to our own assessment and these discussions are ongoing and decisions will be &#x2013; the first round of decisions will be taken as quickly as possible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your second question regarding the tax rates. We've always been using the 27% in the past that was kind of always the indication that we gave. We also said that as far as I recall in November of last year for both 2010 and the outer years. Given the increase, in particular in earnings contribution from E&amp;P, we think at least for the next couple of years, it is more prudent to rather use the 30% than 27%.</p>
          <p>Having said that, my experience from the last four years quite frankly you can always miss out by one or two percentage points on the tax rate, which is why I'm actually almost a little bit reluctant to say it's exactly this number. But if you sort of push me, I personally rather would build my model on the basis of 30% than 27%. Having said that, as I mentioned in my comments, this is nothing new to us and hence for those of you that might now speculate, that means they're altering their 2013 guidance as it relates to net income, no, we're not.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Peter Bisztyga from Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh. Yeah. Good afternoon. Two questions from me. First of all on your hedging. Could you explain why you're more hedged on your spread generation for 2013, than on your outright power generation? And can you also explain why you appear to have accelerated that spread hedging even though you're saying that CO2 permit expiry should lead to capacity closures and improved spread? So that's my first question. Then, secondly, could you expand a little bit on Russia. And why you think that current proposals to cap tariff growth won't impact OGK-4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me do the first one, which is a technical point quite frankly and for my answer you can conclude that we are trying to rethink how we actually do the disclosure on this one as we move forward. How is our hedging defined for the spectras in this? It is that part of the economic generation that is hedged. What is the economic generation? That is basically those terawatt hours that we think can be produced given a specific pricing environment. Now the problem obviously with gas and coal plants is that with spreads dropping, actually the economic generation drops because there are fewer hours, where it does make sense to bring these plants into the market.</p>
          <p>So you can have the same absolute terawatt hours spread hedged but still next month, your hedge ratio suddenly looks like it has dramatically gone up and the simple reason for that is, economic generation came down because spreads came down. So it's a bit of a definition problem we have there. We are mindful of that and we believe, I believe that with Q1 of this year, we'll be in a position to provide you with sort of probably more helpful instruments to model our generation business, which will more likely then look at absolute volumes that have been hedged rather than just percentages.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Russia obviously is &#x2013; the deliberation model always provided for a special ratio of generation that keeps to be regulated. It's reflecting the share of the households' consumption in Russia. The level was defined; it opened the government an opportunity to regulate up to somewhat in the 30% break. But they only used it traditionally in the last year to roughly stay between 15% and 20%.</p>
          <p>Now with presidential and parliamentary elections coming closer and inflation being an issue, they started a process of discussions &#x2013; discussions whether some format of more use of this formula could help control inflation in the industry. And I think we immediately reacted somewhat specifically towards the new build construction, because there had been a clear promise that they will be protected from such moves as much as possible. And therefore we and others have sent a letter to the prime minister asking his focus to have a focus on it to protect new investments.</p>
          <p>The whole discussion is in a rather pre-mature state. What really comes out of it is penalty for us at this point. And obviously, we are aware and you are aware that the biggest part of our revenues comes from capacity payments and not the energy market, as such. So we are not extremely nervous, but I think in such an environment, it's rather advisable to start a little earlier and be cautious and that's what we did.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Alex Karnick from Deutsche Bank. Thanks for taking my question. Just one, you mentioned an improvement or a significant move in spreads and power prices in the earlier half of your two to five year forecast period. I would just be curious, what kind of net capacity closures you would need to see in order for that to happen? And the second question is a very simple one. You're providing your new CapEx figure for '11, '12 and '13, including the UK grid, whether you could provide the same figure excluding the UK grid? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think for the first part, I have not announced that I see definitely a change in the spread environment as early. I indicated that I believe that significant decisions on mothballing and closures might be taken in that period across the market. And that is obvious, because LTPDLs are running out, the clock is ticking, and we know about significant stations that have a limitation in the licenses. And obviously the 2013 allocation period comes to an end and rather expediates the process. That's all we can see. But again &#x2013; further we can't go because we're not just talking about ourselves, but others. And we &#x2013; we cannot provide, let's say a formula, a golden formula to announce at what closure rate margins will start to change significantly. I think that is too easy to try to build it that way. We have to wait and see somewhat.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much. Bashon Honare from XM. Two questions please. First one is on gas. I wonder how much extra gas you'll have to buy from Gazprom, when north stream rise in terms of extra take of the obligations. And how far you were from your take off levels in 2010? And second question is on rating agencies. Can you tell us when you expect them to take a decision regarding your negative watch? And what will be the first take-up for your research and outlook? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the first question, there is no additional volume coming from north stream. It's the same gas that we have contracted earlier that's coming through additional pipeline. So there is no additional &#x2013; no additional portfolio change, no change in anything. So no worry there. North stream is proceeding well. Our investment goes well. Financing has been settled for both streams. So there shouldn't any be worries from the North stream side to anybody.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And take off pay. We don't expect to be a problem this year. Then your second question on the rating agencies. The way you asked your question, you seemed to already imply something, which obviously is your view. I would not confirm that view. We have an ongoing, very open, very constructive dialogue with the rating agencies. They are, they've been obviously <mark type="inaudible" /> our disposal program. They know what we are doing there. I will have with my team conversations with them again in a few weeks from now. And they will do their just, sort of the regular annual review, and they will then sort of publish their comments on that. Today, I have no reason to see why they're &#x2013; they should change their minds on E.ON. I think if there's one thing we can really stress and I think Johannes said it in his part, I believe we have very, very quickly a check of the topic of indebtedness.</p>
          <p>And if you pro forma the 2010 numbers for the sale of Central Networks, you can actually see that our debts factor drops to almost 2.5. So yes, we have a number of operational challenges, and it's not that I think we can be totally relaxed on balance sheet. But this is the one item where I feel, that is reasonably under control.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if you compare that, I would say for all competitors in our industry across Europe, I would be &#x2013; you see probably the very healthiest balance sheet in the industry. So obviously we still try to keep and we always keep control, but I think we have it fully in our hands and feel comfortable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow-up, is the three times net EBITDA key is the right yardstick given that you now have your business profile, which is a bit more risky after the disposal of net box?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we feel absolutely comfortable that, that level is right. Also I believe, if you take into consideration the quality of our debt, understanding the long-term nature of roughly half of that and other items, I feel that we are targeting is in safe territory and not the biggest worry.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon. Two questions, one is on supply and sales. And the minus &#x20AC;1 billion for 2011, you're guiding it. I'm trying to understand this number or rather what's behind it in terms of your exposure to &#x2013; and the gas tolls. But if it is &#x20AC;1 billion for the year 2011 and not in addition to the hedge you talked in 2010. Then given that the spread currently is between &#x20AC;8 and &#x20AC;10 a megawatt. This would assume that your total exposure to the gas tolls. But in terms of volumes is about 11 bcm, which would seem to be a bit low. But maybe you can shed some light on that?</p>
          <p>And the second question is again on this slide 5 and the kind of capacity flow that that we could potentially see. You mentioned that's one of the reasons that people are using free CO2 allocation to cross subsidize perhaps otherwise unprofitable thermal plant. Yet, when you talk about the likely hit from CO2 in 2013, I think the &#x20AC;900 million you mentioned on slide 24 assumes the full value of your free CO2 allowances, i.e. that you yourself are not using any cross subsidization. Is that true? Do you believe the market will behave differently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We didn't get the last two sentences. Can you &#x2013; we do not expect what?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What &#x2013; well, basically what you seem to say on slide five is that you expect people to use free CO2 certificates to subsidize power plants that are otherwise unprofitable -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; at current electricity price or current spreads. Yet on slide 24, when you mentioned the likely hit from CO2 you mentioned &#x20AC;900 million, and I think this is equivalent to your total &#x2013; to the total value of your free allocations, I suggested that you yourself are not using these kind of cross subsidies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's a theoretical case you're building. The only thing you're right in, the &#x20AC;900 million would be the number if we need the same level of certificates. If we, therefore, would not run all the stations with the same usage rate in 2013 and does have all &#x2013; and have already retired and that number might be somewhat lower. We just wanted to be very transparent, to be public, to be clear to the market what it would cost if we needed the same number of certificates. There's no indication that we cross subsidize ourselves, no indication that we necessarily need that amount. It just shows what the &#x2013; would be on a like for like basis if you run the same stations &#x2013; on the same utilization rate, not more, not less.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so just an indication. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lue, on your first question regarding our supply and sales business, and what's the exposure and how can you somehow reconcile that? Let me try to provide some metrics for that. Recognizing that this is a material simplification, but I think you will understand that we cannot &#x2013; in the negotiations provide all the details. But in principle, we've always said, oh you can reconcile that. We have around 600 terawatt hours of total volume, we've always said there is a certain portion which is in the high teens, which is sports related &#x2013; so that &#x2013; anyway, takes that number to something, that is I would say is slightly shy of 500 terawatt hours.</p>
          <p>And then we've always told you that the average duration of our customer contract is around 2.5, three years. That implies if you assume sort of a normal distribution that's probably a third of the 500 terawatt hours, is being locked in every year i.e. some part in '10, some part in '09, some part in '08. The two years that's where we saw the not so friendly gas oil spread, in particular '09, and '10. So maybe up to two-thirds roughly of that 500 are exposed. And then the spreads in that time has been altering between $0.03 and $0.08 roughly. And now you can do the math depending on whatever spread you pick, but I think this probably helps you to better square the exposure. So 500 terawatt hours, times two-thirds, times &#x2013; spreads that apply.</p>
          <p>And obviously to get to the 1 billion, yes, we have assumed some recovery during the course of 2010.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the relatively low number compared to the spreads we're seeing at the moment reflects an awfully lower spread as that are coming through in 2011, which was agreed on locked in a few years back.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Firstly, as you indicated that assumed volumes in the hedging for the spread generation have gone down. I mean if I look on the spreads over the past, let's say six months or so; I think that they have been pretty stable. So I'm a bit puzzled why the, I would say, the anchor has so much changed versus the third quarter? And secondly just to understand the 2011 guidance, you have pointed out that the German DSO is partially due to the fact that you have obviously lost &#x2013; or that you don't have a repetition of the 200 million one-time recovery. The additional 200 million cost, which you expect for that. Is that some kind of a one off or is that going to be a permanent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your second question first. Yes, the 200 million versus recovery from 2009, I mean that was a positive one-off item in '10, which is not going to repeat itself in '11 and also not in '12 and '13. I expect no effects. And then there is a further reduction of around 100 million that we see in the tariffs. And then there are a number of smaller items that get you close to 400 million in total.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But one should not forget 2011 is so called total year. So the new regulatory period is based upon CapEx and OpEx in 2011. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's what I meant, is it...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But probably not most advisable to be on the lowest cost growth and the biggest cost saving or deferral of decisions in 2011 in that business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And then I think your first question refers to the hedging activity, what we see here, when you compare the nine-month results with the numbers we reported for the nine months and what we now show for the full-year results is, I don't &#x2013; I mean, we see that in Italy, we are essentially slightly below &#x2013; sorry, we are slightly above the nine-month numbers for Central Europe. It's reasonably unchanged. And for the UK, we have also a higher hedging level for 2011, compared to what we were showing in October. So I don't exactly understand sort of the problem there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry, I should probably try to be more clear. I was actually looking Central Europe 2012 and '13. And when, I mean, from what you explained early on, you're basically, if I understand is right, you are saying that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>... the absolute volume has basically come down. So &#x2013; sorry, the absolute hedging volume...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand your question. I understand your question now. I did not imply to say that the absolute volume has come down. What I said was or what I was trying to say is that this metrics the percentage of economic generation hedged can be a little bit misleading in particular in times where you see substantial shifts in spreads, because sort of the denominator changes, the economic generation changes and maybe not necessarily the terawatt hour hedged. That's why this number can be a little bit misleading. That was not meant to comment on the specific comparison of the October levels we were showing and the December levels that we are now showing. It's more a general problem we have with this metric of how much of the spreads volume is hedged in percent of economic generation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So no change in the assumption what is the total spread volume in the estimates?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, good afternoon to everybody. Just a couple of questions. The first it relates to your disposal program, policy, excellent progress over the past four months as you've already highlighted. When we look at the remaining &#x20AC;6 billion that you intend to do, should we now really just be thinking about relatively small-scale disposals that could be categorized as non-steel and non-core rather than having to take a strategic decision to serrate particular business that might be more meaningful? And then secondly, you've obviously made it perfectly clear that despite the sale of the regulated utilities in the UK, the UK remains a core area for the group. In that respect, I'd be very interested in just getting a snapshot of your views on the electricity market reform that is currently undergoing the consultation period here in the UK? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all I think we've all &#x2013; we have no clear commands on the composition of the remaining &#x20AC;6 billion. I believe we deserve some comfort after we delivered two-thirds of &#x20AC;15 billion in four months. And we indicated 36 months. We have significant time left, and we are careful in what we're doing there. But we don't want to indicate what is on the list and EBITDA at this point. Then what we have one deal actually to date is another &#x20AC;100 million, so this is more on the list what you would now call rather small items. We have disposed our Swedish engineering activities. A company called Electric Sumptik. And that has been called as a disordered private equity investor, and so another hundred million in. A significant number of people and fitting better and different portfolio ins and out. And second question was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>UK electricity market reform.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>UK electricity market reform, obviously are very involved. So we're giving many opinions on that. I believe we are somewhat concerned that such a significant change within the European market will provide some leakage to the continent and from the continent to shield one regional market and organize it so differently from the rest of the neighboring markets will be an issue. Obviously that can also create chances, but we presently give opinions to the government to be sort of careful on some of the items. But we have not in an official position that we try to share yet. We talk behind closed doors with the government and we believe some of them, pretty much four elements in it. Believe some are wider than others. And some should be implemented slower than others and those opinions we give to the government and but we want to reserve it at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. <mark type="inaudible" /> from Macquarie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Good afternoon. I have two questions. And the first one relates to slide five once again. My understanding of your chart is that you consider the shutdown of the power plant after specific number of years. Are you in now translation to a given level of cleaned out spreads . Could you give us some flavor of on what cleaned out spread that would imply or alternatively say what number of capacity could go out of the market if the clean, dark and spark spreads remains where they are right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, this is- this is- this has no indication to our opinion on the level of cleaned access. This is based on knowledge of <mark type="inaudible" /> Specific locations in a number of stations across Europe that are devoted to specific customers if those would not take <mark type="inaudible" />. So this is a specific technical and environmental knowledge we share and nothing to do with the assumption of specific price or spread levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But do you agree that the current price and spread levels should have an impact on the potential shutdown of capacities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would definitely think so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but you are not in a position right now to give us <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think and I think it would not even advisable on competition law things. And probably, if I would answer that, when I hang up the phone I would have someone from Brussels on the line and that's after our knowledge of past years, doesn't appear to be very advisable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, understood. Just the second question if I may. In the past you gave us some pro forma figures where your 2013 targets could stand if the full asset disposal program would be executed i.e. the &#x20AC;1.5 billion to &#x20AC;2 billion euros decline in adjusted EBITDA and the flat impact on adjusted net profit if I remember correctly. Could you please give us an update here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically, the math is unchanged. We had &#x2013; I mean it's &#x2013; I think Central Europe didn't come as a surprise to anyone. We had already announced in November that we were exploring our options on that one. Obviously we now know what the impact from the disposals so far is where actually the only material one is Central Networks, the other material one, Gazprom, only has a positive impact on earnings because there is hardly anything that goes out, but a loss that comes in.</p>
          <p>I think Johannes highlighted in his chart, I believe it's page four, where we stand by now and that the impact on earnings from the various disposals is around &#x20AC;100 million so far. The math that we spelled out for 2013 is unchanged, so we continue to see sort of an earnings impact including some assumptions on reinvestments, which is somewhere between minus 5% to, say, minus 8% and the rest is unchanged. Obviously, if you want, I can walk you through the math again, but it's unchanged.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. No problem. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from Mr. <mark type="inaudible" /> from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello there, thank you. Two questions. First, you are still proud owners of almost 5% of treasury shares and for obvious reasons just wanted to test your willingness to potentially give them back to shareholders via script dividends going forward. Is that in your current planning? And second question, I notice that you slightly downgraded your expectations of nuclear production in 2013. And I wonder what has changed in your view here. Does that assume <mark type="inaudible" /> make it back to the grid or not at all or at a later stage. And related to that topic, just wondered how much CapEx you think you will need to spend to meet safety requirements that, I guess, we're still waiting for and whether that's already included in your CapEx program. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First of all, on script dividends, this is currently not a plan on our side. It is, I would say, something that I would say something that we observe and we'll have to see whether at some point in the future it might be a concept that could be attractive to our shareholders. But so far this is not a sort of in the toolbox with regard to the slightly reduced nuclear volume for 2013 good spot. Yes, that actually came down a bit. This is a function of us having been through the detailed revision plan for the different plans in the context of once again pressuring our generation business for that CapEx plan. And in this context essentially we saw that there is, I think it's 2 terawatt hours by what it comes down. That some of the revision cycles could be longer in '13, hence the slightly reduced number.</p>
          <p>With regard to CapEx per plan that, it's first of all for those plants that would require those investments, which in the planning period are <mark type="inaudible" /> that is included in the plant. And the numbers can vary quite materially by plants. And we continue to see it somewhere between &#x20AC;200 million and &#x20AC;300 million per plants. But again, it's depending on what plant it is, it can also be bit more or bit less. But that sort of an average figure that one can probably use.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And I assume that's spread over the, well, next few years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As I mentioned the investments for the two aforementioned plants are I think almost all of that is included until '13. I don't, I mean maybe there is sort of the odd &#x20AC;50 million that slips into '14. But that should all be included in the three-year plan.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes <mark type="inaudible" /> from Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have two questions on your gas wholesale business please. So first, you had mentioned an arbitration as a possible option in case you fail to reach an agreement with your gas suppliers in pricing mechanism renegotiations. So my question is, have you had any previous legal arbitration experience with any gas supplier when you successfully challenge the existing oil pricing mechanism in the long-time contract.</p>
          <p>And secondly, in case of a negative outcome of the arbitration proceedings should they happen, what are your options to deal with the gas that you have possibly accumulated against minimum <mark type="inaudible" /> pay in the past? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the first question on the, have you ever legally tested it in arbitration. All these contexts have arbitration clauses, and yes we have filed for arbitration and actually, in most cases things were settled favorably, in some cases judgments were filed, but never published and we don't intend to publish them today but to help us to find favorable solutions. So obviously those judgments help us to be confident that these clauses are hard and reliable and we force the exporters to be &#x2013; to move and that's the answer on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the second part was what happens to the gas in KRR to &#x2013; I interpreted it as the gas we have procured so far and what happens to that in case we lost arbitration. Is that what your question was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. My question was for the gas that you so far failed to off-take against minimum take-up there for which you have already made any prepayment but you didn't take that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, our last question comes from Mr. Ashley Thomas from MF Global.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Could I just return to the issue of the tax rate, you have indicated for 2013 it's likely to be around 30% rather than the 27% indicated with the CMD in November. But you've suggested that's because of higher EMP contribution. But when I look at the EBITDA bridge, the EMP growth of &#x20AC;800 million is the same now as it was back in November. So if you could just reconcile that. And then the other issue with the EBITDA bridge now compared to November is &#x2013; it looks like the contribution from new capacity is about 100 million less now than before, &#x20AC;800 million rather than &#x20AC;900 million. So again I just wondered if you could reconcile that issue as well please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So the second one is easy &#x2013; the &#x20AC;800 million that we were showing in November compared to '10 with '13 and now we compare '11 with '13. With regard to the tax rate, when you look at the chart that we have shown in November, yes it looks a little bit strange because of the one number where for those that maybe have the presentation and it was page 48 of what we presented in November on the Capital Markets Day where we say for the years '10 and '13 assumed average tax rate of 27% on operating profits and then this also carries a footnote that we thought was indicating that that number can actually change, but it was our best estimate for 2010 at that point in time. As I highlighted to you, we came out at 26%.</p>
          <p>So that said, yes, we knew all the facts by November, but this was the way we have communicated it back then. Again today I would not say it will absolutely for certain be 30% in 2013. It might also be two percentage points lower. As we've seen in, I would probably say every year in the past, our tax rate has never been exactly at the point value that we spelled out. So maybe going forward, we should be using a range although I am not so sure that will make your life easier, or what we were trying to indicate today is that we expected historically to more likely be at a higher number than at a lower number and that's why I answered one of the earlier questions suggesting that I today would rather use 30% than 27%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just on the contribution from new capacity, it's actually a 2010 versus 2010 base, so that's not quite the explanation, but I can take it offline. Thank you.</p>
