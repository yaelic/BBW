      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Union Pacific's third quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Rob Knight, our CFO; Jack Koraleski, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales and Dennis Duffy, Executive Vice President, Operations.</p>
          <p>Union Pacific's third quarter 2009 earnings totaled $1.02 per share, that compares to earnings of $1.38 per share in 2008, a 26% decrease. These results are clearly driven by the global recession and our related 15% volume reduction. Although we'll never be satisfied reporting lower earnings, there are some positives in our results. The Union Pacific team achieved a third quarter best operating ratio by concentrating on our business fundamentals of safety, service, value and productivity. Our safety performance is better in all areas as we continue to gain traction with our safety initiatives.</p>
          <p>Our customers (sic) [customer] service reached all-time highs, excellent service reports Union Pacific's value proposition enabling us to achieve pricing gains that support our capital investments and drive financial returns. We're also generating better margins to improve efficiency. Although the benefits of project operating ratio were evident before the economic downturn, we're taking advantage of the lighter volumes to accelerate productivity efforts.</p>
          <p>In addition to running a very solid operation in the third quarter, we're encouraged to see our seven-day carloadings increase from second quarter levels. We view this as a sign that the economy has at least stabilized and may be improving slightly. Within this environment, however, there is still a great deal of uncertainty. Because of that, we continue to hold a larger than usual cash balance and remain fully committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Now with that, let me turn it over to Jack to talk about our business volumes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jim, and good morning. While the impact of the economic downturn continued to be felt in each of our six businesses during the third quarter leading to that 15% fall off in volume, average revenue per car was down 12% as core price gains of 4% were more than offset by a decrease in fuel surcharge revenue and a little negative mix. That being said, we're not shifting our pricing strategy in any way. We're absolutely focused on re-investability even though the soft economy is making things a little more challenging for us.</p>
          <p>So with both volume and average revenue per car down from last year, freight revenue declined 25% to $3.5 billion. Although volumes were down year-over-year during the quarter, they were improved from the first half of the year with the run rate up about 10% from last quarter. That strengthening was driven by several factors. Seasonality certainly played a role as coal, wheat and intermodal all picked up over the past few months. We've seen inventory replenishment kind of ebb and flow, so it's starting to look like sales rates and inventories are aligning, which is a good sign that we've bottomed out.</p>
          <p>Cash for Clunkers has given a boost to our automotive volumes. Supply chain issues ranging from mine production in Colorado, Utah, to bankruptcies in the ethanol market have all improved. Stronger value proposition is attracting new business to the railroad. And last but certainly not least, some of the improvement is what our customers are calling stronger demand, which offers some hope that we'll see more signs of recovery next year.</p>
          <p>Let me take you through what's happening in each of our six businesses. Start with Ag, a 12% decline in Ag products' carloadings combined with a 13% decline in average revenue per car at a lower revenue, 23% for the quarter. Whole grains were down 18% as both exports and domestic shipments declined. Reduced animal inventories and fewer shipments to forward ethanol plants led a 7% decline in domestic grains. And those lower animal counts were also a significant driver of a 13% decline in meals and oil shipments. DDGs and ethanol both posted some slight improvement with ethanol getting a boost from the resumed production at the former VeraSun plants. In import, beer and volume on our produce rail express service also posted year-over-year gains in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Auto revenues declined 30% as a 19% drop in volume combined with a 14% reduction in average revenue per car. Spurred by Cash for Clunkers and the resolution of the bankruptcy related plant shutdowns, the 19% volume decline represents significant strengthening from earlier this year with volume up over 30% from the second quarter. Finished vehicles declined 28% year-over-year, but parts were only down 6% as we saw a nearly 50% increase in parts volume over the prior quarter as manufacturers started to ramp up production in response to the higher sales volumes.</p>
          <p>In chemicals the 16% revenue decline was the result of a 7% reduction in average revenue per car and a 10% drop in volume from 2008 levels that were negatively impacted by last year's hurricanes. Our plastic shipments grew slightly as export moves offset the 5% decline in the domestic market. Continued weakness in the construction, autos and industrial sectors of the economy was reflected in the decline in liquid and dry shipments. Caustic soda was the one counter to that trend growing 2% as commodity pricing favored domestic producers versus the imports. Economic conditions also drove declines in petroleum and soda ash down of 17 and 11%. And continued weak domestic demand and a weak export potash market resulted in a 24% drop in our fertilizer shipments.</p>
          <p>Against last year's best-ever quarter, energy volume dropped 14%, which, combined with an 8% decline in average revenue per car, reduced revenue 21%. Coal stockpiles remain high as a result of the recession's impact on industrial production, utility outages, relatively mild summer weather in our served territory and, to a limited degree, lower natural gas prices.</p>
          <p>Soft demand on our contract losses from the first quarter drove a 14% decline in trains out of the Powder River Basin. And although improved from second quarter, Colorado, Utah shipments continued to be hampered by coal quality problems and production issues resulting in 210 fewer trains than a year ago.</p>
          <p>Those economic doldrums are still prevalent in our industrial products business, where volumes were down 29%. Add to that a 14% drop in average revenue per car, and the result is a 39% reduction in revenue. Softness in housing and construction again drove declines in steel, rock, lumber and cement. Steel mill capacity utilization strengthened through the year, but it's still significantly below last year's level, driving a 50% reduction in steel and scrap shipments for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Rock inventories remain high with stimulus spending having only a very minor effect so far. And the one bright spot's been our new short-haul uranium tailings move in Utah that drove a 6,500 unit increase in hazardous waste loadings for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Intermodal revenue was down 22% as volume was off 13 and average revenue per unit declined 11%. The weakness of the overall economy continues to be reflected in low West Coast import volumes, which resulted in the 25% decline in our international intermodal segment. Our domestic intermodal was, again, a good news story with volume up 9%, largely driven by the new hub business.</p>
          <p>So it looks like the economy has bottomed out but, unfortunately, we're not seeing an upturn yet. We expect volume's going stay below last year. But given the steep fall off in 2008, that shortfall should narrow as we move towards year-end. With winter approaching, we really don't see any pickup in the cards for lumber, stone, cement, asphalt or steel. We have seen some stimulus-related projects, but they really appear to be replacing other funding sources rather than generating incremental activity at this time.</p>
          <p>Stockpiles are high and demand is soft. So we think Powder River Basin tonnage is going to trail last year's record fourth quarter by about 10%. And while our customer or, I'm sorry, while our chemical business should hold its current run rate, wet weather and weak exports could produce another disappointing fall fertilizer market. But against those challenges, we do have some bright spots, the fall harvest is looking great and exports are picking up. Ethanol should hold its run rate, and, with the VeraSun ethanol plants back online, we should continue to post year-over-year growth in ethanol and DDGs.</p>
          <p>With auto inventories having gone from unprecedented highs earlier in the year to relatively low following Cash for Clunkers, that inventory replenishment should keep volume at least as strong as the third quarter. And with the peak &#x2013; international peak behind us, such as it was, the international intermodal volumes will soften through year-end. At the same time, domestic should continue to outpace last year with added hub business and the continued strength in our new service offerings. So we're staying focused on re-investability, new business development and capitalizing on the opportunities created by a strong value proposition that our service is creating. One of the best proofs of that value proposition is what our customers are saying.</p>
          <p>So I'll wrap up with a look at customer satisfaction, which came in at 88 for the third quarter. That's a five-point improvement from last year and our new best-ever quarterly mark since we started measuring customer satisfaction back in 1987. During the quarter, we also set our best-ever monthly record when the satisfaction index closed in August at 90.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll turn it over to Dennis to talk about our operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jack, and good morning. In the third quarter, the operating team continued to make significant enhancements to both our operating efficiency and service delivery. In fact, the performance of our rail network has never been better. Third quarter velocity increased nearly 16% versus 2008 to a best ever 27.4 miles per hour. Freight car utilization, which is cycle time between loaded moves, set a record at 8.4 days. Lower cycle time means fewer assets are needed, reducing capital and lease expenses.</p>
          <p>Terminal dwell times held steady at 24.5 hours. As we discussed in July, we have shut down our significantly curtailed operations at several locations to reduce cost and reflect current demand. We gain these efficiencies while also improving our service performance, as shown by our service delivery index in the lower right, and by the record customer satisfaction that Jack told you about. We achieved this performance while also improving our number one priority, safety, making double-digit gains year-to-date for all three categories in public &#x2013; employee, public and customer.</p>
          <p>Our productivity efforts are also paying off in capital activities. Roughly two-thirds of our capital spending this year goes to replacing and improving the infrastructure. A diligent focus on process improvement using lean principles has driven steady productivity gains. This stretches our capital dollars with a payoff in lower slow order miles. Fewer speed restrictions means better fluidity and service and reduced operating costs.</p>
          <p>On the operating expense side, we set another best-ever fuel efficiency rate in the third quarter, 2% better than the same quarter last year, saving about $20 million in fuel costs. We reduced our freight car lease expenses by about four million and also reduced overtime and guaranteed costs significantly. All of these productivity gains improve our agility in the uncertain economy. In fact, year-over-year, we were volume variable with our working resources.</p>
          <p>Gross ton-miles were down 17% year-over-year, but we were able to reduce train starts and our working resources even more. As you heard from Jack, volumes have improved from the April trough. Sequentially, gross ton miles actually increased by about 9% from the second quarter to third quarter. We put a few more resources back into service, but these were tempered by permanent reductions from attrition, equipment retirements and lease returns.</p>
          <p>The work we did over the last couple of years to efficiently handle volume across the network, such as the Unified Plan, various inventory management systems and the operating income statements we installed in our field work units, also helped us be more agile in sizing the network in the current environment.</p>
          <p>The best part of the story, however, is still in front of us, when volumes increase further. We see strong upside leverage in the operation as a result of long-term structural changes made in our network operations. For example the Evergreen Process of the Unified Plan, which has created room to grow in the existing train network without adding additional starts; changing our locomotive utilization, including expanded use of distributed power, and developing better assignment practices to take greater advantage of technology. These structural changes also create room to grow in the existing train network and improve fuel efficiency.</p>
          <p>We maintain surge capacity to quickly handle changes in demand, thus creating resiliency. And the strategic investments in our infrastructure over the last several years provide us with capital &#x2013; capacity to grow.</p>
          <p>The combination of these activities, as well as many others, have enabled us to be volume variable and will give us good upside leverage as volumes return.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to Rob.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dennis, and good morning. We'll start the review of the financial results with a look at our income statement summary.</p>
          <p>Third quarter operating revenue totaled $3.7 billion, 24% lower than 2008. The primary drivers were a 15% decrease in carloadings, as well as a $590 million reduction in fuel surcharges. Quarterly operating expenses declined 26% to $2.7 billion. A 49% decrease in third quarter diesel fuel prices contributed to the lower expense. In addition, UP's ongoing efforts to operate with a high degree of volume variability, while increasing organizational efficiency, helped to reduce quarterly costs. Lower third quarter operating revenue and expense combined to produce quarterly operating income of $967 million, a 20% reduction versus 2008.</p>
          <p>Third quarter freight revenue totaled $3.5 billion, down 25% from 2008. Similar, through operating revenue, lower volumes and reduced fuel surcharge revenue drove the decline. In the chart on the left, the blue bars illustrate the year-over-year change in our rate-based fuel surcharge program. Of course, this program is only one of a number of fuel surcharge programs that the Company uses, but it demonstrates the significant decrease in fuel surcharges between 2008 and 2009.</p>
          <p>The yellow bars illustrate the year-over-year change in average revenue per car. As diesel fuel prices and the related fuel surcharges declined, our customers benefited from lower freight bills. In fact, after seeing a 1% increase in first quarter average revenue per car, third quarter average revenue per car was 12% lower versus 2008. The mix of our business was negative in the quarter by a couple of points. Over 60% of third quarter carloads were energy and intermodal shipments, groups with the lowest average revenue per car. This more than offset the impact of higher average revenue per car moves such as Ag products and chemicals.</p>
          <p>As Jack discussed, third quarter core pricing totaled roughly 4%, still strong, but reflective of the very difficult economic environment that we face today. And given current pricing levels, we now expect full-year core price to be closer to the 5% mark. Although, clearly pressured by the economy, we remain firmly committed to pricing our business to improve returns, which will be evident in our overall profitability.</p>
          <p>Turning now to expenses, we'll start with compensation and benefits which totaled nearly $1 billion in the quarter, an 11% decline. During the quarter, Union Pacific continued to take actions to better align workforce levels with demand. Through a combination of furloughs, attrition and management actions, third quarter employment levels were 11% lower than in 2008. In fact, we've seen a sequential decrease in our workforce over the past six quarters.</p>
          <p>In addition to our employment actions, greater overall labor productivity kept average compensation per employee pretty flat in the quarter. This is especially significant when you consider about 85% of our workforce received a 4.5% wage increase on July 1. For the reminder of 2009, we will continue to manage workforce levels with demand.</p>
          <p>Slide 23 shows the year-over-year impact of diesel fuel prices, volumes and fuel surcharges on the quarterly earnings. Third quarter fuel expense declined $669 million in the quarter, or 59%. The biggest contributor was a fall off in quarterly diesel fuel prices, which went from $3.70 per gallon last year to $1.87 per gallon in 2009, saving $442 million. In addition, third quarter gross ton miles were off 17% year-over-year, driving down consumption and saving $180 million. The red and green bars on the slide demonstrate the quarterly impact from our fuel surcharge lag. As we discussed back in July, earnings in the first half of 2009 benefited roughly $0.40 per share. That earnings tailwind was created as diesel fuel prices declined and the associated fuel surcharge revenue lagged the lower prices by roughly two months.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, however, the relatively stable fuel price environment allowed our fuel surcharge programs to nearly match the price we were paying for fuel. As a result, the combined impact of fuel prices and the related surcharge lag was basically zero in the quarter. At current diesel fuel prices of around $2.05 per gallon, we would expect to lap a very favorable comparison in the fourth quarter. If you recall, last year's fourth quarter benefited from roughly $0.30 per share earnings tailwind associated with the fuel surcharge lag. And we clearly don't expect to see a similar benefit this year.</p>
          <p>Purchased services and materials expense declined 16% in the third quarter to $403 million. Lower volumes and increased operating efficiency contributed to lower contract services expense, reduced crew transportation and lodging, as well as fewer joint facility costs. We also used less locomotive and freight car materials in the quarter as we performed fewer repairs as a result of lower volumes and having portions of these fleets in storage. In addition, this expense line has a favorable year-over-year variance associated with last year's hurricanes of about $11 million.</p>
          <p>Turning to equipments and other rents, this expense category declined $36 million year-over-year or 11%. Reduced volumes, particularly for shipments of industrial products and intermodal containers, reduced short-term car rents by about $14 million in the quarter. Better asset utilization as well as fewer leased assets also contributed the quarterly expense decline.</p>
          <p>In addition, locomotive lease expense declined as a result of restructuring certain locomotive leases from operating to capital in the second quarter. This transaction reduced equipment and other rents expense by $22 million, while increasing depreciation expense $15 million and interest expense $14 million.</p>
          <p>Other expense totaled $179 million in the quarter, a decrease of $39 million or 18%. Reduced freight and property damages, employee travel and utilities expense all contributed to this decline. We also recorded less expense for bad debts in the quarter. An improved receivables collection rate and our ongoing efficiency focus helped drive expenses lower. Increased property taxes offset a portion of this decline.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Slide 27, we look at our expense variability for the quarter. Union Pacific has taken action throughout 2009 to adjust our cost structure as business volumes had remained low. That work continued in the third quarter in the form of reduced workforce levels, stored assets, greater operating productivity and a company-wide focus on efficiency. If you normalize for the year-over-year change in diesel fuel prices, we achieved an expense variability rate in the third quarter in excess of 80%.</p>
          <p>The organization responded very well to the challenging business environment, which positions us to bring volumes back on to the network in a cost efficient manner. In fact, we expect that we will add volumes to our network at higher margins when the business volumes rebound.</p>
          <p>The final proof statement of our quarterly results can be seen in a record third quarter operating ratio of 73.7%. In the face of significant lower volumes, we achieved a 1.2 points of year-over-year improvement. Operating efficiency, focused cost reductions, lower fuel prices and pricing gains all contributed to quarterly progress. Since 2006, the work of project operating ratio has helped us take nearly 7.5 points off of our operating ratio, despite seeing carloading declines of almost 19%.</p>
          <p>Taking a look at the full income statement, other income totaled $14 million in the third quarter, down $9 million versus 2008. Less rental and interest income, as well as lower gains from real estate sales, contributed to this decline. Third quarter interest expense increased $26 million to $156 million. Higher year-over-year debt levels and a slightly higher effective interest rate drove the increased expense.</p>
          <p>Income tax expense was 24% lower in the quarter to $308 million. Lower pre-tax income was the primary driver of the decline, offset somewhat by a lower effective tax rate last year. Our third quarter 2009 effective tax rate was 37.3%, 0.7 points above the 2008 rate. On a full-year basis, we expect the effective tax rate to be close to 37%. Third quarter net income totaled $517 million, a 26% decline, or earnings of $1.02 per share.</p>
          <p>Slide 30 shows our quarter-end cash position and all-in debt levels. We continue to maintain above average cash balances as warranted by the economic environment. Adjusted debt levels increased to $14.5 billion, reflecting new debt issuance over the past year.</p>
          <p>For the fourth quarter, our expectations continue to be driven by the economy. As Jack mentioned, the volume comparisons become increasingly favorable as we move toward the end of the year. In particular, we experienced a 10% decline in seven-day carloadings between November and December last year. Although we don't expect to see declines of that magnitude in 2009, weekly volumes will likely slow between Thanksgiving and New Years.</p>
          <p>We also face a significant headwind from fuel in the fourth quarter. As I discussed earlier, the fuel surcharge lag contributed roughly $0.30 per share to quarterly earnings in 2008, adding significant pressure to the year-over-year comparisons this year. Regardless, we will stay focused on controlling the parts of the business within our control, which will position us for strong upside and increasing returns when the economy does improve.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it back to Jim.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob. As we close out the final months of 2009, we'd like to share early thinking on what's ahead in 2010. We don't expect a quick rebound and are positioning ourselves for a slow recovery. Net environment remain dedicated to running our railroad as efficiently as possible, while providing customers with a strong service product. Excellent service creates market opportunities, attracts new customers and supports future pricing gains.</p>
          <p>We're still developing our capital plan for 2010, but our spending level will be balanced between current load demand levels and our commitments to long-term strategic growth. Although we're not &#x2013; we won't be taking any new locomotives next year, we will have the additional burden of implementing positive train control. The safety bill requires complete installation by year-end 2015, so we'll aggressively pursue meeting this deadline.</p>
          <p>Looking beyond today's economic challenges, we believe UP's accelerated productivity efforts will drive significant upside leverage when volumes start to improve, enabling UP to deliver increasing financial returns and growing cash flow.</p>
          <p>With that, let's open it up to your questions.</p>

          <p>Morning, Tom.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's see, I wanted to get a sense of your operating leverage, which you might see through expanded train size, assuming you see some pick up in industrial volumes looking out over a couple quarters. So I guess to get at that, can you give a sense of what your average train length is at the present time, setting aside I guess maybe coal and Ag, but if you look in the scheduled network, average train length and perhaps what you could get to given sidings or other constraints, if you see improvement in volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, that's a difficult question because the ability to absorb volume in the near term as it comes back from our function by corridor, by yard, by type of business. We are managing our train lengths pretty efficiently. We're running pretty decent sized trains right now when you look at it. Because again, if you look at the drop off in volume and the reduction in train starts, you'll see we've done a pretty good job of matching that.</p>
          <p>The real upside in my mind comes into the context of &#x2013; think about we've got 1,700 locomotives that are stored and we're depreciating. So if you see some of that increased volume, we won't see an incremental cost in the terms of locomotive ownership. There is room in certain corridors in terms of absorption of train size. We do have our train crews that we're running what we call a low-mile strategy, which says that they've got some opportunity to move up. But to put a specific number on it, it's pretty tough right now. I will tell you this, there's significant leverage as the volume comes back in terms of our ability to convert that into bottom line income. Dennis, do you want to add anything to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The comment across the board whatever the train type is. We have room to go. And I will also just tell you this, our train lengths on the intermodal side, the auto side and the manifest &#x2013; other than the auto side, and the manifest side, are the largest they've been. But as Jim said, since we've added DPU to, as you saw, about two-thirds of our gross ton-miles, we have significant growth opportunities in every one of the train class categories.</p>

          <p>Okay. Got it. That's helpful. My other question would be with respect to coal, and I apologize if I missed this in your prepared remarks. But can you give us a sense of the magnitude of stockpiles in your specific region? And does that imply that kind of the negative case would be a step down in volumes next year in coal? Or is it more realistic to say, hey, you're running at a low rate and maybe the negative case for coal volumes next year is something that's kind of flat with this year?</p>

          <p>You know, Tommy, you think about what could drive coal next year, I mean, there are so many variables including is it going to be a cold winter or a hot &#x2013; warm winter or hot summer, what's going to happen with the export markets, all of those things. I can tell you that our stockpile situation is relatively high, probably higher &#x2013; there was a report out just recently that said on average somewhere in the neighborhood of 20% higher than a year ago. So there is a significant coal stockpile out there. But there's a lot of conditions that would determine whether or not we're going to see down, flat or even potentially some up volumes next year.</p>

          <p>Allison, if you look right now, it's pretty difficult to say. We're in the process of renegotiating right now and looking at those contracts and it's just really too early to say what percent has been done or what hasn't. There's still a lot of things that are going to have to be decided here before we get to year-end.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Allison, we &#x2013; I'm not going to get into specific guidance here other than I'll tell you if you think about Union Pacific, we have the biggest book of legacy deals still in front of us, and I do see positive upside on pricing.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great. And then maybe just turning to fuel, it seems like the gallons consumed are trending better or lower than the volume declines. Can you talk about maybe some fuel efficiency measures that you guys are gaining on?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You bet, Allison, we have a comprehensive fuel conservation program. Obviously, our DPU program, where we're using the distributed power, we think that generates about four to 6% fuel savings versus conventional power configurations. We put in a fuel conservation speed, where we use a maximum speed of 50 at the most efficient fuel throttle positions. Our tons per powered axle, the way we distribute power, we've been able to take advantage of our AC technology. That's lowered the number of units required by over 100 and it's generated some fuel conservation savings for us. And then, the last thing I'd mention is our Fuel Masters Program, which is our engineers &#x2013; our operating craft engineers &#x2013; practicing good operating practices and teaching others, and there's a reward recognition program in there. That's been a significant contributor to our fuel conservation efforts. So it's a multi-faceted approach.</p>

          <p>Just on the &#x2013; back on pricing, I noticed you're indicating that the quarter was 4%. It's down from where you'd been up until recent. And now you're guiding more toward the 5%. Just wanted to make &#x2013; get a better sense, you mentioned that there's some kind of &#x2013; there is a mix effect in there and there is the &#x2013; also the sort of the general economic pressure. Is there anyway you can break out what's pushing that down? Is it the pressure you're getting from customers given the economic environment? Or is it &#x2013; was it more of the mix effect during the quarter?</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Walter, there's a number of things that impacted pricing in this quarter. We've said in the past that our legacy deals are not evenly distributed throughout the year, nor are they even &#x2013; distributed evenly year-to-year. So we had a situation in the second half of '09 here where we have lapped some legacy renegotiations from last year. So last year we had a very nice price increase as we stepped those rates up to market. This year now from the rest of the year on, it's been replaced by more normal escalations. That's one factor.</p>
          <p>A second factor for us is I had a 4.5% increase in price in my international intermodal business. That was completely offset by contract provisions in my legacy intermodal business that required price decreases, so that was a fairly a large hit for us. And then the third factor I would say is the escalation contracts and the escalation vehicles themselves. For instance, ALIF was only up 2.5% in the quarter, last year it was up close to 5%. So those are kind of the three swing factors that were out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great color. I appreciate that. Second question, this is for Jim. Washington, still no word from them, can you give us an update on &#x2013; we had been hearing rumblings that a bill has surfaced that, sort of, you guys have had a look at and you might be all right with. Is there anything you can provide us, understanding there is some confidentiality there, but any update you can provide us on what's coming out of Washington?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Walter, we're still waiting to see an actual bill or language. It's about every other week. I would say this though, we've been in discussion with Chairman Rockefeller and Chairman Oberstar for years in terms of our concerns, what's required in terms of insuring that this industry can still afford to invest, in discussions in replacement costs. So I'm confident that they're listening, because both members, who have an influence, want to see more business movement on railroads. So we'll see what comes out and we'll get a chance to look at it and take it from there.</p>

          <p>There's a lot of issues going on in Washington today that I'm not certain that new regulations on the railroad industry are priority. Although, I am concerned and I have said this to members, that uncertainty is a problem in our industry. And we've got to have some certainty when we start thinking about long-term investment decisions. They realize that. So &#x2013; but we've got to great story to tell, as you know. We've made a lot of investment. You've got to be careful about do you swing this, any new regulations too far because investment will dry up and that's been our message to the members.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks. I was just wondering if you could talk about, Jack, what you're hearing from customers. If I look at the fourth quarter, we really only have six weeks left. And you get the drop-off in the Thanksgiving week, get the drop-off in the last two weeks of December. First quarter is kind of starting to shape up to be a black hole. I'm just wondering if you could talk about what you're hearing from customers in terms of their shipping intentions and capacity requirements beyond what is the end of this peak season which really didn't materialize?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matt, it is kind of a mixed bag. If I just kind of think though them, for instance, I think coal is going to stay where it is. As I said in my remarks, it's going to be down 10% from a year ago. And we're going to get down to the contract minimums and things, both with our sales and also with the utilities. So that's not going to go up. The Ag world is going to be strong for us I think, and the export market's picking up both soybeans and then once the corn harvest is completed, I think we'll see strength. And that should take us into the first quarter easily and we should be pretty decent there.</p>
          <p>Chemical run rate is about where it's going to be. Plastic's faring a little bit better because of exports. I think the fertilizer's going to be disappointing. I think that's going to be kind of seasonally appropriate from the levels that it is. We'll see a downturn through the holidays. But then it'll kind of show some up tick in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Intermodal, it's going to follow a seasonal pattern. Although our domestic, I think it's going to outperform year-ago levels and &#x2013; both because of hub but also because of our new international lanes with Norfolk Southern and the refer service that we started up this year, all of those things. Automotive guys tell me they're expecting it to the kind of stay strong here for a while. The inventory replenishment cycle, they're not going gang busters in terms of overtime and everything else to fill the inventory levels back up. So we've talked to several of them recently and it sounds like through the first quarter we should be okay.</p>
          <p>And that would leave the IP guys and I think construction season has, for all intents and purposes, shutdown. I think the IP world is going to stay where it is. I think it's going to be a tough first quarter. And the hope appears to be second quarter of 2010. They are all kind of saying they're hoping to see at least some minor rebound in the construction industry. The one exception might be steel. The steel capacity utilization now has crossed &#x2013; I think 62% was the most recent number I saw. And if that were to continue, we could see a little bit of an up tick in our steel carloadings and maybe buck the more seasonal trend there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for that comprehensive answer. I would take those comments and just ask Dennis, in terms of operations if we do see that seasonal sequential decline from mid-December into January, is it reasonable to assume you'll be taking actions either on the head count front or from just a network productivity perspective to be able to scale back for reduced traffic levels with that normal seasonality? What are the one or two levers you can pull in the near term for 1Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, absolutely, Matt. We will do that and we have been doing that. I think you saw that demonstrated here in our numbers this quarter. One of the first things we do is obviously go in there and adjust our Unified Plan, and we've been doing that on a daily, weekly, monthly basis, commensurate with the demand. That will adjust our train starts. And the other one that you heard was the initial question series about train size. We've been consistently taking up train size and then we'd adjust, obviously, our yard operations, which we have been driving more towards our more efficient yards and downsizing or shutting down our smaller yards. So those are just three classic things that we'd start with immediately and those are on an ongoing process for us.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jim, you talked about accelerating productivity efforts, I mean building accelerate productivity efforts. If we have a sort of half speed or, say, volume recovery that's on the weaker side of the equation, how much of an opportunity is there to take additional costs out of the system? Or have we taken the cost structure down to as good as we're going to get? Is there another point of OR that can come out just by running the railroad better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I won't give you the number in terms of the OR, but there is &#x2013; the biggest challenge we have right now &#x2013; that we're all struggling with right now &#x2013; is when you pick that point of the up tick. And our assumption here in the next year or so is we're not going to see anything significant. Many of the issues &#x2013; Rob mentioned our project OR initiative, we've had underway for really a couple years right now. There are short-term, there are kind of mid-term and long-term types of opportunities that have come out of that. So we're going to continue to be aggressive on our efficiency in this environment. And on the other hand, we have to be prepared for when this thing picks up. So I expect us to continue to show good cost performance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now I think there are cases we've done better, when we look at it. You have to be smart about &#x2013; listen, the other caveat here we have to be careful on is we are not going to jeopardize service. I think it's so important for us right now, with our service metrics, we have customers that have not considered rail before that are starting to look at rail. Customers are seeing that value proposition, which that value proposition there helps in the pricing initiatives that we take a look at. So there's a whole spectrum of things we look at and consider. But again, I &#x2013; it doesn't end in one year. And it's going to be a tough year next year in volume and we're going to respond with our efficiency.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to follow-up on a couple of the comments. Jack, you mentioned that it was too soon to talk about what's repriced for 2010. I think last year at this time you'd mentioned that at the start of the year for 2009, you expected roughly 70% of the business kind of locked in on price. Would there be any reason it'd be different this year when we look to 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, yes. This is a much different economic scenario than where we were last year. Even at this point last year, we still hadn't really realized the full extent of just how bad things were going to get. So I think there's a lot more moving pieces. It's a lot more difficult economic scenario, and there's &#x2013; it could turn out to be the same, I'm just not prepared to say that yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, Jim, as you think about managing the volume rebound over time, and UP's done a phenomenal job taking out costs to the downside, so you've not shown very much negative operating leverage. There's some skepticism that you can show positive operating leverage when volumes come back. Are you willing to sort of meter this in through price or something? Could we expect maybe lower than expected volume recovery because you're only going to take volumes back at an incrementally higher margin? Or how do you think about that, because I've got to believe that some of these costs are going to come back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you clearly will have some comeback. I mean the obvious one, fuel's about 100% variable with volume when you look at it. Our first criteria when you look at it is where does is it fit on the re-investability strength. That's your first task in terms of taking any business back in.</p>
          <p>The second one, every group in this company has taken costs out. Sometimes there's a, I guess, you look at things when you have the kind of challenges we have. I've seen our team really put on the table some things in terms of accelerating cost reductions. But you ask the question is it absolutely mission critical and, in the environment we're in, it's not. And we're going to be very, very cautious about adding costs in as we move forward. Obviously, you're going to have some cost increase there, that's clear. But we do have good leverage and many of the costs that have come out of here, at least as I see it in the next two, three years, are not coming back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned the locomotives not being able to leverage that. Does this mean we wouldn't have to take any locomotives going forward, so we can actually see a reduction in gross CapEx too?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I said in my comments that we will not take any new deliveries next year. We've got &#x2013; we're sitting on I think around 1,700 right now. So we've got quite a bit of room in terms of taking volume before we're back in the locomotive market.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. On the cost side, is there any evidence that as you bump up into some of these minimum contract agreements with the mines and the utilities, any evidence that that's taking away in any meaningful way from the first half 2010 demand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's not a widespread hitting up against the minimums?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well although at the end day here, with higher inventories, clearly coal volumes in the first half, I want to make certain I understand your question, you're going to have some pressure in the first half in coal simply because your inventories are high.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I understand that. I guess I'm just wondering are you bumping into your minimums widespread, which to me would indicate that there's some additional weakness even above and beyond just the inventory stockpiles that may occur in the first half of 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think &#x2013; we don't see anything there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. And then on the domestic intermodal side, I got to imagine that's probably one of the more price aggressive places just given what's happening on the trucking world. But can you talk a little bit about when truck pricing turns, how you are positioned to benefit from that, and how quickly you can see the benefit from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon, I think there's a couple of perspectives here. You've got to show the service product first. I mean you can have &#x2013; jumping back and fourth between truck and intermodal, customers don't just do that routinely. We've got great service products in place, new offerings that we're putting in place. You've to ask the question on the impact of both demand and fuel. You've got fuel now, crude over $80 a barrel that will start to come through the market. Obviously that should help us on the rail side because we're more fuel efficient. I don't know if you can say there's a magical point here. If anything, we probably have seen &#x2013; if there's any shift going on, it's just been the last &#x2013; right now, with whatever we can &#x2013; well we're calling it a peak, there's been some pick up in demand there. But I don't think there's any magic number that says you automatically start to see a swing.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Morning, guys. This is Scott Group in for Ed. Quick one on pricing. Can you just give a little color on the 4% pricing for the quarter, can you give a sense on where you started the quarter and where you finished, if it was any different than the 4% throughout?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, I don't &#x2013; I hadn't thought about it that way. But, no, I don't really see much difference between the beginning and the end of the quarter other than just the way the escalations played out in terms of formulas. But no real substantive change in activity, thought or strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And as you look out to 2010, what &#x2013; for the legacy contracts that come up, are they more front-end or back-end loaded for next year? And then just can you talk as if you've got any big international intermodal contracts coming up next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have some front and I have some midyears and I don't have any major international intermodals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Just a little housekeeping now. For head count, can you just give some color on where you finished the quarter and then where we should see head count going from here? I know it was down from second quarter to third quarter, are you planning on keeping it flat into fourth or should it be up or down from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the total number's down, what, 11% I believe to a year ago. We're taking a look, a hard look. Keep in mind we're still experiencing attrition. While the rate of attrition has slowed down a little bit, we'll still probably in total lose about 3,000 or so, 2,500 employees this year that'll leave. So we're managing that. We have a, pretty much, a hiring freeze in, other than a few pockets in the Company. So we're going to continue to manage it in terms of lining up as much as we can with volumes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So fair to think head count's not up from where we start in third quarter, sequentially?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then just lastly, on the coal side, can you give an update on Colorado, Utah and when you're expecting those mines to come back? And then just refresh us on when the contract losses in for PRB coal lap?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The contract losses &#x2013; this is Jack, Scott. Contract losses will lapse January 1. And Colorado, Utah, I'd love to tell you, but I really don't know. They're dealing with geology issues. They're dealing with coal quality issues. I have no way of knowing how that's going to fare next year. We've seen this kind of happen before and then all of a sudden they hit a solid seam of coal, production's very well and then they get back into problems. So it's pretty hard for us to determine that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Nice job on the results, guys. Just a quick question on the intermodal legacy contract that you mentioned that was bringing down rates, can you delve into that a little bit? I'm unfamiliar with why you have built in price reductions into the contract.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're legacy deals, Ken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So this is still &#x2013; how long is that contract? Oh this is &#x2013; okay. Forget it. I just &#x2013; sorry about that. I get it now. And then <mark type="inaudible" /> on this contract, but still confused by the comment on why you can't talk about the percentage that's locked in for year ahead. What would &#x2013; wouldn't the contracts be locked in today for next year already, a certain percentage of them? Or I just don't understand how much could be in flux at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you stop and you look at the contracts, there are some that are in place, there are some that have contract provisions, but it's still variable as to where the price is going to play itself out. Even in some of the contracts, as we negotiate, the escalation terms will vary with respect to our cap, for ALIF and those kinds of things and they're all variable. And so it's pretty difficult in this environment to give you any assurance that I've locked in 65% of my price in the marketplace, because there are too many variables to let me tell you that and have you count on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ken, although I &#x2013; we've to be careful a little bit. I mean the fact is, though, a pretty major book of our business is locked in, the contract base, when you look at it. I mean what's the percent of our total book that's contract?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>44% long-term and about 30% one-year deals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, again, I would be careful coming away from here that there's a major shift in terms of the percent of our book that's contract or not. We're still in some negotiations. We're not going to get into the details here, but I'm not &#x2013; there isn't a major trend change from what we've seen in the past.</p>

          <p>And then, Jim, just to wrap up, you talked about &#x2013; a bit about the regulatory picture earlier to one of the questions. I just want to understand, are you seeing any activity pick up right now in as healthcare seems to slow down? Or is this &#x2013; I guess we just hear so many different things about the rails have seen something, or something is coming, it's imminent. I just want to understand what your perspective is. If you're hearing kind of chatter picking up at all or is it just slow and consistent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's been consistent in terms of where we're at. I would &#x2013; I don't see healthcare as diminishing in terms of the focus in DC today. We'll see what happens here. We're waiting to see what &#x2013; get a, kind of a first look here and everybody will see that. I would just be cautious about overreacting to anything that comes out.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gary, there are our cap issues and there are other contract provisions that I'm really not at liberty to talk about.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When you think about the intermodal business, I mean you look at what's going on at &#x2013; is there a transloading phenomenon that's affecting the domestic versus international mix, just when you look at how the volumes are playing out versus what we're seeing elsewhere?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the past it's always been &#x2013; we've kind of cycled back and forth here. It used to be you had a lot of international business, ocean carriers would like to transload into domestic boxes for movement into the U.S. so they could get their boxes back to the Far East. Then that kind of went away. And now it's kind of cycling back again where we are doing some transloading on the West Coast into domestic boxes and just returning the empty international boxes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there any way to get a read on how much impact that's having or it's too hard to tell?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, I don't know, I guess for everybody, when you think about where that leverage point is, where the volume will really matter and have the biggest incremental impact, is there a way to think about generically where that is, which commodity grouping? I would think intermodal, but is that a fair assessment?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well it's going to be your manifest networks. It will be your intermodal network, auto's one. But you think about coal, you don't add coal and carload you add coal and train starts. But even in areas &#x2013; or grain shuttle even in those areas, you still will have leverage. Again, my example is locomotives. We're depreciating the cost of locomotives on the books not earning a dollar revenue. So it varies by group, but each one clearly will show, I think, good leverage.</p>

          <p>I wanted to get a sense &#x2013; you talked a bit about fuel and the performance has been good. But as you bring back potentially locomotives, hopefully the economy improves.

        <plist>
          <p>Well, Justin, we don't expect to see a significant increase here. First off, we still have some of our more fuel-efficient locomotive stored. So in terms of if we have to bring locomotives back, they're not going to be at a degradated consumption rate at this point. And we still think we've got room to grow on. We &#x2013; I showed you that about two-thirds of our gross ton miles are in DPU. We can still have incremental growth there. So &#x2013; and we've got room to grow on our TPA, that's our new tons per powered axle that we're allocating power with in our fuel conservation speed and our Fuel Masters. So we expect a continuous improvement yet, even if gross ton miles do go up, which as you saw here in the third quarter went up 9% 3Q versus 2Q...</p>

      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. That's great to hear. And I know that you guys have mentioned, and I know there've been a couple of questions on what's going on on the domestic intermodal side, and that you do have a legacy contract there that &#x2013; at least one &#x2013; that is weighing on profitability in that piece. And I guess there's been a lot of talk in the marketplace about there being conversations around that contract. Can you at least give us some color as to whether or not you're in those conversations?
