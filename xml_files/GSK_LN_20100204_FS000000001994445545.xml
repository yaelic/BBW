        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you very much for joining us today for our 2009 results briefing. Also, welcome to everybody who is watching this on the webcast as well.</p>
          <p>What we're going to do today is I'll basically run through a view of where we're at as a business. And then Julian Heslop, our Finance Director, will come up and take you through the detailed numbers for 2009 and give you some signals to some of the cost row guidance percentages going forward into 2010 and then we'll obviously have a Q&amp;A session at the end.</p>
          <p>Let me start by saying I really think that 2009 was a very important year for GSK. More than for any other reason that it really started to demonstrate that the strategy that we've been deploying over the last couple of years has really begun to bite and start to deliver, and that's been true across a number of parts of the business that I'll describe in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>I think it's also an important year psychologically because it saw the return to sales growth for the first time since 2007. And it's sometimes interesting &#x2013; and I did this little bit of analysis on Friday, just to look back, and during '07, '08 and '09, between U.S. generics and the loss of Avandia sales, the company actually lost &#xA3;4.5 billion of turnover in the '07, '08, '09 period, but actually grew by 500 million. So in that period, where we've clearly had tremendous pressure on us from U.S. generics and Avandia, to name just a couple of big areas, we've been able to grow the overall business and actually added &#xA3;5 billion of new sales over those three years.</p>
          <p>And of course in 2009 what you've started to see is that reflected in a net growth of sales, as the headwinds have started to diminish and the tailwinds have started to become stronger. And that's because A. obviously a change in some of those negatives, but B., more importantly, coming on stream of a whole series of sources of growth for the business.</p>
          <p>In some ways as I look forward now into 2010, you really start to see the company come through what you might have regarded as its patent cliff in terms of saying good-bye to a whole portfolio of legacy brands in the U.S. marketplace. And not to be too humorous this early in the afternoon, I think to some degree GSK's patent cliff ended up being a gentle slope.</p>
          <p>Let me move onto where we are in terms of strategy. What you've seen across the organization is a real commitment to drive growth on a diversified global basis. That's really being driven through our investments in our emerging markets, our consumer business in Japan, our vaccine business, and, of course, ensuring that our new product pipeline is delivered into the marketplace efficiently.</p>
          <p>I just want to point out, some of you will notice there's some different numbers on this slide. There's a typing mistake in the slide book you have in front of you where it says Rx/Cx sales in emerging markets. The numbers on here, 21% of GSK sales growing at 16 are correct. This is the correct version. I think the books you have in front of you have slightly wrong numbers in there. We just simply pulled that measure together just to try and put our emerging market numbers on the same basis as many other companies. Obviously everybody measures their emerging markets slightly different ways. What this does is bring together everything we do in the emerging markets, whether it's consumer or Rx into the same place.</p>
          <p>What you can see immediately is it's a substantial part of the business and it's growing very well. In the right-hand side of the slide you can see that we are continuing to be successful in diminishing our exposure to white pills / western market business. That business which has been most volatile for the industry in the last 10 years due to patent invalidations, for example, and the phenomena of super-rapid genericization at the end of exclusivity. That business has now come down to under 30% &#x2013; about 29% for 2009, from a level of 40% in 2007.</p>
          <p>What you've also seen during the year is a continued effort to really make sure that we are allocating capital and resources in this company in the places where we can generate the very best return. You know we've been running a program to take &#xA3;1.7 billion out of our cost base, much of it reinvested back into growth businesses of the organization. We're on track with that program; &#xA3;1 billion of cost saving achieved by the end of 2009, the rest to be achieved by the end of 2011. And today we've made announcement that we intend to increase that number by a further 500 million, new 500 million of savings to be delivered in full by the end of 2012, half of it to come from R&amp;D, half of it from SG&amp;A around the world and 70% of that new 500 million to flow to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>Working capital is now a focus of the company. It was not a focus of the company up until two years ago. And you can see that we've generated a benefit of &#xA3;1.5 billion in improved working capital. You won't necessarily see that in the numbers, because clearly what that's allowed us to do is to engage in growth businesses which, for example, consume more working capital, like emerging markets et cetera, and it's also somewhat allowed us to absorb the huge stock build that was required around H1N1 without increasing the working capital for the company. Julian will talk more about that in a second. But rest assured, the fundamental efficiency of the company is working well in terms of working capital. All of that helping contribute to a significant increase of about 12% in free cash flow to just over &#xA3;5 billion during the year.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D continued to perform extremely strongly. I'm going to talk more about R&amp;D in a few minutes, because you'll have seen that we've made some announcements today on proposals that we're planning to make changes in parts of R&amp;D. But right from the beginning, let me emphasize, the strategy for GSK R&amp;D is working again. In 2009 we achieved more NME and vaccine approvals from FDA than any other company; in fact, we were neck and neck with Novartis, four each. And if you look over the period, 2007, '08, '09, we have the highest number: 13% of all new molecular approvals from FDA were GSK, real evidence of the performance of the R&amp;D organization. And, of course, that's helping us diversify even in our core business. So whereas in the past we've been hugely department on one or two drugs, even in our core Western pharma business, you're beginning to see us diversify out that potential growth I'll touch on more later.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we see six opportunities for new molecular entity launches over the next 18 months, the most exciting of which is likely to be Benlysta, but also among there, several new vaccines.</p>
          <p>Now, if I just go to a quick summary of 2009. Julian is going to give you a lot more detail of the numbers, but just to pull out some of the highlights, first of all, growth, back to positive sales growth for the company, 3% overall; obviously driven by very strong performance of a number of our newer portfolio brands, particularly in the vaccine area. Obviously H1N1 was a significant contributor to sales during the year. I'm delighted by the performance of the company in response to the H1N1 demand from governments around the world. An absolutely excellent example of long-term investment over the last 15 years putting the company in a position where we have the right technology and capacity to be able to respond in an unprecedented speed to the demands that governments placed on us. As you will have seen, substantial sales in 2009, and as of today, obviously following a whole variety of conversations with governments over the last eight weeks, we currently expect sales in this area of H1N1 to be about the same in 2010 as they were in 2009.</p>
          <p>But elsewhere in the vaccine business, great start for Synflorix. You can see Synflorix was only launched at the end of Q3 of last year, &#xA3;73 million, very strong start in particularly the emerging markets, now registered in about 50 countries around the world.</p>
          <p>Cervarix, good strong growth year, very lumpy in terms of sales because so much of that business is dominated by particularly European tenders; you tend to get quarters with very big sales and then another quarter of very low sales. Q4 happened to be a low quarter. I can tell you Q1 is going to be a big quarter. So Cervarix is a very lumpy product at the moment. But as we speak, promotion is starting both in the U.S. and in Japan. Those markets are likely to be less tender-driven. And therefore, I think you'll start to see Cervarix smooth out over the next couple of years. But for this year, like last year, I would expect to see that European tender phenomena continue to be present in the patent.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere in terms of growth, I have to mention Advair. Advair, our biggest product, continues to perform very strongly, up 5% for the year. In fact, up 7% in Q4. Very strong performance of the business across the world. Emerging markets strong, Japan extremely strong and a pickup in our U.S. performance which, of course, is a key metric for us.</p>
          <p>If I look generally across our business, you can see some core mid-size brands performing well; Lovaza, Avodart, Arixtra, and in particular also you see Europe strongly helped by H1N1 and Japan a very strong performance. I'd just mention just for your information, there are zero sales of H1N1 in 2009 Japan numbers; so that is all new products, core organic business. And Relenza, and unusually the majority of Relenza in Japan is in the retail sector, not in government orders. So Japan had an extremely strong year and shipments of H1N1 vaccine to the Japanese market started in Q1 of this year.</p>
          <p>If I look at R&amp;D, one very important area we wanted to focus on a couple of years ago was to build up a biopharm area, and you see that really beginning to now deliver. First approval of Arzerra. And we have a positive opinion for Prolia; this is denosumab in partnership obviously with Amgen where we have, essentially, PMO marketing rights in Europe. We have PMO and oncology commercialization rights in the emerging markets. Positive opinion now from the European Union, looks very encouraging. Benlysta, you all know the data looks encouraging. We aim to file during the first half for Benlysta. So biopharm is moving forward.</p>
          <p>We have a series of other molecules in full development. For example, TRex-4, Type 1 diabetes. And right now we have 19% of our R&amp;D clinical programs are biopharmaceutical. So, significant shift forward in making sure that we have a portfolio of large molecules in addition to our vaccine portfolio and alongside the small molecules.</p>
          <p>Emerging market, pharma business had a very strong year, up 20%. You can see Advair, Augmentin and others driving that.</p>
          <p>And our consumer business, I think, frankly, had a spectacular year. 7% up in a year of recession in most economies of the world. 7% up in a marketplace which grew around 2%. We grew market share in almost every segment, with the exception of UK nutritionals. And in America, for example, we increased our oral care, toothpaste market share by over three percentage points. The launch of alli in Europe, first pan-European deregulation by any company, and although launched in only April of 2009, achieved the sales of the third highest selling product in OTC for Europe. So very, very strong performance from Europe which has been continued certainly into January of this year.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of in organic growth, we made it very clear that we would be focused on value-creating bolt-on acquisitions. And during 2009 we in fact executed 11 of those across the business. You can see here a summary of small to medium in all of the key areas we want to focus on. So we make these investments in those businesses we want to drive great growth in: emerging markets, obviously on select areas of the pharmaceutical business, vaccines, and consumer. All of these deals put in place last year.</p>
          <p>We set ourselves disciplined financial metrics. There are lots more deals than this around. We were involved in plenty more but we walked away from a series, particularly in Q4. There was quite a lot of activity around, and our view was that companies were being sold for prices which didn't make economic sense for us.</p>
          <p>Just as an aside, all of the deals on this chart, all of these transactions, we have a projected internal rate of return which exceeds 14% for. So it gives you some idea of the kind of returns that we anticipate in the future that these transactions can generate for the company.</p>
          <p>We're very disciplined financially around this and we're not going to get drawn into buying or bidding up prices on companies. It was an important period at the end of last year to signal to a number of putative sellers that they couldn't necessarily count on GSK to be there at the last round of the auction; they can't. We'll be there if it makes sense for GSK at the right price.</p>
          <p>Let me go into a little bit more detail about the biggest of these acquisitions, which was Stiefel. And I just wanted to take a couple of minutes just to describe to you why, in my view, Stiefel is the right kind of acquisition for GSK. And you've seen the numbers. You've seen the synergies which we can generate. And essentially, we could value &#x2013; we could generate the value of the acquisition through the synergies which were achievable for the business. So we have a lot of opportunity to take cost out of this business. Why do we do that? Why are we confident? Because we're bolting it on to a preexisting dermatology organization. In fact, on a pro forma basis, counting the sales that Stiefel booked before we took control, last year this business combined, GSK dermatology plus Stiefel dermatology, generated sales of over &#xA3;1 billion. It's a big business. You bring these two businesses together, great synergies. We're taking costs out of GSK dermatology and, of course, we're taking costs out of Stiefel as an organization.</p>
          <p>We're well on the way to integration and you can see very substantial amounts of cost synergy coming out of this business in the upper right hand box of this slide. G&amp;A coming down dramatically, not surprisingly. You can bolt on these small acquisitions. This is a marginal increase in activity for our finance organization, the HR organization in GSK. Huge synergy opportunities. Very aggressive chance.</p>
          <p>The area which is much more unusual, and actually was one of the reasons we originally targeted Stiefel, was the opportunity to hit the gross margin. And you'll see here that five out of the six factories that Stiefel ran are already announced for closure. And you might wonder how we can go so quickly to close those plants. I want to explain that to you briefly and I will use a prop for this.</p>
          <p>This is a pack of Eumovate manufactured by Glaxo Dermatology at Barnard Castle, a factory we run in the north of England. In the last two and a half years through a reengineering of the process of that plant we were able to increase efficiency at that factory by 40%. By increasing the efficiency of the factory by 40%, that factory without any new investment can absorb 55% of all of Stiefel's volume. So we were able to eliminate essentially an entire fixed asset base and draw all that volume in to spare capacity that we'd created in GSK. What that's allowing us to do is not just take synergy from the obvious SG&amp;A lines of the Stiefel P&amp;L, but also from the cost of goods line, very unusual to do. Very hard to get at so quickly, and that's on that level why we're so confident we can generate very rapid improvements in the margin of Stiefel. Right now, very hard to see because of all of the puts and takes in the acquisition year, but roughly the margin when we bought Stiefel of that business, about 20%. And what you can see, it's going to very dramatically improve.</p>
          <p>What we also believe, unusually with an acquisition like this, is that we have the chance to now globalize a portfolio of products. So this speaks very much to a global footprint company acquiring a business which for whatever reason had been resource constrained, had never commercialized. No Stiefel products in Japan. No Stiefel products in China. No Stiefel products in India. That clearly is an agenda for us to move forward.</p>
          <p>There are synergies in terms of how we develop our compounds. Now, obviously GSK had over time not prioritized dermatology development of a series of assets. Now, by retaining an R&amp;D focus from Stiefel on dermatology, we can restart that effort to find new assets.</p>
          <p>And the final area is that we intend to create a fourth platform for our consumer business. Within Stiefel there is a big chunk of pharmaceutical business but there are also a tremendous portfolio of straight consumer dermatology brands which have never really been commercialized as a true consumer business through a professional consumer organization. So in future, our intention, alongside nutritionals, oral care, OTC, is to build up now a consumer dermatology platform to our consumer business.</p>
          <p>So what you have in this acquisition is a multi-pronged approach to extract value from the transaction, which was initially justified simply on the cost synergy that was achievable. That's the kind of acquisition we like to find. They're not easy to find. There aren't many around, but when we can find them, we're prepared to go and win them.</p>
          <p>Now I want to move on now to more generalized set of comments about how we think about cost and capital allocation and simplifying our business. And I'm going to start by focusing on R&amp;D, not least because we've made announcements today on some further changes in terms of where we intend to invest in R&amp;D.</p>
          <p>Before I go into that detail, I really want to make a couple of comments about our overall strategy in R&amp;D. This slide you've seen before. Moncef Slaoui presented this slide. It captures exactly the themes on which we focus in how we want to develop our R&amp;D capability. We want to focus on the best science. We want to bring &#x2013; re-personalize R&amp;D, bring the individual, not the process, back into discovery. We want to diversify our efforts through greater externalization. And we're focused on improving the return on investment. None of that has changed. In fact, nothing in the GSK strategy has changed as a consequence of the announcements made today. We're extremely, extremely positive about the way things are going. And I'll show you a little bit why.</p>
          <p>This gives you a sense of the progression of our delivery from R&amp;D, a whole raft of products. This is why we have the highest number of approvals from FDA over the last three years. And if I project forward just another year, what might we have over the last year and a half. Another six molecules. And it's interesting, if you look at this tall, bright bar, there are actually 21 novel small chemical entities, all biopharmaceuticals, all vaccines, 21. And remember, this company didn't launch a single novel molecule between 1998 and 2007. So a huge shift in terms of the delivery of pipeline.</p>
          <p>Of course, what this requires is tremendous changes in commercialization approaches, how do we tackle specialist markets, all of those things. But the flow of product which is coming through is clearly demonstrating a huge shift in capability. The performance of the R&amp;D company has been extremely positive, all the way from our discovery performance units which are all up and running, all the way through development.</p>
          <p>Can we expect more? I believe we can. So if I just look at a snapshot of the performance card that I look at for our R&amp;D organization, this shows you what 2009 looked like. How many approvals, how many filings, how many key Phase III starts, how many first time in humans? Now, you know I never talk to you about anything before Phase III. I'm not going to change that commitment today. But I think it's worthwhile every few years just letting you know that actually beneath the surface is a tremendous amount of progression in terms of activity.</p>
          <p>What's critical is that nowhere are we paying anybody just for numbers. We will pay people for quality. What does quality mean? It means differentiated medicines of value to patients and to payors. That's why the payment system of bonuses in our R&amp;D organization has in it a trigger which is associated with reimbursement. So the R&amp;D team cannot get their maximum bonuses simply by churning out files or simply by progressing molecules. They have to deliver molecules which ultimately get reimbursed, which is clearly the measure of value for money in today's society.</p>
          <p>So, great that we've got activity. What's more important is that activity is focused on delivering quality. That's why during 2009 we terminated at least six programs of drugs which had nothing wrong with them. They were perfectly safe as far as we could see. They had activity in the disease area. We just didn't believe we could differentiate them. And we weren't going to carry on spending money on them simply to generate a product where we fail to get reimbursement. That is evidence of the focus on quality in the business.</p>
          <p>How might we drive greater returns inside our R&amp;D organization? Well, we can shift more of the activity to late-stage development, because that's where value is really created. If we've got more going on in the late stage, it means we're really bringing product to the marketplace, not just spinning our wheels going around hypothesis after a hypothesis. And you can see in the first left-hand box, big shift over the last several years of resources from the early phase, conceptual research to late-phase full development.</p>
          <p>We can do more with external partners. And, again, you can see this is not something we're talking about for the first time that we might do in the future. It is something that is fundamentally part of our organization. And you can see the number of projects in the middle box which are now executed with external partners.</p>
          <p>We want to grow biopharmaceuticals because we know that the run-out period of returns on those molecules are likely to be higher than small molecules. As I've said to you already, 19% of our clinical pipeline is now biopharm, excluding vaccines, and you can see here the number of biopharmaceutical molecules which have now been brought through.</p>
          <p>I've talked to you already about how we focus on differentiation and it's clear that we want to drive more efficiency. And I'll give you some examples of that in a second. Before that, just to remind you where our externalization network is at, this is a slide I showed you last year. 34 or so external engines. We now have 47 external engines. And you can see here a raft of the deals we've done during the year. I think the company continues to be a very strong believer in the merits of this. It's not just about numbers, it's about diversity of approach. Tapping into research teams which have a fundamentally different thought process than our own gives us more probability of hitting a win.</p>
          <p>What this has done is actually replaced quite a bit late-stage licensing. So rather than chasing around after the one or two assets which are out there &#x2013; we go for them sometimes, but generally those things have not proven to be so productive for us. What this has given us is low-cost optionality over a huge amount of potential product flow. The most recent one of which came through positively was the Crohn's disease program from ChemoCentryx which we optioned in just after Christmas.</p>
          <p>So externalization is really a feature of the way we run this business and there are certain DPUs in GSK who have elected to spend up to or even in some cases more than half of their resources on external collaborations. Very interesting, because what that's telling you is that the researchers are saying, I'll take the money I have got from GSK and rather than pay for GSK sciences and GSK labs, I want to use that money with an external partner. Really shows an open-mindedness to chase the best science which is what we're trying to encourage.</p>
          <p>I'm going to move on now to efficiencies. So from one part of the R&amp;D framework of discovery and invention to a second, which is now we've got the product, how do we do this at a lower cost? And this is again an area where we've made, I believe, very, very strong progress over the last couple of years. And this slide simply lists for you a few examples of how we're trying to change the way we spend money in this part of the business. It's obvious to everybody this consumes enormous amounts of resources. And you may look at some of these things and say, God, that's very simple. How obvious is that? But you can imagine when you're talking about, as we are at GSK, having 40,000 patients in clinical trials, just in pharmaceuticals, excluding vaccines. How you make a performance change across 40 countries. How you get those kind of improvements in performance. They're not trivial operational challenges.</p>
          <p>What this shows you is we're making great strides. Very obvious stuff. How many sites only ever recruit zero patients after you've spent all the money to initiate the site? Used to be 29% of the sites, now it's 19. Huge benefits. Can we save money by not oversupplying clinical trial materials that aren't ultimately used? Yes. In fact, over the last two or three years we've saved over $100 million. Can we be more focused in where we do our research? Yes. By reducing our clinical trial footprint. Can we get things more consolidated and go quicker? Yes. You can see from Syncria that we're far ahead of schedule because of the approach we've taken in simplifying and consolidating our research planning.</p>
          <p>All of these are just very simple examples, but you can imagine, just by that $120 million price tag in the middle, each one of these apparently minor twitches of the dial generates huge dollars. And that's why we're able to keep the same 30 drugs in full development and deliver the filings and approvals without massively increasing our R&amp;D spend. We spend today, roughly-roughly, the same amount we spent three, four years ago, adjusted for inflation. And yet we're churning out a substantially greater amount of product because of these sorts of disciplines in the organization.</p>
          <p>Now let me move on to what we've announced today, which really speaks to how we can go further in terms of tackling our return on investment in R&amp;D.</p>
          <p>The strategy I believe is the right strategy. It's delivering but we should never become complacent about driving up returns. Just a couple of facts &#x2013; or a couple of dimensions to think about. First of all, about a third of our R&amp;D cost is in fixed infrastructure. What does that mean? January the 1st, the first scientist walks through the door, turns on the lights and a third of the costs are incurred for the entire company. Because it's buildings, it's all that fixed infrastructure. It's a huge overhang from the 1980s. Today, if we started again, would we all go around building massive research centers? I don't think we would because we want to see a more flexible, a more virtual, a more engaged, diversified research collaborative environment. But we have these enormous research centers; that's what's driving our fixed infrastructure in many instances. So can we do something about that?</p>
          <p>Secondly, if we look across all the diseases we're active in, where are we in terms of risk and return? So in terms of the cost of being successful versus the probability of success, have we got outliers where, frankly, the right decision is to say, right now, this isn't the place for us to be focused. Doesn't mean we could never win, but probability is we won't. And that's why today we've made announcements associated with proposals subject to consultation to reduce our research activity in the neuroscience area.</p>
          <p>So what this means is we'll be proposing to cease research in areas such as depression, in pain, anxiety et cetera. Of course, we'll continue in areas such as Alzheimer's, other neurodegenerative conditions. The point here is that we've identified those first set of neuroscience diseases as ones where we believe, for various reasons I'm happy to get into if you wish, where we believe the probability of success is relatively low. We think the cost of achieving success is disproportionately high. And it so happens that that research activity underpins some pretty substantial fixed infrastructure. By disinvesting from this area we're able to significantly reduce our exposure to fixed infrastructure costs. About &#xA3;250 million in total, releasable over the next three years. 70% of that we intend to deploy back to the bottom line. About a third re-invested. You saw today we announced creation of a rare disease initiative. That's where some of that money is going to go. But the majority of it coming to the bottom line. And what this is about is finding a clear opportunity where we can target a change in activity without changing the strategy and significantly improve the return of the operation.</p>
          <p>Let me go to a general point about returns. I think I'm probably talking to a room full of people who are completely convinced that the return rate of the pharmaceutical industry's R&amp;D engines over the last 15 years has been less than optimal. And I don't know what number you would pick, but if you look at the work that McKinsey did, they basically assessed industry return on investment in pharmaceuticals published last year, and they estimate about 7%. 7% internal rate of return.</p>
          <p>We've looked to all of our activities with our current late-stage pipeline &#x2013; so those products we've just launched and those that we are imminently to launch &#x2013; and we've basically tried to assess what we believe our current internal rate of return is. And we believe it sits around 11% across our organization. Now, of course, this is subject to all those future sales which will come in over the next 20 years &#x2013; very long forecasts, and it's subject to a view of how we allocate resources. And I think in the back of your pack there's a page which gives you a little bit more detail of the methodology, which I'm not going to go through. But our view today is that our internal rate of return is about 11%. We believe we can improve that. And so we set for ourselves an aspiration to improve that 11% by another 25%, to somewhere in the order of 14%, over the next few years. And that's where we'd like to go. And that's why we're so focused on trying to drive all those things I've just talked to you about in R&amp;D. Better quality decisions, focus in areas where we have the best chance of winning, making sure we're efficient, and making sure that organization continues on a steady-state basis to generate the outputs that we've been seeing. I think we're well on the way, as this indicates, to that.</p>
          <p>Now, let me move onto other areas of where we spend money in the organization. Cost control and thoughtful allocation of resources is really a key dimension of how we're running the business in GSK.</p>
          <p>Let me go to SG&amp;A first of all. Thought it would be interesting just to give you a sense over the last couple of years of how we've been moving our resources around. We've obviously been restructuring the business and we've taken a lot of money away from our legacy businesses, particularly in Western Europe, particularly in America, and we've redeployed them into our emerging markets. And you can see here the amount of resource which has grown over the last several years in terms of allocation to our emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Just as an anecdote, nothing more than that, it's interesting that for the very first time, December 2009, we employed more representatives outside of America and Europe than we did inside of America and Europe. So gives you just a sense of the reality of the shift of resources in the organization.</p>
          <p>Let me jump to consumer for a second. You can see here, in the consumer there's two parts to this slide. On the left-hand side, incremental advertising, largely funded by savings from within the consumer business. That's been a key priority for us over the last two years. Increase our advertising activity, and also importantly, increase our spend on innovation. Today we spend about twice as much on consumer R&amp;D as we did when I took over. I believe that's why we've been able to keep some of our biggest brands so current in a period of recession.</p>
          <p>It doesn't matter how much you spend on advertising if the ads are rubbish. So the picture on the right-hand side of this slide simply gives you a sense of how we judge that. So we test every ad for persuasion, for brand recognition, memorability, typical FMCG tests. And you can see that 83% of our ads score in the upper 20% of all ads. Combination of volume, of activity, quality is what's really underpinning consumer. That's why I've been very keen and prepared to continue to invest behind our consumer business. It's why you'll see last year we saw great sales growth but you didn't see parallel profit growth. Why? Because we needed to get that consumer business to the right level of investment. It was the right decision. And even as we went through Q4, we continued to spend that level. I'm delighted we did because we've had a fantastic start in January with our consumer business, even stronger than the performance we saw last year. And I think vindicates the commitment to allocate resources to this part of the business.</p>
          <p>Going forward though, I believe we've got the right kind of level in the equation for the consumer business. And so going forward, I fully expect to see profit growth come alongside sales growth in this business.</p>
          <p>If I look at our emerging markets, though it's probably just &#x2013; talked a little bit more about an increase in SG&amp;A. There you can see it again, increases. Just to show you where they've come from. You can see the effort, the allocation of resources in China, in Russia. Reinvestment behind some legacy products. There's an interesting phenomena in our emerging market business that for a few years some of the products, like Augmentin and Ventolin, hadn't been invested in as well as they should have been. It's been a big shift to try and reverse that trend. And that's why you're seeing a lot of outperformance in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>If we look at now G&amp;A, so moving away from S and focus more on G&amp;A, I just wanted to touch on a couple of areas that we're very focused on. One, is how do we reduce the cost of support or administration for the business. And we have a goal to take out 20% of our costs in this area by the end of 2011. We're already well on the way to that. What does that look like? Centres of Excellence, new systems. We run today something like over 20 back-office finance systems across the world. You can imagine how complex that is to make anything happen. So a lot of standardization and simplification. Creation of Centres of Excellence are real opportunities to drive that across the business. And over time, you'll see us move towards a global business service-type environment which will give us over the next four or five years year-on-year opportunities, I believe, to drive efficiency in this part of the organization.</p>
          <p>We also have real opportunity to further reduce our real estate footprint. And you can see from this slide, over the next few years we expect to exit up to another 11 million square feet, about 13% of our real estate portfolio. That gives us a real chance to reduce our infrastructure costs, at least partially. I've already mentioned some of it in R&amp;D. What it also does is simplify the organization. It allows us to really concentrate our activities in a few places and take away what is clearly a lot of a cost driver.</p>
          <p>One other little example here; we're in the process right now of reducing the people who supply our sites. These are people who do catering, cleaning, all of those things, from 40 to three. And you can see, just doing something like that generates almost &#xA3;100 million of savings. So across the board we're very much focused on how to do that.</p>
          <p>Finally on this piece of the commentary, I wanted to touch on manufacturing. I don't often talk in this group about manufacturing and I think it's something that deserves a little bit of a spotlight because the amount of work that's been going on there over the last several years is quite incredible. Just to give you an orientation, this is our manufacturing network for our consumer and pharmaceutical businesses. Does not include the vaccine business. To give you a sense, vaccines are another 15 factories with another 6,000 people. But everything I'm going to talk about from now on is really about pharma and consumer.</p>
          <p>You can see, spread across the world, 79 sites, over 1,300 brands. We have a massive contract manufacturing network of about 150 suppliers. And this has changed dramatically over the last few years. I think it's also fair to say this benchmarks extremely well against others. So, for example, we run less consumer factories than Reckitt Benckiser, we run about the same total number of factories as the new Pfizer-Wyeth. So if you look across the headlines, they look broadly similar. We continue to look for ways in which we can reduce this footprint. There's been a tremendous number of site exits over the last five or six years and in the future there will be a few but not many. So where the real opportunity now sits is really making sure that we're getting process efficiency into our organization. And there is a huge effort going on across the business.</p>
          <p>I wanted to show you some of the results of that because I think sometimes we haven't necessarily talked as much about this as we should have done. The slide on the left shows you, first of all, what I've just said, number of sites exited over the last few years. The second bar chart shows you remarkable improvement in productivity. So an 80% improvement in productivity per head in the manufacturing organization over the last eight years. And then we've simply taken one product, probably one you're interested in, in terms of what that actually means for cost of goods on a product like Advair, and you can see here, very substantial reduction in costs associated with Advair. How do we do that? Very much grinding through the process. You see on the slide, lean sigma practices, making sure that we've got absolutely the best process in place across all of the lines across the organization, constantly looking to upgrade technologies. That kind of activity is going on across all of our product lines in the business. That's what's allowing us to offset some of this very big margin pressure you've seen in the past from losing the old generic products in America. As that loss of generic products goes away, the negative margin pressure is going to ameliorate significantly and you're going to see benefits come through in terms of these sorts of changes.</p>
          <p>Thought it might be useful just to show you a little bit what this looks like over a life cycle of a product. So how we think about manufacturing, because, again, people tend to be a little bit religious about manufacturing. It's either all in-house or it's all out of house. And the reality is it has to be a bit of both. And we want to be clear about where we believe manufacturing makes sense to be held internally versus done externally. So at the beginning of a product, we truly believe this is where enormous amounts of value, intellectual property and trade secrets are developed. Sometimes those become so important and so pivotal you are never going release them. On others, they don't. You generate them, you generate smooth introduction and then you're fine to disengage.</p>
          <p>So at the beginning, we'll be very engaged around API manufacture. So, for example, in Singapore and Ireland, you'll see the company very active around how we develop the manufacturing technology, using a series of technologies we have as a company. We've driven towards co-location of development and scale-up. And we focus on making sure that the manufacturing people are engaged with R&amp;D to make sure that the production process actually can work in the factories. Quite a novel concept in drug discovery.</p>
          <p>As we move forward into the mid and late stage of the life of a product, then we're going to be much more flexible about how we might operate. So, for example, on products where we don't think there is significant IP, that's when we're going to start to bring in outsourcing and we start to externalize our pipeline. On others, like Advair, nobody's coming anywhere near it. So on that one, completely inside the company, tremendous amount of technology there. We all know how difficult others find it to do what we do. And we focus very much on process improvement. As you get to the end of a product life, then we're looking to essentially externalize the manufacturing supply line and to then consolidate our environment, with only just a few exceptions.</p>
          <p>Now to bring this to life, I thought I'd show you what we're doing with Valtrex. So Valtrex is our most recent product to go to generics. We launched in 1999. I've used percentages rather than pounds per kilogram but, nonetheless, you can see what's happening. You start at the beginning, it costs obviously 100% of the start price in terms of average cost. By 2006 we'd already reduced that cost by 40% by going through the procedures I just described. And today we're at 40% of the price we had back at the beginning in 1999. So a very clear example of the effect of being able to deploy the right manufacturing approach for the right phase of the drug.</p>
          <p>Some of you might wonder, why didn't you give me just the pounds? Why are you making life difficult by having percentages and indexing it, why not just give you the pounds? The reason I'm not giving you the pounds is because the generic manufacturers are interested in buying it from us, and I didn't think we should tell them what our costs were. An interesting notion that the generics would like to buy from us from time to time.</p>
          <p>If we look now, finally, I want to pull together all of this. So we have an organization back to sales growth, strategy working, a series of engines firing for the organization, headwinds diminishing in terms of genericization, and we have an organization focused on appropriate capital deployment and ensuring that we're minimizing our costs. The net of all of that is why I think we're right to be confident about the future prospects of the company.</p>
          <p>If we look at the overall operating margin of the business, which, if you will, is the final bringing together of all of this, there are clearly pressures obviously. As you lose Valtrex, you get some pressure on your margin. Obviously, as we grow consumer, we create pressure on the margin, quite rightly, because we know that business shouldn't be run at the same high margin as historic pharmaceuticals. But we're ready to go for that because we want the growth of profits even though it's at a lower margin.</p>
          <p>On the counterside, you can see the programs we have in place to reduce costs and to reallocate resources rather than just create new spend, is all about how we believe, certainly during 2010, we expect our operating margin to be broadly stable with that of 2009. And Julian will give you a little bit more detail on that.</p>
          <p>So for me to finish, before I hand over to Julian, really just to summarize where we're at. We're back to growth, we've got very effective cost control in this organization, and we have made very strategically coherent decisions about where to divert resources, spend money and, where necessary, increase activity. Our R&amp;D model, in my view, is working, and against all the benchmarks in this industry, I think it's fair to say that we are succeeding in changing R&amp;D. Not withstanding that, we're ready to commit to what we believe a reasonable rate of return ought to be and to do what's necessary to deliver it, as you've seen with the proposals today. And all of that is driven around a commitment to deliver in shareholder value, in terms of the performance of the business and of course in terms of generation of cash, and then ultimately dividend increases to our shareholders, which, again, I was delighted we were able to increase by 7% this time for our shareholders</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll hand over to Julian. He'll take you through the detail of 2009.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Andrew, and good afternoon. I will, as always, talk about performance excluding restructuring costs and I'll mainly focus on growth at constant exchange rates.</p>
          <p>The chart here summarizes our overall performance. As you can see, turnover was up three and EPS up two for the year. Within EPS we took a gain on the formation of our HIV venture with Pfizer of 296 million. And in the year, we absorbed total legal charges of 591 million as against 611 in the year before. You'll see a strong currency benefit of about 14%. If exchange rates stay roughly where they are now for the rest of this year, which of course is always a false prediction, but nonetheless, if they were to, we'd see about a 1% adverse movement in 2010.</p>
          <p>Notice the free cash flow strong performance there. And if you express free cash flow as a percentage of total earnings after restructuring costs, you come out with a number of 94%. So it's a good performance there.</p>
          <p>This just splits pharmaceutical turnover between pharmaceuticals and consumer. I'm going to cover each in a moment.</p>
          <p>This chart simply shows you the geographic spread of our pharmaceutical business and also includes the consumer healthcare business. I'd make a couple of comments. Firstly, generic competition yet again in 2009 hit the business, particularly U.S. pharmaceuticals and that's the driver of that 13% decline. And equally, we benefited, on the other hand, from flu pandemic and vaccine and Relenza sales, particularly in Europe. So that did &#x2013; both those impacted the results. I think if you look at the chart, an obvious conclusion is the investment, the diversified GSK, is continuing to work. You see great growth from places like emerging markets, up 20%, Japan up 22 and consumer up 7%. As Andrew said, consciously we invested significantly in our consumer business to drive that growth in what couldn't be described as a good market.</p>
          <p>This is another way of looking at pharmaceutical turnover, and one which I quite like. Core I'll come back to in a moment. Influenza pulls together flu pandemic vaccine, it includes Relenza and it actually includes annual flu sales as well. So you can see there the significant increase in sales in that category. Avandia has been a decline each year for the last few years, albeit though that that decline rate is now moderating under 16% in 2009. And then products impacted by generics, the impact is clear from the slide, continues to be significant in 2009. Overall, you get a growth of about 2%. And included within that obviously was the Stiefel acquisition which contributed sales of 248 million together with other acquisitions which I think added another 130 million.</p>
          <p>If you look at core plus influenza, that plus 12%, what the next chart does is summarize where that comes from. Advair growth was up 1% in the U.S., up 5% in Europe, up 23% in the rest of the world. Japan did very well, up 79% to 195 million. If you look at vaccines, that clearly got flu pandemic within it. If you strip it out, growth was about 2%. Good performances from Synflorix, Rotarix, Cervarix, but we lost sales with Infanrix and our hepatitis franchises, particularly in the U.S. where we were under increased competitor pressure.</p>
          <p>If you look at that chart, you can see three products all with sales around 500 million &#x2013; four products actually, all growing strongly, including Lovaza which grew at 31%. And then at the bottom, you see a tranche of products growing about 1%, 8.9 billion of them. And that, overall, gives you that 12% growth in core and influenza.</p>
          <p>Here's our new products. You saw the same slide with Andrew's chart going back over three years. You can look at it two ways. You can include everything that's new, in which case new products contributed 2.1 billion and was up over 100%. You can exclude the H1N1 new vaccine on the premise that that clearly is going benefit 2010 and 2011, but thereafter is more uncertain. And if you do that exclusion, you get a number of 1.26 billion, up 55%. Both are meaningful statistics.</p>
          <p>So our consumer healthcare business, another great year for consumer healthcare with great brands. If you start on the right and look at OTC medicines, you see a growth of about 8%. Alli, which was launched in Europe successfully this year, grew by over 100%, Panadol up 10%. Within that category &#x2013; you can't see it on the chart, but NRT, smoking replacement therapy, basically declined by about 1% and that's what drives the overall 8% growth for that category.</p>
          <p>Looking at oral care, another tremendous year for Sensodyne, which seems to grow at a good rate pretty much year in, year out, up another 13%. But the category growth, basically constrained by Aquafresh, which fell by 1%. And within Aquafresh, it was the white trays at the premium end of the market that suffered in a clearly more depressed economic environment and that's what gave you overall return of seven.</p>
          <p>Nutritionals, Lucozade, very much impulse product, a classic product that's going to be impacted by recession, and was, down 3%. But Horlicks in India, booming along at 17%, dragging overall nutritional healthcare up by 3%.</p>
          <p>Now the P&amp;L; cost of goods went from 23.7 to 25%, and the next chart will track exactly what happened. First of all, when we lose high margin products to generic competition in both the U.S. mainly and the EU markets, we see a big impact on our cost of goods. It is unavoidable. And you can see that brought the cost of goods margin up 1.2%.</p>
          <p>Regional and product mix, with growth in places like emerging markets, vaccines, consumer healthcare, also pushed the cost of goods margin up. But that was pretty much equally offset by operational excellence restructuring savings. And then within other, it may be 0.1, but actually that includes currency benefit on the one hand, raw material cost increases on the other.</p>
          <p>The thing that interests me on this chart is if you take the 23.7 and pretend for a moment, sadly not true, but pretend for a moment that we hadn't got generic competition, you don't actually see much movement in the cost of goods margin. And I think that's an important message for the future. In terms of 2010, clearly in 2010 we're going to be adversely impacted by Valtrex generics, and we're expecting a margin of around, a cost of goods margin of around 26% in 2010.</p>
          <p>Looking at SG&amp;A, we split SG&amp;A, as you know, for these charts between core and legal. Legal costs for the year were 591 million. If you go back five years and look at legal charges, they range from about 250 million at the lowest to just over 600 million at the highest. And if you take the average, it's about 450 million, so we were at the top end in 2009. Other core SG&amp;A costs, as you see from that chart, moved from 27.7% of sales up to about 30.3. And in the next chart I will track what drove that movement.</p>
          <p>We reinvested all our restructuring savings into our investment markets. One example, we took over 1,200 people out of the sales force in the U.S. and Western Europe. We put over 2,000 into the sales force in the rest of the world, one example, a very conscious strategy to diversify and grow the business by reinvesting savings.</p>
          <p>Stiefel, we acquired Stiefel. It clearly had significant SG&amp;A. We haven't had a chance to synergize the Stiefel SG&amp;A. It had a significantly adverse impact on our SG&amp;A margin. As we move to synergize Stiefel, that will change.</p>
          <p>You'll recall last year that I told you we benefited from exchange gains. Do you remember, I told you that the margin in fact was 27.7% but exchange gains had brought it down from 28.5? In other words, last year we had a 0.8% benefit to margin. This year we've had exchange losses. The net impact on the margin year on year is a 1.2% hit. And finally, I talked to you last year about pension increases driving up SG&amp;A. They have. Looking forward, I anticipate an SG&amp;A margin excluding legal charges of around about 29% for 2010.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D costs, as you can see, were very similar, slightly better than 2009 in this chart. In 2010 I expect R&amp;D cost as a percent of sales to be around about 14% of sales. I'll come back to other operating income in a moment.</p>
          <p>Operating profit margin, if you look at the operating profit margin for 2009, if you exclude the ViiV Healthcare gain and you also exclude the legal charges, you come up with a margin of around I think 33.7. And it's that margin; i.e., the operating profit margin excluding the ViiV gain and excluding legal charges that we expect do be broadly similar in 2010 compared to 2009.</p>
          <p>Now other operating income, this chart summarizes what's in other operating income. We always have a base of around about &#x2013; certainly historically anyway, 300 million of royalty income. And you can see that very clearly in 2009 and in 2008.</p>
          <p>By the way, our focus on divestments is this. If we can sell assets and reinvest the proceeds and make a better return or divest them and quite frankly add shareholder value by divesting them at the right time, we will do so. And in fact, it's part of our strategy. I think any healthy business cuts off and realizes assets at the end of their life cycle, reinvests that money in growing the business in new brands, and we're no different.</p>
          <p>So you see in the green box &#x2013; the green bar, we did significant sales of products, that included Wellbutrin XL that we sold back to Biovail. And we will continue to do that &#x2013; and also some products we sold to Aspen. So we will continue that strategy into 2010 and later. You also see there the gain from the ViiV, from the HIV transaction.</p>
          <p>Now in addition to this, if you look down the P&amp;L, there's 115 million profit from the disposal of shares in Quest, a different part of the P&amp;L. It's still cash, still money, still profit. And if you add that in, you get a figure of about 1.25 billion from asset sales plus a solid base of royalty income.</p>
          <p>Looking at 2010 and comparing it to that 1.25 billion, I expect us to realize about 800 to &#xA3;900 million of profit from a continuation of asset disposals and from clearly continuing to secure royalty income.</p>
          <p>The chart here shows you interest. Remember, in 2008 we were progressing with the share repurchase program. Remember, in 2009 you have the full-year impact in terms of interest on that. And that's one of the reasons for the interest charge rising in 2009. The other reason is that clearly on a lot of deposits that we have, interest rates have fallen significantly. And that also had an impact. That 710 million is a good base to estimate forecast interest charges for 2010.</p>
          <p>This chart, you see the tax rate was actually lower than I anticipated. It came in at 28%. I think that tax rate's going be good for 2010. Looking down that chart you'll see minority interests of 138 million. Just a reminder to you, remember we've now done this HIV joint venture with Pfizer. Remember they have 15% of it. So minority interest will increase in 2010 to reflect that 15% ownership. And at the bottom here you see the EPS of 121.2.</p>
          <p>On the left you see the results excluding restructuring. In the middle you see the restructuring charges for the year of 832 million, lower by &#x2013; the 1.1 billion was the number last year. And you see the total results after deducting restructuring charges of 109.1p compared to 88.6p in the previous year.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow. I'd make a couple of points on this. There was a increase in working capital of 106 million. We did well in 2009. We've got payables up. We've increased our terms. Still very reasonable, but increased our terms. We pay the terms. We generate a lot of cash there. We've done a good job at collecting long outstanding cash and receivables. Made good progress there. And we've made limited but started to make progress in inventory. Were it not for the very high level of flu pandemic receivables in December, at the end of December, and higher inventory levels, that 106 would have been circa five to 600 benefit. Now, clearly, as we go through 2010 we'll expect to continue to see flu pandemic sales, but as we move towards the second half, based on everything we know today, we would expect those to taper off and we would see obviously a comparable benefit in the cash flow as that large receivable at the end of December comes back in. Time will tell. And clearly at the bottom, free cash flow of &#xA3;5.25 billion.</p>
          <p>So what do we to with that 5.25 billion? I think there's a very simple way to look at this chart; it's certainly the way I look at it. With free cash flow we did two things. We paid dividends to our shareholders of 3 billion and we funded 80% of our acquisitions. Being the CFO I'd always like to stand here and tell you we'd funded 100% of our acquisitions, but sadly, we found some further good acquisitions to invest our money in so I wasn't able to meet that marvelous target. But nonetheless, I think it's a pretty powerful point that 80% of our acquisitions were funded out of our own cash flow. Net debt went down but you can see if you look at exchange and other movements, that was driven by currency changes with a lot of our debt denominated in dollars and in euros.</p>
          <p>This is the restructuring program that Andrew talked to you about. This shows the phasing on the left-hand side of the 900 million of restructuring costs. About 70% of those are cash, 30% of those are non-cash. On the right, the phasing of the savings, cumulatively making &#xA3;500 million in 2012. We intend to reinvest 30% of those, let 70% come and drop down to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion, we delivered sales growth of 3% in 2009. We saw significant pandemic-related sales, but actually, thankfully for the investment that the company put in over the last few years, we were able to meet an urgent need for pandemic and will be able to meet future needs if we see pandemics obviously in the future. We've taken additional restructuring. I think it will make us a more efficient business, and it's very focused. And we continue to be a strong cash generator, up 12% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>We recognize that to our investors, the dividend, a sustainable dividend, continues to be absolutely critical. We're very mindful of that and that is reflected in the four pence increase to 61 pence for the year. And just as a reminder to you, we will be disclosing greater P&amp;L detail from our operating segments in 2010. What I mean by that is we'll take you from sales down to operating profit in the same format that we give you for GSK in aggregate. We'll also be providing a memorandum &#x2013; by the way, that's, those segments will also include our HIV business, which will be a separate segment clearly in 2010. And in addition, although not part of our operating segments as defined under international accounting standards, we will be providing you with memorandum information in a slightly similar format in respect to our vaccines business and also our derms business.</p>
          <p>With that, I will hand you back to Andrew. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Andrew, number six. There's a mic &#x2013; oops, you ran right by. Great.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, it's Andrew Baum from Morgan Stanley. Three questions, please. Firstly, now that you have built out, and are continuing to build out, your non-small molecule assets, namely consumer health vaccines, emerging markets, does that help you accelerate the process to reducing your internal research infrastructure in small molecules? So now you have actually got these additional platforms in place and at scale, does that make you more comfortable about pushing a little harder and accelerating the timelines to reducing some of the infrastructure you referred to?</p>
          <p>Second, do you have sufficient BD&amp;L teams in order to take full advantage of external opportunities which exist out there or is that something that you're looking to still bulk up?</p>
          <p>And then finally, could you talk about the broader implications of externalization? Patent boxes are something that have been talked about in UK and many, many other European countries. To what extent does externalization have any impact on more adverse or a less opportunistic tax environment compared to maintaining an internal research presence?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Andrew. I think in terms of the first question, not really a huge link there. I mean, I think that we're really looking &#x2013; obviously we're looking to invest behind where we can drive growth in the business. That's clearly what the emerging market strategy and the like is around. R&amp;D is a closely related but really independent agenda, which is how do we get value out of this organic engine and how do we drive up the return. And I think what we're &#x2013; I think what's made us more confident, if I can use your &#x2013; take your concept, to make those changes is our belief in the progress we're actually making in things like the discovery performance units, our ability to work the external network of discovery organizations. And it's more what's gone well in R&amp;D which has revealed what we can afford to pull back on in R&amp;D rather than &#x2013; so that would be the first part.</p>
          <p>As far as business development and licensing. Well, not to endorse any particular bank, but if you were at the JPM conference in San Francisco, you wouldn't have wondered whether we were short of business development people. I think we had 50 people at that meeting and we did 300 meetings in the three days. So we have a lot of people. I don't think we're short of people, but this, in my view, this is all about having a handful of brilliant people. So we are always looking for whether we can augment that. And so I feel very good that we have the machine. We have some great people in there. But there's no doubt, as we've stepped up both at the corporate level, at the R&amp;D partnering level and even at the VC investment level, we've been looking for and have been securing specific individuals to really strengthen our capacity to get those deals done. So it's not a mass thing, but it's definitely a capability we're focused on building. And I'm sure there's more that we will do there, that we will have more people like that.</p>
          <p>As far as the patent box is concerned, I have to say the UK's announcement to implement the patent box here is probably the single biggest change in our investment planning that we've had for 10 or 15 years. Completely changed where we think we would build major new facilities, particularly manufacturing facilities. And I think what it also drives is where you think about licensing in intellectual property to, so which entity is going to become the owner. So to some degree the patent box doesn't inhibit what you might do in terms of externalization but it makes you think very carefully about which entity goes into the agreement with the partner because you need to think very carefully where you want the patent to be held or the IP to be licensed to downstream for when the profit flows start to be generated.</p>
          <p>So first thing I say is the patent box is enormously positive for GSK. Secondly, it's going be positive for the UK because it's going to drive our investment decisions. And thirdly, it just requires us to think &#x2013; we need to be thoughtful right at the beginning of a partnership, about which part of GSK licenses the IP.</p>
          <p>Next question, Graham, down at the front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Graham Parry from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. I've got a couple of questions on the R&amp;D and productivity improvements that you talked about. First of all, you talk about on your 11% calculation in the back of the slide, I did take a quick peek, about using industry-standard attrition rates. I was just wondering what those attrition rates are and what is the source. Are we using more recent or are we going back to Tufts University studies from 2001?</p>
          <p>And then secondly on the improvement to 14% from 11%, what is it that you see driving that? Is it really lowering your R&amp;D cost or is it actually that you see higher value in the molecules that are coming through in development? So is it the cost or the return part of the equation?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, a question on guidance for 2010; I'm just wondering, a question for Julian, how we should think about legal going into 2010. So is there anything in the impairments or the adjustments that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2009 that would imply they should continue into 2010? And on the other operating income line of the eight to 900 million, how much of that do you expect to be divestment gains?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't you answer the guidance questions and I'll address the R&amp;D ones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In terms, Graham, of the eight to 900 million, I expect about 300 million to be royalties roughly, and so the rest would be divestment gains. And maybe there may be a certain small offset in terms of impairments, although, as you saw, we took some pretty hefty impairments this year. There's not much value left to be impaired. So that's an overall &#x2013; it's rather a sad comment really, isn't it? It does show there's potential for the future. So that hopefully answers that question. Sorry, your other one was?</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Yes, just the legal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the legal, yes, I mean, look, you can't predict legal charges, clearly. We progress with our cases looking to settle them. Clearly, if we can settle them at a reasonable figure, if not, we go to litigation. All these things takes time. I think all I can guide you to is that we have a historic range between 250 and 600 with an average of about 450. I think that's probably the only information I can give you. But you can't predict them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in terms of your first couple of questions, Graham. In terms of where we get the attrition rates from, we calculate what we think the industry attrition rates are. They're very similar to the kind of surveys you describe. The reason we're doing that is we're not building in here some big assumption that we can massively change attrition rates. That's really the point here that we're not loading the future or the assessment by some belief that we're going to be &#x2013; and actually our attrition rates over the last four or five years have been quite similar to industry rates. It's an area to improve, but it's not one that today I'm going to stand here and say we've found the magic bullet.</p>
          <p>In terms of why, how we get to 14, it's basically both. So it's an aspiration to improve from where we are, and clearly both dimensions are important. So you've seen today announcements &#x2013; or proposals to reduce our cost of R&amp;D, particularly around fixed infrastructure. Clearly that has an impact on potential returns, but obviously also the potential sales forecasts which will be driven by greater differentiation is the other side of the equation. It's clearly both and that's what we're focused on at both ends of the equation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just one other point. I know it's probably obvious to you, but just in case it isn't, the impairments I was talking about are equity impairments which are a line on other operating income. Clearly if we have any impairments in respect of R&amp;D assets, in-licensed assets, they fall as an R&amp;D charge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alexandra, you had a question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually four. The first question is &#x2013; sorry, it's a boring question about FX, but you had a &#x2013; I've just been trying to get my head around this. You had a 4% FX benefit on the sales but that turned into what looks like a 10 or probably slightly lower hit on the bottom line. And I understand there has been the swing factor from having exchange losses this quarter and gains in the quarter last year, which is about a 6% swing factor. Can you just run us through the P&amp;L where the negative effect comes from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. It really does look odd, doesn't it, in the fourth quarter. And it actually looked odd last year. You've got these exchange gains and losses that have a significant &#x2013; I think it's about 8 or 9%, in terms of the quarter four EPS movement doesn't affect sales at all. That's the first point.</p>
          <p>The second point, which is a more complicated one, is the fourth quarter is always a catch-up. Remember we use average rates for the whole year, so there is a catch-up in the fourth quarter to average everything out at that final average rate, which does have an effect.</p>
          <p>Finally, what I always do, and I do it myself at the end of the year, is I look at the full year, see our actual rate differential and I use that simple ready reckoner we gave you. If you use that for the full year, it all works pretty perfectly. Actually the thing to remember when you do that ready reckoner for the full year, is you've got to take that exchange gain/loss impact out of the AR CER growth, which brings you down to the level we saw for the full year. So that's the answer. If you need any more...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>He's available later if you want more on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I will have to think that through, thank you. The other questions are simpler. Firstly just looking on R&amp;D, when I look at the new restructuring program, you're telling us 250 million savings, 70% coming through to the bottom line. But before that, you have broadly been guiding to we should think about R&amp;D being pretty flat going forward. So does it mean it's now going to decline? Or is that actually going to be reinvested into non-pharma R&amp;D as in consumer or vaccine R&amp;D?</p>
          <p>Third question is on the divestment gains. You gave guidance for this year, but you also said it's going to continue beyond 2010. And I know you can't predict them going forward, but it is about a 5% or so swing factor on your earnings. So maybe you can suggest a similar range which we should use going forward for the legal charge maybe.</p>
          <p>And the final question is just on the &#x2013; you were talking about the internal rate of return in the 2009 acquisition being 14%. You also said that Stiefel is the largest part of &#x2013; has been the largest acquisition and you have just found &#x2013; after the acquisition was done, you're finding significant sales synergies from globalizing to sales and from tapping the OTC potential of those brands. So I was just wondering what the 14% would have been before you found those sales synergies. Obviously trying to find out what's the real hurdle rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of when we look at a transaction before we start, we're basically looking for transactions where we can get to at least a three-year return on invested capital of about 8% right now, and that actually is quite challenging in that there's a lot of transactions flying around where you can't get to 8% ROIC at year three. Now, you might argue in some parts that if we were looking at an emerging economy business we'd probably be looking at more like we want something like 11 or maybe even more than that to recognize the increased risk around those businesses. So in terms of upfront hurdle rate type analysis, then that would be the kind of numbers we're looking for.</p>
          <p>In terms of Stiefel, we've shown you where we're at today. A lot of what I've talked to you today is in terms of where we're going. Well, I think we'll drive up the return on that transaction. So I think that transaction will continue to improve. And what I also said was all the ones on this slide are at least 14. I didn't say which one each individual one was. And I didn't say they were all 14. So don't miss that either.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me ask the question another way then. Finding these sales synergies, has that been a key driver of that 14% or is it a minor thing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Particularly the consumer synergies is not a key driver of whatever the return is for Stiefel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Which means that the globalization which could be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Globalization and the cost synergies were always part of the thought process of acquiring Stiefel. Consumerization is something we've really started to focus on since we made the decisions to go forward. So it has enhanced our confidence we can drive greater returns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To answer your question another way, the bulk of the drive of the value in Stiefel was the existing business combining it with ours, and there were some sales synergies within it. And it was a contributor but not a material contributor. It was driven by those cost synergies which were very significant because of the manufacturing, because of the administration gains by combining the two business. And naturally, we're always when we're looking at investment, although we believe in sales synergies, we're much more skeptical about them than we are about cost synergies. So it was the strong cost synergies that really reinforced our view that from a &#x2013; forgetting about strategy &#x2013; but from the financial point of view this was a good deal. Clearly from a strategic point it was.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, look. You'd expect me to say I won't guide you to 2011, and obviously you'd be right. But there's going to be &#x2013; look, we seem to have had a steady royalty income. Of course, it moves around. I can't predict it, but 275, 300, 325. It depends on what happens to the products that we get royalties from. But it's a pretty steady earner, pretty steady earner. I can't recall a year where we haven't sold assets, divested assets in a sense to shake the tree, dropping the low hanging, the fruit that's delivering lower returns, products at the end of their life or a product where somebody can do a better job than we can. And I think that will go on. I can't give you a number, but again, I think if you look back in the past, you will see a pretty &#x2013; we do disclose what this is every year &#x2013; are pretty steady. If you look at the past, I think that's a bad predictor for the future if you look back and take an average.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as far as R&amp;D is concerned, I'd make a couple points. First of all, I've always said we're not a slave to a certain percentage of sales or a certain level of R&amp;D. That has never been part of our thinking. We should be very much in my view allocating R&amp;D resource to where we believe we can generate superior returns, right, the best return.</p>
          <p>All else being equal, based on what we see today, the announcement we're making today would lead you correctly to believe that R&amp;D spend will come down in the future. Not by a massive amount because obviously this is a portion of the total. However, if there were great opportunities, so if we, I don't know, tomorrow morning we have an opportunity to license in an asset which we have to pay the Phase III program for, then obviously we're going to take that opportunity. But all else being equal, absolutely right, we'd expect the savings which we're talking about here to drop down to the bottom line; and as a result, you'd see a reduction in our pharma R&amp;D activity, absolutely.</p>
          <p>Next question; yes, Jeff, I think isn't it over there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. It's Jeff Holford from Jefferies, two questions. Firstly on H1N1 orders in 2010, just wondering what level of visibility you have so far on the sort of similar levels versus last year. And so what percentage you have very good line of sight on being delivered already for this year.</p>
          <p>And then just secondly, as you continue to externalize on some of these projects coming to maturity as well, at what stage and what aspects do you think about in terms of re-internalizing some of those assets given that potentially become less efficient as you have to split marketing on co-promotion deals et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question. As far as H1N1 is concerned, we have very good visibility of contractual position. That doesn't mean to say that that will never change. So there's no certainty that a government isn't going to come back tomorrow morning or in three weeks time and say we want to have another conversation. So I'm not going to pretend that these things are absolutely bulletproof because you're talking about working with very key customers on our whole business and their needs change and we have to work with them on it.</p>
          <p>But much of that conversation has already happened and we have very good visibility, and January was a very busy shipping month for vaccine for H1N1. So we have good visibility. Shipments have been very busy. And I'm happy with the steer we've given you in terms of being able to deliver about the same this year as last year. If that changes, we'll let you know, just as we've let you know. I think we've bent over backwards to try and be pretty real-time in terms of giving you a sense of where this was going up and then as it has plateaued, what it's looking like.</p>
          <p>In terms of re-internalizing external partnerships, it's probably the most elegant way I've heard somebody ask that question in quite a long time. So it's not intuitively what we want to do actually. So if you look at the overall strategy of what we're doing, obviously partnership is a really big part of what we're about, and it's how we're able to leverage a lot of discovery activity without consuming huge P&amp;L resources. So it has given us a huge potential of diverse research without necessarily having to commit too much.</p>
          <p>Not every partner wants to be bought, right, and so it's very important that philosophically we don't get ourselves into a position where we eat our partners the minute we feel peckish. And it's really not the way we're going to go. Could it happen? Yes, it could happen. But it's not a philosophical approach we want to take. And I have to say that on most of the partnerships we have which have progressed to a point where you might have this thought in your mind, we have a pretty healthy share of the economics. And it's not obvious that it's the right thing to do. So I can't be more specific than that, Jeff, but it's not a philosophical direction of travel that we're revved up on.</p>
          <p>Next question. Yes. Absolutely. Thanks.</p>

          <p>And also for Julian, just in terms of CapEx in the longer term. You've got this mix of outsourcing and insourcing, manufacturing and R&amp;D as well as the mix of emerging markets coming in.

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So on the first one, Michael, I don't look stressed today, do I? No. So I'm actually &#x2013; I think we've made a lot of progress in the last six or eight months on the simplification agenda, particularly around system selection and standardization, particularly around in our simplification of our above-country operations, so what we want to get done outside of the subsidiary versus what we want to get done inside. There's a lot of work still to go, but I think we have got a very highly agreed actually roadmap of where we're going in terms of systems, in terms of global business services, in terms of service levels, in terms of the resources we're going to need or not need going forward. So I think a lot of execution to get done and a lot of obviously therefore the benefits to flow, but I think we've broken the back of the architecture of what we want and I feel pretty good about that actually. So no, I'm feeling okay about that.</p>

          <p>The next two or three years we've been running at about 5% of sales, 6% of sales, around about 1.4, 1.5 billion, putting a lot of money into vaccines in terms of new products. Rough estimate as we sit here today, around that level, maybe a bit more, maybe a bit less. Not dramatically different over the next two to three years. There will come a point though where we reach that position in vaccines where we have established that new manufacturing base. Then I'd like to think we can bring it down. But as of today, over the next few years, I think around about the one and a half level is probably as good a steer as I can give you.</p>

          <p>Hi. It's Naresh Chouhan from ICAP, just a couple of questions on emerging markets, please. You've obviously ramped up the investment in SG&amp;A in emerging markets. When do you feel you'll have sufficient scale there to be able to stop the investment ramp-up?</p>
          <p>And secondly, can you give us some sense of your market share in the BRIC countries and where you think this investment can get you to here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great questions. So we're continuing to scale up, but it's beginning to differentiate across the world. So in, for example, Middle East, North Africa, we're getting very close to where we need to be. We're continuing to build up in China, although in a very not in a nuts way, in a pretty gradual way. Keeping control of your operations in China is not a trivial proposition, and so that it's happening in a relatively gradual way. LatinA, you'll see things build up in. So there will be some patterns around the place. But probably the biggest part of the surge has happened rather than to come.</p>
          <p>In terms of market shares, it varies around the world. So again, MENA, Middle East-North Africa, we're running around 9 &#x2013; 10% market share. If you go to India, we're the second biggest pharmaceutical company in India after Ranbaxy-Daiichi, probably running there around a 5 &#x2013; 5.5% share, something like that. China, we're much lower, and LatinA we're much lower. And so we want to obviously grow in all those markets. We definitely need to do some catch-up in LatinA. I think China we're on the right course, a very strong growth performance in China last year. LatinA, for me, is a kind of still little bit needs some attention.</p>
          <p>Where do we want to go long run? We want to grow faster than the market in the emerging market region that we describe, and that's the goal. So we intend to grow share and obviously we're going to need to do it in places like LatinA, China, and to some degree, India. But India we're already huge. It's a question of really what is a realistic growth rate. Thank you.</p>
          <p>Yes, please. Yes.</p>

          <p>Gbolahan Amusa, UBS, another question on R&amp;D, this time from the cost side. The data you gave was pretty interesting. To what extent does it reflect outperformance for Glaxo or a general trend in the industry in terms of zero patient recruitments, recruitments per sites, et cetera?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on Advair IP, I notice that there has been a Citizen's Petition since the last set of results. To what extent is that beholden to new rules on timing from the FDA versus having some exceptions because there is a device involved here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As far as R&amp;D performance, I don't know how well the other companies are doing. Our sense is that the kind of level of focus that we have on really turning those points of efficiency all up and down the activity set of R&amp;D is probably rare if not unique. So I can't guarantee that it's not happening on this scale. We have a huge program across R&amp;D where we're focused on essentially taking a lot of the practice &#x2013; and this is in development, a lot of the practices which we've test driven and has helped us a lot in manufacturing and applied it into our R&amp;D development teams. A lot of it's around Lean Sigma. And the key with Lean Sigma, as you well know, is not that it's a great idea and it makes sense. The question is can you get 100 teams to do it parallel or is it just going be one or two people do it and everybody else carries on like they were. So it's really about how you get that scale of impact.</p>
          <p>We have a series of these programs. In fact, I sponsor personally the development cost reduction program in the company. So what that means is we have a team of people led by two of our Senior Vice Presidents who are looking, working with every single development team in the company. And they work together, multiple team, individual team, looking at every single piece of their program for how they could do better compared to other best performers in the company and other best-in-class.</p>
          <p>To my knowledge, there has never been so far in the last 16 months a single intervention like that which has not reduced the cost of the program being reviewed. So even the teams that come in and say we're bulletproof, there's nothing you can teach us, we know everything; even those teams have &#x2013; and who were genuinely very good, not just deluded &#x2013; even those teams found money. And the great thing is, they then come out of those sessions telling everybody else you've got to get in this room. Because you get in this room, they're going to find money, going to find ways to go quicker. And that's what's really about culture changing R&amp;D, just as repersonalizing discovery, taking accountability for corporate resources in development is all about culture. And changing the culture on those two dimensions is huge in terms of driving performance and efficiency and returns for the organization. So it's I think a very healthy program. It is very well endorsed by people in the organization, and it's making a big difference.</p>
          <p>As far as Advair IP is concerned, listen, we put the citizen's petition in there. It wasn't triggered by anything other than we wanted to get a message in, if you will, or a statement in that we want people to be judged &#x2013; we want to be judged with others on a level playing field. And so what that was all about was simply saying here's the dimensions on which we think any potential or putative product needs to be judged. And it's pretty &#x2013; there was a lot of those levels. So there's no special trigger, circumstance, rationale for it other than we wanted that to be understood and recognized early. And that's why we did it.</p>

          <p>Yes, Savvas Neophytou, Panmure Gordon. I have two questions. The first one relates to the AdCom on LABAs on the 10th of March. Have you been asked to present on any specific requests by the FDA to run Phase IV programs, even on products that are already on the market? And if you have or if there is that scope, is that affecting your decision on when you initiate Phase III trials for the Horizon program?</p>
          <p>And the second question is a philosophical one, if you like, but you're exiting a large part of neuroscience. I assume from your presentation, subject to consultation, that perhaps one of the sites might close, some relocation et cetera, et cetera. Can you maybe paint a picture here of how you aim to do that? Will it just be put a lock and walk away from that, or are you looking to maybe put some of the assets together and spin it out or sell some of the IP? How do you propose to go about doing that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Listen, two good questions. As far as the AdCom is concerned, the AdCom is focused on what if any safety studies ought to be done for marketed products. Whether that's ultimately the full scope of the AdCom, we'll have to wait and see. As you know, it was only just announced a few days ago. We haven't been asked to do anything specifically at this point. Obviously, we have on opinion. It's not an easy question to answer. Remember, we've had a series of AdComs on this class of products. You'll remember that Advair I think was the only product at the last AdCom to have a unanimous vote of support from the advisory board. And it's not a trivial question to how do you disprove the possibility of this event when it's so rare. So we'll have to see how that goes.</p>
          <p>As far as where we are in terms of starting Horizon asthma, we're in the final discussions with FDA on that. We're ready to go on it. We need to decide whether we wait for the AdCom or not. We'll make that decision as we go through the next few weeks, but no substantive news on that to be honest with you.</p>
          <p>In terms of potential scale down of sites or exit of sites, I'm just going to be a little bit reticent here. This is &#x2013; we're only just telling &#x2013; literally, we're telling our employees while we've been sat in this room. So I'm just going to be a little bit reticent on that for the benefit of them. But obviously we're going to be looking forward to working with unions and employee representatives to come up with whatever is the best outcome that we possibly can. But beyond that, I'm just going to leave it there because it's important we have those conversations with our employees first.</p>
          <p>Yes, please, then this maybe is the last question.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Justin Smith from JPMorgan. I've just got two questions. The first question, Andrew, about 18 months ago you gave some interesting anecdotes on the cost of goods line that the pharmaceutical business could learn a lot from the consumer business. So I'm just interested to get your thoughts on why with a new 500 million sterling program there aren't some cost of goods synergies in there or there's addition on top of the 500.</p>
          <p>And then the second question with regards to when you slowed down the pace of the share buyback. Just wanted to really get your thoughts with regards to ranking the organization since then. Are you kind of happy with the deal making that's been done? Could there be room for improvement? I know the world has changed but just wanted to get some thoughts there as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question. CGS, actually, the reason why &#x2013; so you end up with big restructuring charges in CGS when you close factories to release cost. We've kind of done that now. We've got one or two sites which we're winding out and that's part of the current 1.7 billion restructuring program. But actually, what's much more &#x2013; I'm much more excited about now is you're seeing these literally product after product be reassessed for process efficiency. And so actually we've got some significant efficiencies built into our future five years from manufacturing. But it's not going to require huge amounts of upfront write-offs, which actually is very positive.</p>
          <p>So the agenda for manufacturing, if anything, is more constructive to the profitability of the company and it's not costing huge amounts of money to access it. And the amount of &#x2013; and you're right, there's lots of lessons, just as I've said, there's lessons from R&amp;D to learn from manufacturing and there are certainly lessons from consumer to pharma.</p>
          <p>So to give you an example, we're part of what's called the POBOS benchmarking study, which is a McKinsey pan-pharma consumer benchmarkers there. And we have I think 10 of our 11 pharma &#x2013; or 10 of our pharma sites are in the top quartile of all &#x2013; sorry, 10 of our consumer sites are in the top quartile of all consumer factories. So we've got fabulous efficiencies in consumer. And it's exactly what's going on in those sites which has been shared into pharma along with lean sigma approaches. Along with, frankly, we launched Ventolin in 1969, surely something's changed since then which could allow us to be even more efficient. I mean, just simple, obvious statements of fact.</p>
          <p>So that's the kind of place you're going to see. And it's why Julian was right when he said net, net, net, the negative on the margin is all to do with the loss of high gross margin product in the U.S. But actually there's so much going on in the CGS line that all the other things have been offset by efficiencies which have been delivered. So as those U.S. losses start to ameliorate, the pressure on the gross margin starts to ameliorate.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of &#x2013; I'm not sure I'm the right person to judge our score card of acquisitions. I think we've made &#x2013; I think we did what we said we'd do. We said we'd make bolt-on acquisitions, that we would be fiscally disciplined and that we would make those acquisitions coherent with our strategy of where we wanted to develop this company. It's exactly what we've done. We've done that and we've walked away where those conditions aren't met. So, thank goodness, no bank can now come to me with a book trying to get me to do a massive piece of M&amp;A. Taken a year, but eventually they've stopped. So nobody's doing that anymore, which is great, and we've walked away from some deals which we just didn't believe made economic sense to us. Whether or not ultimately we got the best deals or &#x2013; that's for other people to judge in the future. But we did what we said we'd do, and that's exactly the way we're going to carry on.</p>
