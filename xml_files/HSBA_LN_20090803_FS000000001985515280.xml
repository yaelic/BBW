          <p>Well good morning, ladies and gentlemen in London. Good afternoon here in Hong Kong. And thank you for joining HSBC's 2009 Interim Results Presentation. As usual we have a satellite link to jointly present in London and in Hong Kong. I'm delighted to be able to here in Hong Kong in person this time.</p>
          <p>My Hong Kong colleagues don't really need introduction but I'll do so all the same. I have to my right Vincent Cheng, Chairman of the Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation and to my left Sandy Flockhart, its Chief Executive and we also have with us Edgar Ancona, the Chief Financial Officer here in Hong Kong and Russell Picot, HSBC's Group Chief Accounting Officer. At the London end we have Mike Geoghegan, Group Chief Executive, Douglas Flint, Group Finance Director and Stuart Gulliver, Chief Executive of Global Banking and Markets. Before we start the presentation can I ask you to take a minute to read the usual forward-looking statements on the screen before you now?</p>
          <p>Let me run through the reported headline numbers for the first half. Profit before tax $5 billion, profit attributable to our shareholders $3.3 billion, earnings per share $0.21, return on equity 6.4%, Tier I ratio at 10.1% just above the top of our target range and core equity Tier I ratio of 8.8%, dividends for the first half of $0.16 per share with a total value of $2.8 billion.</p>
          <p>This time there's major impact in our reported results from movements in fair value on our own debt related to credit spreads. This is not part of the managed performance of the company, does not affect cash flow or dividend potential or capital ratios, and so we've stripped this out of our profit figures. On this basis, profit before tax was $7.5 billion, attributable profit $5.6 billion.</p>
          <p>The numbers demonstrate HSBC's resilience and ability to deliver results even in what have been difficult financial markets and a recessionary economic environment in much of the world. The operating performance of the business is broadly maintained compared with the first half of last year. We've strengthened our position in the faster growing markets, for example in China where we are the leading international bank, the value of our investments there rose by $8 billion in the first half. We continued to open new branches. We launched new rural banks, and we introduced new renminbi services.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere in the region, we doubled our presence in Indonesia. We were the first foreign bank to incorporate locally in Vietnam. We integrated the Indian retail broker acquisition enhancing our wealth management business there. And we continue to see growth opportunities in the faster growing regions that are our strategic focus.</p>
          <p>We're comfortable with our capital strength, strongly boosted by the rights issue earlier this year, and we're also generating capital net of dividend payments. The balance sheet is buttressed by very strong liquidity with an advance deposit ratio of 79.5%. Our costs are down and our cost efficiency ratio is significantly improved. We've shown record profits in Global Banking and Markets.</p>
          <p>And what I'm now going to do is to hand over to Douglas and Mike in London, Douglas to cover to the financial performance, capital, liquidity and risk management, and Mike to cover the first half business performance including Global Banking and Markets successes, the tight cost control, and our progress in handling our U.S. consumer finance business. Douglas, over to you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Stephen. This slide sets out the reported income statement for the last three half-years. And we've presented separately the goodwill impairment in our North American PFS last year and the movements in fair value of our own debt which are related to the credit spreads which we don't include in managed performance. More relevant and since capital has been such a feature over the last 12 months, neither of these items impact regulatory capital. The major takeaways from this slide are that capital generation was much stronger versus the second half of last year, and while loan impairment charges rose against the first half of last year, they're down against the second.</p>
          <p>Before we look at the numbers on the usual underlying basis, can I remind you of the significant factors that we highlighted last year, and add this year's comparatives. As well as movements in fair value in our own debt related to credit spreads and the goodwill impairments in North American PFS, which I've already mentioned, the other factor to note is that the write-downs in Global Banking and Markets have progressively declined over the last three periods.</p>
          <p>One final point, had we treated, and we did not, but had we treated the rights issue as a derivative liability instead of an equity transaction, the movement in our share price during the rights period would have been reflected as an element within our reported performance. On reflection, the Board concluded that this would fundamentally distort the presentation of our performance, and that a true and fair view override was necessary and our auditors concurred with this view. I also note in passing that the IASB voted at their July board to expose for comment a specific revision to IAS 32 which would remedy this anomaly, and we expect this to be formally part of GAAP shortly, and so there should be no need for a true and fair override in our full year account.</p>
          <p>Looking at the underlying results in the usual way, that is stripping out the impact of foreign exchange in acquisitions and disposal, and also showing separately the impact of goodwill impairment and the fair value movements on our own debt related to credit spreads, because these don't impact capital, you can see that revenues rose by 10% while costs fell by 3% in the period. While the charge for loan impairments and other credit risk provisions increased substantially, because of the very positive jaws, our underlying profit before tax was down by a more modest 9%.</p>
          <p>Looking at the current period versus the second half of last year, again you can see the very distorted impacts of goodwill impairment and credit spread movement on our own debt, again with no impact on capital, which is why we've separated it. On this basis operating income before loan impairment is up by 17% and cost down by 5%. The other factor to note is that loan impairment charges were 3% lower in the first half of 2009 within which North American PFS services charges were lower by $1.4 billion or 15%.</p>
          <p>This slide illustrates the movement in the quantum of Tier I capital. Clearly the major movement is the rights issue proceeds. However, in evidence of the fact that movement in our own credit spread does not impact capital, we generated on a capital basis some 4.7 billion in the period from operations against which is offset 1.9 billion of dividends, and added to the stripped value the dividends were more than twice covered. Risk-weighted assets were broadly flat as we targeted and so the Tier 1 ratio improved to 10.1% from the pro forma 9.9% that we showed at Q1 incorporating the rights issue pro forma. I'd also note that in passing of the $1.2 trillion of risk-weighted assets perhaps, and it's a broad thing, perhaps some 20% in aggregate supports the run-off portfolio in the U.S. consumer finance business and the legacy-structured credit and asset-backed securities portfolios in Global Banking and Markets.</p>
          <p>Looking at customer loans and advances, advances were lower primarily reflecting the run-off in the consumer finance portfolios in the United States, a reduction in wholesale balances, both in assets and liabilities, and muted credit demand across most major geographies. As far as liabilities were concerned we grew deposits strongly in Personal Financial Services, particularly in Asia. Global Banking and Markets saw deposits fall as major counterparties de-leveraged, and there were lower transactional balances within some of our custody and payments businesses. The advances to deposits ratio ended up at just under 80% at the end of June, and we would regard this as marking, perhaps, the lower end of the range within which we seek to position the Group.</p>
          <p>Turning to risk and related charges in Personal Financial Services, you can see that loan impairment charge expressed as a percentage of average advances were elevated compared with the first half of last year and broadly flat compared to the second half. Hong Kong remained the best performing market in terms of loan impairment charges in personal banking as it has been for some time. In Commercial Banking we saw increases across most geographies albeit in many cases coming off historically low bases, and inevitably this reflected the weaker economic conditions and the impact of the decline in trade flows. And while there was a substantial but manageable deterioration first half on first half, the dollar charge in the first half of 2009 was lower than in the second half of last year. We've not shown a separate slide for loan impairment charges in Global Banking but these were 1.2 billion against a relatively small number of troubled relationships.</p>
          <p>Turning to the risk elements within Global Markets, firstly the write-downs in respect of legacy trading assets has declined substantially from the first half of last year, from $3.9 billion to less than a billion as credit markets have stabilized and credit spreads tightened. In the available for sale asset-backed securities portfolio the transfer of fair value deficits through the income statement upon recognition of any element of cash flow impairment accounted just over half a billion dollars. And this is in line with the guidance we gave you in March. As in past periods we consider this to be a multiple of the actual projected expected loss.</p>
          <p>The AFS reserve has fallen modestly both from the transfer to the income statement to fair value deficits for impairment as recognized as well as amortizations. And the benefit from improved pricing is less than you might have expected, as the portfolio remains highly illiquid in large part due to the onerous capital requirements of these securities under the capital rules of Basel II currently.</p>
          <p>Overall we remain comfortable that the stress test figures that we disclosed to you in March remain valid with an expected impairment from the beginning of this year of two to $2.5 billion with an ultimate expected loss of 600 to $800 million. Now let me hand you over to Mike for the business review.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Douglas. In these tough times we are very clear about our priorities, and the direction in which we wish to take this business. We have further enhanced HSBC's signature strength over the first half after paying cash dividends. We are now deploying our capital base conservatively to build long term sustainable return to our shareholders. We have stood aside from the aggressive competition for deposits driven by government-influenced banks. Even so customers are still choosing to place their deposits with HSBC, and our published advance to deposit ratio was a conservative 79.5%. Deposit spreads remain compressed, of course, but we are even more convinced of the importance of maintaining HSBC's distinctive liquidity position. That is the key from which we can expand profitability when interest rates recover.</p>
          <p>I will now take you through our business performance for the first half of the year in more detail. And as I do so I will highlight our progress in four core areas. First, we have maintained a strong grip on costs, achieving significant positive jaws. Second, thanks to our broad-based business model we increased our revenues year-on-year. Third, we have continued to provide responsible support for our customers and build that customer base, ready for when the global economy recovers. I will cover the performance in each of our businesses in turn. And finally in the U.S.A., the restructuring of HSBC Finance is on track. And as a result of all of this we have strongly positioned HSBC for the upturn and the opportunities which lie ahead.</p>
          <p>When I became the Group Chief Executive, a core premise behind my thinking about joining up with the company was that HSBC should be able to operate and write additional businesses from a lower cost base. These results prove we are achieving this success. We often talk about the benefits of scale that HSBC enjoys, but here is real evidence of this coming into play.</p>
          <p>Compared with the first half of 2008, we grew revenues by 10% on an underlying basis, and excluding movements in fair value on our own debt related to credit spreads. Yet over the same period we reduced our costs by an underlying 3%, and this excludes the goodwill impairment incurred in 2008, and was after restructuring costs in the U.S.A. Comparing against the second half, the picture is even clearer, with revenues up 17% and costs down 5% on the same basis.</p>
          <p>Let's look at our revenue growth in more detail. This slide highlights our resilience in difficult market conditions. Here you can see the diversification of our business by region. Revenues were broadly stable in Latin America, Asia and the Middle East. The increases in Europe and North America are largely thanks to the revenues from Global Banking and Markets. This geographic diversity positions us well to grow our revenues in line with our strategy. At HSBC we run a balanced business. In this half it has been Global Banking and Markets which have been most able to seize the opportunities, but each of our customer groups is an important component of HSBC's success. Few financial organizations today benefit from such a broad-based platform by both geography and customer group as HSBC.</p>
          <p>I will now move onto our customer groups, starting with Global Banking and Markets. This record performance highlights the continued success of our emerging markets led in finance, folk and strategy, which Stuart Gulliver put in place when he took charge of this at the end of 2006. We are now reaping the benefits of a strategy which has been consistently applied ever since. As you can see we have achieved a good balance between fast growing and developed markets. We are very comfortable with this geographical split of business and its scale.</p>
          <p>Of course, as you know, market conditions were favorable during the period for all. Performance in Global Banking and Markets in the second half therefore partly depends on whether this continues. This slide shows how our growth is broadly spread across different product areas. It also emphasizes that HSBC is well placed to benefit from the actions and decisions of clients during this downturn.</p>
          <p>Record performance in the rates business and strong foreign exchange revenues underscored the strength of core products. We have also seen clients turn to HSBC to help them access the markets as they reopened. This is illustrated by the increase in our financing revenues compared with the first half of last year. HSBC is also ranked first in the Bloomberg Bond Lead tables combining all issuance in Europe, the Middle East, Asia excluding Japan, and Latin America.</p>
          <p>Again, the benefits of our integrated business model come through in the current low interest rate environment. Balance sheet management generated a significantly higher treasury revenues. This was achieved by actively managing the surplus deposits of the other customer groups and by correctly positioning for lower interest rates.</p>
          <p>Next, Commercial Banking. This is a business which has consistently delivered sustainable profits for the Group. Its first half performance reflects the strength of our international business model and our brand. Customer accounts have remained high, reflecting the flight to quality during 2008. Over the last 12 months, we have seen an increase in foreign exchange revenues of 18%, trade revenues were up 11% and global links referral volumes were up 7%.</p>
          <p>Credit quality has inevitably deteriorated over the last 12 months given the challenges which our customers have faced. However, loan impairment charges were stable compared to the second half of 2008. It's too early to draw any firm conclusions about long-term trends but we're encouraged by what we have seen so far this year.</p>
          <p>The growing contribution of emerging markets is seen -- is something that you can see right across the Group. Here is clear evidence of this in Commercial Banking. Customer numbers have increased by 8% to 3.1 million over the past 12 months. 61% of these new customers are based in emerging markets. In fact, the percentage of customers in emerging markets is growing steadily. This looks positive for the future.</p>
          <p>The economic environment has been hard for depositors who make up the majority of our PFS customers. As a deposit-rich bank, HSBC is also suffering, bearing the brunt of the compressed deposit spreads. Importantly, our liquidity position will drive strong revenue opportunities when normal interest rates return. PFS overall remains solidly profitable outside of North America, driven by an encouraging performance in Hong Kong. Levels of loan impairments were disappointing in Latin America, the Middle East and India but we are dealing with these right now. I will say more about our North American business in a moment where there is also progress to report.</p>
          <p>Even in the current environment, HSBC is one of the main winners and we are gaining new and affluent customers. Over the last 12 months the total number of HSBC premier customers grew by 23% to 2.9 million. In fact the screen in my office says it's now more than three million. We have grown our business in mortgage lending too. Our share of the mortgage market increased in both U.K. and Hong Kong during the period.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the U.S.A. We are satisfied with the progress achieved in the first half. All parts of the run-off consumer finance portfolio declined during the period. In a total by $9 billion. The majority of our customers continued to meet their obligations and we are supporting those in difficulty where we can. During the first half, we modified loan obligations of over 69,000 customers with total mortgage value of nearly $10 billion.</p>
          <p>Looking at our core business in the U.S.A. the Cards portfolio reduced faster than expectations as a result of early action taken in tightening underwriting. The Cards business was also profitable overall despite the current economic conditions. We remain clearly focused on managing risk within our consumer lending portfolio but we've been encouraged by the two important trends.</p>
          <p>Firstly we have seen evidence of stabilization of dollar amounts on our two plus delinquencies. And secondly the increase in two plus delinquencies as a percentage of total loans has also begun to moderate. We are therefore seeing less need to bolster provisions. Two quarters are not a trend but they give a clear signal. We are satisfied with what we've seen so far this year.</p>
          <p>In Private Banking, client de-leveraging and low risk appetite impacted both fee income and client assets during the period. However our performance was robust. Pre-tax profit was down 23% compared with the record first half of 2008but is in line with the second half. Our Bancassurance strategy has delivered impressively in the fast-growing markets.</p>
          <p>We have seen growth in profitability in Hong Kong, Brazil, and Singapore. We have also cemented the foundations for the future growth by establishing platforms in India and China. In particular, we are committed to increasing our client penetration rates for life, wealth management and critical illness insurance.</p>
          <p>In summary HSBC has had an encouraging and exciting six months. Throughout the turbulence of the last two years, and again over the last six months, we have proven our ability to deliver through diversity. At HSBC we measure our performance against a set of benchmarks. Our return on shareholder equity for the period was 6.4%. Obviously this was well below our target range of 15 to 19% through the full business cycle. However, the circumstances when most major markets were in recession we believe that this is acceptable, and we also believe the target remains achievable when conditions normalize.</p>
          <p>Our cost efficiency ratio was for the first half 47.9%, slightly better than our target range. An important driver behind this is the 1-HSBC program. This is a core strategic initiative which we launched in 2006. Its purpose is to leverage our economies of scale, improve customer experience and improve efficiency.</p>
          <p>But it's not just about cost, it's about revenues, too. Let me give you some real world examples of 1-HSBC in action. First, by the end of June, 50,000 large corporates were using our online financial management service, HSBCnet. Secondly, by the end of 2009 we expect our global payments platform to handle more than three quarters of the Group's high value payments. Third, we also expect to have more than 80% of our cards on a common world platform by the end of the year. This will reduce the reliance and external service providers and help us reduce processing costs. Of course there is much we can do and we must do to join HSBC. But we are pleased with the real and tangible progress we are now seeing.</p>
          <p>Next, our Tier I capital ratio was 10.1%, which stands slightly above the top of our target. We remain very comfortable with HSBC's strong position at this point. Finally, total shareholders' return is below the target at the half-year, but over the duration of the crisis it has been broadly in line with the peer group average.</p>
          <p>In closing, it's worth saying that this success in executing our Group's strategy has not gone unnoticed elsewhere. We are proud of HSBC's strong global reputation. We were therefore delighted to be recognized as Euromoney's Global Bank of the Year in 2009. We were also named the world's top banking brand by Brand Finance.</p>
          <p>Thanks to this powerful brand, customers are continuing to choose HSBC for deposits, for borrowing and for all financial services. We have a global footprint that is second to none, and our balanced business model has allowed us to increase our revenues whilst reducing our costs. We continue to provide responsible support for our customers and deliver profits, and we have made good progress in restructuring our U.S. consumer finance business. As a result of these factors, we believe we are well placed for the upturn, and we are confident that customers with international needs will continue to come to HSBC.</p>
          <p>Thank you, and I now hand you back to Stephen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, thank you. To summarize, HSBC is strongly positioned for the upturn when it comes. We've seen improved operating conditions in the financial markets. We may be at or around the bottom of the downturn. The timing of the recovery is, of course, is still uncertain, but we believe that HSBC is well placed for when it comes. Our capital strength and our capacity, therefore, to grow risk-rated assets and still maintain strong capital ratios. Our deposit-rich balance sheet, with the ability that this gives us to meet customer demand for credit. Our strong global footprint, with the opportunity to participate in faster-growing economies and to service the need for connectivity between markets and lastly our economies of scale, demonstrated through tight cost control as revenues rise, which will feed through to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>So there's no institution better placed than HSBC to deliver sustainable growth for our shareholders and to contribute to balanced economic development. Whilst the timing of economic recovery of course remains uncertain, we are confident of HSBC's ability to deliver results over the long term.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. Alastair Ryan from UBS. Could I ask, it's Slide 67 of the slide pack where in Mortgage Services, clearly is that, as delinquencies have declined and the size of the book is declining, and you're not feeling confident in running down the level of reserves somewhat. It feels like we should be there fairly quickly in the other books and Household as well, whether that's something you'd be comfortable to comment on. I mean, what drives that flip-over from the pretty aggressive reserve build you've had over the last 18 to 24 months to being comfortable in drawing that down?</p>
          <p>A brief second one if I may. There's a very low marginal cost income in Stuart's business in the first half as obviously against a very high bouncing point or an unusually high starting point. Just whether there's any particular drivers to drive that please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alastair, thank you. Mike, if I, let me suggest between you and Douglas, you take the first one and Stuart the second one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Well clearly, Alastair, as you talk about the trends, you're absolutely right. We are seeing a couple of trends now beginning to develop and it looks like we were projecting a situation that was worse in regard to unemployment and we do see a decoupling at the current time in regard to actual delinquencies and unemployment. Now if that was to continue, then that would be a very positive position for us. But as you see, there are two things happening. One, is we're running off the book, particularly in Mortgage Services, now probably half since we first told you this in March 2007; and the second part of it is the consumer lending side is although weak is not as weak as we were expecting. Douglas, you want to add there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean we built provisions over the half by about 600 million but in the second quarter there was a -- the first time in as long as I can remember, there was a reduction in both Mortgage Services and indeed in the Cards business. The Cards business is driven by volume. I mean, the book came down. And therefore charge-offs, of course are backward-looking in comparison to forward-looking it was a smaller book. In Mortgage Services, I mean, the book's half since we started. And I think what you're now seeing is partly a mix change, i.e., the seconds are much, much smaller as a proportion of what's left. And very little has been put on in the last two, three years, and therefore, you've got a very, very seasoned portfolio which is just maturing and amortizing, and therefore, given the conditions in the first half, there was no need to add to the stock of provisions which we've been doing I think for something like 11 successive quarters. So it's exactly as you describe it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Also cost income ratio at 36 is mainly driven out of very strong revenue growth. The costs are basically more or less flat. They're slightly down, obviously on the first half of 2008, that reflects the fact we took 1,650 people out of the business during 2008, and slightly up on the second half because obviously those performance accruals are going through. But the big delta on the cost efficiency ratio is the revenue line, that 12.2 billion.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Robert Law at Nomura. Could you I just press you a bit more on those two issues if I may. At the start of the year you gave guidance as to the kind of credit impairment we might see at HSBC Finance in relation to unemployment, and certainly the answer to the previous question you seem to be changing that somewhat, but in the past you've seen quite significant second half, first half differences in the experience at HSBC Finance. Can I invite you to comment on the guidance you gave at the start of the year in relation to the rises of unemployment of about 1%?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on the GBM efficiency ratio, obviously the ratio down at 44% I think I worked it out, maybe I've got it wrong, but even if you add back the balance sheet management, it's something like 50. That's very different from the kind of efficiency ratios you're seeing at other investment banks. Is that the kind of number that you would look to be sustaining if you could sustain this kind of revenue number?</p>

          <p>Well, Mike, let me suggest to you, Mike, you and Douglas carry on on the first question and again Stuart on the second.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Clearly when we gave you guidance at the beginning of the year what we were looking at was a trending up in unemployment. And at that stage there was a clear correlation between our impairments and unemployment, which you would expect in the Card businesses and possibly to a lesser extent in mortgages. What we've seen is something interesting to the extent that sub-prime borrowers in regard to cards seem to behave differently to near-prime and prime cards. In some ways the sub-prime cardholder is more alert to a downturn. He's able to adjust his approach to living, whereas the near-prime and the prime have found it more challenging to change their lifestyle.</p>
          <p>So what we're seeing is an improvement there, and also as Douglas said, there has been a marked reduction in debt in the United States, which you've seen across all U.S. institutions. But it's come quite quickly into our Card business with receivables significantly down in the first and second quarter. So it's hard for me to give you a projection of where unemployment goes. I mean if unemployment was to spike significantly in the second half, well then there must be some correlation, but at the current time that correlation is not staying to the position we set at the beginning of the year and it's positive to us. Stuart.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The costing ratio on Page 35 of the ARA is 36. If you do reverse out balance sheet management you get up towards kind of 50. However if you're asking the question if we continue to make 12.2 billion each half year, will the cost income ratio stay where it is? I guess the answer is yes. But the chances of making 12.2 billion is something you should evaluate. I don't think the business needs to get more expensive to run because we're hitting revenue at better level. We've been a huge beneficiary of increased business in the first half because I think and a lot of the countries we're operating in and don't forget Global Banking and Markets is in 67 countries. Clients are asking themselves, are you in wholesale banking in 10 years time? Are you in my country in 10 years time? And they're selecting the banks that they think are survivors. So there is a bias going through our sales and trading numbers which is about increased market share, increased volume in an environment where there are wider spreads. And that doesn't mean my business re-prices on the expense side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well if I could just add a little bit on the first bit. I think you pointed out something very important too. I mean the guidance we gave was very much on a full year basis. There is a seasonal impact and I think the seasonal impact has been accentuated this year but on top of the tax refunds there's also been a number of government programs that have put cash into consumer's pockets and they've had the benefit of lower energy prices coming through. So you know I think until we see third and fourth quarters particularly that September, October, November period which has been very significant in the last three years. I think we're just noting that this is a quite a good trend where it is today but it would be very foolish to extrapolate it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Douglas, thank you. Let me take a question from here in Hong Kong. Yes. Please. The gentlemen behind and, Roy, then I'll come back to you if I may. You behind. All right, Roy. Go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Roy Ramos from Goldman Sachs. One very quick follow-on question on HSBC Finance Household and then one question on the balance sheet management which is again, as you yourselves have noted this is the first time in 11 quarters where provisions are running lower than charge-offs. To what extent should we you assign significance to that? Or as you said is there still seasonality and technical factors involved? Or is this fundamentally the management being more confident about stabilization from here?</p>
          <p>And then the other question I had was on Page 22 where you had a very noticeable year-over-year and half-on-half swing in balance sheet management. And if you could give us a bit more color into that. You mentioned that part of it was positioning for lower rates. So presumably obviously there's a one-off element in there, but I guess if you can give us a bit more color in terms of what you've done in tenor or risk appetite, then obviously we're trying to figure out how much is sustainable as an increase going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Roy, thank you for that. And I'm going to turn this largely to my colleagues in London. Stuart, in the case of the second question, and Douglas, I guess, on the question of the impairment provisions versus the charge-offs in the consumer finance book. Let me just briefly say in the case of the balance sheet, we did put on a number of positions in the autumn of last year. They do partly offset the pressure on cost, excuse me on deposit margins, and yes, those run off in the latter part of this year. But, Stuart, let me ask you to pick up on that at first, and then we'll come to the consumer finance question second.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Stephen. The second half of '08 had write-downs in it. It had write-downs of losses on Icelandic banks and various of the U.S. banks that got into difficulty. So the second-half number would actually have been higher, and therefore the jump into the first half is more pronounced because there were not similar write-downs in the first half. It's also obviously the case that in the U.S. and the U.K., central banks reset interest rates close to the zero bound. And it's also the case that with the enormous injection of liquidity that went into the market, short-term rates became very low. I mean we saw just last month the ECB come with a funding program of one-year money that was taken up to the tune of about &#x20AC;450 billion. So there is an element where we have seen substantial additional gains in balance sheet management.</p>
          <p>Now the positions were put on basically in 2007, and they're mostly two, three-year positions. So there are some maturities, and there are positions that run off, however the yield curve is actually a great deal steeper than it was say when we did the results back in March, and therefore what would be correct to say is that the second half will be lower than the first half, but I don't think I can get into particular guidance without falling foul of stock exchange rules. But I think the thing to stress is, it is not the case that the entire book matures some time in the second half, and therefore this number falls completely dramatically, and we have been able to reload the positions as yield curves have steepened up. And as I say, there was a pronounced depression, as it were, in the second half because of write-downs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think very quickly, Roy, in answering Robert's question, the trends were pointed out. Obviously the stock of provisions at the end of the period is a function both of the current trends, the statistical requirements extrapolating those trends, but also the size of the book, and I think in both in the run down portfolio but also in the Cards portfolio the runoff has been very strong, so part of the movement in the stock of provisions is simply a reflection of the fact that we have a smaller book of business at the end of June.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Morning, John-Paul Crutchley from UBS. Two quick questions if I can. The first was just going back to the U.S. business where the core portfolios, the Card business has actually shrunk faster than non-core portfolios. Mike, you commented on this, there's been a de-leveraging process going on, but it's obviously seasonality as well. I was wondering if you could just comment on what the balance was between the two. Just trying to think about this ongoing run rate of that business is in terms of assets when I think about profitability going forward.</p>
          <p>And the second quick question was just on the China businesses, where it looks like the core HSBC-branded businesses have relatively underperformed the associates in terms of reported numbers. I wondered if you could just comment on what the trends are there, so I haven't actually got to that part of the release yet, so it's for <mark type="inaudible" />? Maybe if you can just comment around what's happening in the China businesses, with both the associates and the HSBC brand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John-Paul, thank you. Mike, do you want to comment on the U.S. situation, and I'm going to, we'll take the China question at this end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. The Card business as you recall is split 50% prime and store cards, and 50% sub prime. What we're seeing is a general run-off of credit in all areas. You're absolutely right, there is a timing element to it. But it goes back to my point before is that the sub-prime is behaving better than the prime in regard to both us being proactive in regard to renegotiating store card contracts, et cetera, moving out of some of that business, running off the metrics portfolio, which was the near-prime portfolio, which hasn't been -- performed as well. So overall, if you ask me where does this business go, I think it's a reflection of the underlying economy. I do believe probably in the second half we'll have to look at where we are in sub-prime. We made it very clear we weren't going to make a decision on the Card business overall for two years, and that remains where I stand on it. But I certainly do, either for us or for somebody else, this is still a valuable business. It's got 36 million active cards. I think China, Stephen, is for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Mike. Thank you. You're correct, John-Paul, the profit performance of the network was down on both the two previous halves. That's a little bit due to investment in expansion of the network, but largely due to compression of lending margins. In fact, Sandy, do you want to add anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The compression on lending margins obviously a drop-off also in terms of trade values because not only in a drop in trade exports out of China but equally as well in terms of the value of commodities coming in, the dropping, the drop down there; and equally as well in terms of what we earn on deposits. There was a significant drop there and equally as well in terms of international companies in China, a lot of paying down of their debt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's certainly not a phenomenon that leads us to reappraise the value of investment in China in our own network and we're going to continue our pace with that. Indeed, I expect and hope to have got to 100 outlets by the end of the year. Mike, another question from London.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. It's Leigh Goodwin from Fox-Pitt Kelton. I actually I've got a couple of questions, if I may, one on GBM and the other on margins. My question on GBM is, and, Stuart, you kindly gave us some indication of where the balance sheet management revenues might go, how we might think about those. I wondered whether you could elaborate on some of the other items within the GBM performance obviously extremely strong. How much of that is related to the steepening curve that we've seen? And what the outlook might be? My question on margins may relate because I see the Group's net interest margin is up nicely. I just wondered what that would be without the balance sheet management contribution?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Leigh, thank you. Obviously, Doug and Stuart, if you could take the first one and Douglas join in as you see fit and indeed the second one may also be between you two as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Leigh. The total operating income for Global Banking and Markets was 12.2 billion and balance sheet management was 3.2 billion of that. So it's only 25% actually of the total. And also, you should look at the fact that we've absorbed a headwind or a negative variance in security services, PCM, asset management and private equity of about 1.2 billion, within those numbers. So it's actually a very diversified book.</p>
          <p>So the extent to which you suddenly get inflation come back, apart from the benevolent impact that will have on PFS and CMB, they will also drive through enhanced performance in GTB, in payment for cash management and security services and asset management, et cetera. So actually there's diversification even within the Global Banking and Markets business. But the BSM part is only a small part of it.</p>
          <p>We have seen a substantial pickup in customer-related revenue and the way we analyze this, and this is a broad assumption that Douglas would recognize is there's a sort of fully audited statement. But we see our business as being about two-thirds customer, and about a third risk, including 80% of BSM as risk in that definition. So you can kind of work back from that and take BSM out. So actually it is reasonably sustainable. It's very diversified across 63 countries. We're one of the few international banks that now actually enables corporate, who deal internationally across the world, to connect those pieces up and are perceived to be in business in 10 years time, and are perceived to be in all those countries in 10 years time. So actually it's reasonably sustainable. The second quarter was higher than the first. July is looking pretty good.</p>
          <p>So actually we think that this is a reasonably sustainable business. The question mark is over the BSM, and I wouldn't want to back over the points I made to Roy, but the rest of it is going to turn on whether the economies are actually healing or not. But I think we're very well positioned to take, and have already taken, really quite significant additional market share in the markets we choose to compete in, which is basically Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East and Latin America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think, putting it simpler, I think in PFS and CMB, broadly speaking the re-pricing of assets has been of a similar order to the give up of margin on the deposit side. But of course we've got a much bigger deposit base than we have assets. So by having that balance sheet strength, which we are committed to, we're actually on a comparative basis slightly disadvantaged, because the current interest-rate environment is very attractive to over lend banks. It's less attractive to those that have got an excess of deposits. So to answer your question, without balance sheet management, the margin would have clearly come down.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I'm Sunil Garg from J.P. Morgan. Two quick questions, the first one's on Global Banking and Markets costs. Stuart, if you could give us some color on should we expect a spike in second-half costs in line with the revenues, as in the variable compensation? Is that accruing along with revenues in the first half? And the second question is on AFS reserve release, as you've released about $4 billion in the first half. The expected loss guidance, I think Page 40 on your presentation, is still the same as it was in December when you reported numbers in March. Any color on how we should look at the timing on AFS reserve releases from here? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks. Stuart, over to you on both those please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have been accruing bonuses in line with the enhanced performance already. So the extent to which there's a true-up in the second half should not be material. And in fact, so that really explains, we've been reducing underlying costs within the business, and the reason why costs jumped from the second half to the first half is actually additional bonus accruals. So in terms of will there be a massive catch-up, no there won't. Will there be some true up, well that depends on what the second half looks like, but we've been accruing in line with our increased revenues.</p>
          <p>Now, on the AFS reserve, which is Page 40, if I remember correctly in this, 39, 40. We do still consider the stress test is relevant. We still believe that this portfolio will have impairments of two to 2.5 billion, '09, '10, and expected losses from those impairments of 600 to 800. The 539 impairment in the first half reflects that two to 2.5, the expected loss of 148 that we've seen in the first half trues-up to that 600 to 800 expectation. So there's nothing that's happened in the market in the first half that causes us to feel that we need to revisit that. So that continues to track as we told everyone both at the March results and during the rights road show.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

          <p>Stuart, thank you. Mike, another couple of questions from London.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Michael Helsby from Morgan Stanley. Sorry to harp on about it, but just on costs in GBM. Clearly it was a huge swing factor for actually what was reported, I think if you take out the improvement in the cost income ratio there then the rest of the groups actually got a negative jaws profile. So I appreciate how you've said you've been accruing costs in line with the revenues, but it's quite clear that you do do things differently, or appear to be doing things differently in GBM. So I was wondering if you could give us some more philosophy in terms of how we should think about that going forward in terms of the costs.</p>
          <p>And just one extra small thing on costs, I noticed there was about a 500 million gain from an accounting change in the cost line. Is that just a one-off? And I've got a follow-up question about debts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Stuart, I think first, and then Douglas on the $500 million gain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you have to look at the fact that the cost income ratio, you've got to look at the income side. There's a six billion increase in revenues first half this year versus second half last year. There's a five billion increase in revenues versus the first half of last year. So the story on the improvement in the cost income ratio is not so much that we are managing our costs artificially down, but that our revenue has come through very, very strongly, and we don't, unlike say yourselves, pay out 73% of our revenues or accrue 73% of our revenues.</p>
          <p>But I absolutely can say that we have accrued our bonus pool in line with the improved performance. We have a great team of people who produce a superb result. Clearly, we're going to pay those people within whatever the industry standards are at the end of this year and whatever our competitor marketplace is doing at the end of this year, and we'll continue to pay for performance. So there's no magic in the expense number. Actually, the driver is the revenue.</p>

          <p>Bad debts. There's quite a big improvement in the bad debt in the commercial book in Hong Kong. We've been all reading about the boost to liquidity in the region. I was just wondering if you could give us some more color in terms of what you would expect the -- should we expect that to be stepping back up in the second half of the year? And also in Asia Pacific and LatAm, there's been a continuation of deterioration there. I was just wondering if you could give us more color on what you're seeing on the ground and again, whether we should expect that to carry on drifting up. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Michael, I think, we'll take that in Hong Kong, if I may.

But with that forewarning, Sandy, would you like to talk about both Hong Kong and then rest of Asia?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have had an increase in loan impairment charges in Hong Kong in the first half coming from a low base and that has continued throughout the first six months. The other place where loan impairments on the commercial side picked up were obviously in India where we have an increase there as well. On the PFS side, principally the main areas where there has been increases would be Hong Kong, to a lesser extent, small amounts in Indonesia and an increase in impairments on the consumer book and PFS in India. That's the principal places where in the first half that happened. But generally speaking, that's from a low base and we certainly think that we've got all these bases covered.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Stephen. I mean, well recall we bought Bank of Bital which was a liability-driven business that didn't have that significant number of assets. So we have been building the asset base of that in particular in the Cards business and there's no question that we are experiencing some digestion issues with that. It's a broader margin business than you see in developed markets. It will take some time to mature, but that's how a Card business works. We'll work through it. In Brazil payroll loans we're not that successful in certain areas, but we're well into restructuring that part of the business. So I think overall it'll be a reflection of the underlying economy where impairments go from here.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Bill Stacy from Aviate Global. My question is about the private bank, and I noticed that in the half, net-new assets declined by seven billion, whereas some competitors have actually seen improvements in net-new assets. And I was wondering what's the issue here? Is there any need to reposition your business in the U.S., given a number of changes there, and obviously intense focus on private banking there? Is there any impact in the Asia business from things like the experience with accumulators, et cetera that have had a focus locally? And what are the quarter-on-quarter trends there?</p>
          <p>And I suppose, just very quickly while I have the question. On IS 32 and the draft changes that are there, how would you anticipate dealing with the elements of those proposed changes that are optional? And what are the key issues for HSBC in those proposed changes in IS 32?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Bill, thank you. On the private banks, I'm going to let Douglas answer the questions on IS 32, you will not be surprised to hear. But on the private bank we've, as you mentioned,  had some net assets outflow. It's relatively modest, and it's actually the first time. I don't think there's anything particularly significant in it other than to say we have, as a general policy, not competed up for deposits in particular, because we've not had the need to do so. So I don't think there's anything that you should read into that that's in any way significant. Douglas, over to you on IS 32.</p>

          <p>Well it's still a work in progress. I think what you're referring to is the move from a three-bucket model to a two-bucket model and get rid of available-for-sale. I think in principle, we're quite comfortable with that, and we see it as a simplification. The devil, as ever, is in the detail, and while the actual guts of the proposals can be encapsulated within about four pages, then there is about 80 or 100 pages of guidance.</p>
          <p>And the big issue, which will be the subject of consultation over the next few months, is on the definition of basic loan features as to whether you can accrual account or not accrual account. We will be heavily contributing to these debates, as we have done in the run up to the proposals. But it's still very much a work in progress. I think we can't really give you a proper response until we know what the final shape of the revisions are. But we welcome, in broad outline, the move to a simpler two-bucket model, as it were.</p>

          <p>Yeah. Hi. It's Sandy Chen from Panmure Gordon. Just one broad question and a final specific question. Looking at Europe and trends in delinquencies and impairments, how would you contrast that with what seems an improving picture in the U.S., especially given the slightly different flavor of our government bailout programs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Firstly let's look at Europe, broadly across all three business, PFS, CMB and Global Banking and Markets. And also you need to look back second half from first half, there were some fair value gains in the first half, sorry in the second half and not in the first half of 2009. And also there was the sale of the French subsidiaries in the second half of 2008.</p>
          <p>But generally if I look at loan impairments, firstly we're starting from a very low base, and you need to stand back and think what did HSBC do in late 2006, early 2007? We told you there was a problem in the USA, and we also went around making sure that our businesses across the world were prepared for the downturn.</p>
          <p>Back here in the U.K. it meant that we cut back on lending, unsecured lending, and we cut back on commercial real estate. In Europe, where we're not that large, our businesses were generally robust anyway. So where you're seeing the uptick in trends is in unsecured lending here in the U.K., to a lower extent from our loan basis, it's about 1.46%.</p>
          <p>Clearly during the period there were a couple of charge-offs and provisions made for Global Banking and Markets individual client exposures, but overall our business was there strong. Commercial has actually, I believe, been very robust, far more robust than what we've seen from our competitors. Again, from a very low base, we have seen some deterioration in the U.K., but significantly less than we're hearing reported by others in the market. But I think in the accounts, if you look, there's a breakdown of this on Page 52 to give you some more guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. Just the specific question was on the model line exposures. That's gone down a bit from about 12.4 billion down to 10.9 billion. Just given the fact that some of the monolines have been downgraded further and there might be some further underlying assets deterioration would you expect that there'd be further credit risk adjustments that you'll be taking in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Douglas said he's policing what I'm doing here, so probably it's best to have the Finance Director talk about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's all set out in the impact of market turmoil section. Yeah. I think that the significant charges in the half were in respect of those monolines that were downgraded in the period, and obviously the extent to which we rely on protection is -- the residual value that we place on protection offered by the monolines, or purchases from the monolines is heavily concentrated in those that continue to be investment grade rated, and the level of value that we've given to the non-investment grade rated ones is very, very modest now.</p>
          <p>Clearly there are two moving pieces. One, what happens to the underlying net exposure OI? What's the mark-to-market on the underlying bonds, as you say it's coming down, and whether that underlying exposure is supported by the better or the weaker monolines. I don't know. I think that the downgrading in the first half of this year was broadly expected, and it's not impossible that we'll see further downgrades at some point in the future, but it really just depends on what happens to the next exposure because that obviously impacts what happens to the monolines. Plus, as you know there's a huge set of legal discussions going back and forward between some of the ways that they have restructured to their benefit, or this benefit depending on whose argument you're pursuing. So I think it's just all very uncertain. Stephen?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. It's John Wadle from Mirae Asset Securities. A quick question on the HSBC Finance risk-weighted assets. Again, it's up to $190 billion. You're shrinking the book, but the risk-weighted assets keep going up. Your Group capital is very strong, so is there any incentive for you to try to dispose of those assets to free up capital? I know the unrealized or fair value would be a write-down if you had to sell them, but when in your mind is there an incentive to do that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll let Douglas or Mike comment. But at the moment there's no real market, so it's somewhat of a theoretical question. Actually, we may well find that as and when the market is there, well clearly as and when there's a market there, we will look at whether there are opportunities that make sense. We may also conclude that these are rather good assets to own, because as you will see from our advance deposit ratio, it isn't as if we were long on assets. But Mike, Douglas, do you wish to comment on the risk-weighted assets part of the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. This is pro-cyclicality, if you like. I mean the risk-rated assets are rising with a falling book largely because the quality of the assets is moving into, it's a more mature book with a higher proportion impaired, or with a higher risk rating to it. So the capital rules put a higher risk rating, so that's why the risk-rating assets are going up. We continue to look at this business entirely on a discounted cash-flow basis. Are we better running the business and collecting? Or are there individual portfolios that we can redeploy capital from by selling in the marketplace?</p>
          <p>Clearly we would not sell the book at indicative fair values at the moment, because we believe that to be significantly less than the cash flows discounted from running the book off, because what you would loose is clearly the spread from revenues over cost, which has actually been quite good in the first half of this year. So we continue to run off. We look at individual portfolios. We actually sold a four billion portfolio out of the prime mortgage books, largely because we could see the ability to redeploy capital and the modest loss that was made from that was seen to be perfectly reasonable against what we could see from running it off ourselves, and in the Consumer Finance we still think we will do better for shareholders in running the book down.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Douglas, could I just add to that before. I think if you go to Page 64 of the presentation, what we're really saying about HSBC Finance Corp. Its revenues are up 7% first half on second half 2008, and the reason for that is that obviously the pricing of our liabilities our funding has been offset, and much better than we envisaged. But it's more than just that. Loan impairment charges are down 17%, but expenses are down 13% as well. So all these ingredients, I think just looking at a set of assets, you've got to look at the underlying trend in the business, the value of the business. Cause I, going to Stephen's point, with the U.S. banking industry de-leveraging so rapidly, and savings going up so quickly, yielding assets like these are going to have a significant value in the future, even if you're going to have to carry a risk-rated asset basis for a period of time. The revenue uptick is quite important.</p>

          <p>Mike, another question from London?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Ian Smillie from RBS. You've been very clear that the Group ROE is positioned to benefit when interest rates go back up. The question is from here with the strong cost performance and the strong balance sheet management revenues built in, what incremental levers are you thinking about pulling to get the ROE up until short-term interest rates go back up, or given the strength of the economic outlook are you happy to sit and wait until that naturally flows through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ian, if I may we've got a published target for the ROE of 13 to 19% through the cycle, and clearly that's where we believe that the company should be able to perform over the medium and longer term, but this isn't a short-term objective, it's not a short-term target. Our job, I believe is to position the business so that we are in a position to take advantage of opportunities as they open up. That's not just a general statement, it means specifically that in the context of the current financial and economic environment and as the world economy begins to move out of recession, there will be opportunities to grow business, certainly organically. We want, as you've heard us on this before, to be able to look for sensible inorganic opportunities, but our main focus is organic. We believe that we have shown market share gains in Stuart's business, in commercial banking, in retail banking in the shape of the mortgages business both here, in Hong Kong and in the U.K.</p>
          <p>These are all the sorts of things that we should be doing to grow the business. If we do that on the basis of a very tight operating cost control, and by presumption if we're doing that against the background of impairments peaking because the economy's improving, that's not a forecast, but eventually that is clearly one of the implications of an improved economic environment, you've got substantial gearing that should enable the company to perform strongly, and we do believe it us possible to operate the company over the cycle in that 15 to 19% range for return on equity. Another question from London perhaps, Mike?</p>
