      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Joachim. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, ladies and gentlemen. As Joachim said, today we are calling from Berlin, the birthplace of Deutsche Bank.</p>
          <p>The third quarter actually was a milestone also therefore in the history of Deutsche Bank, because we successfully conducted the bank's largest capital increase, generating gross proceeds of &#x20AC;10.2 billion. As you know, we mainly need the money for our intended takeover of Postbank, where the PTO is currently underway.</p>
          <p>But before I start, I would really like to express my gratitude to our shareholders for your belief in Deutsche Bank. We will continue to commit our capital in a shareholder-friendly manner.</p>
          <p>Now let's move to &#x2013; on to our third quarter results, which start at the third page of the overview, as you can see here, we had a strong operating income before income taxes of &#x20AC;1.3 billion, and here this time, because of the Postbank effect we've added an additional column that shows you our results without this one-time accounting charge.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, as you know, Deutsche Bank has performed very well in, as we can see still, fragile global economy. As we had indicated before, we had to revalue our existing Postbank stake and the MEB, which led to the charge of &#x20AC;2.3 billion, which therefore is marking a little bit the underlying strong operating performance. But I'll try to guide you through to show separate from that one-time effect, the good performance of the bank.</p>
          <p>This charge, as I said, was triggered by our intent to consolidate Postbank. The related asset is a non-cash non-tax deductible charge, which represents a difference between the previous carrying value of the equity method investment and the fair value of the current stake as of September 30. The charge was booked as a negative revenue in our corporate investment segment.</p>
          <p>Including the Postbank-related charge, we reported a loss before income taxes of &#x20AC;1 billion. We reported net income of 1.1 billion, excluding the Postbank effect, versus 1.4 billion in the third quarter of 2009. Including the aforementioned Postbank-related charge, net loss in the third quarter was &#x20AC;1.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax RoE for the firm's target definition was 13% versus 14% in the third quarter of 2009 based on a higher average active equity. Tier 1 capital ratio, excluding the proceeds of the capital increase was at 11.5 at the end of the quarter, up versus the end of last quarter. Excluding the Postbank related charge, Q1 capital ratio would have been 11.9% based on a Tier 1 capital of &#x20AC;33.6 billion.</p>
          <p>IFRS assets of &#x20AC;1.9 trillion was slightly up versus the end of the second quarter, while adjusted assets, which reflect in netting of the relatives and certain other trading instruments, were essentially unchanged versus the end of last quarter.</p>
          <p>The bank's leverage ratio for our target definition was 25 at the end of the quarter, and here as well, if I took the Postbank stake-related charge, the leverage ratio was 24, slightly above the quarter end level. The increase is mainly to a reduction in the adjusted equity of &#x20AC;4.5 billion.</p>
          <p>If I move on to page four, you see that the third quarter net revenues were &#x20AC;5 billion, compared to net revenues of &#x20AC;7.2 billion in the previous quarter. Here again, excluding the Postbank-related charge of 2.3 billion, net revenues for the quarter would have been &#x20AC;7.3 billion. Net revenues included approximately a &#x20AC;130 million from the sale of Axel Springer shares, which had been pledged as loan collateral, partly offset by fair-value losses on certain of our own debt of &#x20AC;113 million.</p>
          <p>Lower revenues in CB&amp;S were offset by higher revenues in our classic banking businesses. Revenues in GTB and the asset and wealth management business were bolstered by the recent acquisitions. In all businesses, net revenues were in line or higher compared to the prior quarter, with the exception of GTB. But the second quarter included the recognition of a provision in negative goodwill for the first time consolidation of parts of ABN AMRO of &#x20AC;208 million.</p>
          <p>If I move on to page five, we show you the provision for credit losses, which were significantly below last year in both our core lending and our non-core IAS 39 portfolio. The quarter-on-quarter increase in IAS 39 related provision for credit losses reflects charges on a small number of individual assets, but we mainly saw rating downgrades.</p>
          <p>Nothing that overly worries us, but as I told you in the last quarter, there will always be some variance in this number given it is very asset specific and event driven. In our core business provision for credit losses has been very stable with PCB recording 165 million this quarter after &#x20AC;171 million last quarter.</p>
          <p>CIB, excluding IAS 39, remained at low levels and quite a bit below the 109 million recorded in the prior-year quarter. The slight overall pickup in provision for credit losses outside IAS 39 includes a higher provision related to the Sal. Oppenheim Group and ABN AMRO, which you know is covered by &#x2013; 75% covered under the risk umbrella in line with our expectation.</p>
          <p>So move on to page six, you will see the development of non-interest expenses that were at &#x20AC;5.7 billion in the quarter, up 300 million compared to the third quarter of 2009, bearing compensation and benefits of &#x20AC;3 billion, up &#x20AC;140 million versus the prior year quarter. The increase is mainly driven by the acquisitions and exchange rate effect. The comp ratio, excluding the Postbank-related charge, would have been 41%. General and administrative expenses were &#x20AC;2.5 billion in the quarter, up &#x20AC;350 million compared to the third quarter last year.</p>
          <p>As you may remember, we had a specific negative item of &#x20AC;200 million in last year's number related to the repurchase of investment products from private investors. Adjusted for this, almost half of the increase is related to the acquisitions. More than 100 million represents the impacts of foreign exchange rate changes, and the majority of the remainder is driven by business expansion and strategic initiatives, including some IT investments that are also related to our complexity reduction effort that I'll cover later.</p>
          <p>The reduction in other non-comp expense reflects lower reserves in our Abbey Life business, which was fully offset by corresponding revenues in CB&amp;S. Not yet reflected in our comp costs are any impacts derived from the new German and the new European CRD3 regulation on compensation. All remuneration paid after January of 2011, including variable pay resulting from 2010 performance, will be subject to the new regulation. We're currently reviewing the new requirements and any potential actions for our compensation structure and governance.</p>
          <p>Let me move on now to page seven, in which, as I already mentioned, excluding the Postbank charge, the third quarter income before income taxes would have been &#x20AC;1.3 billion, in direct line with the same quarter last year, which we feel is a really solid result considering the usual seasonal Q3 slowdown in client activities. The pre-tax loss of &#x20AC;1 billion included against the aforementioned Postbank charge.</p>
          <p>I move on to page eight. In the third quarter, we recorded a net loss of 1.2 billion versus a net income &#x20AC;1.4 billion in the third quarter 2009. The effective tax rate in the quarter was negative 16%, obviously distorted by the Postbank related charge, which did not result in a tax benefit. Without this charge, the ETR for the quarter would have been 13%, benefiting from the favorable geographic mix of income and the release of a deferred tax liability.</p>
          <p>We expect the full-year ETR to come in approximately 44% because of the Postbank related charge, which as I had already said did not result in a tax benefit. Without that, our full-year ETR would have been expected to be approximately 28%.</p>
          <p>Currently, and I apologize for that, we do not provide a mid-term guidance for the bank's ETR because obviously of these current uncertainties related to the U.K. and German bank levies, which are still being discussed.</p>
          <p>I move on to page nine. We will show our Tier 1 capital ratio development, which was at 11.5% at the end of the quarter, up from 11.3% at the end of the second quarter. Excluding the Postbank related charge, our Tier 1 capital ratio would have been at 11.9%. The core Tier 1 ratio, which excludes obviously the hybrid capital instruments, is up 7.6%. Excluding the Postbank related charge, our core Tier 1 ratio would have been 8.1% at the end of the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Not yet reflected in these ratios are the &#x20AC;9.8 billion of net proceeds from our capital increase, which was successfully completed on the 6th of October and would have led to a pro-forma Tier 1 capital ratio of 15% and 11.1% core Tier 1 ratio, respectively. Both ratios reflect the Postbank related charge.</p>
          <p>The decrease of Tier 1 capital of &#x20AC;2.5 billion during the quarter was offset by reduced risk weighted assets, which were &#x20AC;26 billion lower than at the end of the second quarter 2010.</p>
          <p>On page 10, I disclose some further development both for Tier 1 capital and risk weighted assets. As you can see, Tier 1 capital decreased to 31.8 billion compared to 34.3 billion at the end of the second quarter. And the decrease is largely driven by the net loss that includes obviously the Postbank charge and negative FX effects of 1.4 billion, partially offset by capital deduction items of around 400 million.</p>
          <p>The Postbank related charge was partially offset by a reduction of the capital deduction for our Postbank investment and by reduced risk-weighted assets on the mandatorily changeable bond.</p>
          <p>Risk-weighted assets, as you can see, decreased from 303 billion to 277 billion at the end of the quarter. The decrease was mainly related to FX movements and risk mitigation initiatives within our credit risk, as well as lower levels of risk exposure and reduced market volatility within our market risk. It includes also a risk-weighted asset relief of &#x20AC;5 billion arising from the revaluation of the MEB.</p>
          <p>On page 11, I show you the strength of Deutsche Bank again in terms of our funding and liquidity position. We continue to have a well-diversified liquidity position. The reduction in stable funding sources is consistent with lower term funding requirements. Our strategic liquidity reserve stands still at &#x20AC;45 billion. And in September, we have already now completed our issuance plan of 19 billion for the year.</p>
          <p>Let's move on now to the segment results. On page 13, we have once again proven the robustness of our recalibrated business model despite the continuing demanding economic market condition. This slide not only shows the solid performance of our investment bank, but also robust results in all of our classic banking businesses.</p>
          <p>GTB and Asset and Wealth Management were both impacted by their respective recent acquisitions. Excluding the Sal. Oppenheim transaction, Asset and Wealth Management has achieved a pre-tax profit of &#x20AC;130 million in the quarter. And again, here the result in corporate investment reflected the charge related to Postbank.</p>
          <p>On page 14, let's move onto our investment bank, and here you see that despite challenging market conditions in the quarter, we achieved a &#x20AC;1.1 billion pre-tax profit that I think is quite remarkable.</p>
          <p>On page 15, we've split up now the P&amp;L of our investment bank, first into sales and trading. Here net revenues of 2.9 billion; they were in line with the prior-year quarter, as we had said. Revenues were impacted by a &#x20AC;90 million charge related to Ocala.</p>
          <p>Overall, volumes in the third quarter were down 20% versus the prior quarter, but 17% higher than the previous year.</p>
          <p>Equity volumes were up significantly in September, as were rates and FX volumes. Businesses such as flow credit and cash equities saw a surge in revenues in September, about 50% above July and August levels as activity and volatility returned to the market. We also saw significantly lower client activity, especially in Europe, due to sovereign risk concerns as well as the usual seasonal slowdown in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Wider margins towards the second half of the quarter, reflecting lower liquid and risk aversion, but margins remained far lower than during the peak of the crisis. There was a significant pickup in the second half of September, and growth in volumes partially offset the reduction in margins compared to last year.</p>
          <p>As expected, in a lower volume environment we saw slightly higher margins in July compared to July of 2009; however, by September margins had contracted. Overall in the third quarter, margins were 44% lower than in the third quarter of 2009, which offset the higher volumes. Nevertheless, conditions reaffirmed the importance of global market recalibration and our revenue diversification.</p>
          <p>On page 16, you see that the diversification of our fixed income businesses was very important during the quarter and allowed us to post solid results. Although credit activity was muted, we saw good revenues from FX and rates.</p>
          <p>In FX, we saw increased volume even compared to 2009, which I think is quite remarkable and shows that we maintain our competitive edge in these products.</p>
          <p>Money markets and rates revenues were lower versus the previous-year quarter, reflecting market normalization and lower margin. However, we recorded an increase in rates solutions for our clients even though we also had a very strong flow of franchise.</p>
          <p>We rank, by the way, number one overall in Risk Magazine's annual Risk Interdealer poll, with top rankings across most currencies and tenants.</p>
          <p>Credit, we had a strong performance across the franchise, both in our flow and distressed businesses, but also in our solutions businesses, which as described at Investor Day, is working with clients on restructuring their exposure while not exposing ourselves to a liquid risk.</p>
          <p>In emerging markets, we noted an increased interest in Latin America, and we continue to develop well in Eastern Europe. Euromoney voted us the Best Risk Management across our emerging market franchise.</p>
          <p>Commodities results were lower compared to the prior year due to low volatility and difficult trading conditions, but we are still on course to deliver good results this year.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to page on 17. We are obviously very happy with the performance of our recalibrated equity trade fund, which is more client focused, and we've significantly reduced our share risk. This quarter we shut our dedicated equity prop-trading platform. We are number one in prime brokerage and are number in euro cash equities and are investing and improving our market share in U.S. and Asia cash equities.</p>
          <p>I'll admit that we are somewhat disappointed by our equity derivatives performance, but continue to invest to grow client market share over time, for example, in institutional flow equity derivatives.</p>
          <p>CIB integration, the integration of our Investment Bank, will ensure that we are able to bring our primary and secondary franchises even closer together so we'll benefit from the large pipeline of IPOs.</p>
          <p>However, client volumes were down substantially in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, while volatility increased. In cash equities, like in the second quarter, commissions held up well, but client facilitation was difficult in this environment, and overall secondary market activity was significantly lower due to the lack of primary issuance.</p>
          <p>In equity derivatives we saw extremely low client activity. Our prime brokerage platform continues to do very well. Despite a much more competitive environment and margin compression, we maintained very stable revenues as we onboard new clients and new products in our synthetics business.</p>
          <p>We exited our dedicated equity prop trading business. This was a small revenue contributor anyway, and the fact that we generate good equity results without any contribution of prop is a testament to the success of our clients' franchise, but there is still work, obviously, to be done as I described previously.</p>
          <p>Keep in mind that we continue to aim to improve our model; we run our business now with significantly lower risk. This will at times limit our upset, but also our down set, and should improve relative revenue stability over time, which is what we understand shareholders want us to do.</p>
          <p>On page 18, we saw that in Origination &amp; Advisory, we achieved a solid result in the second quarter and continued to make a good progress in achieving our target of a consistent top five position.</p>
          <p>DB ranked number 5 globally for the first nine months in Origination &amp; Advisory. In the last two years, DB has gained the most market share and counts the most lead table positions of any bank in the top 10, three places from number 8 at the end of '08 to number 5 at the end of September. We ranked number 4 globally by fees here today, which represents our best ever advisory ranking for the first nine months. Looking ahead, strategic M&amp;A expected by well-capitalized acquirers and significant co-private LBO activity driven by financial sponsors. So we have a good outlook here for our business.</p>
          <p>Deutsche Bank ranked number 5 globally, and has maintained our number 1 position in the first nine months in EMEA, with a strong IPO backlog, and are ranked number 2 in the global IPO backlog. We also ranked number 2 in all bonds in Euros and number 2 in all Euromarket issues, number 2 in all corporate bonds in Euros year-to-date. In high yield, DB ranked number 5 globally and number 1 in Europe.</p>
          <p>Expect issuance to remain high and the leveraged loan market to remain positive for this business. Against this climate, I think Deutsche Bank has achieved the competitive rankings whilst maintaining our underwriting discipline, which we will to continue to monitor very closely.</p>
          <p>On page 19, we show the results of GTB, which had a solid third quarter with an overall EBIT of &#x20AC;240 million, compared to a record second quarter result driven by a &#x20AC;208 million provision and negative goodwill, attributable to the commercial banking activities that we acquired from ABN AMRO in the Netherlands.</p>
          <p>GTB's net revenues were &#x20AC;852 million in the third quarter, an increase of almost 30% compared to the third quarter. This was predominantly attributable to the commercial banking activities that I have just discussed. In provision for credit losses, GTB recorded a net change of &#x20AC;44 million, which is an increase of 38 million year-on-year, solely driven by the aforementioned acquisition. Noninterest expenses were &#x20AC;594 million in the quarter, up &#x20AC;141 million compared to third quarter 2009, driven by integration and operating costs related to the acquisition, as well as higher regulatory costs related to deposit protection.</p>
          <p>As I told you in the past, the last results &#x2013; as I told you in last call, the ABN AMRO P&amp;L impact is anticipated to be roughly breakeven for 2010 due to one-time integration costs as we are taking over and integrating this business. The bottom line acquisition related pre-tax profit impact this quarter was 13 million negative.</p>
          <p>On page 20, we show the different results of the different businesses within GTB. All these businesses suffered from seasonal decline quarter-on-quarter, but overall performance improved year-on-year. We have recorded a continued shift to fee income, as planned, that we have done to counterbalance the impact of the still low interest rate environment. Strategically, we're trying to move this business segment further away from its dependence on the interest rate environment.</p>
          <p>However, interest rates are also slowly starting to increase again in some regions, mainly in Asia. In the 2010 Euromoney cash management poll published in October, Deutsche Bank retains its number one position in EUR Clearing and Western European Corporate Cash Management, while improving to number 2 position in the U.S. and Latin America for U.S. dollar clearing.</p>
          <p>Our Trust and Securities Service showed a solid performance mainly driven by the direct securities services business. And here also, particularly in Asia, we expect the GTB business to continue capitalizing on their improved position in the market as we move on.</p>
          <p>On page 21, I move to our Asset and Wealth Management business that reported net revenues of &#x20AC;1 billion in the third quarter 2010, an increase 32% year-on-year. Revenues included &#x20AC;200 million related to the Sal. Oppenheim Group.</p>
          <p>Provision for credit losses were &#x20AC;19 million, up &#x20AC;14 million compared to the same quarter last year. This development was primarily driven by higher provision related to the Sal. Oppenheim Group. Noninterest expenses in the third quarter were &#x20AC;921 million. Sal. Oppenheim and BHF accounted for more than 80% of the increase year-on-year.</p>
          <p>On page 22, I show some features about the performance of asset management, which reported a strong pre-tax profit for &#x20AC;84 million, up 50% quarter-on-quarter due to one-side, slightly more favorable markets in our fees, as a result of this higher performance fees in DWS Europe, mainly in money market and the equities business, and also quite a success in a lower cost base.</p>
          <p>A lot of things in this business are going in the right direction. Real estate write-downs are trailing off and the restructuring of asset management over the last five years that is mostly completed and going forward. We should see the underlying earnings and the underlying benefits of this significant restructuring we've done to this business.</p>
          <p>Net new money inflows of &#x20AC;2 billion predominantly in cash and insurance products started to reverse last quarter's cash outflows trend.</p>
          <p>On page 23, I show the Private Wealth Management business that, adjusted for the Sal. Oppenheim Group consolidation effects, achieved &#x20AC;47 million pre-tax profit. The revenue of ex Sal. Oppenheim/BHF were lower due to seasonal effects, but were up compared on a year-on-year basis.</p>
          <p>Cost in this business remains stable quarter-on-quarter, despite the IT investments we have to do in this business currently. We are also pleased with the progress we've made in Asia where revenues were up 25% year-on-year, and also I can report that Sal. Oppenheim's performance has now improved quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>On page 24, another of our successful businesses, PBC's net revenues were 1.5 billion, up 5% versus the previous prior year quarter. Provision for credit losses was 165 million in the third quarter, down 21% compared to the third quarter of 2009 as a result of measures taken in portfolio and on different country level.</p>
          <p>Noninterest expenses were &#x20AC;1 billion in the third quarter and were in line with prior quarters, while the third quarter 2010 included expenses for strategic projects and other one-offs.</p>
          <p>And if you see on page 25, our comparison, this result was really the best quarterly result since the Lehman bankruptcy, even exceeding our strong second quarter results driven by revenue growth, reduced provision for credit losses, and stable costs.</p>
          <p>Higher margins led to a record quarterly revenue in our deposits; revenues from credit products were robust. We had a solid performance in investment products, but we still have the results of the usual holiday season and that general environment. We are very pleased with the performance in the quarter, also in this division things are moving in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Let me move on now to some key current issues. And as you know, on the 6th of October, on page 27, I referred to our two large transactions. As you know, on the 6th of October we completed our &#x20AC;10.2 billion capital increase. One day later on October 7, we published the offer document for the voluntary public takeover for all of the shares of Deutsche Postbank. Acceptance period runs from the 7th of October until the 4th of November, and the final settlement is then expected by either the end of November or the beginning of December.</p>
          <p>As you know, our offer price is &#x20AC;25 per Postbank share. And through this takeover offer, we aim to consolidate Postbank already this year. As you know, going in we did hold 29.95% of the shares, but as of Thursday, 21st of October, we have &#x2013; the offer has been accepted for a total of 1.3 million Postbank shares. So we are successfully already above the 30% threshold.</p>
          <p>On page 28, now I think move onto one of the real hot topics right now, and I am going to ask to bear with me for a while, because obviously we need to give you some detailed explanation on this page and on the next. On these two slides, I want to explain to you how we look at the upcoming regulatory changes, specifically the new trading book rules under Basel 2.5, CRD3, which will become effective on the 31st of December, and the new minimum capital standard under what is referred to as Basel 3, CRD4, which will be phased in a over a number of years, starting on the 1st of January of 2013.</p>
          <p>As to separate it, let me first talk about the impact on the risk weighted assets and then talk about the impact on capital. Based on our latest analysis, the new trading book rules when applied to our current positions would increase our risk-weighted assets by 85 billion. Banking book rule changes would add another 8 billion. The higher trading book risk weighted assets comprise charges for stress, value at risk, and incremental risk charge for credit default exposure, as well as additional charges for trading book securitizations, which includes correlation trading.</p>
          <p>On the banking book side, the increased charges caused by the introduction of higher risk rates for re-securitization &#x2013; under Basel 3, we see additional risk weighted assets of 185 billion, again before management action.</p>
          <p>Here, the main items are a 1,250% weighted securitization position, currently deducted half and half from Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital, as well as the new risk weighted assets requirement in relation to credit valuation adjustments.</p>
          <p>Obviously, all of these movements will be subject to management and risk reduction actions. Overall, targeted management actions will allow for a reduction of 90 billion risk weighted assets, as we manage down legacy positions and further optimize our risk profile and processes, and as we have said that this includes a reduction also on the trading book Basel 2.5 to 50 billion.</p>
          <p>Let me give you some more specifics. On stressed VaR, we intend to rebalance our trading book risk profile further to be less sensitive to extreme market moves. However, to protect our overall trading franchise, we will continue to provide sufficient VaR and stressed VaR limits to the businesses. It means that management action in this area will provide comparatively limited benefits.</p>
          <p>Regarding the new incremental risk charge, we see more room for mitigation. Here in particular targeted hedging of low-rated sovereign exposure will be used as an effective countermeasure. The biggest area of risk-weighted asset increase, and therefore also the biggest area of risk-weighted asset mitigation, is the securitization, which also includes our correlation trading. And the Basel 2.5 trading book securitizations and correlation trading will attract extra charges, and under Basel 3, securitizations-related capital deductions get replaced by risk-weighted assets at 1,250%</p>
          <p>The targeted reductions include a further reduction in our correlation trading exposure where we have already made good progress, as well as the review of our full inventory of trading and banking book positions for which we target a reduction up about a third. The CVA-related charges that will come with Basel 3 are another area of significant management action.</p>
          <p>Next to targeted counter-party risk hedging and collateralization of exposures, we also continue to invest in our infrastructure. The later will result &#x2013; will ensure that we have the most appropriate modeling results, which include conservative regulatory add-ons only for a very few selected transactions.</p>
          <p>Lastly in this area, the shift of OTC derivatives toward central clearing will provide risk-weighted asset relief. The combined effect of Basel 2.5 and Basel 3 after target actions would be approximately 188 billion risk-weighted assets, or what we call 125 billion risk-weighted asset equivalent.</p>
          <p>Let me explain what we mean to this. That includes the Tier 1 capital benefit from the removal of securitization-related Tier 1 deductions under Basel 3. To clarify, we've added a column for risk-weighted asset equivalent values to give you an estimate of the net core Tier 1 ratio effect from future rule changes after management action. What we reflect here is the fact that under Basel 3, we not only have higher risk-weighted assets, but also higher core Tier 1 capital because securitization-related Tier 1 deductions will be removed and instead reflected in risk-weighted assets.</p>
          <p>Scaling fees no longer require Tier 1 deductions by 12.5, and subtracting the benefit from the net risk-weighted asset impact gets you to the 125 billion equivalent. Simply speaking, you multiply 5 billion deduction times 12.5 and get a 62.5 billion risk-weighted asset equivalent, which is the difference between the 188 billion risk-weighted asset and the 125 billion risk-weighted equivalent.</p>
          <p>I now move on to page 29. Here I show the capital effect of the equation. How that &#x2013; therefore our stimulation that we have prepared here play out in all or our risk-weighted assets and therefore in the core Tier 1 capital and capital ration turns.</p>
          <p>First, we take the 30th of September Group risk-weighted assets of 270 billion, as I reported previously, and now we add the effects of the anticipated consolidation of Postbank. Then we add the 188 billion risk-weighted assets from the previous page &#x2013; from the Basel 2.5 and Basel 3, and then you arrive at a pro forma risk-weighted assets of 525 billion under the future regulatory regime. This obviously includes now Postbank.</p>
          <p>Second, we simulate movements in Core Tier 1 capital beginning with 21 billion published today for the third quarter. To start, we then adjust Core Tier 1 capital by the 8 billion reflecting our recent rights issue and the anticipated Postbank consolidation effects. In our scenario, we go on to add about 11 billion net income until the 1st of January 2013, purely based on current analysts' forecasts and a dividend assumption.</p>
          <p>Lastly, we add back the current securitization Tier 1 capital deductions, as this must be reflected as risk-weighted assets under Basel 3 rule. In such a scenario, we would arrive at a pro forma January 2013 Core Tier 1 ratio of 8.5%, way above the regulatory 3.5% minimum at that point in time.</p>
          <p>Now I understand that many of you are asking what the situation would be if Basel 3 rules would be fully applied as of January 2013. So as to be honest, this is not really an issue as the real question should be how much capital a bank needs from a regulatory and economic perspective at a given point in time to be safe and sound, but without being over capitalized at the expense of shareholder returns.</p>
          <p>Still, to answer your question, we provide you here with an estimate of the capital impact fund applying directly, and this is what we mean with the work without phase-in, the full Basel 3 rule package is expected to be legally in place in the year 2019. Applying 2019 rules directly at January 1st of 2013 leads to a pro forma Core Tier 1 ratio of 7% in our scenario and over 8% by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>Lastly, in our chart we illustrate our ability to generate new capital through net income over the Basel 3 phase-in period, calculated by applying latest analyst net income forecasts for 2013, flat for five year. As you can see, capital formation will provide ample room to ensure strong capitalization while at the same time being able to pay attractive dividends to shareholders and to fund future growth.</p>
          <p>So starting 2013, meeting analyst estimates would allow us to pay annual dividends of 30% to 40% of net income, grow risk-weighted assets by 20 billion a year, and still achieve a Core Tier 1 ratio of above 10% at the end of the phase-in period.</p>
          <p>So let me finish in saying that while we do have concrete plans to mitigate the impact of upcoming regulatory rule changes as discussed on the previous page, we remain 100% committed to our broad trading franchise, and we will optimize our actions in the interest of our shareholders and allocate our capital to the most accredited businesses, balancing capital requirements and shareholder return.</p>
          <p>On the next page now, I move away from the capital topic to the second hot topic. Obviously, we brought up to your attention, which is the update on our complexity reduction program. It took some time to go on with the program and finalize the program. You should take this as the proof that we did our homework. First, we have now a detailed action plan in place, and we're already delivering against it as we speak.</p>
          <p>As target, we have now identified initiative in excess of &#x20AC;1 billion of efficiency gains, which are, as I said, already being executed right now. As mentioned, we are focusing on mainly three levers. It's group-wide standardization. It's consolidation, especially in the IP systems areas, application systems. And we are reducing our reporting processes and improving their efficiency, and we are also centralizing our vendor and centralizing all our sourcing activities.</p>
          <p>A generic description in some initiatives and examples of initiatives I outlined here on the slide, and again, many of my IR colleagues are happy to provide you with additional color if that would be required.</p>
          <p>Now on page 31, I want to make you aware that obviously the timeline for the target costs to achieve the savings of the complexity reduction program. We obviously, due to the scrutiny we applied setting up the program, we won't be able to recoup all benefits already in 2011 as initially indicated, but the 2011 exit rate reflects sustainable cost savings from initiatives implemented by year-end of 2011, which will fully occur in 2012.</p>
          <p>So in 2011, more than &#x20AC;500 million of net savings are scheduled to be achieved. But of course, the run rate of net savings will increase during the year.</p>
          <p>But in 2012, the program will reach its full run rate of &#x20AC;1 billion of net savings. But 2010, plan savings and costs achieved will almost neutralize, but for the first nine months, we have already achieved &#x20AC;200 million, which were offset by costs of achieve.</p>
          <p>On then page 32, I show you that the divisional split of the targeted costs achieved in the savings, and as you can see, all businesses are contributing to the complexity reduction effort. The majority of costs achieved and savings obviously affect our investment bank. This program by the way does not yet include savings we expect from the integration of global banking into our CIB platform.</p>
          <p>We will provide you with more information in due course, but let me already highlight that we have ambitious plans to optimize this structure, and we have further benefit of the integrated platform.</p>
          <p>So to conclude, on page 33, we show our performance in the first nine months of 2010, against obviously the 2011 profit targets. And after nine months, we have achieved &#x20AC;6.1 billion, and we remain committed to our target, and we believe to be on track to achieve our 2011 target.</p>
          <p>Please bear in mind that obviously the underlying profitability in the first months &#x2013; first nine months of 2010 was negatively impacted by a variety of specific charges, such as the front-loading of the U.K. bonus tax, integration cost of Sal. Oppenheim, and the other acquisitions or asset markdowns. Our continued improvement in the cash and banking business in the third quarter also gives us a lot of confidence that we are on the right track under the assumptions made at Investor Day.</p>
          <p>So to sum up, economic environment remains challenging and our business model was influenced by the third quarter seasonal slowdown. Against this backdrop, we had, though, a very strong operational performance. Our investment bank remains a very strong pillar of performance with a much improved risk profile. Our proposed acquisition of Postbank will allow us to develop an equally strong second pillar, improve our earnings mix, with an increased proportion from more stable revenue streams. And then executing on our current initiatives, which is the complexity reduction and the cost savings of the CIB integration and the targeted Postbank synergies, we will definitely create incremental shareholder value. So if economic and market conditions further stabilize, we're also confident that we'll continue to deliver strong earnings.</p>
          <p>So thank you very much, and we're looking forward to your questions.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Christopher Wheeler. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, gentlemen, and well done on some good results. Three questions, if I may. First of all, on the Basel III disclosure you have given, which is very helpful, the securitization side &#x2013; could you perhaps comment on the impact you think that the changes in securitization treatment will have on the way you do business in that particular area, because clearly, the concept of holding on to some of the higher-rated pieces of those transactions is part of actually getting deals done. Do you think there is going to have to be a change in the way you actually operate in that area, that's the first question?</p>
          <p>Second question is on wealth management. I noticed the decline in earnings from 77 million to 47 million in IBIT before Sal. Oppenheim. I'm finding that a bit confusing by looking at your spreadsheets, given that revenues were pretty up or flat across the board in asset and wealth management. And I'm just wondering, what was the reason for that decline? Is it reallocation of some costs, or maybe the costs of the buildout?</p>
          <p>And the final point, which I asked UBS yesterday, and you touched on in terms of the new European rules on compensation, what are your -- how are you viewing the bonus ladder as you move forward, given the fairly aggressive noises, obviously this week, from the British Prime Minister and Business Secretary about their intentions if banks choose to what they describe as paying unreasonable bonuses in the particular climate. Because, certainly UBS insinuated yesterday that they would just get on with it, retain talent, and take the hit in Q1 to what will inevitably be not just perhaps a U.K. bonus tax, but other bonus taxes. And I just wonder how you viewed that, particularly given the comment you just made on your 10 billion target. So, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, Christopher, for your questions, and obviously you touch on a very good point, and that's valid not only for securitization, but for all our business. The new environment, certainly, needs to reassess what &#x2013; how our business model is going to look into the future in different areas, and the additional capital charges certainly will demand that.</p>
          <p>And obviously in terms of your securitization question, we plan to continue in this business. We believe that securitizations are important for the world. It's a planning to &#x2013; we continue to believe that there will be a market, and we will definitely stay in this business as a market makeup. But, however, the volume of these positions that we hold will need to be lower and certainly we will need to be able to go to quick turns on those. So it will change the shape of it, very clearly.</p>
          <p>In terms of the Wealth Management, there was no specific cost issue in here. It was mainly driven by the usual seasonality in between your Q2 and Q3. It's a vacation months and therefore we have &#x2013; that mainly impacted this business. So that this is what happened with Wealth Management and nothing out of the ordinary, with a little higher run rate cost in this quarter as well.</p>
          <p>In terms of your compensation question, number one, we also acknowledged there is a lot of general pressure on the compensation topic. It continues to be also not only in the U.K., but also in Germany an area of focus. We will have to manage this. On the other hand, we see that the market continues to be very competitive, and top talent has its value and its price and we cannot ignore that fact. So we have found some formulas how we deal with it. I think there is some areas in terms of our business where we can effectively start reducing bonuses without weakening our competitive performance. This is mainly obviously in less competitive back-office functions and things like that.</p>
          <p>But we also have a significant new German law that basically rules the percentages between fixed and variable compensation, and within the variable compensation, fixes the percentage between cash and stock. And then, within those again rules deferred amounts and as trade paid out amounts, so quite complicated. We're assessing the implementation of this. It will have an impact on how compensation is structurally done.</p>
          <p>Overall, we believe though that if we comply with these rules that mainly aim, yes, to reduce the incentives of risk takers to take on short-term risk that we should not have a problem nor with governments, nor with regulators. I think that the spirit that we always understand out of the discussion is to make sure that the incentive structure is derived for a longer term, not short-term risk taking, and to trying an attempt to influence right behaviors. So therefore, I think if we comply with that and if we're able to prove to regulators and to our government that that's what our new compensation system is, and we comply with these rules, we expect that we will be able to manage that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I got it. Just as a follow-up there, Stefan, clearly no one would argue with your sentiments at all on this call I would suggest. But I think the comments we certainly heard in the UK are about absolute levels of compensation, which does suggest that we &#x2013; they will return to a bonus tax undoubtedly if we do go into a competitive round of bonuses. But anyway it's a &#x2013; there's no answer yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but it's quite interesting that the German law, for example, and the discussions we had with the German government did not provide any absolute level caps.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in that &#x2013; in the environment and the discussions we have had now the people understand that this is not something you can regulate or govern, but this is something the market &#x2013; at the end the market will define. But I think it's right for governments and it's right for our regulators to make sure that the incentive system drives the right behaviors. And I think that's what, bottom line, is what we are focusing on.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Kinner Lakhani from Citi. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Good morning. Yeah, I wanted to come back to slide 29 actually, and basically I wanted to understand what are your views in terms of the natural RWA inflation? Because obviously this analysis has been done based on the 277 billion of RWAs at the third quarter stage. So just wanted to get a feel of how you will think about natural RWA inflation over the coming years?</p>
          <p>Secondly, also if you have any views on capital requirements for systematically important financial institutions, of which I'm sure Deutsche Bank would be one? So if you have any kind of broader views on that? Secondly, would you &#x2013; what's your read of the kind of exposure in risk of Deutsche Bank to the kind of U.S. mortgage business, both from an origination standpoint, I remember you had a originating vehicle in the U.S., but also from a securitization point of view?</p>
          <p>And final, maybe if you could provide us with an update on how you're thinking about dividends for the current year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, Kinner, for your question. Let me start with your RWA question. Obviously, our simulations we said does not include any actions of growth that we plan to take outside, obviously on outside assets or anything. But again, this is always when you do a simulation, we have to base it or found it on a specific point in time. And therefore, obviously this is what this mess starts at this point &#x2013; but we &#x2013; that also does not include BHF sale, does also not include any divestments we might do, and does also not include to the down side of that, for example, any change or recalibration of our business model.</p>
          <p>So to some extent, I think it's a fair estimate of where we're going to be, because we will see chances and opportunities from both sides, in terms of increase and decrease. As we have described, it is important. It is important to take into account that obviously a simulation like that needs to be based on something, and we are somewhat limited in terms of what we can see, in terms forward looking statements as well.</p>
          <p>On systemically important banks, we understand that this will be covered outside of Core Tier 1 capital, but ultimately this is too early to tell. We know that we will be, if something like that, we will be a bank exposed to that, but again I defer to the longer-term implementation timeframe, which again, let's go back to what regulators and governments really intended to do is to give banks enough time to grow into these scenarios. So I think, as I have presented, we have ample room in our capital math that we have provided to you. As you know, we have not provided for any earnings growth, we used just analyst estimates and then projected them out. So I think there is some ample reserve to compensate if there will be some additional requirements to take.</p>
          <p>But I think you've heard Capital Market's estimates that range around a bank of our size being in the 8% to 10% capital requirement framework. And I think that would mirror our views, our current views as well, but taking into account the longer implementation time.</p>
          <p>Our exposure to the mortgage business &#x2013; and I mean to say that, obviously, we're aware there is much discussion in the markets regarding these mortgage-related issues. In our view, the discussion has been focused on two areas. Obviously, the impact &#x2013; the financial impact due to any defects in the mortgage foreclosure documents or foreclosure practices done by loan servicers; and second, the exposure to mortgage repurchase claims for alleged breaches of representations and warranties. These are from our point the two main areas of risk.</p>
          <p>With respect to the alleged defects in the mortgage foreclosure documents and practices, we do not expect here any significant exposure, because we do not have a U.S. mortgage loan servicing business. And as you know, our originator business is disbanded by now and closed by now. And therefore on mortgage repurchase claims, we currently have approximately US$780 million of pending mortgage for purchase demands, and we have reserve against these claims that we believe are more than adequate.</p>
          <p>And the last question was the update on dividends. I can give you my usual update in dividends as that obviously it's a decision of the Supervisory Board and the AGM, so therefore, we accrue always through the previous-year dividend policy, which is no indication of what our true dividend decision will be at year-end.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Can I just ask three questions? Firstly, about 19% of your level three assets got &#x2013; have been moved up to level two. Could you just share with us what's &#x2013; which instruments or any color you can on that move? Secondly, maybe if you can share any thoughts on Deutsche, or your perspectives on potential use of CoCos if that were to be a material part of the system at premium in the future? And then thirdly, I'll just go back to the mortgage repurchase issue. I'm sorry, I think I missed what reserve you had against the 780 million of pending claims? And does that also include the litigation, which ATO had been considering against Deutsche as well? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with your last question, we are not disclosing what the reserve levels are, but we are adequate. As you know, this is a business that we already seen sometime started to reduce and started to get out of in the U.S. This dates back as far as our decision in 2008, so in the process of disbanding this business and in the process of running of this mortgage origination entity we had in the U.S., we have reserved more than adequately for any risks. This was part of the disbanding of this, but at this point we're not providing, out of obvious reasons, we're not providing any numbers around that.</p>
          <p>On the level three assets, it's pretty much across the border. It's, obviously a big portion is derivatives, but that's also been a large portion in the level three assets, and we saw a migration, as markets had improved, the observable parameters for our models have increased. We have more observable parameters, so we had a significant move there that had something to do with the fact that we just got better assets in our models, the value of these assets.</p>
          <p>We are &#x2013; to your other question, we're looking at CoCos, but we don't have a firm view at this time either way. What we do believe that as a system, the financial industry should have CoCos available, but this will always depend on regulation. And then at the end of the day, it will also depend on the cost and how attractive in the funding an instrument of this nature will be.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Carston Werle, good morning. Two or three questions please. On page 28, you targeted management actions that you've already elaborated on in the call. What would you realistically expect to be the negative revenue impact from this, and what should we assume here?</p>
          <p>And then I would like to come back to the dividend question that we heard before. I mean I understand that actually you take the $0.75 per share dividend into your model until 2013 and not just as an accrual base for this year. Is this actually indicating that also from your side as well as from others who have already said so, we should expect a very low dividend years going forward?</p>
          <p>And last question, on the net new money and private wealth, I think we had another outflow of &#x20AC;3 billion. Perhaps you could shed some light where this is coming from, where you see inflows, where you see outflows. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Okay. So, the target management action we see that they will be all doable with really a limited P&amp;L effect. Let's not forget that some of them don't have a P&amp;L effect at all. This is the improvement side. This is the some of that. And then obviously some of them are related to legacy assets in which anyway the P&amp;L contribution is very limited. So the way that we have looked at management action was to carefully balance exactly what you say, and not to risk our future P&amp;L and our profitability. But obviously, for example, there will be some hedging cost. Sometimes, if you get risk-weighted assets reduction when your hedge booked up, there will be something like hedging cost. And certainly what we don't know exactly yet is, for example, a derivatives move to platform, what the revenue model will be there. But this is more future than existing P&amp;L at this point of time.</p>
          <p>So therefore, for example, if we look at the management action that's already planned for Basel 2.5, we don't anticipate an impact on our 10 billion target from all the discussed and agreed upon measures with our investment bank.</p>
          <p>On the dividend, I really have to ask you to bear with us. We've tried to provide some disclosure in a model like this. Obviously, we can't make any statements to any anticipated future dividends or share buybacks or anything. It is a simulation. It's a simulation; it should give you some indication for the size of the numbers, and therefore I have to very clearly say, the 75 basis points in the model do not imply any behavior of Deutsche Bank in terms of dividends.</p>
          <p>To the contrary, I can clearly state that we remain committed to be an organization that's very shareholder oriented in that sense, as we have shown in the past, and therefore, obviously we remain committed to as quickly as possible and as quickly as we can to move ahead with our dividend and with our payout ratios there. So please don't take the 75% as any indication of future behavior or as any indication showing any kind of management intent at this point.</p>
          <p>In terms of your net new money question, PBN, it's mainly in our European business where we had some outflows. This &#x2013; we think that what's happening underlying in this business quite some change especially in the &#x2013; this cross border business that was a strong in the past is changing. Therefore, we see some structural changes in that. And therefore, it's somewhat expected towards the month of September then we started to see a reverse in the strength. And therefore, we expect to regrow our portfolios by the way. This was also the first quarter where we had an improvement in the assets in our Sal. Oppenheim franchise as well.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Philipp Zieschang from UBS. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Three areas, please, all of which have already been touched on somewhat. Coming back to slide 21, and just to clarify, this is all before 2013 retained earnings? Also, the right part of the slide, the 8.1, if you front-loaded the deductions. And also related to that the comment on the organic growth was already, the question was already been asked, but this is also before any potential capital release at Postbank, and am I right in assuming that you continue to target roughly 40 billion as a core risk-weighted asset base for Postbank?</p>
          <p>That's the first part. The second one, sorry to come back on the divided, but you were quoted on Reuters as saying that 30% to 40% payout ratio on the Basel III is basically what you are aiming for. Is that a level which is very much medium term, or is that also depending on the business conditions over the next two to three years that you would aim to move towards these levels? I'm just asking because it was quoted.</p>
          <p>And the third one is on the complexity reductions. So if I got you right, you're saying that you have 1 billion in the bag or in your plan for 2012, the related implementation costs are somewhat only 100 &#x2013; only 420 or so to come, the rest has already been booked. But it reduces implicitly your 2010 target by 500, given that the 500 are going to come in 2012. How should we read it? Has it been fat because of the merger of the investment bank or you didn't include a potential contribution of Postbank &#x2013; or could you reconcile it to your 2011 target given that 5% have just been gone basically? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Philipp, let me go through &#x2013; your first, I mean, question on slide 21. It does include...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>29.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It does include the analyst income forecast for the periods of 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2018, so we did include obviously retained earnings, but not based on, I cannot even say, if you look at 2011 right now, at the lower analyst estimates versus what we have even put out there as our plan. So there is some reserve margin in the calculation from our point of view, because we use the much lower analyst estimates. And then yes, it's correct. Also these numbers do not include the risking effort. You alluded to Postbank; it's 30 billion by the way and not 40 billion that we think that we will get out of it, and also this math did not include any actions relating to that, which provides further buffers in terms of our calculation. So, current internal projections I can disclose to you show much better ratios than the ones in the simulation, but I cannot use our internal longer-term business plan and projections for obvious and non-reasons, so that's why we related it &#x2013; on that.</p>
          <p>In terms of the dividend, it's in line, which was what I just said. In the model trees we used the $0.75 because that's not giving, and the math shows what we anticipated what we have in the accrual this year, but it does not show, sorry, what we anticipate into the future. And at the end, yes, as I said, we remain very committed, and therefore if you were to ask me what an acceptable payout ratio were, I would reconfirm the 30% to 40%, which is something that Deutsche Bank has done in the past. And of course it is our aim to get back at that as quickly as possibly as we can. And we believe that the plan that we just showed you in terms of our capital development, and we believe that if we &#x2013; if you ask me about a couple of question that showed that you we have some results in this plan as well that we should be able to get back at that. Big caveat, I still have to do, we don't know what the government and regulatory environments' point of view on dividends will be. And that's something that certainly will somewhat remain outside a little bit of our control.</p>
          <p>On complexity reduction, again, in the 10 billion plan there was an assumption for our contribution of complexity reduction, which is not a full- year effect of 1 billion, because when we started the project, we knew that we were going to get &#x2013; start to have an impact on run rate saving. But normally, you might have 10% of the savings at the beginning of the year and 100% of the savings at the end of the year of implementation, which on average throughout the year will obviously not deliver to you the 100%. That's why we always use to word exit rate.</p>
          <p>I did want to include this time, a clarification of what exit rate really means. Exit rate means that the bank will be efficient by the end of the year 2011, will be more efficient by a &#x20AC;1 billion. And I can right now say, at least, because obviously we will get further contributions obviously through as you correctly said the CIB integration and the Postbank effect. But this will be exit rate; this means at the year-end that's the run rate savings we will have. But if you extrapolated during the course of the year 2011, you will not have full effectiveness of 1 billion, and on top of it, there will be, and that's also what I wanted to come clean with and clear with, there will be some costs to achieve these run-rate synergies, which will be booked in the years 2010 and 2011, respectively.</p>
          <p>Okay. So I just wanted to make sure that the market understands all the effects that it has. But again, this has absolutely no change to our 10 billion plan. And the impact was correctly calculated in the plan, and I alluded to additional upsides we have towards the plan relating obviously mainly to the CIB integration portion that's not included in any of our numbers and was not anticipated in the 10 billion plan, as well as then obviously something will have to then look into separately as soon as we can consolidate Postbank, which is then the first portion of the synergies that we might be able to realize after the consolidation that's taking place.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I got a few nitty-gritty questions. On slide 46, you show the number of shares, and the number of shares have gone up from the second quarter under common shares issued. And you have a note but admittedly I don't fully understand your notes, and I want to make sure I use exact share counts. In addition, it looks like the dilution effect is not in the numbers due to a loss, so I should assume that you still have 27 million additional shares there? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is on the page 29, on Postbank; clearly Postbank is using a standardized methodology and wants to go to internal, so if I look at CVA to securitization, where this model changed, how should I think about the risk-weighted assets of Postbank going forward on your numbers? Or have you already adjusted for standardization to internal on the market risk side?</p>
          <p>And the third question is on your IAS 39 assets, I see declines, and I was wondering if you actually have sold &#x2013; or the IAS 39 reclassification, if you have sold assets at this point. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I start on the IAS 39 assets, yes, we actually had sales in the third quarter and actually we had a positive P&amp;L contribution, a slight slim positive P&amp;L contribution, which again showed us that these assets are marked at right levels. If I look at the whole year, with third quarter substantially IAS 39 assets, we have to interrupt in the second quarter as markets become weak and volatile again, but we have sold a substantial part of that portfolio throughout the year at more or less breakeven, if I take the year-to-date effect. But in the third quarter, we had sales with positive P&amp;L.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In what areas was that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pretty much across. This is a portfolio of quite diversified assets and was pretty much across the different asset classes that we have in this portfolio. And then in terms of your share count, according as you know to IAS 33, if the capital increases, the subscription rights issue is performed, now at a price below the market price of the existing shares. The capital includes a bonus &#x2013; so-called bonus element. And this bonus element is viewed as an implicit change in the number of shares without a fully proportionate change in our resources. Therefore IAS 33 requires that the number of shares outstanding that we then have to use for the EPS calculation is adjusted for all periods before the capital increase. And this adjustment is already reported in the third quarter, because the subscription rights issue was performed before the 30th of September. So that's the background to this question.</p>
          <p>And then again, to your last question, which is the Postbank question. There is no adjustment for e Postbank in our simulation. Therefore, I stated there is further room to reduce risk-weighted assets that we did not include in our simulation at this point in time. As you may know, Postbank has already disclosed that their improvement, their move away from the standardized to the internal model, will provide a substantial reduction in terms of risk-weighted assets that will be positive in terms of this math as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I can maybe had one more question. Your Postbank equity pickup on slide 36, how &#x2013; I assume under your accounting standard you have to amortize that pickup? Is that correct in the P&amp;L?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So there is no adjustments over time on the under Postbank pickup; it's going through the P&amp;L?</p>

          <p>The next question is from Derek De Vries from Bank of America. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have two questions actually. The first comes to your outlook statement. Yesterday, UBS give us a pretty clear positive outlook on Q4. I've read through yours a couple of times; I'm a little bit more confused. I was hoping you could provide some clarity. You talk about volatile trading and downward correction in valuations, but you also had some positives in there. So, I was hoping you could just sort of clarify for me what you're trying to say on Q4 trading conditions in the outlook statement?</p>
          <p>And then coming over to a sort of copy and paste in your interim statement on the risks related to the U.S. mortgage situation, and I recognize that the comments are very much the same as last quarter. But I'm just wondering, when you talk about the litigation risk from securitizations that you've done for third parties, Fannie Mae, CountryWide, Wells Fargo, et cetera. At any point in the warehousing process or at any point that securitization would you have provided the representations and warranties on these mortgages, or is the risk just that you're being sued and people will try to prove that you breached securities laws and that's what we should be thinking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First of all, the outlook is as clear as the environment we're facing. So it's obviously very difficult to say, and it's still volatile. But I can put one line behind it, we are very positive, especially looking at the pipeline, especially looking at how the end of September has done and how our development has been. So in that sense, you should take it all with a positive note. We always have to cautious, because obviously, in either one or other areas there might be still issues, but in principle, we also remain positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now to your U.S. mortgage business, if we quickly go through the different roles you can have in it, and if we quickly say what our exposure is. Number one, Deutsche Bank is not a servicer. So in any discussions around the servicing of this mortgage portfolio, we have no exposure, because we have never been a servicer in the U.S., and we are not a servicer of pieces of paper.</p>
          <p>On the loan origination, we had in this company in the U.S. that we disbanded in the crisis. We put obviously there, but in the process already that we underwent already as we disbanded this business, we have had litigation, and we've dealt with this litigation, and its part of the closure of this business. Obviously we provided for what we think will be needed to completely disband this business. We don't expect therefore any information. Obviously, that could be legally an exposure there, but again, it's in our view covered.</p>
          <p>Then as a trustee, obviously, what we are in the U.S., we are a trustee, and the role of trustee is pretty clear forward. What the trustee issue brings to us mainly is reputational risk, as you know in the United States, because as a trustee you appear to be the one foreclosing, although the servicer is the one that's doing all the foreclosure process. You are the owner of this mortgage, or the holder of this mortgage, to say it correctly. And therefore, you have more reputational exposure. We will see, but we don't expect any large exposure to this part.</p>
          <p>And then if we go into the securitization, of course as a market maker in the securitization area, there could be obviously exposure to discussions around legal claims around representations that may have been done. But there might obviously &#x2013; and therefore, obviously what we expect if then there's litigation on the securities rather than on the loan, so you don't expect to be exposed to the loans. But the situation is still unclear. Some of these claims have been made, but to be honest, it's really difficult to see how substantial these claims and real these claims will really be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So just to be clear it's a last area which you're &#x2013; which you perceive as a potential area would be, people coming and saying, look these underlying securities weren't as we understood them to be, and it's not so much the individual loans themselves, it's just the process of what got put in there. Is that correct, or am I oversimplifying it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. It's absolutely right that we don't because of our roles in this type of transaction. We don't expect exposure in our out of the structured services in terms of the securities that we issued based on these assets. And therefore, there's the question how big is the risk, therefore, because who you sell these assets, if you sell securities too -- the knowledge of &#x2013; around these assets should be pretty far reached. So and again, but there's really too early to assess what at the end of the day a court could make a decision.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Jernej Omahen from Goldman Sachs International. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Jernej here from Goldman Sachs. I just have two questions left. Essentially, the first one is very straightforward. I think that you commented that on Deutsche Postbank, you're just above 30% shareholding currently, which is where you want to be. Can I just ask these, I guess, by now the question asked many times, which is what makes you or what makes Deutsche Bank rather so certain that you will get to a high enough acceptance level to fully consolidate Deutsche Postbank? And furthermore, if we look at the slides from the acquisition announcement date, you actually get to say, 80%, 90%, et cetera. Can you just clarify that for us please?</p>
          <p>And then the next question is on now slide 28 of your presentation. And I was just wondering the total targeted management action for risk-weighted asset reduction of 90 billion. How much of that 90 billion is actually just, in a sense, just passive measures? And what I mean by that is, how much of your securitization and correlation books essentially just roll-off. I am asking the question, what is the roll-off rate per year, let's say, of the assets that you want to get rid of. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me clarify the Postbank question first. When we made the announcement, we provided some math in which we implied a 21 point take-up just because that's what is the, let's say, natural and straightway to consolidation getting us to 50 plus of ownership of Postbank straightaway, and therefore enabling us to consolidate straightaway. This is not intended to be our estimate of how much shares will get tendered, because to be honest we don't know. We don't know. So, but as you know there are many roads to Rome, and they all will lead to Rome, and therefore we are confident that we will be able to consolidate Postbank. And all I can disclose at this point in time, we have plans and assumed different paths that will lead us to the consolidation. Yeah, so the take-up itself in achieving the 50 plus, is only one of these tests.</p>
          <p>And in terms of your roll-off questions, of course there will be a roll-off, but looking at the time frames there is obviously a smaller part, I can really say that's effective in 2011. And then obviously as we continue on in 2012, there is a larger part that is a natural roll-off. But only to say it very clearly, it's the management action that's active instead of passive. It's much larger than the management action that &#x2013; what you call the passive action would be, much larger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot and that's very clear. So just a short follow-up on that note, given that all investment banks are essentially talking about identical management action, particularly when it comes to securitization book, is there on your side any anxiety as to the execution risk on this point or not really?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, number one, I think you asked a very, very good question, because if we add up all the plans of the risking of all the global banks, they are certainly quite substantial. We believe that there is a market for this. We believe that based on the fact that these -- many of these assets &#x2013; just we have to accept a regulated bank is not the best holding entity for this type of assets in the future under this regime. But we believe that there are enough other, let's say, entities for whom an ownership of these now market &#x2013; low market value and high potential future revaluation value might get. So that's why we're not too concerned.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Couple more clarification questions, please. Firstly on your 780 million residential put-back request, can you just confirm that that includes all GAC requests, mononline requests, and any private investor requests, so that's everything? Secondly under the Basel III, 185 billion growth impact, could you give us a split between the CVA impact and the securitization components there?</p>
          <p>And then finally just on the CB&amp;S division's results compared to the prospectus guidance that you gave for the summer, the outturn was much better both in revenues and costs than I interpreted on the perspective. I am just wondering whether I misinterpreted the perspective guidance or if not, what changed, what were the drivers? I mean you said, you had a much better trading result in September, but what product areas, and why didn't you have higher costs associated with that better trading result? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the 780 million, I have previously said it doesn't include monoline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's not included. On the 185 billion, we don't split it into different, but securitization is bigger than CVA, as I had referenced in my work. But we don't &#x2013; we will not provide a split at this point in time. And then on your CB&amp;S, it was really that way when we issued the prospectus, which obviously was work done before the month of September. We were looking at two months that obviously had a thoroughly weaker result, as I also alluded to in my speech.</p>
          <p>And then towards the end of the quarter we had quite an improvement in conditions, but second, also one of &#x2013; I referred to one of them being the actual spring sale that provided a significant P&amp;L, as well as some other transactions that could be then concluded towards the end of September, which were not foreseeable and where decisions had made. Therefore, I think it fit very well to what we said in the prospectus and in later updates, when we gave later updates. We already told you that on the revenue side, for example, in our CB&amp;S business, we are seeing a stronger result coming in September as compared to the previous month. At the time of issuance of the prospectus, the data available was July-August data that have shown the significant slowdown.</p>

          <p>And have you changed any of your compensation accrual formulas since the prospectus? It wasn't that you migrated more of the fixed components or something that will &#x2013; so more of its &#x2013; okay. Thank you very much.</p>
