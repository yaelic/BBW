          <p>Thank you and welcome to Nordea's Telephone Conference in relation to our Q1 Results out earlier this morning.</p>
          <p>Together with me here in the room in Stockholm we have our CEO, Christian Clausen, CFO; Arne Liljedahl, and Chief Risk Officer, Carl-Johan Granvik. Christian Clausen will make a fairly short summary of results in like 10 minutes and then we will move into Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>So please, Christian.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and welcome to this press conference. The financial scene in the first quarter 2008 was in general characterized by increasing turbulence and challenging financial markets. I am, therefore, very pleased that we, under these circumstances, have been able to continue to grow our business, to increase our revenues and to improve our results before loan losses.</p>
          <p>We also show that we are consistently following our plans when it comes to both income, growth and cost development and we are maintaining our financial outlook for 2008. I will now go through the presentation, which is available on the Net and give a few extra comments.</p>
          <p>On the first slide we note that our growth strategy is on track. We are delivering and we see income growth is up 5%, risk adjusted profit is up 1%, profit before loan losses up 3% and for the first quarter in more than 15 quarters, for the 16th quarter now, we see loan losses change time and we have real loan losses &#x20AC;21 million. Net profit is down 2% and return on equity is 15.8%.</p>
          <p>Nordea has managed the challenging market conditions also in the first quarter of 2008 and this is due very much to the liquidity strategy, which we have had in place for several years, our diversified funding basis and our lending portfolio with the retail profile. This means that we even today are acting in the funding market on favorable terms. We note that we only a few weeks ago issued a Euro cover bond at prices which were quite similar to those in November at around mid to upper class 11 points. We have no maturity of Tier 1--Tier 2 capital in 2008 and we have one of the lowest credit for swap spreads in Europe right now, which clearly is evidencing that there's a good trust and confidence in Nordea's funding efforts.</p>
          <p>We see limited negative impact from the turmoil. We have estimated some 30 million effect of fair value assessment in the trading portfolio in the trading book and then we have these &#x20AC;23 million in negative results from our guarantee to Norwegian export finance. Export finances in Norwegian semi-public export financing vehicle, which were backed by a guarantee from its shareholders during March because of the financial turmoil and all the main shareholders stood up for this and they are the Norwegian States and some of the large Nordic Banks and some smaller Norwegian banks.</p>
          <p>The liquidity remains strong. We have a positive net balance of stable funding, meaning that we have positive funding for the longer maturities about six months, and we have a liquidity power of more than &#x20AC;20 billion at the end of March available.</p>
          <p>Operating income is up 5%, excluding export finance it's up 6% and it's very much driven by net interest income coming from higher corporate lending margins and very strong growth, also from Russia. Net commission income is down 7% reflecting that we see a shift in customer demand where they move out of retail funds with high risk into mainly deposits, savings deposits, and this means that the savings commissions on -- is down quite a lot with 15%, but it's then reflected on the other hand around net interest income.</p>
          <p>Payment commission is up 6% and net gains/losses are nearly unchanged despite the challenging market conditions and the seasonal lower level in Q1. Cost increases in line with our guidance at 6.4% equal to last year and excluding the Russian operation, which was not part of the consolidated P&amp;L in Q1. Last year it was only 4.5%.</p>
          <p>Profit before loan losses is up 3% and it's due to strong momentum in both the Nordic and the new European markets. We still -- we see very limited credit losses of &#x20AC;21 million, mainly due to the fact that we see lower reversals. The new provisions remain at a low level and this goes for all our markets. We have a clear direction for Nordea moving for good to great. I will not repeat the strategy. I will just give some highlights on our financial targets and growth strategy and how it's doing.</p>
          <p>And the next slide shows that we, on our financial targets, have three long-term financial targets, in TSR, risk adjusted profits and ROE and in TSR we have the target to be in the top quartile of our European peer group. We are just outside that in Q1 with number 8. Risk-adjusted profit and increase of doubling in seven years, which we are following 15% last year and four quarter rolling average, we are at 16% now. ROE, to be in line with top Nordic peers we are 15.8. We haven't seen all the peers but I think it compares favorable to the ones we have seen.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows that if we take the total share of the return since the target was adopted to be in the top quartile, then since the first of January 2007 we are actually in the top of the top quartile. The risk adjusted profit is going up. We have 1% increase in Q1 but adjusting for its profit and it's actually 5% and, as I said, 16% on the four quarter average.</p>
          <p>Return on equity is 15.5. The reduction from last year is mainly due to the higher equity we have in Q1 prior to the dividend payout in April and also due to the fact that we have now net loan losses.</p>
          <p>Our organic growth, the strategy is well known and rests on the four pillars, moving up customers in the segment in the Nordic area, selective global and European businesses and new European markets and then a number of efficiency projects to support the growth and mostly also to free up resources to finance the growth.</p>
          <p>I will give a few comments to some of the most important initiatives. First of all, our growth in the Gold segment, which is a main engine for profitable growth for Nordea, you see the number of customers is up 7% and volume per customer another 7. It's clearly following our track and it's convincing.</p>
          <p>Growth in Sweden is also delivering. We have now for sometime focused on Sweden, where we have a significant number of customers per employee and in order to improve the penetration here we are increasing number of advisors and that is clearly giving result now. We have a higher income growth than our peers both last year and now in Q1. This will continue in 2008 where we add further advisor capacity and also convert the 76 branches of Svensk Kassaservice, which will nearly double our capacity in the Stockholm area and increase in the other areas.</p>
          <p>Private banking continues to deliver. You see strong growth in the number of customers by 13%. Of course, it's impacted by the negative equity markets, but income holds up very well, which is very satisfying to see. The call-back customer activity has been particularly high in Q1. It's up, income is up 18% and we are clearly gaining some market shares in top corporate segments. Its successful execution of our customer teams strategy and of course also the strength of Nordea into these market circumstances with our strong balance sheet we are available for our good corporate customers.</p>
          <p>We see margins, a shift in the margin trend during the quarter and we expect margins to increase going forward. Also, our risk management products to corporate customers are increasing. It's an important part of the strategy, so it's not only leading it's also a number of other important product areas, which actually shown significant growth to corporate clients.</p>
          <p>Our business grows well in the new European markets. We opened 11 branches in Poland in Q1, continue the growth with 40% in Poland, good increase in the number of customers and it's interesting to see that as we go by and open new branches we even see the cost income ratio to go down and actually agrees with 3%, which is close to the Nordic area, the Nordic level.</p>
          <p>So the outlook for 2008, the increased turmoil in the financial markets are increasing, the uncertainty about the growth in real economy in Europe and the Nordic area. We still experience very high customer activity in almost all areas. We expect lending growth to be somewhat lower but still at a high level for the rest of the year and we expect margins to increase. So we keep the financial outlook unchanged and that is that risk-adjusted profit is expected to grow in the range of 5 to 10%.</p>
          <p>We continue to execute our growth strategy and our investment plans, which means that cost growth is expected to be somewhat higher this year. And finally for the year, we expect some net loan losses as the reversals is going to be less this year.</p>
          <p>So concluding, our growth strategy is on track, income growth is continued and profit before loan losses increased. We have managed the changing market conditions also in the first quarter and we have a strong fronting in liquidity position. We have high customer activity and continued strong growth in volumes and sustained growth in our risk-adjusted profits. The overall quality of the credit portfolio remains strong and we keep our financial outlook unchanged.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Christian. Then we are ready to open up for questions.</p>
        </plist>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from Mikael Hall&#xE5;ker from Handelsbanken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Mikael Hall&#xE5;ker from Handelsbanken Capital Markets. I have three short questions, if I may. First of all, regarding the credit risk and the provisioning. Your key competitor, Danske Bank, made a very large, around &#x20AC;50 million, group provision regarding Denmark and obviously also Nordea around 20 million are much, much more and then the lending book is bigger. I would like to hear your thoughts about the risk side and especially Denmark where economic growth seems to be slowing down quite heavily? The second question is regarding the margins, you're saying that margins are increasing. I'd like to hear which products are and mainly which geographical areas do you see this happening? And the third question would be that, if you can shed some light a bit more, you have a portfolio of &#x20AC;30 billion and you're booking a loss of only 30 million on that, how is that possible? One could think that losses should be larger than that. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, first start with the credit portfolio. We actually already last year took quite some sizable provisions for certain areas, including some in Denmark as well and, therefore, we have not seen any reason for increasing provisions on any particular group of assets in this quarter. We showed, as you've seen in the representations, small losses in all the countries, including Denmark, but they're there on the moderate level and the quality of the portfolio is also supported by the fact that there has not been any increase in paid loans in this quarter. So the situation is still very solid and as we've stated, looking forward, that unless there would be a significant change to the macroeconomic forecast, we believe that we will be able to maintain it on this level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, your second question on the margins, I would say that it's mainly the corporate lending margins we are pointing at and that too goes all over the market places where we operate. We see actually the possibility to increase corporate margins all over. Your third question about the estimated losses due to the market turmoil, one first of all should see that &#x20AC;30 million as a net loss, of course are -- have been in some circumstances a positive impact on the market turmoil when it comes to the business activity in some areas and we have our portfolio &#x20AC;30 billion in fixed income is our market. A major part of that is our trading book with a very high turnover and then during this period we have seen spreads widening and also tightening in some periods, so this is a net of our activity. And then I think the main reason is that we don't have any long-term investment portfolio. This is a trading book with a very high turnover and it varies a lot from day-to-day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. If I just may on the lending margins still, is it fair to say in your opinion that Sweden has the toughest competition regarding corporate lending at the moment in the areas where you operate at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all I think it -- you can see from our customer segment reporting where we do report very strong increases actually, not in geographical terms now but on customer segmentation, on the very largest corporates. On the corporate merchant at large, there, you see a quite a significant increase and less so on small and medium size, that having goes for the whole region. Then there about Sweden <mark type="inaudible" /> I don't know if you'd like to comment on that... .</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have experienced quite tough competition all over. But now all banks realize that their increasing funding costs will lead to a higher cost for the customers as well as also possibility to dividing the margins in most markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, very helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Johan Eckblom from Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello, Johan Eckblom from Merrill Lynch. Just three quick questions, if I may. First of all coming back to the provisions, in the Baltics you show growth that is well above what we see in the larger banks in the region report and yet you have no provisions at all in the region. If you'd like to comment on the outlook there and especially and even if you're not seeing the credit losses today, if there is sharp cuts to GDP growth estimates shouldn't have an impact on your provisions there? Secondly, as of later this year when you take over the control of the branches from Svensk Kassaservice, what impact do you expect on the financials? Should it be limited or will this allow you to accelerate your exploitation of those customers or better cross sell to these customers? And then, lastly, in terms of capital you reiterated your target of a 6.5% tier 1 target. We've seen several banks come out in the last couple of weeks and significantly increased their tier 1 capital targets under Basel II, more or less implying that capital relief is unlikely to happen at all? Are you still comfortable and, if so, why should Nordea be able to run with a significantly lower capital ratio relative to Nordic peers? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I start again with the provisioning, if you remember surely that last year, we made a general provision for the portfolio, the Baltic countries amounting to &#x20AC;80 million and we have maintained that during this quarter. We have not seen any reason to increase this that even if we have seen a slight increase in non-performing loans, but that is exactly for the purpose for which we did this general provision. And, on an individual basis there were still very few losses indeed. I think the combined loss amount for Baltics was in the ranging of &#x20AC;1 million for this quarter that just booked as a materialized loss. So we feel that the buffer we have still is adequate in terms of the expected downturn in the economy, which we indeed subscribe to what you said, that it seems like it's going to come but we feel that we are prepared and we were sort of early out compared to maybe some of our competitors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And a few comments on Svensk Kassaservice, we will see a gradual effect. The reason why we have this focus on Sweden is that we have more customers per employee in Sweden than we have in other countries, so in order to penetrate the customer base we simply need more advisors. We also need more contact points because we also have fewer contact points. So through the agreement with Svensk Kassaservice, what we actually do is we nearly double the number of points of contact in Stockholm area and increase throughout the country also. We increase the number of advisors by taking over people and hiring new and this means we gradually in the coming period after this is being executed throughout the autumn this year. Then from early next year that we will see growth from Sweden continue, meaning that we will be able to advise more customers, get them up as in our customer program as gold customers or private banking customers and this is clearly our experience that to have the more advisors and have the more customer contacts clearly increased the business volumes and the income. So I think the effect is expected to be seen over 2009 and 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And your third question about our tier 1 target, we have deliberately chosen not to adjust our tier 1 target yet. We will do that during this year. And the reason is that the tier 1 target on 6.5 should be seen related mainly to Basel I. We are now gradually moving into Basel II and we not yet implemented Basel II on whole our portfolio. So our retail banking book will be hopefully approved during this year and the tier 1 rate -- it would be also, we state in our report that we expect the reduction from Basel I will be in the area around 35% when we have fully implemented our RB models. With the same tier 1 capital that will lead to a tier 1 ratio in the area of 9.7, 9.8 so we will, of course, when we are -- have come through our discussion around the consequences of pillar 2 come up with a adjustment of our tier 1 target.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Per Gr&#xF8;nborg from Danske.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. This is Per Gr&#xF8;nborg from Danske. Two questions, first of all related to your retail business, Finland, your net interest income have now been flat or further declining for three quarters. What's happening in Finland? Is it first place, you're on the very last deposit base you have up there? What is the key reason why the weak net interest income? The second question is related to your life and life insurance operations. When I look at this what you slide said that you have put on the net, it looks your, well in traditional insurance that your fee from distributions for last profit sharing is roughly unchanged in the first quarter versus last year. Does this imply that you have taken out full risk allowance and I also allowed to, do that in the statuary accounting for the different companies in the different countries or have you actually booked it without being allowed to take it in the local statuary accountings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I talk to your first question on Finland. The main driver on the development in net interest income is the development on our transaction account and savings accounts in Finland on deposit side. We have seen a slight drop of our transaction accounts by the good inflow into savings accounts really, of course, lower margins. So that put a pressure on the net interest income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it also the general price war in -- on deposits in Finland, which I guess to a large extent, was initiated by counting or was that more noise in the press than it is reality in the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's more -- I mean, we have been offered competitive rates on our deposits all the time and I think it's more now the shift in that we actually -- we have a higher portion of savings accounts in our deposit base. It will be lower margins and lower portion of transactions accounts, it's very high margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And your question on life, just talked to it, of course, we have not included in our -- nothing that we're not allowed to in our statutory accounts. If I understood you right, you refer to our change in financial buffers or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I referred to slide 27 in your fact slides where you show the fee and profit sharing contribution for traditional life, 47 million in the first quarter. I would assume that when your Danish Life issuance company had a return that was below the guaranteed return imply that you were to allowed to take out any profit sharing from that portfolio...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No that was the case. We were able to take -- this may refer to our profit sharing model we have in Norway so that, it's a lower contribution from the profit sharing in Norway in this quarter compared to the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But was normalized profit share both on Denmark and Sweden?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank You,</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Per Lofgren from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. First, one follow-up question here from my side and that relates to Johan's question on capital there. Following this logic that you used like the 6.5% tier 1 target and the Basel I 35%-ish risk weighted reduction leads to a 9.8% on the Basel II but going to set that later. I'm just curious if you could elaborate a little bit on this potential 35% capital release under the current circumstances, if you can shed some light to the -- I don't know, the sensitivity in the model that you see some reason. If you go from an environment with GDP of 2 down to 1, I don't know, it would be very, very helpful to get some -- get a feeling for the sensitivity in this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that it is so that we can calculate fairly accurately how much our risk weighted assets are going -- expected to come down when we have fully implemented the credit part of Basel II but we still don't know fully the implications for pillar 2. The FSAs have not clearly decided the amount of stress test capital which is needed and they are not decided on how diversification effects can be deducted and as long as we don't have a clear view on pillar 2, which we will have during the year I guess, then it's difficult to set up the clear target for tier 1 capital at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But if anything that you expect?</p>

          <p>Yeah, we expect to set a new target when we have clarity on what the rules actually are but, as I say, they're not quite clear on these elements in the pillar 2 and, therefore, the actual tier 1 capital need is not quite obvious. That what can calculate is, of course, in our own model how much we think we need and we can calculate also quite precisely that the 35% reduction in risk weighted assets, so it's something we will set during the year when we know exactly how the FSAs are interpreted in these two pillar 2 areas.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Perhaps relating to Per's questions somewhat, I see here that you dissolved some buffers of 739 million from the life insurance business here in the quarter, which brings the net gains and losses on items at fair value up to 280 million. Could you remind me about the conditions and circumstances how we can dissolve these buffers and bring them back into the P&amp;L please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That difference from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, that was the total of the financial buffers that was released during the quarter. It's actually -- it's mainly related to operations in Denmark and Norway.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is this something which you can have, which you can keep also throughout up and including the yearend, so to speak, or does the yield on your portfolios need to surpass some special levels in order for you to keep those also at the turn of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, it's dependent on the -- yield on the investment because the financial buffers now are at 6.7 of the provisions with the bonus rights and at a certain level, of course, you need to assure that you don't get lower than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so obviously they're -- if markets were to deteriorate, continue to deteriorate, throughout the year here obviously this would need to be reversed during the latter part. Am I right in that assumption?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. This is Chintan Joshi from Lehman Brothers. I notice that you've taken a 23 million charge on export finance. I was just wondering if you could explain the implication of this guarantee consortium on future profits and also if the 5 to 10% of growth in risk adjusted profit guidance includes this loss? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your first, we have entered into a guarantee consortium as a minority owner in this Norwegian export finance and our total exposure on that guarantee is &#x20AC;145 million. The owner -- the consortium guarantee, the market risk in the company but it's limited to 145 and, of course, dependent on the market development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if the markets deteriorate and they take more hits on their liquidity portfolio there's a potential for the losses regarding export finance?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi I think we've gone through most of the stuff, but can we just have a follow-on question? In Finland where we hear at Dansk is having big IT problems can you just tell us if there's anecdotal evidence that you're gaining clients or if you see a big, big numbers moving over?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think their numbers are big when they talk about private individuals but obviously they also talk about huge sort of total customer base, so I think we cannot say that we will even see impact from this in the next quarter, but overall both the other big banks are benefiting from customers moving their business over and also what has been evidenced in the last few weeks or last couple of weeks exceedingly corporate customers that are moving their cash management business because they have not got the service that they need, for instance, for paying salaries to their employees, so -- and we believe that that can stay on and benefit our business going forward but obviously they know that bank customers move slowly so you cannot see some big exodus happening but a positive impact.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Can I just ask a question about the lending growth? In the fact book I think it's page 35. I just wondered if you could go through, I think you're saying that you're expecting lending technical corporate lending to slow down but to remain at a high level. Could you explain why you're so optimistic, given that you think growth is slowing quite markedly and what there are risks to that and whether any particular industries you're worried about? And also, could you talk about your consumer loan business, which is growing very strongly and I am assuming that's all unsecured and what you're doing to kind of mitigate any potential rise in impairments there? And then also if you could talk about private equity because I think you've got a &#x20AC;6 billion portfolio and whether there's any deterioration or how comfortable you are? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I thought on the expectation lending what we have said is that we expect the accumulated lending growth to slow down somewhat in the rest of the year. We are now 40, 50% lending growth and, of course, we will still see strong -- good growth rates in all markets and not least we have this lending growth been supported by new European markets in Poland and Russia. We are -- we expect that to be a little bit lower at the latter part of this year but still double-digit volume growth. And on the consumer lending it's a combination of collateralized and non-collateralized. A high part of that actually collateralized consumer lending, so we haven't seen any-- and remember that that is consumer loans to our existing customers that we can offer and to keep it under all they'll have, so it's very little apparent risk on those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the leveraged funds portfolio, there's not been any change in the quality of that during the quarter. The new business in that sector has slowed down from what we saw last year. We can see that also in the amount of fees that we are collecting in that business, one reason being that people are still waiting for prices on objects to go down and therefore not as eager to pay out. Another reason may be that they consider finance to be expensive and finance did not be so unavailable as it was last year, so I think it all plays in the favor of the banks when it comes to quality but when it comes to quantity high volumes it's an area where we see lower growth this year than we saw for last year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

          <p>The next question comes from Henrik Schmidt from KBW.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. This is Henrik Schmidt from KBW. I was just flipping through the presentation and on page 34 you have the change in net interest income and I was looking at Q1 over Q4 and on that slide, it looks like most of the improvement is coming from increasing lending volumes. But then when I actually look at the different divisions you have falling net interest income in Nordic banking. I think Norway was pretty much down a place where it was up. Then institutional and international banking was up slightly, 4 million, and then other customer operations were flat quarter-on-quarter and then the improvement in net interest income came from the Group corporate center and from Group functions and eliminations. But there is very little lending growth allocated to those two divisions, so I'm just -- how does that work out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's if you compare the slide 34 you should look at also the other net, which is a net of a number of things and overall there is -- we have one day less in this quarter and that is a reduction of net interest income in the business area. We also have a net, net increased earnings on our equity but on the other hand in the business areas, it's in their retained earnings to deliver lower returns in the beginning of the year, so that is also a negative impact. So if you add a number of things together, you end up with the numbers. But your overall reflection is, of course, correct that it's seen also business there but we see that this is a very strong beginning of the year with being able to have the same net interest income development in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, which normal usually is very strong due to the fact that we have one day more and also the rates on the retained earnings, they are becoming bigger and bigger throughout the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the underlying would have been better even under normal circumstances but then you have this negative effect from one day less?</p>
