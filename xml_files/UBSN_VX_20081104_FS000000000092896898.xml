          <p>Welcome to UBS' Presentation of our third quarter results. After the presentation by John, we will take questions from the phone and the webcast audience. Here is an important disclaimer. Please take a few moments to read it.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand over to John Cryan, CFO of UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Philip and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Before I take you through the numbers for Q3, I thought I might say few words on my priorities after two months in the CFO's seat. Having experienced a near shutdown of the funding and liquidity market in late September, and early October, we are finally seeing them improve. Tentatively, day-by-day, as the enormous weight of government intervention gains effects.</p>
          <p>However, the markets remain powerless and still heavily dependent upon Central Bank facilitation. The ongoing process of de-leveraging, lower asset prices across most markets and economic uncertainty are now affecting revenues across all of our businesses.</p>
          <p>Though it seems likely that the global economy will continue to deteriorate for some time to come, answers to questions about how deep the recessional be, for how long it will last, the impact will have on the banking sector all remain unclear.</p>
          <p>As a management team, therefore, we have to remain flexible in our responses. And we are tightly managing those aspects of the business, over which we have control. So what are our priorities? First, we will continue to seek generally to de-risk the business for some time to come being responsive to market developments.</p>
          <p>Our agreement with the Swiss National Bank to sell-off up to $60 billion of legacy illiquid asset positions other assets, particularly those related to the US real estate market is clearly a major step in this direction, but we remain vigilant. We have made significant progress in de-risking our Investment Bank.</p>
          <p>Since June 2007, we have reduced its balance sheet by over $700 billion. Just this reduction in itself would represent the balance sheet of a mid-sized Investment Bank. However, we're not yet at the stage where we feel comfortable that the Investment Bank is at the right scale to operate most effectively given the current economic climate. So you should expect that we will continue to shrink its balance sheet somewhat in the future.</p>
          <p>The next priority is capitalization. We are in advanced discussions with our lead regulator, the EBK our new target capitalization ratios to come into effect in the medium term. We expect that the agreement will involve us maintaining a larger capital buffer, calculated on a Basel II basis over and above the regulatory minimum.</p>
          <p>We also expect to have to meet balance sheet leverage ratios. Our expectation at present is that the leverage ratio will uses its numerator, the Tier-1 capital balance calculated by reference to the Basel II rules.</p>
          <p>The denominator that will be our balance sheet footings adjusted for certain items. We expect to reach agreement on the details of the new capital regime soon. We envisage that we will continue to reduce our risk asset positions and carrying values. And that we will bolster our regulatory capital base through retained earnings.</p>
          <p>On funding and liquidity, we remained focused on generating liquidity internally by selling down or running off illiquid balance sheet positions. We're open, we have sort to tape the term funding markets and in third quarter, we raised almost CHF20 billion of new term funding. Our deposit base remains a significant source of liquidity. Deposit balances at the end of the quarter stood at CHF520 billion.</p>
          <p>Finally, we are working hard to reduce our cost-base. By far the largest element of our expenses is personnel related. We have significantly reduced our head count across all our businesses and cut our rate of bonus accrual, especially in asset management and in the Investment Bank.</p>
          <p>I will now cover these points in some detail by taking you through our presentation on the third quarter results, and on the effect of the transaction with the Swiss National Bank and our proposed new capital raising.</p>
          <p>Here the highlights of Q3. We brought down the balance sheet by some CHF83 billion or by around 4% of the opening balance sheet on the 1st of July. Virtually all of the reduction was in the Investment Bank. The achievement was all the greater if you make allowance for the fact that the U.S. dollar, in which form we hold much of our investment banking assets, appreciated by some 8% over the quarter.</p>
          <p>Excluding assets representing replacement values of our derivatives portfolios, which increased as a result of spread widening, heightened volatilities and the foreign exchange effect, the balance sheet came down by over CHF200 billion in the quarter, equivalent to around 14% of the opening adjusted balance sheet footings.</p>
          <p>The disclosed risk concentrations came down by over $13 billion in the quarter, largely as a result of sales of illiquid securities for cash. Good progress was made on bringing down Group expenses, which were just over CHF6 billion for the third quarter.</p>
          <p>On the 16th of October we announced the sale of up to $60 billion of legacy risk positions and other assets. We also announced our conditional placement of CHF6 billion of Tier 1 capital to the Confederation of Switzerland.</p>
          <p>As already announced, we made a profit attributable to UBS shareholders just short of CHF300 million for the quarter. The overall result is not satisfactory, though it does represent some improvement over the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Key items impacting the third quarter result were a further CHF4.8 billion of write-downs and losses on our risk positions, a gain from own credit of CHF2.2 billion and a tax credit of over CHF900 million.</p>
          <p>Adjusting for the non-recurring nature of the write-downs and the own credit gains, operating income for the core business came in at approximately CHF8 billion, somewhat lower than in previous quarters, but in step with market conditions. Fee and commission income declined by 8% to 5.7 billion, mainly driven by lower portfolio and other management and advisory fees and a sharp decline in underwriting fees.</p>
          <p>This slide charts the progress we made in managing our personnel numbers in the third quarter. Across all divisions, head count fell by almost 1,900. The biggest contribution was from Wealth Management U.S., where numbers fell by 701, including 182 financial advisors. Much of this reduction was the result of the take up of redundancy rights under a voluntary severance program.</p>
          <p>The Investment Bank saw a reduction of 574 in the context of an ongoing cost reduction program. Here the number was partly offset by the annual graduate intake. Business Banking Switzerland's personnel count was down 269 and Wealth Management International and Switzerland was down 248, of which 69 were Client Advisors.</p>
          <p>We expect the Group's staff complement to fall by a further 3,000 or so from current levels to reach approximately 76,500. Some two-thirds of the further reduction relate to the Investment Bank's announcement of the 3rd of October and are expected to be implemented before year end.</p>
          <p>The remaining 1,000 positions are in areas outside of the Investment Bank and form part of the 2,900 job cuts we announced in May. The bulk of that number will come in time from natural attrition. Factoring in the further 2,000 job cuts in the Investment Bank, the staff count in that division will fall to 17,000, approximately 75% of the peak level.</p>
          <p>Reported Group operating expenses fell significantly quarter-on-quarter, though this is distorted by the inclusion in Q2 of three significant one-off items. First was the charge for the auction rate security settlement of CHF919 million.</p>
          <p>Second was the write-off of goodwill in an amount of CHF341 million previously held against our U.S. Muni Bond business, the closure of which we announced in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally, there was the release of CHF256 million of an accrual for deferred compensation consequent upon a planned change to forfeiture rules within our deferred comp plans.</p>
          <p>Reversing out these non-recurring items reveals an underlying expense run rate for Q2 of approximately CHF7.1 billion. Q3's reported expense total at just over CHF6 billion represents a 15% reduction compared with the underlying Q2 figure.</p>
          <p>The biggest component of the reduction in Q3 was in personnel expenses. This mainly reflects lower accruals for performance related compensation and mainly in the IB. Salary costs were also lower because of lower staff levels.</p>
          <p>Overall, total compensation expenses fell by 13% compared with the prior quarter, and by 18% adjusting for the release of the accrual for deferred compensation in Q2. You should also remember that the full effect of the head count reductions has yet to come through in the numbers. G&amp;A expenses came down in every single category except for one, and that was professional fees.</p>
          <p>Moving on to invested assets. In Global Wealth Management &amp; Business Banking, aggregate invested assets declined by CHF74 billion or by around 4% during the quarter. They were most heavily impacted by negative market performance, particularly in September. This was despite strong positive FX effects mainly from the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Swiss Franc.</p>
          <p>Weak markets also contributed to net new money outflows, which were 49.3 billion for the quarter, of which more than half took place during September. The volume of net new money outflows was equal to some 2.4% of the quarter's opening invested asset balance.</p>
          <p>We have identified a number of factors that have contributed to the outflows. These include clients generally seeking to diversify their exposure away from a concentration on just one financial institution; a general tendency for clients to deleverage, in other words, to sell investments to pay down debt; poor investment performance; the indirect impact of negative publicity on UBS, especially in Switzerland and in the USA, and general concerns on the part of some clients about the financial position of UBS.</p>
          <p>At the end of the presentation, we will give you a brief outlook with some commentary on where we are, and how we are addressing these issues. Global Asset Management saw net new money outflows of CHF34.4 billion in the third quarter. Of these 21 billion were in institutional, spread across asset categories and 13.4 billion in wholesale intermediary, mostly in multi-asset strategies and in equities.</p>
          <p>Approximately half of the outflows in Global Asset Management, CHF17.6 billion, are double counted within the outflows in Wealth Management, as they came through the UBS distribution channels.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet, as I mentioned earlier, we started our balance sheet reduction back in mid 2007 and this remains a theme into the fourth quarter of this year. Since the peak in June 2007 we have reduced assets, excluding the replacement values of derivative contracts, by CHF774 billion or by around 35%. Around 500 billion of this has come from reducing the trading portfolio in the Investment Bank, which is now less than half the size it was back in June 2007.</p>
          <p>In Q3, we reduced the balance sheet footings by CHF217 billion, excluding PRVs and the effects of foreign exchange movements. We continue to seek proactively to manage down our balance sheet footings.</p>
          <p>Over the past year, we have also seen good underlying progress on risk-weighted asset reduction. In Q3, headline RWAs increased by CHF7 billion or by 2% from the June quarter end. I'll come back to the underlying RWA details and our capital ratio position in more detail in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>You will all by now be familiar with the situation in the liquidity and funding markets in the second half of September and the earlier part of October this year. The Interbank funding market came to a virtual standstill. New open market unsecured funding was limited to tenders of less than one month and secured funding was only available for very high quality collateral.</p>
          <p>We have been managing our position defensively since mid 2007 and have shrunk our total liabilities excluding negative replacement values by over CHF750 billion in just five quarters.</p>
          <p>With this chart, I just wanted to highlight how well balanced our funding is. We report these details on a quarterly basis and you will be able to see that our funding profile has remained stable over a number of quarters.</p>
          <p>Moving on to risk positions. We already showed you this chart on the 16th of October; though we have added here the P&amp;L impact in Q3 by exposure category. Exposures to U.S. residential real estate related positions were reduced by almost 50% during Q3. And this was achieved largely through sales for cash and to a lesser extent through further write-downs.</p>
          <p>Leveraged finance and commercial real estate positions were also reduced through a combination of sales and write-downs. Further credit valuation adjustments were taken against credit default purchased from monoline insurers. We've provided you with further detailed information on these exposures in the appendix to this presentation.</p>
          <p>You'll also by now be familiar with this chart. It shows the effect of the deal with the Swiss National Bank on our risk positions. We selected U.S. real estate related asset to be sold to the SNB on the basis that the residual position leaves us with minimal market risk.</p>
          <p>Within our U.S. RLN programs, which we continue to operate, there remain some $1.4 billion of net exposure after recognition of effective protection as of the 30th of September.</p>
          <p>And finally, for the sake of completeness, here is a reminder of what we currently contemplate selling to the SNB. We expect to be able to sell the first two categories totaling some $49 billion primarily in the fourth quarter. Provision has been made potentially to sell the remaining $8.5 billion of identified exposures in further closings.</p>
          <p>At the end of the quarter, the BIS Tier-1 ratio stood at 10.8%. At the end of June 2008, the ratio as disclosed was 11.6%. But for the first time, we have consolidated our Swiss Pension Fund surplus in line with the change to IAS 19. This has had the effect of the increasing the risk weighted assets by CHF2.1 billion and the Tier-1 capital by 1.6 billion. This has increased the Tier-1 ratio by 0.4 percentage points. And prior periods have been restated accordingly.</p>
          <p>In Q3, Tier-1 capital decreased by CHF3.2 billion. The reduction was the result of the third quarter profit adjusted for the whole own credit gain of CHF2.2 billion, as well as for the negative impact from foreign exchange movements and high deductions for own shares.</p>
          <p>Risk weighted assets were up in the quarter by approximately CHF7 billion. This movement masks good progress in the Investment Bank, where balance sheet reduction measures had an underlying impact of reducing RWAs by about CHF14 billion. However, this reduction was more than offset by a spike in the notional risk weighted assets representing trading and other assets held in our market risk framework.</p>
          <p>Here, refreshed time series of recent volatilities led to a significant increase in the regulatory value at risk, which pushed RWAs up by CHF11.5 billion. Also there was the FX effect of our long dollar assets that increased RWAs by around CHF10 billion in the quarter.</p>
          <p>At the foot of the charge, we have setout briefly the pro forma impact of the SNB transaction. The analysis is also pro forma for the issue of the new series of MCNs. The first impact here is to take the after tax effect on our P&amp;L, where we expect to incur a loss of up to $6 billion on the sale of our equity interest in the fund for a price of just $1. We then add the value of the asset we expect to book in relation to the conditional option to acquire the SNB's fund once the fund has fully serviced, its non-recourse loans from the SNB. For illustrated purposes, we show the net effect of these two items as being a loss of CHF4 billion, against an option value of, in this case, CHF2 billion.</p>
          <p>We are assuming that we will be able to recognize half of the option value as Tier 1 capital, and that it will not qualify as total capital. And we've shown this effect under the row headed Option Treatment. Finally, we show the Tier 1 credit of CHF6 billion for the MCNs.</p>
          <p>The net effect of all of these measures would have been to increase the Tier 1 ratio as at 30th of September on a pro forma basis to around 11.9% and the total capital ratio to 15.9%. And when we present Q4, we will show this impact separately from the operating results.</p>
          <p>I'll now very briefly go through the divisional performance. Global Wealth Management &amp; Business Banking, saw its underlying profit fall by almost 9% quarter-on-quarter, adjusting for the ARS provision in Q2. It had 2% negative jaws. Revenues fell 5% on lower invested assets and lower transactional activity. We would expect the gross margin to decline somewhat over the coming periods, reflecting the general trend of clients to shift to lower margin defensive product.</p>
          <p>Costs were down 3%, reflecting lower head count and some loss absorption by staff compensation. Given the continuing stress in markets, we will focus on moving our cost base more into line with our revenue levels. Despite the difficult environment, the division as a whole still returned over 40% on its attributed equity.</p>
          <p>Profit in Wealth Management International &amp; Switzerland fell by 12% quarter-on-quarter. Gross margins fell by five basis points to 95 basis points per annum. Three basis points of the reduction were attributable to a change in asset mix affecting recurring income, and two basis points were attributable to lower transaction volumes.</p>
          <p>There were outflows of 26.9 billion in Wealth Management International a 9.1 billion in Wealth Management &amp; Switzerland with all regions being affected. APAC experienced its first negative quarter in recent years, though, only by a very narrow margin. Some two-thirds of the net outflows in the quarter occurred in September.</p>
          <p>The acquisition of VermogensGroep in August contributed CHF6 billion of invested assets, not categorized as net new money. Client advisory numbers fell by 69 during the quarter, which is less than 1% the total numbers of client advisors. Wealth Management US' result for the quarter was relatively strong. The gross margin was held at 83 basis points on an annualized basis.</p>
          <p>Underlying profits were up 14% in Swiss Francs and 9% in dollars. This reflected greater flexibility in managing head count and personnel cost in the USA. Wealth Management U.S. saw net new money outflows of CHF9.8 billion in Q3, of which two-thirds occurred in September. Including dividends and interest income as U.S. peers would report, net outflows were CHF4.3 billion.</p>
          <p>The number of financial advisors fell by 182 reflecting active management of the sales force, effect of the voluntary severance program and probably some impact of reputational issues.</p>
          <p>Invested assets held up well in Swiss Francs, helped by a positive currency translation effect largely offsetting the market performance impact which was minus CHF63 billion.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax profit in Business Banking was down on 8% on reduced revenues and slightly higher costs and lower charge-outs The impaired loan ratio improved marginally to 1.0% at the end of the quarter. Net new money outflows in Q3 were CHF3.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Underlying profit in Global Asset Management was down 30% quarter-on-quarter, mainly because of much lower performance fees from A&amp;Q. Headline numbers were up 18% taking into account the CHF168 million gain on the sale of our remaining minority stake in Adams Street Partners.</p>
          <p>In the institutional business, net new money outflows were CH21 billion, of which 4.9 billion were in money markets, a small amount in real estate and the rest roughly evenly distributed between equities, multi asset, alternatives, and fixed income. Around three-quarter of outflows occurred via third party channels.</p>
          <p>Excluding the ASP sale, institutional's gross margin was 33 basis points down nine basis points from Q2 mainly on lower performance fees. In the wholesales intermediary business, net new money outflows were CHF13.4 billion, of which almost two-thirds were in multi-asset and in equities. Outflows almost entirely arose by the UBS channel.</p>
          <p>Looking at fund performance, as we have highlighted before Global Asset Management outflows are partly the result of a disappointing investment performance in recent quarters. Recent data indicate a significant improvement in performance, particularly in equities starting from the end of the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Several capabilities are now ahead of benchmark on a one-year basis. Whilst, the Investment Bank's results did improve compared to previous quarters, its performance taking as a whole is not yet satisfactory.</p>
          <p>Personnel costs have fallen sharply reflecting the low head count base and significantly reduced bonus accruals. We expect the SNB transaction, which has a retrospective effect til 30th of September to transform the divisional performance in Q4 and in future periods.</p>
          <p>Revenues in IBD were down sharply on Q2 and by approximately 50% on the third quarter of 2007 reflecting significantly lower activity levels in M&amp;A and especially, in debt and the equity capital markets.</p>
          <p>In equities, prime brokerage revenues were down significantly. This is due to a combination of factors including the seasonal reduction in securities lending revenues as Q2 benefits from the European dividend season. The widespread short selling restrictions and market movements leading to a significant decline in client balances.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere in equities, derivatives revenues increased, exchange traded derivatives improved across all asset classes. The cash revenues were lower and crop was weak. In FICC, we saw record revenues in foreign exchange and money markets of $1.3 billion, up $730 million quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>This reflects the sharp increase in spreads enjoyed by our short-term interest rate operations towards the end of Q3. When we believe, we were one of the few market makers prepared to provide liquidity to the markets.</p>
          <p>And now I'd like to wrap-up the presentation with the discussion about the outlook. Difficult conditions across markets have continued and we expect those conditions to effect of our client assets and our fee-earning businesses.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses will continue to be trimmed. Efficiency and personnel reduction programs are in place. On a preliminary basis, we estimate that the SNB transaction will result in an aggregate net charge against earnings in fourth quarter 2008 of approximately CHF4 billion.</p>
          <p>As can be seen from the development of our credit spreads the transaction with the SNB and the MCNs have had a positive impact on the bank. However, tightening spreads will cause the reversal of own credit gains to impact fourth quarter results. Based on current credit spreads, we would expect to record a debit of over CHF2 billion in the fourth quarter, though this would have no impact on our regulatory capital.</p>
          <p>The fourth quarter results may also be affected by restructuring provisions and possibly goodwill impairment charges within the Investment Bank resulting from the closure of businesses. Any goodwill charge will not affect regulatory capital nor cash flows.</p>
          <p>And let me summarize what actions we've taken to stabilize the business. We've materially de-risked the balance sheet. We have lowered the run rate of costs. Investment performance in asset management has begun to improve. We have repositioned the Investment Bank. And we have strengthened our Tier-1 ratio as a result of the second MCN issue.</p>
          <p>These measures, taken together have increased client and market confidence in UBS. However, we continue to keep a close eye on the net new money development. Whilst the first two weeks of October were very difficult, in the two weeks since the announcement of the SNB transaction, we have seen some more encouraging signs.</p>
          <p>We plan to give you a status update at the EGM, which is scheduled to take place on 27th of November.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to hand you back to Philip.</p>

          <p>Thank you, John. We'll now move on to the Q&amp;A. And we would now like to take the question from the webcast and the telephone audience. Could we first have the question from the phone, please?</p>
        </plist>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me, this is the conference operator. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Mr. Kian Abouhossein, JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I've a few questions. First of all, the option value of 2 billion, are you also writing a put option of 100 million shares that might be exercised? And I'm trying to understand, how you get to the 2 billion, and if you account for the potential put option, and what the terms are of the put option?</p>
          <p>The second question is on risk-weighted assets. Your market risk is going up by 11.5 billion. You're talking about cash <mark type="inaudible" />. It looks to me like hedging issues. I'm just trying to understand why you're still adjusting your market risk model? And what is going on, because there is a continuous trend of market risk increasing, and how we should see this trend going forward?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, FIRC [Fixed Income Rates and Currencies], you make very little money in fixed income revenues, ex write-downs. You used to give quite a detailed chart of how the different areas are moving. Can you give us a bit of an idea of how the rates versus FX versus credit et cetera is moving in those areas? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Kian. Kian, on the put option for 100 million shares, is that a reference to the kick-in warrants?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right, yes, on the SNB kick-in warrants, exactly, because clearly, there could be further dilution potentially. So I'm trying to understand how you get to the 2 billion option value when you have a potential risk on the shares that might come into the market. And then how you calculate that, if that's included in the 2 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 2 billion is an estimate. On the calculation of the estimate, I am not sure we did factor in the implicit put option in the kick-in warrants. The 2 billion is, as you might imagine, a round number. The 2 billion was the calculation that's based on the carrying values at the 30th of September being carried forward into the future. So there's no increment other than the time value increment attaching to those values.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">

          <p>On RWAs, the expansion in the risk-weighted assets is largely a result of an increase in credit spreads, an increase in interest rate spreads and increased volatilities on rather a large book. And the detail on FICC [Fixed Income, Currency &amp; Commodities], we do give some information in the quarterly pack. But the business is being reconstructed at the moment. A number of businesses have obviously moved into discontinued status, and the basis of the current breakdown is the basis that we plan to continue with in future.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just wondering when we go to sort of the capital ratios, I think we previously said that based on a Tier 1 and on a leverage ratio yours is a bit light of the 2013 target. I was just wondering philosophically how you would like to bridge that gap? Would it be with hybrids, with <mark type="inaudible" /> or with dividends? And then particularly on dividends, on the back of my envelope, I would think you'd maybe have to conserve two more years worth of dividends. And sort of what's you perspective on paying a nil dividend for '09 versus a modest dividend and maybe the Swiss have to take a few more years to actually potentially reach the target? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Huw, the -- obviously the target is a ratio. And so we can work on both the numerator and the denominator. In terms of capital, I think we still stand by our expectation that we will be profitable in 2009. And therefore, we will start to accumulate retained earnings from that stage. We also want to continue to work on our risk-weighted assets. There are some technical factors in the increase in Q3 as I went through, some of them foreign exchange related, some related to the regulatory VaR.</p>
          <p>But we continue to work on balance sheet reduction overall and we continue to work on risk-weighted asset reduction, particularly in the Investment Bank. And so our expectation is that over time, and you are right till 2013, we have some time to accumulate capital and we will reduce risk-weighted assets over that period and thereby, by and large, meet our ratios. There is no increase in capital baked into that through hybrid or otherwise.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Jeremy Sigee, Citigroup. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Jeremy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Firstly, a follow-up question on the capital point. Are you able to spell out for us what the new SNB capital requirements are going to be or give us any guidelines on that? And then second question, really -- well, two bits to it about costs in the Investment Bank. Partly how do you look at comp accruals heading towards the year end relative to revenues, ex-marks et cetera? And secondly the -- within still Investment Banking costs, the 640 million G&amp;A cost is a lower number than previously. Is that sustainable at that level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're in pretty advanced discussions with the EBK on the capital ratios. And we've said that there are two elements to the new regime. The first will be a requirement to maintain a liquidity buffer or a capital buffer rather over and above the regulatory minimum that we currently have. And that will obviously be more significant than it currently is.</p>
          <p>The second element is as well flagged, I think, a leverage ratio. And it's not going to be a straightforward calculation on the leverage ratio. I think the capital component will be the Tier 1 capital as calculated for the other ratio. But the total balance sheet footings will be adjusted downwards for accounting effects and some other effects. And we've yet to reach agreement on those. We do expect that agreement to come relatively soon. And we will obviously report to you when we've conclued those discussions.</p>
          <p>On compensation accruals, I think the only message I have there is that although we've obviously attacked the bonus accrual in the third quarter, we think that is no more than in line with the market. There are some data points coming in from our competitors, particularly in Investment Banking. And I'm afraid for the fourth quarter, it's a question of wait and see.</p>
          <p>If the business continues to suffer from difficult market conditions, then we have reserved the right to review bonus accruals for the fourth quarter. If the markets were to improve and the business turn in a better than expected performance, then there could be some relief on that front. But we do want to manage our compensation accruals on the basis that we offer fair compensation for our staff, but on the basis that we offer only market rates and we reflect the overall performance of the company.</p>
          <p>On the G&amp;A expenses in the IB, they again are relatively well geared to head count. And we expect head count to come down. What you may see are some restructuring charges as I flagged, and potentially, but only potentially, we haven't done the numbers, the chance of a goodwill impairment charge in relation to one or two of the businesses that we are fully exiting as opposed to just downsizing. So difficult to give you concrete guidance, but save those two exceptional factors, there is no particular reason why G&amp;A would not -- in that division would not remain relatively constant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So there's no reversals on anything? Because you're referencing, I think, sort of lower professional fees and that kind of thing. There is no funnies or reversal on those lines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think professional fees is more of an issue in the other divisions, particularly in Wealth Management. I think in the Investment Bank one never knows. But it's not such a big element.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you plan reductions in provisions, admin charges and professional fees. But -- so those are all just organic reductions. There's no large reversals, or anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there will be a slight step change in Q4 for the announcement we made on, I think it was the 3rd of October when we announced the exit from a number of businesses and the additional 2,000 job cuts.</p>

          <p>The next question is from the Mr. Chris Malmer, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Questions in two areas, if I may. First of all, in the -- to better understand the impact on revenues from the transfer of assets to the SNB fund. Presumably the yield on those assets or the 60 billion, or &#x2013; what will become somewhere around 60 billion is booked in the revenues now, and presumably within the investment banks. Just trying to understand what will be the revenue impact once you've got those coming out, and the cash coming in. And if you have any indication already now, what you intend to do with that cash, and how we should think about that in the context of revenues within the investment bank?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just on the wealth management margins, you mentioned that more than half of the outflows came basically in September. Would it then be fair to say that the margin assets calculated on the average asset is maybe somewhat hiding more of a decline in the 91 basis points, just any sort of indications as to the outlook there for the subsequent quarters would be very helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the first one, we wouldn't be entering into the transaction with the SNB if we didn't think at the bottom line, the transaction made sense. I agree that further up the P&amp;L one could have a gross yield on the assets we're selling that looks higher than the yield we'll get on the money we get in for having sold them. But I don't think too many people will complain that the gross yield has not been a particular factor in the bottom line profit that's been driven from that that pool of assets.</p>
          <p>And so the relief we get from those risk positions finally having being sold on a net basis at the bottom of the profit and loss account is obviously much more beneficial than holding on to those assets. But you're right on a nominal basis given the written-down carrying values potentially the yield were it to come in and not be credit impaired is higher than the yield we would get on the cash we receive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you could have a negative revenue impact that on the risk adjusted basis. It obviously -- it's &#x2013; still the right thing to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very much so, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now on the deployment of the cash that comes in, we still are able in relation to some of the asset -- we look at the $49 billion or so of worth thatwe have flagged that we hope to be able to conclude on in the fourth quarter. Some of those assets a reasonably large proportion are currently capable of being secure funded, and so we can repo them. Clearly they are -- they're not the most liquid and so they carry very, very large haircuts.</p>
          <p>But there is a degree of repayment of secured funding with the nine-tenths of the value that comes in the form of a loan or the sale proceeds from the loan. The remainder I think we would plan to hold on the balance sheet. And initially it would simply the -- a further bolstering of our liquidity position.</p>
          <p>So the liquidity is made up kind of the excessive deposits over loans and our loan to deposits ratio is about 67% if you take out interbank deposits. We then have built the liquidity buffer within the much -- within the commercial trading book, within the investment bank, where we have longer assets and shorter liabilities. And we would I think just intend to keep the balance sheet at the same size, not specifically pay down any form of funding. And just bolster the long cash position on the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>On the net new money outflows and the relevant margin on that, I think, all we can say is that is really what we covered in the presentation. I don't think we've seen different trends other than what we mentioned which is -- the gross margin falls, the mix of assets held by clients is becoming more defensive and moving more into cash product which generally carry a lower gross margin.</p>
          <p>And transactional activity, but for a general spurt in switching from the complex more structured assets into the cash assets where we see an increase in activity once the transfer has taken place then transactional activity, frankly falls quite significantly. And so revenues from transactional brokerage fees will fall, I think, fairly significant in line with what you would expect in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you comment on encouraging signs in new moneys since the 16th of October announcement. And we'll have to wait till the 27th of November for any comments as to whether that actually means new inflows or less outflows?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I mean, we didn't -- we certainly didn't want to be too specific in the context of what are really just two weeks of data points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Since the SNB transaction. I mean the statement we've made was obviously carefully crafted. The encouraging signs, I appreciate it's somewhat vague, but I didn't want to give a statement either way. I didn't wanted it to be misleading on the basis of 10 business days worth of data.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fair enough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would refer you to is the analysis that we've made of, the root causes of the outflows. And they split vaguely, I suppose into two categories. One of them a market related category. So this was the general trend of deleveraging, which I think is still continuing. And we see that across a variety of our client types, even with some of our key clients.</p>
          <p>The other is I think since the collapse of Lehman brothers, there has been a heightened awareness amongst our client base -- amongst everybody of the counter party risk that the corporate mortality point that a company can go under and people can lose money. And I think people have therefore sometimes reacted defensively, and sought to spread their invested assets across the number of institutions. And unfortunately if you are thebig guy in the market, just arithematically speaking you are -- you come up slightly worse than the smaller guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we're certainly suffering from that general effect. There is also no doubt we were -- we were open about this. There was a UBS related impact there. And we've taken actions, and the action we took was rather draconian action, which was to raise capital, again, and to sell virtually all of our risk positions, which have been troublesome to our clients and to our counter parties on block to the Swiss National Bank on the basis that we do ultimately share in some of the upside.</p>
          <p>So I think, difficult to say, I don't want to say anything other than what we've said in the specific statement. But we will give you a clearer picture later in November when we just have another two or three weeks worth of information to go on.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. <mark type="inaudible" />. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, good morning. I just wanted to return to the question about the run rate of revenues in the fixed income business. If I take the loss of 4.6 billion and add back the 4.8 billion of charges, you have got about a 200 million underlying revenue this quarter. In the past, in the recent past, Marcel's [Marcel Rohner] talked about maybe having 5 billion of annual revenues out of the fixed income business. I just wondered if you could give us some clarity, given that you are restructuring the business, where you think revenues in that business might settle out to. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, <mark type="inaudible" /> there is one other factor that we should take into account in -- when you look at the fixed income revenues. And that is that -- as it's currently constructed that liquidity buffer -- that buffer we created to bolster the long cash position on the balance sheet in addition to our deposit balances, that at present is sitting within the FICC reporting line. And on the basis of the credit spreads and the interest rate curves of the third quarter that was rather an expensive liquidity buffer. We were borrowing relatively long duration and deploying that effectively overnight in risk free assets.</p>
          <p>And so the negative spread there was frankly 100 basis points and more for a lot of the quarter. And the entire cost of that has been placed on the FICC business. So I think I want to give you two closer set of numbers because we've been shy about disclosing the size and the quantum of that liquidity buffer within the Investment Bank. But it is sizable, and the cost is quite considerable. And my colleagues in the Investment Bank have been screaming a bit about it. But they know it's for the general good.</p>
          <p>There is a plan afoot, and I'm supporter of it, to try to share that separately. We may move the liquidity buffer into corporate center. And hopefully when the funding and liquidity markets do ultimately recover or at least gain a better semblance of stability we can start taking that buffer down again. But at the moment, it's a bit of a luxury, It's an expensive luxury, but we want to keep it in place. And we are charging the FICC division with that cost.</p>
          <p>So I think when you factor that in, the picture is a little rosier than you painted. However, again within that, during the course of the quarter there were a number of businesses, which after the end of the quarter, we have just announced that we are exiting because they are no longer in line with our strategy for the Investment Bank. So, you will find that some businesses that we were clearly drag on profitability will be in run off in future quarters. And the run rate of revenues in FICC will be somewhat better.</p>
          <p>If you go a little bit further down the P&amp;L, obviously we have taken some quite severe measures in relation to the expense base, particularly in FICC. And those job cuts in particular are only taking place in this quarter. So, there will be an accelerated impact to cost of implementing those job cuts in Q4. But thereafter we should see some relief in the expense line. So the profitability of that business in additon to the revenue line should also improve somewhat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Derek De Vries, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. I have the three short questions, if that's all right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The first one relates to the transfer of assets to the SPP &#x2013; SPV [special purpose vehicle] rather controlled by the Swiss National Bank. As you are doing that, I presume they are setting the prices on these things I know it's early days, but do you have any indications whether there is going to be a big loss on repricing those assets before putting them in? The second question relates to Basel II. I understand there is going to be some changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets in the trading book going forward. I was wondering if you could give us some indication of what that would mean for UBS, how much your risk-weighted assets will go up, because of changes under Basel II the way they calculate the trading risk-weighted assets?</p>
          <p>And then the third question just very quickly. You said the gross margins expected to decline in the coming quarters in the Wealth Management Businesses. And I'm wondering in the Wealth Management sort of Switzerland and International. Are you just talking about a trend of declining gross margin? Or are you saying specifically it's going to be below the 95 basis points we saw in Q3, which is seasonally a weak quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the sale of assets to the SNB, the relevant points are that first of all, they take place as at the 30th of September values. Now there is baked into the arrangement with the SNB, the provision for some form of independent price verification of the carrying value of those assets as at the 30th of September. That review hasn't started yet.</p>
          <p>We do plan, however, to get a move on with this. And as I said we would hope to be able to conclude the first tranche, the big tranche, almost $50 billion worth, very soon after we've raised the capital. We do want to raise the capital first before we incur the loss on the sale of the fund to the SNB. But we are reasonably confident about the carrying values on our books at the end of September.</p>
          <p>In relation to those asset categories that we are seeking to sell, we did find that even in the incredibly difficult markets at the end of September we were able to sell assets -- like assets for cash in the market at pretty much at our marks or sometimes a little above marks. Which -- and for the first time in the few months, actually gave us quite some confidence that we were carrying these liquid positions at the right level. I think we are reasonably confident that of this sort of price verification review we will -- we'll have our carrying values endorsed.</p>

          <p>You're absolutely right about the proposals from the BIS to modify the algorithm that's used to feed through the regulatory VaR [Value at Risk], to a notional number of risk-weighted assets or amount of risk-weighted assets that goes into the calculation of the relevant capital ratios. I think there are a couple of papers released at the end of July on that and I think they were discussion documents. I am not sure quite what their status is.</p>
          <p>However, the trend and the underlying intention of those documents was clear and that is to increase the notional risk-weighted asset weighting effectively of the market risk frame workbook. And so we would expect a headwind in that respect from that change in the algorithm. Now it's difficult at the moment to quantify quite how much that would be. But I could imagine in the context of what is -- still a relatively small number we are talking, even though the risk-weighted assets went up by about 11.5 billion in the third quarter. And that was a 50% or so increase, when you are talking about going from about 20 to CHF30 billion of risk weighted asset contribution, then I think we could see a meaningful increase if and when these new measures are implemented. But I think it's some time before it's proposed that they are implemented.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to sort of follow up on that, I mean the way its done now -- you have our VaR calculation and then you have a multiplier effect and I think the multiplier has been something like five to six or something. Could that double or is that the order of magnitude when you are talking significant? Or is it going to be calculated in a different way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's difficult to say. I think double is probably at the top end, but I think it could be a very meaningful increase in what is still a relatively small number. If you compare that with the credit risk framework and the risk weighted assets that's a materially high number in our case. And we're not particularly noted for being a lending bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when you compare that stuff with the U.S. guys, they look very different in terms of how they breakdown credit risk versus trading risk, is that just different starting points or I mean, should we read anything into that? Or is that just the way it is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as I know it's the way it is, I can't really comment too much on the U.S. Obviously, their starting point is a slightly different point, because it's a presentation under U.S. GAAP at least for the time being.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the last point on margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the gross margins, I think -- I mean you probably read between the lines of what I said and that was effectively to flag that we do expect that the gross margins will come under pressure in future quarters, both because of the mix of assets. So in rate terms that will come -- bring the gross margin down. But also I think transactional activity may slow down for a period. And of course, that slightly lower margin is applied then to a lower client invested asset base. So I can't give you much in the way of news on that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you are just lagging just a directional trend, you're not saying 95-basis points is going to fall from there? You're just saying directionally, we expect to see year-on-year declines in gross margins for all the reasons we are well aware of.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think so. I don't know about year-on-year, but certainly quarter-on-quarter. And there may be -- if you look back at previous downturns, there may be some data points you could pick up. But it's difficult to gauge what the impact would be specifically on this occasion.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, questions in two areas. One was on credit risk or loan losses. They were pretty high in the Investment Bank. But I can't really find much information about why. And I thought that you had hedged quite a large portion of the loan. Perhaps if you could talk a bit more about what's going on in the Investment Bank on credit risk.</p>
          <p>And the second area was BlackRock. I noticed that you haven't fully used the $60 billion of the fund and there's about just under $3 billion left. If you -- if the loan was to basically flow through the equity and you end up having some losses on those assets or they come back on the balance sheet, would you be able to transfer them to the fund? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This -- can I take the second question first? It's a little bit like asking me when I am going to start beating my wife. But -- so we don't except the assets for the subject of the arrangements with BlackRock to come back. Although, those are famous last words, you never know. At the moment, there isn't really provision for the sales of assets were we to get them back. They are obviously at the moment subject to a first loss insurance policy effectively. So we do have a residual interest in them. At the moment, there is no specific provision for them to be placed into the fund.</p>
          <p>On your first question, you are right about the loan losses and you are right about hedging. Unfortunately, I think under IFRS, I am not the world's greatest IFRS accounting expert, but I think what happens is that if you incur a credit loss, it goes through the credit loss line. And if you have an effective hedge and that rises in value or accretes value, that appears somewhere else in the profit and loss account, probably in trading income. And so -- unfortunately, the way the presentation works is you can't offset them. But what you can do is, you can have a net effect shown.</p>
          <p>But you are right that we do carry hedges, which we still consider to be effective hedges against much of our own book. But having said that, we also did incur some loan losses in the Investment Bank and obviously not all hedges are perfect <mark type="inaudible" />. So you did see some loan loss provisioning and some loan loss events.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would this mean &#x2013; I can't actually see &#x2013; I would have thought fixed income would have benefited from credit spread widening as an offset. But I couldn't see it. But just going back to the actual loan losses, I mean, is this something that's a step change in corporate credit quality to continue at such a high level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't expect so. Our lending book is not particularly sizable. Clearly, the economic environment is not propitious for an improvement in credit quality. But of the various things that may keep us awake at night, I don't think this is particularly one of them.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Matthew Czepliewicz, HSBC. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, yes, three disparate questions actually. The first is on wealth management. And judging from slide 17, some of the reputational issues that might have had an impact on other parts of your Group, did not seem to have too much of an impact on Wealth Management U.S. And we are seeing a lot of changes in that industry now with consolidation occurring over there and defection of FAs from some of your competitors to boutiques and so forth. So based on your own internal calculations, perhaps, do you feel that you have held your own in market share; you've gained a little; you have lost a little? And if you could just looking ahead how do you see that -- how do you see your positioning there evolving?</p>
          <p>Second question, just a technical question on the goodwill impairment in the Investment Bank in Q4. Would that just relate only to the businesses you are executing or might you use this as an opportunity to be a little bit more aggressive and just hit goodwills and intangibles in the Investment Bank generally, perhaps given the industry outlook over the medium term?</p>
          <p>And then final question is no one is really talking much about lawsuits in the industry right now, which I can understand. There are other issues on the agenda. But lawsuits tend to be a lagging indicator after a sharp market correction or period of turmoil. And do you see lawsuits as something of an industry issue -- investor lawsuits as an industry issue in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. I will take those in the order in which you posted them. In Wealth Management USA, I think you may be right in relative terms about the impact of UBS specific reputational issues. I think for the business in the U.S., the negative coverage of UBS was more of a second quarter phenomenon and was more related to the auction rate markets, prior to us agreeing a global settlement.</p>
          <p>And I think when that settlement was ultimately agreed, given that I think UBS still has as generous a settlement for our clients as any of our competitors. It's the most extensive, it extends to institutional clients. I do think we won some brownie points there from the market generally but I think specifically from our own staff there. And morale I think received a bit of a boost from that event. And so I think the third quarter, the business was little more chivy than it might have been otherwise and we're certainly a little more upbeat than it was in Switzerland.</p>
          <p>In relation to our pipeline, you've alluded to one of the key performance indicators in that business is our ability to attract performing financial advisors. I think we have seen an improvement. I think we have benefited from some of the fallout there. You may have seen one or two higher profile team hires that we've made, which have been publicized. And I think on that front at least we remain reasonably positive about our ability to attract good people.</p>
          <p>In the context of voluntary severance program that we ran there, there was some active management, if I can put it euphemistically, of the financial advisor base. And we did lose some financial advisors. But I think we mentioned in our third quarter report that it was a more active management out of the lower performers. So we are actively seeking to upgrade and enhance our franchise there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question on goodwill is quite a good question, technically how we calculate and assess the goodwill is we take the Investment Bank as a whole. I'm again not pretending to be a huge expert in IFRS, but there is an entity level at which goodwill is assessed for other than temporary impairment, and we tend to do that at a relatively high level. The IB carried a goodwill balance of I think it was 4.7 billion as at the end of the third quarter and you might imagine not withstanding its recent losses, but that's not a particularly high hurdle.</p>
          <p>So it's unclear at the moment whether we would incur a goodwill impairment charge. Although, we do it at the level of the IB as a whole, obviously, if we are exiting businesses within that and you saw it in the case of the exit from the Muni business in Q2. That subset of the Investment Bank does contribute to an overall assessment of whether goodwill should be impaired or not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so its -- at the moment, we genuinely do not know but what we --- what I wanted to do is when I was sort of cataloging the one or two big items that you should be aware of in Q4 lest you forget them. I just wanted to put it in a placeholder for the potential for goodwill impairment and I genuinely at the moment can't say whether that will be -- that place will be filled or not.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On lawsuits I can be very brief. The answer to your question is, yes, you are absolutely right it is the trailing indicator of the markets. And unfortunately, the law of tort in the US is in my view unlikely to be reformed any time soon and therefore the propensity for lawsuits to be filed probably does increase. So, yes, I am afraid that probably is the case.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Peter Thorne at Helvea. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. On the wealth management, can you may be give us an indication of what sort of client advisors you are looking to recruit over the next couple of years. You obviously have been the targets for recruitment from your competitors and yes, the first time  in ages the numbers have actually declined there, but are you being more proactive than perhaps the numbers have suggested in Q3?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Peter I wouldn't overegg the declining putting because 69 is still below 1% of the entire compliment of client advisers throughout Global Wealth Management and Business Banking. I think the fact is in that division, we're constantly on the look out for good people. And we continue to hire as we continue to train. And so we are very much open for business.</p>
          <p>We are however, at a general point, reducing head count across the entire Group. And that's, I am afraid that does also extend to client advisors. And we do it on the basis as best we can, on the basis of merit where we're not closing businesses. And unfortunately, sometimes it does fall on client advisors. So, not all of them are regretted departures, where they are, we do seek to replace. And there is no specific market in which we do so. I think we've said in the U.S. at the moment, our business there is relatively buoyant whereas in the rest of the world, the market for Wealth Management product is more challenging than it's been for some time. But we are open for business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And what about retention of people that are trying to be poached by others. Are you being more proactive in keeping the people you actually want to keep? I mean, one hears lots of stories about whole teams of UBS on the point leaving or have left then haven't yet taken the money, is that just exaggerated market stories or is there some truth in this comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we always get sort of comments of that sort from our friendly competitors. Obviously, we have been losing people and we've been hiring people. By and large, we are not a firm that believes in battlefield promotions or increases in salaries off cycle where there are exceptional cases and where there is a palpable mismatch between what our people are being paid and what the competitors are prepared to pay then we do consider making up the difference. And we're having to be competitive, clearly. So that doesn't mean we are prepared to be reckless in that regard and we managed the businesses on the basis that we are keeping our cost base under control, in the context of the market environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question also refers to your -- relates to managers statistics, and there is always a little bit of uncertainty, how you count. So the question would be, how do you treat relationship managers that have already resigned, but are still on your payroll, because they are now on gardening leave. Are they included in the reported number of relationship managers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They are until they -- until they affectively until their legal agreements, their contracts with UBS formally come to an end. But likewise the people we hire also not on because they are still on their former employers head count.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you for the follow-up question on that. The net reduction of 69 is certainly a low figure and in that respect a good figure, but can you also give the indication on your overall turnover has that changed to the previous quarter. So the gross figures leave us and you join us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They haven't been a big issue in Q2, I remember the equivalent number to the 69 was 11. So in two quarters we've lost 80, which is still around 1% of the number of client advisors. There isn't really a particular pattern. It's not a big issue. We may have seen sporadic increases in level of turnover in gross levers. Clearly, the -- given that the net number reduction is just 69 in the quarter in the context of us reducing the overall staff complement, in the context of us rebalancing our front office to back office ratio to improve the front office proportion. I think that's -- that's perhaps an acceptable number in the context.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Matthew Clark, KBW. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, I am afraid the same question on relationship manager head count in a slightly different way, perhaps you could just say whether -- that you don't expect about decline in relationship managers to accelerate in the coming quarters. And presumably you have good visibility there, because you know who has resigned and who is waiting to come on board. So, we shouldn't expect a 2 or 3% decline in relationship managers in fourth quarter, would that be a fair comment to make?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I think, you still on credit watch negative, downgrade by one of the rating agencies. Could you just discuss how this would affect your liquidity position? Would you have to post more collateral on the CDS contracts et cetera?  Maybe just discuss some of the moving parts in your liquidity buffer, because it seems as if you have been losing tens of billions of deposits every quarter, against that that you get 40 odd billion of liquidity coming from the SNB transaction. But then you'll also have a negative, potentially from a downgrade. So, could you just discuss the magnitudes of the moving parts on your liquidity buffer, a bit as well please? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the client advisory numbers, I don't think we have any grounds to expect an acceleration in the net number that we're losing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're right we do have some insight into the pipeline so to speak. But it wouldn't give us any grounds to think that number was going to worsen particularly. In relation to liquidity and the possibility of a downgrade, obviously Moody's has affirmed our rating at a notch higher than Standard &amp; Poor's currently holds us. And there are counter parties, you're absolutely right, there are counter parties with whom we would have to post some more collateral, were we to receive that downgrade.</p>
          <p>In general terms, I think, when you're looking at the liquidity position, you've missed a key point, which is that there's a considerable amount of internal generation of liquidity, because we've been shrinking the balance sheet by selling positions for cash. And you're right that client balances have reduced. They are sometimes into bank deposits, they are sometimes corporate deposits. All part I think of the deleveraging. And there are some baked in UBS specific issues there.</p>
          <p>But our liquidity position is a whole range of factors, as you didn't mention some of the more major ones. In client deposits, you're right, have been coming down. But there has been considerable liquidity generation by the corresponding reduction in assets and the sale of assets for cash.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can you quantify the stress case liquidity burden if you were to be downgraded presumably that's something that you need to do internally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously this is work we've done internally. I am not sure it would be appropriate for us to share that publicly or see it. It's something we are monitoring, it's something we are alive to, and it's something we are working on relatively hard but it's not a pernicious issue for us. It would be an inconvenience, but that's pretty much it.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I have three questions if I may. First of all, on the investment banking loan book, could you elaborate a little bit on the size of this book and how it has developed in Q3? And also what proportion of this book is carried at fair value, we heard at Credit Suisse that they carry some 50% of their IB loan book at fair value. and also some indication on the geographic spilt?</p>
          <p>Then the second question would be on goodwill. You mentioned that some 4.7 billion of IB related goodwill could be at risk. Now you still have some 4 billion of goodwill in your U.S. Wealth Management division. Do you see any potential need or any given the market environment and the outflows, do you see any potential need to impair any of this goodwill? And the last question is on the transaction with the SNB. Is there any -- what's the reason why you do not offload the leverage finance exposure to this fund? Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Yes. On the IB loan book, I am not sure I can give you much more information than the information that's disclosed.

          <p>On goodwill I don't think at the moment we would see any grounds for needing to impair the goodwill we carry in relation to the Wealth Management U.S. business. And on the SNB arrangements, the simple answer to the question as to why we don't put the leveraged finance positions into the fund facility SNB, is that those are bilateral agreements and we are not at liberty to simply move the loan or have the SNB step into our shoes.</p>
          <p>So they are -- they would require client consent and we'd have to rejig the loan in some way and I am not sure that that would actually work for the benefit of UBS. So at the moment because they are bilateral arrangements with our borrowers, we've decided to hold on to them.</p>

          <p>We do -- just so you know, in relation to those loans, we do mark those leveraged loans to market and I think we've disclosed that on the net basis and it's net of some effective hedging we have against the pool of leverage loans that we're holding at 84% of the par value.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning obviously you've made up huge jump to bring down your balance sheet including the 44% drop in the trading portfolio assets which I expect will fall a lot further with the trade to the SNB. You'll still have though I think CHF300 billion or more in trading portfolio assets, could you just give us some indication as to what exactly is in this portfolio? And perhaps the breakdown between proprietary and client related business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know if we have a breakdown to hand I mean we're the biggest trader of equities in the world, so it's not surprising that we have rather a large book. But we don't disclose the -- on a quarterly basis that the breakdown of the trading portfolio I am afraid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I appreciate that but obviously with it having changed 44% since the end of the year the historic disclosure is pretty relevant now. Do you think the majority is equities related and that is client related?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you just track the changes we've made to our business over that period, the weight of the reductions falls in FICC rather than equities. In FICC, we've already exited some of our bigger balance sheet utilizing businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's fine I understand you don't give the disclosure its just to say that one of the biggest resistance that we are getting to be wanting to buy your shares is knowing what other risks beyond your illiquid assets are and I think some further breakdown of your trading assets would go a long way to calming peoples nerves.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a question on the bonuses that was a topic again over the weekend in Switzerland and Board Management as far as I understand has decided to renounce on bonuses for the current year. What is the significance of that decision either qualitatively as well as quantitatively? And that's my first question. And the second question is will this decision impact the compensation of highly ranked UBS managers below the management, Board Management level? That's basically the questions I would like to ask.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm not sure to what extent it was officially announced over the weekend but I understand it appeared on Swiss television. That must be fairly official. But you are right in the context of a discussion last week the Group Executive Board did feel that in the context of the current environment and the recourse we had to the Swiss National Bank that it would be appropriate for the members of the Group Executive Board to renounce their right to bonus compensation for 2008.</p>
          <p>The extent of any other changes to our compensation system is currently as you may know under debate and we have promised that before the EGM, we would make some sort of statement in relation to compensation and at the EGM there is an agenda item at which our compensation structures will be debated. And so, I don't want to &#x2013; not least because I can't, but I don't want to say anything in advance of that in relation to compensation other than we do commit to make public statements, probably before the EGM and certainly at the EGM there will be a debate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to ask another question on the same subject. How do you then explain your statement before that you were paying in your Investment Bank, market prices or market salaries, I mean how to -- how free or how far can you go in redesigning your bonus system, when you now officially announced that your investment bankers can expect to be paid in accordance with market salaries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that will obviously the form part of the debate that we have at the AGM. The purpose of our bonus system is obviously multifarious. The first is obviously to compensate staff for their performance. Second is to retain staff and the third is motivate staff. And unless we can retain and attract staff and motivate them, then we won't have a successful business in any of our divisions. And so market factors have to play some sort of role. Where they can modified is in this context of the current situation. And I think where we strike that balance is as I suspect the number of the debate that will be had.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one more question. Can you comment on the Mr. Scoby's decision to go back to the alternative market business? Is that basically the first step out of UBS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the comment I can make on Mr. Scoby's decision to go back to A&amp;Q was that that decision was made before he agreed to join the Group Executive Board and he always wanted to go back. Joe is my friend, he is trader and asset manager and that's where he wanted to be.</p>
          <p>He stepped into a very difficult role at an exceptionally difficult time. He's helped to re-engineer our risk systems and our risk processes, and his performance has been outstanding for the year in which he is been in the position. And he is taken -- his job is taken by someone who has been with the firm for an awful long time, has been his Deputy for this past year or so, and can jump straight into the job and take it up running. So I hope that no one outside the firm will notice that the change has taken place, but he &#x2013; the fact is decided to go back to A&amp;Q sometime ago.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Good morning. Three questions, firstly just wanted to get a sense of the impact of the de-leveraging cutting the balance sheet on the P&amp;L particularly in the fixed business at the Investment Bank. I think in the past, you've hinted that there have been undisclosed marks or hits to the P&amp;L as you cut the balance sheet aggressively. We just wanted to get a feel for the quantum again in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Secondly, to get a bit more color on what stage we are in terms of the exit from the U.S. across board business. So could we expect to see further outflows from that what assets are still left there? And thirdly, any impact from Lehman's structured products actually that may have been sold to your clients? Thank you</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the de-leveraging, in relation to our legacy risk positions and as we have sold those, as you know, there has been a something tight rope walk between not wanting to crystallize too much in the way of P&amp;L hit ,and on the other side wanting to maximize the de-leveraging and the liquidity creation and the exit from those positions. And so that there obviously has been some P&amp;L impact from the de-leveraging process.</p>
          <p>The sale to the SNB isn't so much a de-leveraging in fact, when taking together with the capitalizing, the balance sheet actually goes up a small bit. But the de-leveraging or the SNB transaction is more of the de-risking and it's now -- I think for us more of a question is de-risking as de-leveraging, but we do continue to want to reduce the overall size of the balance sheet. And on the exit from the U.S. cross board business, there is obviously still someway to go. We are in the middle of that process and the middle that we are underway in that process. And I don't really want to give too many details. It's obviously a sensitive subject. And I think I'll just leave it to say that there will be further client flows in relation to the exit from that business.</p>
          <p>And in relation to Lehman, I don't think we've given any information on Lehman structured product other than obviously we sell structured product manufactured by ourselves and others. And I don't think there's much further we have to say that unfortunately.</p>
