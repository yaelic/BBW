          <p>Welcome to today's program. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Please note today's call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the program over to Kevin Stitt. Please begin, sir.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Before Brian Moynihan and Bruce Thompson begin their comments, let me remind you that this presentation does contain some forward-looking statements. And please review Slides 2 and 3 with information around forward-looking statements. And for additional factors please see our press release and SEC documents.</p>
          <p>And with that, let me turn it over to Bruce.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start on Slide 4 and as all you saw this morning we reported net income of $2.5 billion for the second quarter or $0.19 a share on a diluted basis. You'll notice at the bottom of the page we do not have any selected items that we brought forward during this quarter and given that the list is relatively short we'll just hit those as we go throughout the presentation within the lines of business.</p>
          <p>If we go ahead and move forward to Slide 5, we clearly believe that the results in the second quarter demonstrated our ongoing momentum on several fronts. Capital continued to strengthen and is at record levels by most metrics. Tier 1 common capital increased $2.5 billion to $134 billion and ended the quarter at 11.24% under Basel I.</p>
          <p>We estimate that Basel III Tier 1 common equity was 8.1% at the end of June on a fully phased in basis based on our current understanding of both U.S. market risk rules and international Basel III guidelines. If you recall, we had estimated we would be in excess of 7.5% under Basel III at the end of the year, so based on where we came out at the end of the quarter we are quite pleased with the progress we've made so far.</p>
          <p>While we increased capital we also continued to bring down long-term debt, reducing it by $53 billion in the second quarter through both maturities as well as liability management actions that we will get into throughout the presentation.</p>
          <p>Likewise, we made progress on expenses, which declined $2.1 billion from the first quarter of which approximately $900 million was due to the absence of annual retirement eligible stock-based compensation awards that impacted the first quarter.</p>
          <p>As we said last quarter, while revenue growth correlates in large part with the health of the overall economy, the two areas that we clearly have the ability to control are our expenses as well as our debt costs and we aggressively addressed those during the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Asset quality also continued to improve in almost all categories. This improvement combined with decreased levels of distressed loans drove provision expense to be its lowest level going all the way back to the first quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Interest rates did continue to be a headwind, and as you can see the decrease in long end rates during the quarter did negatively affect net interest income. The European crisis and seasonality are impacting the markets-related businesses, driving those revenues lower compared to the first quarter of 2012. However, non-interest income did reflect improved results in some of our consumer businesses, which we'll get into as we go through the presentation.</p>
          <p>If you turn to Slide 6, as we look at regulatory capital under Basel I, you can see that $2.5 billion of earnings along with a $27 billion decline in risk weighted assets or about 2.3% of risk weighted assets drove the capital improvement from 10.78% at the end of the first quarter to 11.24% at the end of the second quarter. If you look at the left-hand chart, since June of 2011, one year ago, our Basel I Tier 1 common ratio has increased by approximately 300 basis points.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 7 and providing a Basel III update, as we near the 2013 implementation period for Basel III, we've estimated our Tier 1 common equity ratio and its components to provide a better understanding of where we are relative to the Basel III guidelines that will be fully implemented at the end &#x2013; or excuse me, at the beginning of 2019. The estimate we provide here is for BIS Basel III guidelines in the final U.S. market risk rules. If we reported Basel III as of June 30, on a fully phased-in basis, we estimate that Tier 1 common equity ratio would be 8.1%. We estimate that our Tier 1 common equity would be approximately $127 billion while our risk-weighted assets would be $1.566 trillion.</p>
          <p>As we think about the important differences between Basel I and Basel III capital or the numerator, the differences include capital deductions related to the MSR, our deferred tax assets and the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on debt and equity securities recognized in other comprehensive income. As you're well aware, these items will be impacted by future changes in both interest rates as well as overall earnings performance.</p>
          <p>If we turn to Slide 8 on funding and liquidity, you can see that long-term debt during the quarter was down $53 billion while our overall global excess liquidity sources only declined by $28 billion to $378 billion at the end of the quarter. At the parent company, long-term debt during the quarter came down by approximately $40 billion. That $40 billion reduction was approximately $34 billion of parent company maturities of which we call out $24 billion of that related to TLGP debt. At the end of June all of our TLGP-related debt has been repaid.</p>
          <p>It addition to the maturities, we brought in about $5.5 billion through liability management actions on our TRUPs and subordinated debts that are outstanding. The benefit in the quarter from that was a little over $500 million. As we look forward, those liability management actions will reduce net income &#x2013; or excuse me, will result in net interest income savings of approximately $100 million in 2012 and $180 million in 2013.</p>
          <p>As we look at parent company liquidity, it remained very strong at $111 billion at the end of the quarter. And as we look at time to required funding, we finished the quarter at 37 months, the highest in the company's history.</p>
          <p>During the quarter we didn't issue any long-term unsecured parent company debt and I doubt that we will do so during the balance of 2012. What we will continue to do is to bring down long-term debt both by paying off debt at maturity as well as active liability management, consistent with our overall goals of continuing to optimize net interest income.</p>
          <p>In fact, we've already announced calls of another $5.2 billion in both TRUPs and sub-debt, which we expect to complete during the third quarter of this year. In addition to these calls, maturities of $23 billion, of which approximately $15 billion at the parent, will come due during the second half of the year which will also help reduce both long-term debt balances as well as associated interest expense.</p>
          <p>We'll spend a minute on Page 9 on a couple balance sheet highlights. You can see total assets were down about 1% to $2.16 trillion while total risk-weighted assets were down over 2% to about $1.19 trillion dollars. Our tangible common equity ratio improved 25 basis points in the quarter from 6.58% to 6.83%. And tangible book value improved by $0.35 during the quarter to $12 &#x2013; excuse me, to $13.22 from $12.87.</p>
          <p>We turn to Slide 10, and look at net interest income on an FTE basis it was $9.8 billion during the quarter, down $1.3 billion from the first quarter. The decrease in the quarter was primarily due to higher premium amortization expense associated with FAS 91 as well as market-related hedge ineffectiveness. If you recall, rates rose in the first quarter of this year, and that led to lower premium amortization, and favorable hedge ineffectiveness that benefited NII by about $400 million in the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>However, lower rates in the second quarter had a negative impact of approximately $500 million, which resulted in a combined negative impact of approximately $900 million to NII from the first quarter to the second quarter. If we back out those market-related swings, net interest income decreased by approximately $400 million during the quarter due to lower loan balances and yields and lower trading net interest income which was partially offset by the benefit of the lower long-term debt that I just mentioned.</p>
          <p>In the near-term, given long end rate levels at the end of June, we estimate that quarterly net interest income will start at a base of approximately $10.25 billion before the impact from liability management actions. Second quarter parent debt maturities and liability actions plus third quarter announced redemptions and calls will benefit quarterly interest income by approximately $300 million, of which $60 million was captured in the second quarter of this year. To state the obvious, if rates increase from the end of June it will have a positive impact and obviously lower rates would have a negative impact.</p>
          <p>We turn to Page 11 and look at overall loan activity. Total loans for the quarter declined by approximately $10 billion from the first quarter or about 1%. If you look at the composition of the loan balances, you can see ending commercial loans actually grew by about $4.1 billion or 1.3% from the first quarter of 2012. That growth was attributed to increases in our commercial and industrial loans and was partially offset by about a $1.4 billion reduction in commercial real estate.</p>
          <p>If you go to the bottom of Slide 11, you can see ending consumer loans declined approximately $14 billion from the first quarter of 2012. I'd like to spend a minute on that. If you go and look at the bar chart, we've talked throughout the last couple of quarters about runoff portfolios that we're looking to run off that do not produce any meaningful level of pre-tax income. You can see we had about $4.4 billion of that during the quarter. In addition, residential mortgages were down about $4.4 billion. Keep in mind as we look at those mortgage portfolios, we can either invest in mortgages or securities. And during the quarter we came up in securities, a little bit down in loans. Over and above that, about $3.4 billion of loan sales that had been targeted that wrapped up at the beginning of the second quarter.</p>
          <p>If you back those three items out and look at consumer loans on a net basis, that leaves us with about a $2 billion reduction during the quarter, or well below 1%.</p>
          <p>On Slide 12, we highlight the results of the Consumer and Business Banking segment. Earnings were $1.2 billion, a decrease from the first quarter, driven by lower net interest income, lower reserve releases and higher litigation expense, partially offset by higher non-interest income.</p>
          <p>Non-interest income did increase from the first quarter due to a couple of factors, consumer spending, including higher interchange, the gain on certain card portfolios and the impact of our consumer protection products.</p>
          <p>On Slide 13, we list some key indicators for our Consumer and Business Banking for the quarter. Average deposit balance growth was strong, increasing by over 2% or $10 billion compared to the first quarter of 2012. As we continue to focus on cost and look to optimize our delivery network, our branch count came down by 57 branches during the quarter.</p>
          <p>As far as card purchase activity, combined credit and debit card purchase volumes increased 6% from the first quarter of 2012. In addition, credit quality continued to improve as the U.S. credit card loss rate is the lowest since the fourth quarter of 2007, while the 30-plus day delinquency rate is at historic lows.</p>
          <p>As we look at activity levels within the segment, we've also continued to increase our mobile banking customer base to more than 10 million customers, which is a 6% increase from the prior-quarter and up 34% from the year-ago period.</p>
          <p>If we turn to Slide 14, Consumer Real Estate Services reported a loss of $768 million, which was an improvement of $377 million versus the first quarter of this year. Lower revenue was more than offset by lower expenses and a lower provision for credit losses.</p>
          <p>The home loans business within our Consumer Real Estate Services segment recorded a profit of $241 million for the quarter. First mortgage retail originations of $18 billion were up 18% over the first quarter, due to lower rates and HARP refis and in line with our retail originations a year ago.</p>
          <p>However, as you all know, we exited the correspondent business late last year, so current correspondent originations during the quarter are virtually nonexistent versus volumes of approximately $22 billion a year ago. Even with the exit from this correspondent channel, core production income is higher than a year ago.</p>
          <p>Results for the quarter include $395 million in costs for representations and warranties provision and $109 million of litigation expenses and expected assessments waivers and other costs related to foreclosure delays.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, our MSR assets decreased by approximately $1.9 billion due to lower mortgage rates and ended the quarter at $5.7 billion. MSR hedge results for the quarter largely offset market valuation declines and the capitalized MSR rate at the end of the quarter was 47 basis points versus 58 basis points in the first quarter and 78 basis points a year ago.</p>
          <p>We move forward to Slide 15. As we've done before, we showed some comparisons of certain metrics in our Legacy Assets and Servicing basis on a linked quarter basis and compared to second quarter a year ago, as we continue to focus and work very hard on reducing delinquent loans and looking to find homeowner solutions.</p>
          <p>As you recall Legacy Assets and Servicing reflects all of our servicing operations and the results of our MSR activities. We added almost 1,700 people in the quarter, including contractors versus 3,000 people in this area in the first quarter alone.</p>
          <p>The number of first liens serviced did decline by 5% in the quarter while the number of 60-day plus delinquent loans dropped 2%. As we think about that drop in 60-day plus delinquent loans of 27,000 loans from the first quarter it was lower than we would have expected for two reasons. The first is a result of the DOJ AG settlement. We had holds on loans that we're attempting to modify and in addition to that we had approximately 15,000 loans where servicing is being sold but we won't complete until this month.</p>
          <p>Even with these delays, we continue to believe we can reduce our 60-day plus delinquencies by a net of approximately 300,000 over the next 12 months. And as we've talked about before, we remain very focused on decreasing these loans because, on a lag basis, it gives us the ability to further reduce costs within this segment.</p>
          <p>On Slide 16, you can see that outstanding claims have increased from the end of March from a rep and warranty perspective. Claims from the GSEs increased as a result of ongoing disagreements with Fannie Mae about what constitutes a valid repurchase request. Through June, there has been minimal monoline activity, consistent with the past six quarters. However, as I'm sure many of you saw last night, we did sign a settlement with Syncora that would have reduced our outstanding monoline claims at the end of June by approximately 20%.</p>
          <p>On the private label side, we did have an increase in outstanding claims from $4.9 billion to $8.6 billion during the quarter. The increase in claims is primarily due to claims received from trustees that we fully anticipated at the time of the Bank of New York settlement a year ago, and were largely reflected in the increase in our reserves at that time. As we look forward, we expect these outstanding claims to continue to grow as the process for ultimate resolution continues to evolve and does remain unclear.</p>
          <p>As you look at this table, I think it's important to keep in mind that the table reflects unpaid principal amounts as opposed to actual losses that are projected on the loan. Our reserves for rep and warrants ended the quarter at $15.9 billion, up slightly from the prior quarter. And as you look out, our non-GSE range of possible loss over and above existing levels is up to $5 billion.</p>
          <p>In Global Wealth and Management &#x2013; Investment Management on Slide 17, earnings for the quarter of $543 billion or a pre-tax margin of 20% were in line with the results we saw in the first quarter of this year. Solid long-term at AUM flows as well as loan growth of $2.5 billion in the quarter helped offset a 2% decline in client balances driven by lower market balances. Loans within this segment are at record levels and our advisor levels remained essentially flat, up just slightly from the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>If we move to Global Banking on Slide 18, net income decreased $1.4 billion from the first quarter due to lower net interest income as well as lower reserve reductions during the quarter. Average loans for the quarter were down 3% as a result of the decreases in commercial real estate that I had spoken about before as well as certain targeted loan sales.</p>
          <p>Average deposits increased to $239 billion during the quarter as our corporate customers continue to remain very liquid.</p>
          <p>Asset quality for the quarter continued to improve substantially as we had the largest quarterly percentage reduction since the peak in 2009 in both nonperforming assets as well as criticized balances.</p>
          <p>As you can see on Slide 19, investment banking fees for the quarter firm wide excluding self-led deals were $1.1 billion, down slightly from the first quarter as a pick up in M&amp;A activity was more than our set by a decline in both debt and equity underwriting fees. We were ranked number two globally as well as in the U.S. in net investment banking fees during the first half of 2012.</p>
          <p>And as you look at the mix and the geography of the revenues, you can see that during the quarter more than 80% of the fees were driven by activity in the U.S. and Canada.</p>
          <p>If we switch to Global Markets on Slide 20, net income of $462 million decreased $336 million from the first quarter reflecting lower sales and trading activity, which was partially offset by lower expenses. Total revenue ex-DVA was down $2.1 billion from the first quarter and down $769 million from the second quarter a year-ago due primarily to the European crisis as our clients became more risk-averse.</p>
          <p>Expenses were down both from the first quarter driven by lower personnel-related expense as well as from a year ago. Average VaR was $63 million in the quarter, down from $84 million in the first quarter due to lower levels of client activity.</p>
          <p>Continuing with the Global Markets segment on Slide 21, we recorded DVA losses of $156 million in the quarter versus losses of $1.4 billion in the first quarter of this year and gains of $123 million in the year-ago period. Sales and trading revenue excluding DVA losses decreased $1.9 billion from the first quarter due to the deteriorating market sentiment that I just mentioned as well as a slowing U.S. economy.</p>
          <p>FICC revenue ex-DVA was down $2.6 billion &#x2013; or was $2.6 billion during the quarter, down $1.6 billion from the first quarter as we experienced decreases in almost all product categories but would also point out that if we compare Q2 of this year to Q2 of last year, FICC revenues were basically flat in the year-ago period. In equities, ex-DVA results decreased 26% from the first quarter as volumes remained at low levels significantly impacting both trading as well as commission revenue.</p>
          <p>On Slide 22, we show you the results of all other. Recall in all other, we include Global Principal Investments, the non-U.S. Consumer Card business, our discretionary portfolio associated with interest rate risk management, insurance, and the discontinued real estate portfolio. The revenue increase we saw from the first quarter was due to a lower negative valuation adjustment on structured liabilities under fair value option. And was offset, in part, by lower equity investment income, lower gains on sales of debt securities, and lower gains on debt and trust preferred repurchases during the quarter.</p>
          <p>The decline in noninterest expense was mainly due to the absence of retirement-eligible stock-based compensation awards that we have in the first quarter of each year.</p>
          <p>If we turn to Slide 23, and look at expenses, you can see in the upper left-hand corner in the red bars that we've had significant declines in noninterest expense from the second quarter of 2011 as well as on a linked-quarter basis from the first quarter of 2012. What we've done in the gray bars is back out goodwill impairment as well as the annual retirement-eligible comp cost that we have during the first quarter. And if you back those out you can see, once again, expenses declining from $20.3 billion in the second quarter of last year to $18.2 billion at the end &#x2013; or during the first quarter of this year, down to $17 billion during the current quarter. I would note during the current quarter, litigation expense embedded in that $17 billion, is approximately $1 billion.</p>
          <p>As we look at the reasons for the decline on a linked-quarter basis in noninterest expense, three major drivers: lower incentive compensation expense, the benefits of our new BAC programs, as well as lower mortgage related costs.</p>
          <p>If you move to the right and look at our full-time equivalents within the employee base, you can see year-over-year ex-legacy assets and servicing, our number of employees has come down from 253,000 to 233,000 or an 8% decline.</p>
          <p>While we're on the topic of expenses, let me spend just a moment on taxes. The tax rate for the quarter was approximately 22%, which resulted from the impact of our recurring tax preference items on the level of pre-tax earnings. We estimate 22% to be the rate for the rest of the year except for any unusual items that may arise.</p>
          <p>As we mentioned last quarter, one unusual item that we do expect to be enacted later this month is the U.K. tax rate reduction of 2%, which should result in a tax charge in the third quarter of approximately $800 million. And recall due to our current DTA disallowance that charge will not impact our Basel I or phased-in Basel III Tier 1 ratios.</p>
          <p>If we turn to Slide 24, as we've talked about previously, our Phase 2 evaluations began late last year and we completed those in the second quarter. As you know, Phase 2 focused on corporate commercial and market space businesses. We expect that these Phase 2 cost savings will total approximately $3 billion on an annualized basis which would be fully phased-in by mid-2015. We did start to see some of these Phase 2 savings in the second quarter as these initiatives aren't as interdependent as the consumer businesses in Phase 1 are.</p>
          <p>With respect to Phase 1, we are still on track to exceed the 20% of the $5 billion in annual cost savings by the end of 2012. In total, in both Phase 1 and Phase 2, we're targeting to produce annualized cost savings of approximately $8 billion by mid-2015. So if you consider the lower expected FTEs and other expense reductions associated with New BAC, both Phase 1 as well as Phase 2 along with an improving delinquent mortgage loan servicing pool we believe we can continue to realize cost savings for the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>If we switch to asset quality on Slide 25, overall trends continue to remain very positive. Provision expense declined $645 million to $1.8 billion. Net charge-offs decreased $430 million or 11% to $3.6 billion versus the first quarter driven by lower consumer charge-offs while commercial charge-offs were relatively flat.</p>
          <p>The reserve reduction was $1.85 billion versus $1.6 billion in the first quarter of the year. As we go forward, and as credit continues to stabilize, we would expect that our overall reserve reductions will continue albeit at significantly reduced levels. Consequently, we believe that provision expense for the next two quarters of the year will be higher than what we experienced during the second quarter of this year but below that which we thought during the first quarter.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me turn it over to Brian to go through how we continue to focus moving forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bruce. Let me add a few thoughts before we take questions. The results you see in our numbers today show that we continue to be well-positioned to keep building on the customer and client relationships that we have in our company. As we think about our individuals and business suite service clients, many of them have addressed all the financial circumstances that they faced over the last few years and actually are in better shape than the broader economy and the statistics may reflect on a given day or week.</p>
          <p>However there remains some uncertainty in the markets and in the minds of our customers and clients. This largely revolves around the situations in Europe and United States around the longer term fiscal issues that must be dealt with, and we continue to run our company consistent with that uncertainty in everything we do.</p>
          <p>If you think about the path we've been on for last couple years, rebuilding the balance sheet, making the strategic decisions, putting our operating principles in place and living up to them and driving our customer focus strategy. Everything that we've done in our company has been achieved to make our company less complex and more streamlined, and also to position our company better to grow over time.</p>
          <p>What this quarter continues to demonstrate is the sound financial foundation we have built, the strong balance sheet that we've built and will continue to maintain. And because of all the work the opportunities which we are focused on is now to drive the core earnings of the company. As we discussed at the beginning of the year we laid out four things that we are focused upon. We told you we would focus on improving our capital levels. We told you we would focus on managing our risk. We told you we would focus on reducing our cost base and we told you we would focus on driving core business improvement. This quarter we saw improvement in each of these areas.</p>
          <p>On capital, we continue to make strong progress and feel good about where we stand especially in light of our Basel III guidance. In a year's time we have gone from being behind our peers to being ahead of our peers.</p>
          <p>If you think about the risk side, asset quality trends continued to be positive across the board. Charge-offs continue to fall and have room to go. Provision expense is at the lowest level we've had in this company in five years. Delinquency trends continue to improve in all our products. And criticized commercial exposures continue to fall.</p>
          <p>As we think about the cost side, we are starting to see the benefits in new BAC programs and the results of the Phase 2 work will continue to roll through as well. This is evident in the reduction in head count and expenses that you have seen in the numbers.</p>
          <p>So let's remember this, as we reduce our costs we continue to invest in the opportunities in our franchise. We invest in technology over $2 billion or $3 billion a year this year. An example of that investment is in May we completed a major technology milestone for our company converting our California franchise. So for the first time in our company's history we now have one deposit platform serving customers coast-to-coast.</p>
          <p>In addition we continue to invest in our technology platforms across the world including our cash management platform that serves corporate clients and you can see the effect of that in our numbers. But also we invest in  our client-facing teams. We continue to grow our small business bankers, our wealth management teammates both in our Wealth Management business and our FSAs and Consumer business and we continue to add mortgage loan officers as you can see in our increased production.</p>
          <p>So we've had strong steady progress on capital risk and costs, providing a solid foundation as we focus our energy on our core business growth and the earnings power of the company. This is the area that we continue to have work to do as you can see in the numbers. But we've put ourselves in a position to be successful. For example we transformed and repositioned our core Consumer business. While taking the core expenses down we continue to drive growth. An example that Bruce referenced earlier is our mobile banking platform. We hit 10.3 million customers this quarter in that mobile banking platform, up 600,000 from last quarter. With the usage of that platform and the payments initiated growing very, very quickly, this is a superior service model that is second to none in the industry.</p>
          <p>In our Consumer business our deposit balances were up. New credit card accounts are up. For example we've issued 1.4 million Bank of Americard Cash Rewards cards since we introduced them less than a year ago. That's 26,000 new cards a week. Our mortgage productions increased almost 20% quarter-over-quarter. In a broader context we've extended $107 billion in credit to customers to help them participate in the economy this quarter. In the important small business area, year-to-date we've initiated $4 billion in new credit to small businesses.</p>
          <p>So we continue to drive business across the board, whether it is in our Wealth Management business as you can see in our good long-term assets under management flows or in the banking products side we can see loans have achieved record levels. We have market coverage and penetration second to none in the commercial areas whether it's the large corporations or medium and small businesses. We've bought the Wall Street capabilities to those clients across our franchise.</p>
          <p>And for the institutional investor client base, you've seen in our Trading business the core customer focus and how that continues to improve recurring revenue streams and also you can see our research capabilities that our clients tell us are second to none.</p>
          <p>So now we have tremendous opportunities in the franchise and we all know that and we continue to focus on execution. So that's what you can expect out of us over the next few quarters. Continue to build our momentum around business performance, continued focus on the fundamentals, stronger capital, careful management of risk and reducing cost. And you'll see us drive forward and deliver the results that you, our clients, customers and shareholders expect.</p>
          <p>Thank you, and now we are happy to take questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And with that, we can take our first question from the site of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, good morning. Bruce, on the net interest income I just to want clarify your statement there. You said that the starting point should be the $10.2 billion, is that the adjusted NII from this quarter, is that why you are referencing in the $10.2 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then from there are you saying we should add the incremental $240 million benefit from debt reductions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then what about kind of the core leakage, like this quarter you had that $400 million of core leakage from loan runoff; you didn't mention that but do you expect to still have that battling against the debt benefit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we think about the $10.25 billion, that's the jumping off point. We clearly, and I think you've seen it in the commercial area, are clearly looking within the context of a reasonable risk appetite to start driving loan growth going forward. And as we've talked about before, that the runoff portfolio is not one that's particularly profitable. So as we look forward, and as we've thought about that jumping off point. that's how we think about the $10.25 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just trying to think of once we jump off, is there something about the $400 million that was elevated this quarter in terms of core leakage? And why that might slow? Is it just &#x2013; is loan shrinkage slowing? Is that the idea?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the idea. I mean I think the other thing is that, and as I mentioned in my comments and we talked about rates going up or down, while we're not predictors of interest rates per se, we clearly would not expect to see the decline in interest rates from the &#x2013; that we saw from the end of the first quarter to the end of the second quarter going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just finally, how would the hedge and the premium amortization work given where the tenure is today versus where it ended the second quarter? Would that be an incremental hurt and would it be similar magnitude or less?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It obviously goes both ways, both up and down. I think if you look at where the tenure was at the end of the quarter I believe it was at about 164, so we're clearly a little bit lower today than we were at the end of the quarter. I would expect, though, that if rates were to continue to go down, I'm not sure that you would necessarily see the same impact on the downside for premium amortization because at some point it is going to stop.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it would be down but not by the same magnitude on the hedge effectiveness and the premium amortization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be the expectation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the expenses, it sounds like you think the $17 billion is a good jumping off point for expenses all in and you expect to decline for the rest of the year from there? Is that what you said?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the Phase 2 done by 2015, am I correct that that &#x2013; the Phase 2 stage was supposed to come faster than Phase 1; is that still the expectation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. When we put out the Phase 1 expectations we obviously said it was roughly 20% by the end of the first year, and given, as I said, a lot of the work's not as interdependent, you would expect that those Phase 2 savings to come more on a ratable-type basis as opposed to having them a little bit more back end loaded.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But given that those are coming by mid-2015, obviously the Phase 1 takes longer than mid-2015 to finish up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. But keep in mind that the Phase 1 we had talked about a three-year period and having all of the Phase 1s done by the end of 2014, remember, because Phase 1 was started much earlier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Got it. Got it. Okay. So it's not from today, it's from when it started. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then last thing, just the operating expenses in LAS were up to $2.7 billion from $2.4 billion, do you believe that those have peaked now? And do you see those starting to decline in the second half of this year or more in 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, I think they are up a little because remember we are now in full, multiple things going on: Department of Justice, the lookback in full swing and everything. So the team thinks we've largely peaked but I would &#x2013; I'd expect to be slowly start to move in the right direction but I think the next quarter I wouldn't expect them to come down a lot just because we're still finishing up for the third and fourth quarter. But once we get through the Department of Justice lookback, once we get &#x2013; settlement work, once we get through the lookback, there are &#x2013; a lot of expenses will come out relatively quickly and the core underlying loan numbers go down but I think we've peaked, but I don't &#x2013; I think it will take us as we &#x2013; into early next year when you start to see meaningful quarter-by-quarter improvement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the decline from $17 billion in the back half of this year is more from the New BAC stuff, would you say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think if you look at that chart on head count, John, that Bruce showed you in the upper right-hand corner, watch the quarter-by-quarter sort of trend and you can see that from a broad franchise, apps and LAS were down 20,000 people year-over-year and 3,000 this quarter, including an &#x2013; overcoming an increase in LAS, and so you've just seen it come through quarter by quarter by quarter so we are still driven largely this year by the non-LAS and then the LAS will help probably more in 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>And your next question is from the site of Paul Miller with FBR. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you very much. Hey, Brian, can you help us on Slide 16? A follow-up question on the &#x2013; you said the $8.6 billion private label, that settlement last night settled 20% of that, or roughly $1.7 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we said so. If you look at the &#x2013; that's correct that on the monolines, as you look at the dollar of claims it was roughly 20%. I think, Paul, though that the other thing to keep in mind is that when you look at the monolines, some of the exposure is included within the claims, and with respect to certain other monolines it's within the litigation number. But you are correct that with respect to the Syncora settlement, it was 20% of the outstanding claims.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Of the monolines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just to make sure, you said private and Bruce said monolines but the monolines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Said private.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I heard it wrong. The other question is like the private &#x2013; I mean the GSE reps and warrant putbacks continues to grow and I agree with you that after 25 payments you shouldn't have to pay any reps and warrants. But how is this going to be settled? Will the GSEs go to court? Have they gone to court? I don't think you are in dialogue with them. I know you probably don't want to make a comment about that, but how can we look at this as analysts; how will this be eventually settled? Will it have to go to court?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, I would just reiterate your point. I think if you look back on Slide 33 and look at the new claim trends that are coming in from the GSEs it's very clear that the new trends that are building up in that bucket were back in the 2006-2007 vintages. So I think we clearly have a disagreement and the way that it gets resolved is obviously through one of two ways. Either they would look to bring an action or alternatively there would be a settlement but those would be the two ways that it would get resolved.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, if you look on those pages you can see that there are approved repurchases going through in quarters, so there's a pattern which things &#x2013; we are still paying Fannie today on ones we believe we owe them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you're paying on those that are less than two years of payments right? The disagreements are coming about on those loans that have made over 25 payments right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We are paying on the ones that are consistent with our past beliefs that we owe them the money. We decide the payment exactly but it's really do we owe them the money or not.</p>

          <p>And we turn our next question from the site of Glenn Schorr with Nomura. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Quick one. The Basel III 8.1% that you showed, correct me if I'm wrong, it includes 2.5% but not the NPR? I'm curious on why you took that route and what your estimate might be using the standardized approach?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. That's correct, Glenn, and I think as we look at the NPR obviously there is a comment period, there's a lot of clarification and qualification that needs to get baked in. We've done the work and based on our understanding realizing it's a draft and there's going to be a lot of comments, we think the negative effect would be around 15 basis points but I think we're just hesitant to include it in the number until there's exactly clarity and the different clarifications get made and the rules become a little more clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's all we really needed just to get that range. That's helpful. And then on the &#x2013; just curious I don't know if I missed it in the prepared remarks but I think the private label claims spiked by like 77%. I'm not sure if that's a single private label holder or what caused that spike?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a series of holders and I think the one thing that I think is important to take a step back and when you think about these private label claims, is that when we set up the reserves and entered into the settlement at the end of the second quarter of last year, we obviously established both the reserves and range of possible loss with the anticipation that we would see increased claim activity.</p>
          <p>And I think as you look at these private label claims, I think it's important to think of a couple things. The first is they're notional amounts. The second thing is, if you look at the losses that tend to be associated with those notional amounts, they're at roughly $0.60 on the dollar of what the notional amounts are. So if you take that $8 billion number that's come in and think about it in the context of $0.60, it gets you down to a number of roughly $5 billion. And then, you can take the settlement data that we've had out there if you wanted to look at a Gibbs &amp; Bruns type settlement number off of collateral losses, and if you applied that to that number, you get something that's well below $1 billion. And obviously as we go through the process and set up both reserves and range of possible loss, we factor in the data that you see there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very helpful. I appreciate that. Last one's a quickie; there was nothing in the Q, the past Q on LIBOR. I know it's a sticky situation but is there any &#x2013; I think you only set LIBOR in U.S. dollars, if that's correct. And just curious, if you can update us on anything related to that issue now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean I think obviously all of you have seen the different press reports and that you're aware that we're a panel bank. Not unlike others, we've received and are cooperating with the inquiries that we get from both the U.S. and the foreign regulators. We're also one of a number of defendants in some of the other LIBOR-related litigation. And just given the fact that these are active matters, there's really not a lot more than we can say than that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We'll go next to the site of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. If I could just follow up a little bit on the net interest income commentary. I guess, first, when you talk about the jumping off point, that $10.25 billion, I guess I'm trying to think why it's not at $10.5 billion roughly including some of the liability management. And then, from there, we've got to make adjustments up or down for loans, securities, and interest-rate environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're saying the same thing slightly differently that we did, which is that the $10.25 billion is generally where we were at in the second quarter adjusted for that activity. And you're right, going forward, there should be a net incremental $240 million a quarter that would get added to that. And then, plus or minus whatever you see in balance levels and rate movement. So, we said it slightly differently but you're right, you can look at it the way you just articulated it as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, taking out the accounting nuances of premium amortization hits, the market-related hedge ineffectiveness, like as we just think about the core portfolio and some of the repricing that you might see in the securities book if rates stay here, I mean I would assume there's just kind of some natural drag to the core NIM if rates were to stay here that we would expect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you almost need to look at it portfolio by portfolio. Obviously the securities portfolios are subject to rates either going up or down from here. I think if you look go back and look at the different card portfolios, that the actual rates on the card portfolios have been pretty sticky where they are. And obviously, beyond just NIM, as you go down to the pre-tax line, we're benefiting from credit improvement within the Card business.</p>
          <p>And then I would say if you look at and go through some of the commercial and corporate loan pricing, that I would characterize that environment as generally pretty stable at this point. So to your point as far as where do you see and is there downward pressure going forward, I think it's going to be more a function of both loan balances as well as where rates go from here more than anything else.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then I guess that you're not the only bank but like a number of banks have kind of brushed off the low rate impact on the securities book. And I know it takes time for the securities portfolio to reprice but if we adjust your yield for some of the one-timers, it seems like it's around 2.8%. And my guess is the stuff that you're adding is 1.5% to 1.7% right now. So I mean hypothetically if rates stay here it's just kind of a constant bleed down to that, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what I'd say is that as we look out at, and I think if you go back to last year, we could see, and I think as we looked out we're pretty close ex the FAS 91 and the premium amort of being pretty close to where we thought NII would land. And what I would say at this point is that I think all other things being equal in this environment, obviously there's a little bit of pressure downward on that.</p>
          <p>I think the other thing though, and clearly what we're looking to do and working real hard to mitigate and hopefully improve where we are from a net interest perspective, is the debt footprint. And I think as you look out it's apparent we've got roughly $15 billion of maturities during the balance of the year and we'll look to clearly offset to the extent that that pressure exists, work real hard to continue to shrink the debt footprint because we're paying roughly $2.5 billion a quarter on that long-term debt footprint and obviously one of the things that's in our control is to continue to shrink that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just separate topic briefly here, obviously there's a lot of cost savings coming from New BAC, probably another $7 billion or so versus what's in the run rate now. The legacy mortgage costs could come down you said it and we've estimated maybe $8 billion annually. So these are really big numbers off of your expense base. Are there any modest offsets like ramp ups and investment spends or some of the growth initiatives you talked about in the commercial, anything in those areas that we should be factoring in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; so think about the Markets business. So the revenues and compensation will follow that, so be careful to always adjust that to what you think it is. But outside of that we're &#x2013; for example we invested about $3 billion in technology development this year, about a billion of that &#x2013; about $750 million of that will go to New BAC implementation, which is going through the run rate. And as that comes off we'll turn that $750 million level back to the core businesses.</p>
          <p>So embedded in that is shifting money around even on something like that to help drive the business growth. So of course if you look in core consumer you'd see expenses are flattish when you adjust for litigation quarter-to-quarter. That's because that business is putting on loan officers and putting on FSAs and putting on preferred bankers and the preferred growth area of the business while in the mass-market the retail business we're bringing it down.</p>
          <p>So I think you're seeing those investments go on in the business and so we're taking advantage of those opportunities. Our marketing dollars, we've always &#x2013; we're careful with them but we continue to watch them and trim them, but we're getting rid of a lot of expense that is just coming from the overall reposition of the company including real estate expenses and things like that. So there's enough room to invest and embedded in the way we did New BAC is two &#x2013; at least a couple years of growth capacity that we've left in there to &#x2013; assuming the economy which is bumping around at 2%, 2.5% type of growth. So I think we're comfortable that you won't see a big offset to it in that context.</p>
          <p>When you go to the Markets business, we built the international platform out. We'll always take opportunities to add people where opportunity is, but even on the international we've brought that back a little bit because the fees available and the trading processes available are down. So I'm not overly concerned about the reinvestment rate within the businesses. There's &#x2013; the money's there, so you should think a lot of that is only coming through today net of the implementation costs, which that, we can reposition.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Thanks. One follow-up question on the capital. You indicated that Basel III proposals, if you put them all in, would be about a 15 basis point hit, lots of caveats around the fact that we need more clarification. I guess I'm wondering is that on an advanced basis or standardized basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be on a &#x2013; assuming all model approval, so it's going to be on an advanced basis, which I think from everything that we've seen, Betsy, I think we clearly believe that that will be our governor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so &#x2013; and then the standardized rate with the Collins amendment, when you have to disclose whichever is lower? Would the standardized have an impact there or no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think from everything we're seeing at this point clearly the advanced approach is going to be our governor, so as you look at the different rules assume we're advanced.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Betsy, also remember when we're saying fully phased in we are still deducting the entire DTA in terms of the calculations as of today and by time those rules will be phased-in, we'll earn that back over time. So there are other adjustments, which while you are making these adjustments on this side we'd agree with you but the fully phased-in acts as if the rules were there, fully implemented and it's still five to six years out. And so as you watch this really play out you will see differences in the reported numbers during time and we will earn back the DTA and that creates capital at a faster rate than otherwise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Okay. That's helpful. On Page 16, I just want to make sure that I understand what you were saying about the DOJ AG is holding onto the loans and then you've got this 15,000 loan servicing sold that are going to be completed this month so I just want to make sure I understand how that's going to flow through into not only expected declines in delinquencies, that's over and above the 300 that you're talking about over the next 12 months or that's embedded within?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The servicing sales are embedded within that net 300,000 units.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But then the comments that you were making about the DOJ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the DOJ just as we attempt to modify some of those loans it has slowed down what would have gone through the normal process as we satisfy those obligations. So we look at that as more of a one to two quarter delay; not something that is permanent and I think the thing we just wanted to make sure of is we've spoken publicly before that as we look out at over the course of the second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, first quarter that we were thinking it would be a net 300,000 reduction and we just want to make it clear that over that timeframe we are not coming off that guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, as we think about the LAS expenses, as you've indicated a decline in the delinquencies obviously should be driving down your LAS expenses. When I look at the servicing pools of foreclosure to liquidation or past due to liquidation, I'm not seeing that much of a ramp-up yet. Can you give us some thoughts on what you are doing to try to ramp that up and when you think that turn is going to happen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, a couple things. I think the first thing is that when you look at the expense side, just to keep in mind embedded in these numbers are a couple things that we have absorbed in the second quarter as we go forward. First is obviously as part of the different settlements we have had to staff up and obviously going to single point of contact at the level of expense. The second thing is there are a variety of obligations under the DOJ AG settlement including getting through the modifications that adds expense and obviously there is some of the lookback and another activities that adds expense.</p>
          <p>So as you look at those different things from an expense perspective those are all embedded in the second quarter and it's why we believe they will trend down based on the guidance that Brian had given before. I think as it relates to some of the activity as far as the different buckets of getting the number of 60-plus day delinquencies out, I don't think there's any question that the second quarter was a little bit slower in those different buckets than what we would have expected. At the same time, as we look out at, and as I said over the next couple quarters, as we see the different pipelines, the different servicing sales and everything else, we are still quite comfortable with what we've communicated before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And last on the DOJ piece, a lot of that review has to be done by the end of this year, can you tell us how much you think the expenses could come down as you move into 1Q, 2Q from those reviews being completed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we've said it will take us the rest of the year so you'll see more benefits next year in terms of them coming down plus the day-to-day work. You've got multiple things going on. You've got the DOJ, you've got the foreclosure lookback which is running through here and then just getting the inventory down overall. And remember also Betsy there's a flow in each quarter that you address. Each in 75,000 or 80,000 new units come in in the second quarter. So just from the general delinquency flows of the portfolios.</p>
          <p>So all of that put together what we're saying is for the rest of this year we are busy getting the DOJ behind us, getting the work done on the lookback and get that behind us which is very expensive largely not through the personnel line but largely through the out of pocket expenses to third-party the independent foreclosure review. And then you'll see it start coming down next year more measurably because those two activities will be completed as you said and then the rest of the balances come down so year-over-year we're down 200,000 60-plus units but remember in that year we probably had 250,000 think about maybe 300,000 new units flow in from the delinquency proposal portfolio so you made a net gain over the top of that and that front-end flow is slowing down as the portfolio shrinks and the asset quality gets better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Got that. I just wondered if it was possible to put a number on the third-party payments that you've got associated with this review that could end at year-end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we can take our next question; this one from the site of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners. Your line is open</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. On &#x2013; just back on capital so I just want to with the capital ratios coming in above where you had targeted for the full-year as well, how do we think about you have a new target for the end of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have not put out a new target for this year. I think the things that I would say is you look at capital let's think about it both numerator and denominator. On the numerator side as you look at us generating net income and given where we are from an DTA perspective, I think generally you can think about that capital number growing in the zip code of 1.5 times our net income. So you've got that benefit and that relates to the tax position that Brian referenced and unlike some of our other peers it's largely in the U.S. where we generate income.</p>
          <p>Secondly, and I think one of the benefits that we had this quarter that just be aware of is that obviously as we continue to drive down into self-servicing that benefits the MSR which is a capital benefit; that MSR obviously also bounces around with rates as does OCI so I think as you think about the numerator I would think about those different things.</p>
          <p>And as we look at the denominator, and moving forward, I think we still believe that we've got a decent bit of runway on the denominator as we go forward both from actual risk reduction things that we continue to do and as we continue to reduce legacy assets that we believe that there's upside there, and then secondly, there's still a lot of model work that we're working through that we believe will provide further benefit as we go throughout the end of this year and into next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Should we assume that the runoff portfolios more than offset incremental growth? Or are they offsetting now? How do we think about kind of the overall balance sheet size?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that clearly some of the stuff that runs off given its nature tends to be higher on the risk weighting spectrum. So, as you think about that amount that runs off of $5 billion, some of that has decent risk weightings associated with it. Until we see the actual mix of what we're able to get and what comes on it's probably not appropriate to comment but we're obviously mindful as we look to grow and put assets on what the different Basel III risk weightings are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thank you. And then lastly just back on expenses, can you help us understand in terms of Phase 1 and Phase 2, $8 billion by mid-2015, I just want to understand is Phase 1 now the $5 billion you've realized $1 billion, is there timing of realization on the same glide path as it had before? I recall it was going to be coming in sooner by the end of 2013 but maybe I'm not recollecting correctly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think a couple things on there, Andrew. What we had said when we came out with New BAC 1 is that it was $5 billion on an annual basis. It would be fully phased in by the end of 2014. We said that we'd realized 20% of that by the end of 2012 and you're exactly correct that we've subsequently said that we're ahead of schedule with respect to that 20% by the end of 2012. And as I mentioned earlier, as you think about the New BAC 2, when you think about that $3 billion over the course of the next three years, unlike New BAC 1, I would generally think about that in the buckets of kind of a third, a third, a third in each of the three years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. So just to be clear on the New BAC 1, if 20% is realized in this year, how much should we think about next year? Is the bulk of that coming in next year? Is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've not provided that guidance or split between the second and the third year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But just to be clear, we haven't changed what we've said before, we just added a &#x2013; the 2015 comes attached to Phase 2 not Phase 1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks. I was going to follow-up on some of the &#x2013; on the rep and warranty question. Given that we're not in dialogue with Fannie and that the private labels seem to be trying to get their suits in before Statute of Limitations hit, should we expect the same types of outstanding claims increase next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think at this point we're not going to predict what these claims are or not because I think you have to keep in mind that first, they tend to be lumpy. And the second thing is that I don't think we want to confuse claims that come in versus those that are valid that have the ability to come in. But I think as you think about it and you think about when the underwriting and the originations with respect to these slow down as we got into 2008, we're clearly almost 4 years into that. So I think, generally speaking, your point has some merit. But we're not going to predict exactly what we'd expect these to be besides that we expected those to increase. We've continued to see some of those increases in the second quarter and we'll see some more going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And just on a follow up, is it possible &#x2013; I'm trying to frame this $6 billion of increase in the outstanding claims and you give us the net claims every quarter. Is it possible to look at the total claims that you've gotten over this cycle and compare that $6 billion of new claims to the total claims? I mean is it &#x2013; if you've gotten I don't know, $60 billion of claims, it's a different &#x2013; or $600 billion of claims, it's a different growth rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you look at 32 and 33 you can sort of see that we paid out $13.6 billion &#x2013; on page 32 of the slides &#x2013; through this quarter. That's actually been paid on resolution of these types of things, and then, we have our reserves established for $15.9 billion. And then, if you look &#x2013; we don't &#x2013; I don't have it right here in front of me but if you look at this chart on page 33, we've been producing this now for better than a year-and-a-half so you can sort of go back and see the claims flows literally quarter-by-quarter going back pretty far.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. A couple of things. On the rep and warrant, Bruce, I understand the idea that you set up the reserve contemplating a lot of this. What should we look at from our vantage point kind of out here to kind of get the sense that you would need to add to the reserve? In other words, what would have to happen in order for that &#x2013; for you to add to them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, I think you almost need to go through the three different buckets. We obviously, as we've said before, believe that the work in the way that we reserve for the GSEs is based on our obligations. And we continue to believe that we're satisfying those obligations with respect to the GSE bucket. We think, second, if you go to the monolines, the deal that we referenced in core that we signed up &#x2013; that got done today was in the context of our reserves. So I think in the context of getting that one behind us it was where the reserves were. And so, I guess given that a fair bit of the monoline stuff is out there, relates to litigation. Obviously it's something from a litigation perspective was different than what we'd assumed. That would affect it.</p>
          <p>And then I think third, if you go down to the private label stuff you've got two different buckets of liability. You've got one from the rep and warrant perspective. And obviously, if there was different behavior from a claims perspective than what we've assumed in an outcome that we didn't anticipate, we'd have to adjust at that point if the experience was different than what we'd assumed. And then obviously, the fourth piece of it is that there is securities litigation that's out there that we touch on as far as looking at range of possible loss within our litigation bucket. So I think we've, at this point, we've got experience. We've got the different buckets and we've laid out what those are. And obviously changes from what our assumptions and our experience is what would change that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. On the comment that you made about the retail banking platform, now that you are on one platform is it more likely that you will kind of have a new retail banking offering and kind of adjust pricing and try to recapture some the revenue that's been lost over the several years? Any thoughts you can give on that Brian?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a combination of everything but if you look we've sort of passed through all the regulatory impacts now and you can see if you look at the consumer segment you can see the revenues have stabilized in terms of the fee revenues and started to grow really with activity at this point because you've now had the impact of the overdraft, and the interchange and everything through the quarterly results. And so the team is working on all &#x2013; the combination of all factors. Driving revenue from the standpoint of loan originations and things like that off the core portfolio, bringing down expenses; that's the 57 branches or whatever we reduced this quarter. And if you look at the people the head count in this business it's down from the a high point at one point 100,000 down to say 70,000 to give you a sense. And so we continue to reduce that.</p>
          <p>So it's a combination of all things so we continue to do it. A new offering, new account structures is something we have been testing we've been clear about that. We haven't made any decisions there and we continue to look at it. But interesting enough this mobile platform growth has really changed some of our thinking there because for example we send out 20-odd million texts a month to people telling their balances are low. The initiation of payments off the mobile platform is about $1 billion a week now, up dramatically year-over-year and continues to grow. And it's just a much more efficient and frankly strong service model. So I think it continues to be a combination of expenses and revenue and activity.</p>
          <p>I'd tell you the core sales of checking accounts were strong this quarter. The account closures by our customers the lowest since they've been in 2007 so the net attrition rates are down and we keep driving of all those different things. So I would not lean it's any one thing but the platform really Northwest and in California because people for get we did the Northwest gives us a much more &#x2013; a cheaper platform obviously but also a much more capable platform that we can change things quickly and get into the system. And we continue to look at account structures and making sure we balance the rates we charge for the value we're giving.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. My question is on LAS first off. The staffing levels there, it seems as though the FTE definition that you guys use in your LAS disclosures bounces around a little bit. I was hoping you could maybe give some clarity on that and maybe provide some consistent quarter-over-quarter disclosure over an extended period of time so we could get a better handle on exactly staffing levels there and what is moving, because it doesn't seem like it's just the FTEs plus third-party. Can you help out there a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have been consistent in the FTE's, the way we count the FTEs so you can see that. What you sometimes you hear numbers that are 42,000 and the 55,000; the 55,000 is the contractors. We have about 10,000 to 12,000, 13,000 contractors given working at a given time that are not on our payroll that we obviously pay through the expense line. And we'll talk about 50,000 plus people working. But the FTE numbers have been calculating consistently and if you look on page 15 you can see it's up 7,000 employees FTE equivalents from 2000 &#x2013; the second quarter of 2011 to 2012. But the contractor one moves around a little bit based on the ebbs and flows of what we're doing and you should see those come down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but last quarter in your deck you had FTEs at 38.1 and now you are 42.4 but you say you're only up 0.3. So I guess I don't understand that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in the last quarter there was an adjustment &#x2013; there is a group that's in our core Consumer business that does good mortgage servicing before collection and we've moved some people around so there might be a little bit of noise there but from a core activity level you are seeing this thing is really run about 55,000 people equivalent, 42,000 with us, 13,000 with other people.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess I'm just &#x2013; it would be helpful to see it consistently disclosed because I mean what I'm kind of getting at here is starting at about third quarter of last year, indications were that LAS staffing was at or near peak, but we've actually seen the staff levels go up every quarter since and I might be not remembering this correctly but I seem to recall that you saying previously that that LAS staffing should be &#x2013; start to go down in the back half of 2012, previously. Now it seems like they're calling for those declines to be held off until 2013, so what I'm getting at is can you give a sense of your confidence level of these cost projections and maybe how much we should bake in there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me just make sure on &#x2013; with respect to the staffing levels and what you're looking at, what was adjusted this quarter was the &#x2013; within Legacy Assets and Servicing there is some non-distressed servicing that's in there that when we reported this segment, we adjusted the people that do some of that non-distressed servicing in the numbers. That's reflected in the numbers and we've gone back and adjusted those numbers to make sure that it's consistent on a look-back basis so you got apples-to-apples within these numbers. Okay? The second question as it relates to the staffing levels I think what we've said this quarter with respect to the overall expense base in staffing is that we're wrapping up the different parts of the different DOJ, AG and other settlements and we would start to expect both the people and the expense to go down probably more towards the latter part of the year with significant momentum in 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I get it, believe me, the business has been really difficult and I'm sure it's been really hard to manage, so I can certainly appreciate the challenges there. I guess it's just a key part of the story is a lot of this expense improvement. And some of the commentary around improvements in 2013 it seems as though it's been &#x2013; that's going to be sort of slow whereas you get a more substantial pickup in 2014. And I think, Brian, you've made some of those references in some of the investor presentations where I've heard. So could you give us maybe a bit more, is it possible to get a bit more specific on what you're talking about there? I mean are we talking about somewhere in the ballpark of like a 10% to 15% reduction in that $8 billion ex litigation number? Or is it more like a third? Is it &#x2013; what are we thinking about for 2013 and then 2014, is it impossible?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've given you an overall viewpoint that says that the amount of 60-plus days delinquent loans will ultimately get into say the 300,000 range. That will take us the rest of this year and next year to get it down into those ranges and probably into 2014. For that we're saying that takes about $500 million of quarterly costs versus the $2.8 billion you have in there today. And so that's what we've given.</p>
          <p>The pace of this even six months ago, for example, on those closure lookback, we just got the final rules recently about how to finish the work. And that was months after we expected. So a lot of this is based on, in that case we had to get the final rules to actually go do the work. And the Department of Justice, the settlement came through in early April, the final settlement. A lot of people believed it would be done a few months before that because it was largely worked out. We couldn't start the work until the settlement was finalized.</p>
          <p>So, so many things move around a month or two but in the grand scheme of things the key is to get this from the $2.8 billion level to the $500 million level and they're in there, all the people costs, and in there on top of that is some of the &#x2013; effectively each quarter the one-time adjustments for the lifetime expectation for foreclosure delays and things like that, that we adjust on, but I think you'll see this come down relatively quickly once we break through the two big bodies of work and then &#x2013; being the Department of Justice settlement work and the lookback. And then after that it is really scheduled against as the work goes down, the people will come down. And we're working as hard as we can to get it down.</p>
          <p>So I think any adjustment to the view of timing has largely been just to make sure we do it right, because the number one thing is to do this right for the consumers, continue to modify the million plus loans we've modified, continue to work the short sale process and other alternative resolutions, continue to do all the work under all the various programs that are there now and get added. But it's always subject to making sure we do it right and we are not going to bring the head count down until we know we've got the job done well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Yeah, no, as I said I get that it's been a challenging environment so that's probably been real difficult. Last, not to beat a dead horse here but the put back claims, just on the GSE side because I get it, the private label, right, that's going to be solved by the courts and probably pretty difficult but at least with GSEs there's a lot more history. When you look at some of the Fannie and Freddie filings, BofA and Countrywide really stand out on the pending and disputed claims. You all are about 6.5 times your closest peer even though the repurchase levels are about in line and the withdrawal claims are only about 1.8 times your closest peer. So it seems as though these disputes are a BofA specific issue. What gives you confidence that you're going to be able to buck the trend of the entire industry? Can you help us out on that front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think all we can really say at this point quite frankly is that the way that we look at this and in the reserving is based on our view of what our understanding agreements are. We have said there are disagreements that are out there. And I'm not sure there's a lot more to say than that. I think the only other thing that I would say though is that as you look out at and you look at these agreements and you go back, we were able on a look-back basis to get a deal done with Freddie Mac on a global basis to resolve all the Countrywide claims prior to the end of 2008. So I think the way that we're going about it and looking to solve these challenges has not changed the bet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you also have to remember that if go you look at 32 and think through the categories which there is resolution on and so the claims are really coming through; there's obviously disputes on, in the sense that the private label CSD issues has been resolved with Bank of New York for over a year now and we're waiting for the core process to take place, as Bruce mentioned on the Countrywide. So I think the issue is that the volumes we would have are not coming through big parts of the production at the time, the 2004 to 2008 production, because they are settled, and the monoline is the same thing. So obviously the people that &#x2013; specifically Fannie that we are going to have the biggest argument with are the people still submitting claims.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. And then the last one. Just on wealth management, can you give a sense for net new assets and what they were and what they have been over the last years? Because it seems as though that's not a disclosed number anymore. It would be really helpful to get that figure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Which number are you looking for?</p>

          <p>We'll get Lee to get back to you on that. You can see the long-term AUM flows which has been driving the business to be more of in the financial plans of the consumers or the customers and clients. The AUM flows are where we focus and move from sort of the transaction based to the more money managed basis and you can see those flows have been strong. We'll get to the new asset side.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Go next to the site of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Syncora's press release cited that they received $375 million in the settlement and you said that it was about 20% of the $3.1 billion which is a bit more than $600 million so that implies a settlement rate of around $0.60 on the dollar. And I wonder if there is anything that would make Syncora better or worse exposure than the rest of the monoline claims? And then secondly, why would the settlement rate on the private label be radically lower than what it is on the monoline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think you have to be careful, Chris. I can assure you that the rate at which was paid was not anywhere near the number that you quoted, and the reason is keep in mind with the monolines, as we've talked about you've got a couple different buckets that go into what you think a monoline exposure is that drives that number significantly lower than what you just quoted.</p>
          <p>The first is there are claims that come in that monolines have submitted. At points in time, monolines have stopped submitting claims because they believe that they're going the route of litigation; and then third, over and above those two buckets you have things that may happen in the future that have not been realized or worked through. So when I quoted the fact that the Syncora settlement was 20% of those claims, you should not in any way extrapolate out that that's the payment percentage.</p>

          <p>And we'll take our final question; this one is from the site of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just a real big picture question, what inning are we in from the negative impact from this very low interest rate environment? You had one bank say it was pretty much done. They're not going to have a whole lot more negative impact. You had another large bank saying well it's more than half done. It's mostly done. And a third bank has said, well actually it's going to hurt a lot more if rates stay here. So where do you stand on that question? And specifically, I note this quarter, the deposit rate only declined by two basis points whereas the yield on loans were down 11 basis points and commercial loan yields were down 17 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I'd say a couple things on that, Mike. The first thing I'll address is just your last question which is that where do you &#x2013; we continue to look at, and given this rate environment, to be very disciplined with respect to what we do on the deposit pricing. And as rates persist, we'll continue to revisit that, realizing that when you get to the levels that we're at with respect to deposit pricing there's only so much further that you can go.</p>
          <p>I think with respect to the rest of your question, I think you need to split the rate question really into two pieces. The first piece is that as you look at loan spreads and what we're seeing from a loan spread perspective, that on those things that are floating rate based, the spreads at this point and some of the new originations spreads we have seen, that the spreads on those have stabilized. So I think as it relates to, is there more downside or are you concerned more on rates with respect to that, at this point I think we feel okay with that.</p>
          <p>The last piece is where it is with respect to those fixed rate instruments. We've been very careful at this point to manage and to manage the duration such that we don't have OCI issues with respect to Basel III. And if you look at, on a swapped basis with respect to duration on the securities portfolio, we're just over a year on a swapped basis, realizing it's a couple more years if you didn't take into account swaps. So I think as we look at it, the piece that probably has some element of risk over time is if these rates stay at this point, the overall securities portfolio. But I think a lot of what we do at this point, the low rate environment is baked into it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just one follow up, so I'm looking at page 10 of the supplement, and I'm sure you know these numbers. Total commercial yield from the first quarter to the second quarter went from 3.52% to 3.35%. That's a 17 basis point decline in the commercial loan yield. So is there noise there? What gives you such good confidence that that decline is pretty much done?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think if you go into it that if you look at where the majority of the noise came in and if you look at that there are two pieces that move. The first and probably the most significant was, and we disclosed this back in the first quarter, we had some gains on the overall leasing portfolio that settled up during the first quarter. So if you look at that, if you look at the number, you can see the leasing portfolio came in by about 100 basis points. That's clearly something, as we look out at that, we don't expect to repeat.</p>
          <p>So I think as you look at those two buckets, that's the reason &#x2013; both, so if you look at U.S. commercial it was down a little bit. Commercial real estate was effectively flat. Commercial lease is where you saw the biggest change. And on the non-U.S. commercial stuff where you'll see that number bounce around a little bit is if we're doing trade finance, it tends to have a little bit lower rate than some of the straight up corporate stuff. But I would say as we look out at, and look at the new origination spreads that we're seeing on the base business, we really didn't see any erosion of spreads that we booked with respect to newer loans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that jumping off point of what, would say take $10.2 billion of NII, you expect that to be flat or higher, then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we've said at this point is that we think that's the jumping off point. We mentioned the benefit that we have from the long-term debt footprint. And then, we'll obviously need to see activities during the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, to back it up to the broader level, think about two or three things. One is the low rate environment has been impacting us and that's why one of the issues about you have to go out to the cost side and get the cost structure in line because the low interest rate environment with respect to revenues.</p>
          <p>Secondly, remember in these runoff portfolios we are giving up net interest margin gross yield, but if you look at our net interest margin minus charge-offs you'll see that it's actually growing year-over-year second quarter last year to second quarter this year. So what is running off is costing us money or is not contributing a lot to the pre-tax lines as Bruce said.</p>
          <p>And the third is we continue to have benefits that we think that are unique to this franchise because of the amount of acquisition debt we've built up on the long-term debt side, to continue to drive that down. So as you watch the balance sheet shift across time, the non-interest-bearing sources, deposit funding sources become more and more a higher and higher percentage, of which they're already high, of the total funding. And if you think about it very simply we pay about $0.5 billion a quarter for all the deposit funding, the $1 trillion, and we pay about $2.5 billion, round numbers, a quarter for the $300-odd billion of long-term debt. So the effectiveness of moving that down because we just don't need the size, we have the &#x2013; because we're running off late assets which aren't yielding as much is very beneficial going forward. So we're fighting the trend. This is the trend that's held on a little longer than most people expected but we're fighting it with all the arrows in our quiver that we have.</p>

          <p>And we did have one more question queuing at the site of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just an administrative question; you'd noted that your tax guidance for the remainder of the year is around 22%, excluding the effects of the U.K. tax. Last quarter you noted that you thought the tax rate was going to be about 30%. I'm just curious as to what's driving the decline in the tax rate guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe, and I could &#x2013; I'd have to go back and look, I think if you look at it and what we're saying now is that the 22% includes the different preference items that we have based on where we are today. And as we look out at that 22% is a good number. As it relates to what we'd expect before, as we've said, adjusting for what we'd see coming out of U.K. tax.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And then again another, one final administrative question, you mentioned about $300 million in benefits from your actions reducing higher cost debt, $60 million of that was recognized in the second quarter. And then on page 8 of the slide deck you say that there's about $100 million of savings from those actions in 2012, another $180 million expected in 2013. Is that $300 million number you're talking about the equivalent of the $280 million in combined savings in 2012 and 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The &#x2013; we gave you that, the information on the liability management action, to give you a sense as to the benefit that they would provide. So the way to think about those savings that we talked about in the liability management is they're embedded in the $300 million quarterly benefit, of which $240 million will be incremental in the third quarter of this year relative to the second quarter of this year.</p>
