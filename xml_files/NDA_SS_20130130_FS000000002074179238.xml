          <p>Good day and welcome to the Nordea Bank AB Fourth Quarter and Year-End Report 2012 International Telephone Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Rodney Alfv&#xE9;n. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator. Most welcome to today's presentation. We will start with a very brief introduction of our Group CEO, Mr. Christian Clausen. And then we will follow that by a Q&amp;A. We will have the opportunity to ask questions to Mr. Clausen; to our CFO, Mr. Torsten Hagen J&#xF8;rgensen; and our Chief Risk Officer, Mr. Ari Kaperi.</p>
          <p>So, Christian, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello, everybody, and it's a pleasure to be here and present just very briefly a few things now. And you've probably already seen in the news today. But from my first slide, I have the P&amp;L, and you saw that we had a good income development and a very well-controlled cost development which means that actually our risk-adjusted profit is up 20%, ending the year on a 12.1% return on equity in Q4, and building 13.1% core Tier 1.</p>
          <p>And based on that, we put forward our plan for the future. We have delivered on the 2011 plan above what we set out to do in 2011, one and a half years ago. And now, we have plan for the coming years which is shaping the future relationship bank, as we call it, a lot to do with moving closer to customers, managing capital and cost and risk-weighted capital.</p>
          <p>And we actually have three areas where we intend to deliver and where we have, today, made the disclosure on how we see things going forward. One is our capital generation going forward and the fact that we'll return excess capital to shareholders.</p>
          <p>The second one is ROE target which we have revised or confirmed, but revised in the ways defined to 15% on a core Tier 1 above 13% in a normalized interest rate environment to make it more clear. And the core Tier 1 ratio above 13% is our new capital policy and that we intend to deliver continuously on our very well diversified and resilient business model, which should create very low volatility in our results. As it has done in the previous years, it will always do that in the future.</p>
          <p>And we will do that very much by increasing share of wallet, repricing, continued cost reductions, risk management and very much our accelerated risk-weighted assets efficiency program which I have delivered in Q4 and Q3. We'll deliver even more during next year and also going forward, very much compensating the Basel III effects and the growth we have in our RWAs.</p>
          <p>And my final slide is the one that summarizes our capital generation in recent years, which demonstrate that we have built &#x20AC;20 billion of capital. We have retained &#x20AC;12 billion for equity and paid out &#x20AC;7.6 billion. Going forward, we will not need to build very much equity according to our plans, and therefore our capital generation will be available for shareholders. And the way we will do that will be discussed later on dividends or we will get a mandate for share buybacks which is another possibility.</p>
          <p>This will end my introductory remarks, and I'm sure we will have questions now.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll now take our first question from Matti Ahokas in Handelsbanken. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Good afternoon. Two questions if I may. Firstly, regarding Norway, what's your take on the mortgage risk weights? What do you assume they will be now after March? And have you already increased the mortgage rates in Norway to adapt for this and if not, when will you do it and how much of an impact do you expect that would have?</p>
          <p>The second question is regarding Denmark. Hearing your comments earlier today that, obviously, it looks like it's stabilizing but what are the key sensitivities for the reported loan losses in Denmark? House prices apparently are stable but what is really the game-changer? What could make that the loan losses could be a lot lower than what they have been? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Talking on the mortgage risk weights in Norway, we have included in our assumptions that there will be mortgage risk weights of somewhere about 20% in place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What about the margins or the mortgage rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that our margins have improved and I think we'll see potential for further increase in margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But have you increased the rates already and/or do you plan to do in the coming future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may, Matti, as you might recall, we started last year with a fairly low profitability in Norway in 2011 beginning 2012 coming from too low margins. So, what we done in 2012 is actually to raise the margin to have a more sufficient profitability with the current situation. So, we have not taken into account any further increase in risk weights and things like that. So, the main purpose in 2012 has been to restore margins to a more decent profitability with the current capital requirements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I could comment on this, your question on sensitivities in Denmark, what would be the levers to take the loss level down. You mentioned yourself one important lever, it's house prices naturally. But then I would say that this and overall consumer confidence is the main issue in the Danish economy. So then, in a way, when that is up, naturally, that will influence on local SME corporate and under performance as well as that will be the trigger also for the house prices.</p>
          <p>And all issues related, of course, then economic macro drivers are, of course, behind this consumer confidence that when the situation in Europe, I mean, the export market is improving and issues like that, then, of course, that will have an influence. That will be my answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Great. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll now take our next question from Geoff Dawes from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Geoff Dawes here from Soc G&#xE9;n. Two quick questions from myself. First of all, if we can look at the Finnish operations for a little bit, obviously, the pre-provision and post-provision profitability is quite depressed. Is there anything you can do around asset repricing or is that absolutely impossible in the Finnish market, particularly on the mortgage side, and costs haven't really added too much to that equation either? So, how would you get the Finnish profitability up to adequate levels, or is it purely about waiting for a rate increase?</p>
          <p>Second question is around the shipping operations. You guided at the start of last year that the shipping division would remain breakeven or profitable every quarter throughout 2012. That has obviously been the case. Can you give us similar outlook for guidance for 2013, i.e., will the shipping book be profitable every quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can start talking about Finland, yes, we see that there is a potential for margin hikes, actually both in the mortgage group as well as in the corporate group. The Finnish market has been and still is very price sensitive so that the banks who have started this type of increasing margins usually have seen that quite quickly in terms of volumes and number of customers and market shares. So, that skipped a little bit <mark type="indiscernible" /> (09:08) this type of trend.</p>
          <p>But now older banks, they are actually now taking up their margins. And I'm relatively, let's say, honestly, and that we can see some kind of increase especially in the mortgage with the margins in Finland. Then, again, of course, Finnish business is &#x2013; the structure of Finnish business is they're very sensitive with the interest rate as you said yourself, so that we have a very high and big transaction account portfolio in Finland, higher in relative terms than in any other market. Of course, that is very sensitive to interest rate levels and that is, of course, one driver which is keeping this profitability a little bit lower in Finland compared to other countries.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the cost, let's say, savings and efficiencies naturally we are running the same type of, let's say, programs as in all other countries so that there is no &#x2013; Finland is no exception on that. So that technically, we'll work on cost efficiency also in Finland.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then should I continue on shipping as well? Shipping will be profitable, going forward. It's been profitable also with the crisis and it will continue because we're saying that loan losses may stay at this level for some more quarters. We actually don't really know when it will start to go down, but it's unlikely it will go up and we see some improvements coming in towards the end of the year in shipping values and other things. So, we are determined to keep ourselves profitable with every single quarter during the crisis in our shipping business, which just shows what fantastic business line it is, one of the best ship financing companies in the world.</p>
          <p>And I just met shipping companies both in China and Singapore, and I can tell you they really know who have supported them during the crisis. So, this will be a fantastic business now when these loan losses starts to be a bit lower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. That's fantastic clear. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We will now take our next question from Omar Keenan from Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Thanks very much for taking the questions. Just two short questions for me. Firstly, just wondering on the 1.5% guidance of RWA efficiency. I was wondering if you could give us an update of the timetable we can expect that to come through. In particular, when will be, by the time you have to start reporting in Basel II, which for the Swedish banks might be by the July 1 of this year.</p>
          <p>And just a second quick question, just on capital and you discussed that excess capital, maybe your policy requirement to be returned to shareholders and now you're at 13% fully loaded core Tier 1. I was just wondering if you could perhaps just give us a bit more insight into how you're thinking about how projected growth, your current capitalization and payout policy, and other options fit together. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start on the last question. Just to clarify, we are now 13.1% Basel 2.5, as we say, in the table, for example, in our analyst presentation, table 20, just to make it clear. So, what we are saying there, we are 13.1% now, then we will have the Basel III effect, 1.5%. We will grow, and then we will have our efficiency programs. And this will not gain during the year, but we expect in every single quarter to be above 13% for the rules applying in that particular quarter.</p>
          <p>So, returning excess capital, yes, but that some time I think we will need to see the Basel III reporting come in as expected and then that stance will be taken. It's a clear commitment to return capital. We don't want to run the bank with more capital than necessary. And with this very well diversified business model with low volatility, we can run the bank with somewhat lower capital than others because the volatility is so much less. But we're not giving any precise timing of excess capital returns to shareholders but the commitment to do so <mark type="indiscernible" /> (13:39)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Please continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. I guess just to expand on that question, I guess if we think about the full Basel III deductions taking place from the 1st of July, I guess how much of the 1.5% efficiency measures will be complete by the 1st of July as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I can take that part. If you have these presentation slides, on page 21, we have this kind of waterfall chart there showing a little bit on the element. So, in this RWA efficiency target, we're aiming at executing &#x20AC;25 billion during this year. And then your question is that how that is scheduled between the first half and second half, most of this is expected to come from this approval of advanced IRB model in Nordic corporate issues and portfolios and that we expect to come in place during the first half.</p>
          <p>Then, let's say, from the rest, that is split evenly between the first half and second half. So, let's say, roughly 70% of this &#x2013; 70% to 75% of this &#x20AC;25 billion is scheduled to be executed during the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now take our next question from Sofie Peterzens of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I was wondering, you have your profitability slide where you've got 1% of your &#x2013; or 100 basis points of your ROE improvement will come from labor losses. When should we really start to see that your loss has come down because if I back calculate that, it would mean that you would have around 15 basis points of credit losses? So, should we already start to see an improving trend in 2013? And yes, if you can talk a little bit about that.</p>
          <p>And then my second question relates to your buyback scheme. Are you &#x2013; if the Swedish government would reduce their 13.5% stake in Nordea, would you use potentially your buyback mandate to buy any of these shares? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Throughout this loan loss guidance, in a way, we don't give this kind of very precise guidance so that, okay, what is the exact number in loan losses in various years? But this is clear that we expect that during this period we are outlining here and in this material, we expect that this will happen. To be more precise when, that remains to be seen. But during, let's say, next, let's say, two, three years &#x2013; within the next two years, so we expect that. We, more or less, expect those levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But what about the &#x2013; I think your shipping and Denmark accounted for roughly three quarters of your losses in 2012. Should we &#x2013; do you expect an improvement in these losses for 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. What we have said is that we may see that as the current level of losses in those books. They are continuing for the next quarters, then it's very difficult to say that, okay, what happens in Q3, Q4, Q1, Q2, let's say, next year? So that is too precise guidance you are now asking so that I'm not willing to give such an exact one. But the trend is clear what we're obtaining and what we are believing. So that will be materializing during this period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now take our next question from Jacob Kruse of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Jacob from Autonomous Research. I just have two questions on your cost program. Firstly, the &#x20AC;450 million of savings, that's about 3% for the year. I don't quite understand why that doesn't lead to a reduction in cost given where inflation levels and the kind of union agreements that have been made with bank employees in the Nordic countries, which I guess to me look more like maybe 1.5% to 2% underlying cost inflation.</p>
          <p>And then my second question is, if I look at your cost base, your staff cost base in 2012 versus 2011 excluding the integration expense, that's up about 2.8% while you've cut your staff on average by about 5%. So that seems to be an 8% of negative wage inflation or migration of expenses somehow. So could you just talk about why you cannot be a little bit more aggressive and actually cutting cost, especially if we assume that we're not having a massive increase in either volumes or activity for the near future? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. If we start with the savings, I mean this 3% and you're right that inflation is somewhat lower but then I mean we are also in an investment phase. We still want to continue the business and improve and increase our franchise. So that will also drive this flat cost target. Then when it comes to the trends in 2012 versus 2011, if you adjust for foreign exchange or the FX movement and if you adjust for variable salaries, the cost is actually down 0.5%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And how much investment is there in that &#x20AC;450 million less underlying cost gross?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will be very happy to elaborate more on that on the Capital Markets Day. That's when we're going to give this sort of disclosure.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Most of my questions regarding RWA efficiency have been answered, but just a follow-up there. Is it that the mobile approval on RWA advanced also has to be, on the Norwegian part, has to be done by the Norwegian FSA? And in that sense, have you got any signals there that they will also do this within the next six months or something?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're right. It's more of it has to be approved by all four FSAs, including Norwegians and we will expect that that will be the case. Of course, if and when there are different specific issues with the specific FSAs, then we have to evaluate that, what does it mean to this approval? Of course, we may end up in the situation that in a way we don't introduce the model in all geographies as an extreme case, but nevertheless, we are working for the full rollout, the full approval and we believe that we will get it during the first half.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. Three quick questions, if I can, please. The first one on the target now of 13% Basel III core tier 1, could you please just elaborate a little bit on the drivers or the justification of that number? I know some of your peers have a range which goes slightly above that. Just we assume if you have the dialogue that gives you the comfort that 2013 is the go to number and are you making any assumptions on there on mortgage risk weights, kind of cyclical buffers and other still slightly unsolved regulatory inputs?</p>
          <p>The second question, please, sorry, back to the RWAs on slide 21. Your efficiency measures now target &#x20AC;35 billion of mitigation. I think the previous target was around &#x20AC;19 billion. So could you just give us some flavors to where the marginal &#x20AC;16 billion of RWA production is going to come from, where you're having particular success, really just give us a flavor of this gap and where it's coming from?</p>
          <p>And then the third question, please, on slide 22, this bridge of your ROE. Just getting a flavor please, if I can, to the 200 basis points of ROE improved from income generation and cost efficiency. Obviously as you discussed, you're aiming to keep costs broadly flat. So I suppose this is largely revenue-based. I'm sure we'll get more of this in March, but any rough guidance, please, on areas where you is what you feel particularly confident on revenue growth from here? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Yes, I think on the first one on the 13% core tier 1 target. I think we have developed a view on most of the known impacts on the capital requirements, including most of what have been mentioned mortgage risk rates in Norway and Sweden, FSA's IAS19, et cetera. So I think we have covered most of their requirements. And of course, we are then making assumptions of the actual outcome where there are ranges to be defined. We have, of course, signals then from that. So that has been a quite elaborate approach to this 30% Core Tier 1 target.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can take the next question with the RWA efficiency which is now &#x20AC;33 billion as you say compared with the &#x20AC;19 billion earlier communicated. The increase is coming from three components. Mostly, it's new rollouts which we are now implementing faster so that we are going for smaller and smaller portfolios earlier. We plan to introduce them a little bit later, let's say 2015, 2016. Now we have to simply speed it up in the planning of rolling those.</p>
          <p>Then we are talking about portfolios like Russia, we are going to have internal models. We are doing internal models in Nordea Finance. We are &#x2013; finally when we get this approval for advanced model then we extend that to international branches as well as in our market and trading of treasury books. And so for a lot of smaller rollout which we have to simply get faster.</p>
          <p>Then the next area is this cover even enhanced so called housecleaning exercises more and more, let's say efficient sourcing in of information and from our collaterals and other issues which are influencing under RWA calculation. And thirdly, we are going, let's say, refining and then making our models more and more granular, so that they are measuring better than the various segments. Currently, we have quite large parameters that they comment on many types of customers and we are doing more granular in that approach so that's improving and then be more precise in our models. Those are more of the issues we are now adding up to this current plan and of course, it takes more resources, more IT support and all that, but that is now what we are planning to do.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing on the ROE bridge question. In continuation, the cost efficiency, this is of course where we will come back to. But on the income generation side, it is, as mentioned, it's mainly driven by repricing and share volume effects and based on what we regard as moderate volume assumptions. And on the cost efficiency side, it's a long range of initiatives including types of processes, offshoring, and over time, of course, also people reduction. But then I think it's exactly what we will elaborate more on the Capital Market Day.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. I have two questions. The first one again related to slide 20 and the regulatory impact from Basel III. You're talking about &#x20AC;20 billion. As I see it, Swedish risk weights, are they in that figure at all? Norwegian risk weights, if I look at 35% risk weights, those two items by themselves should be some &#x20AC;11 billion. You have a sizable insurance base which don't make any deductions for all today. Just wondering how the figure is that low.</p>
          <p>My second question relates to slide 22 and the effect of return on equity from lower loan losses. On some of the early events, you said that this is Denmark and it's sitting where loan losses will normalize which makes a lot sense. What about the current very low loan loss level we have in the rest of the Nordics? Do we assume that will normalize in others or will just stay at the very low levels they are currently? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the first question, yes, the mortgage risk rates in Norway are fully included in the numbers and so the expectation of the Swedish mortgage weight of 15% is also included in the estimated regulatory fix in 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We are aware of some figures of some &#x20AC;10 billion to &#x20AC;11 billion for those two items?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We assume, as we said before, for the mortgage risk rate in Norway, we assume slightly above 20% risk weight.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With weaker somewhat more than &#x20AC;2 billion of risk-weighted assets and for the Swedish mortgage weights, it is around close to 30%. And in Sweden, it's Basel II and the effect that it has on core Tier 1 requirement is also included in the expected rate of 2013. Now we ask &#x2013; we will try to be allowed to meet this with Tier 1 or Tier 2 capitals but it is improving including the core Tier 1 requirements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question related with loan losses and how do we feel that other markets beyond Denmark and Sweden are developing. So there we believe that, more or less, the current status will prevail so that we don't foresee any kind of big increases and losses on average in other markets.</p>
          <p>Then, again, there may be ups and downs so that some markets may be up, some markets may be down, and that is, of course, our strength so that we have many markets and then they are compensating, more or less, each other in normal circumstances and it has been kind of a quarterly or even annual volatility. So that's our base estimation that on average, the other market, the loan losses in other markets would be, more or less, at this level also.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have two questions please. The first is related to slide 22 in your ROE progression. I'm just wondering if you could talk a bit about how the leverage moves as the ROE increases. So we have the RWA roughly flat, but what would RWA to assets or equity to assets or a Basel III leverage ratio look like and is that something that you focus on in your planning?</p>
          <p>And then my second question relates to partly the income generation expectation you have. How much of this do you think could come from margin expansion from reduced liquidity requirements? Now, you're well above the 100% in LCR and potentially you could see a change in the calculation of the LCR going forward. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think as such we have operated with leverage ratio expectations, but you are right RWA should be flat and equity might be slightly higher, and we are assuming somewhat even moderate volume growth. So for that guidance, I think you can make the calculations on the risk ratios.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Currently, our leverage ratio is roughly 4% or 400 basis points so that at least we are at comfortable level already now and of course, to mitigate this plan would increase the leverage or improve the leverage ratio even further.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I should say something about income on page 22. It seems to be a bit &#x2013; a lot questions for that. The income will grow because we re-price and because we do more business with more customers. Real volume growth is very small in the assumption going forward, but more business with our more customers will actually &#x2013; and then we have some re-pricing in some markets and now we have indicated some of them already, but we'd get some income growth and then the flat cost it's actually cost income ratio effect.</p>
          <p>We are talking about obviously from these two lines across the income and that combined will give some lower cost income ratio which will amount to these numbers. We will elaborate more in London around this and also per business area how it works.</p>
          <p>I also like to say on the loan loss is lower. I mean, we have had an average now of 19 basis points loan losses and we are coming from the high level now during the crisis in 2009, 2010 and 2011 of &#x2013; yes, we were already up 50 basis points or something and now we are down to 30 level. Of course, we will, in the coming years, with this outlook, we have come to know below our average and that is likely.</p>
          <p>And as Ari has said we will see reduction in the present loan loss areas in the coming quarters. Exactly when and how, we will not say. We don't give forecast on loan losses. But we have clearly indicated that we think some stabilization in credit quality is happening, and therefore that will eventually happen and therefore this bridge is one that should indicate the magnitude we expect. We don't put exact timing on it but we expect that to happen sort of clearly within this time horizon.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Claire, if I just may, did I interpret you correctly that you were asking whether we can expand margin due to the softer LCR rules in Europe? Then the answer to that is Sweden has already implemented the liquidity regulation with the LCR measures so we don't expect any effect there short term.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Just a quick one. Your messaging on capital seems to be that you need to make progress on capital build. But at the same time, you've asked for a buyback permission and I'm just trying to square that circle. What will be the use of buyback if you're still focused on increasing capital over the next year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I don't understand the question because we are not saying that we need to build significant amount of capital. On the contrary, we are clearly indicating that limited capital build is made very limited actually. If you look at the combination of these slides that they're much demonstrated capital and, therefore, as we demonstrate, for example on page 27, we are building &#x2013; if you take the capital, it's up more than &#x20AC;3 billion. Some of it is retained and some of it is paid out. But we don't have to repay and retain any more, then obviously the figure is &#x20AC;3 billion available. And if you have that for 2013 and 2014, good thing, then I think it's fairly easy to get to a number that is substantial.</p>
          <p>And whether we would buy back or we will give dividend has certainly not been decided, so we clearly stated the mandate for buybacks is only to get flexibility. So we are not saying that that will happen but then, of course, the dividend will happen. But this also goes very much hand-in-hand with how things develop and what the board perceives is the right move forward, which, of course, would depend on the pricing of the stock and the number of other issues.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Here is Sofie again. I realized that you forgot to answer one of my questions and that was regarding the buybacks that in case the Swedish government with sell their 13.5% stake in Nordea, would you use potentially these buybacks to buy back some of those shares, and if so, by how much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, nothing can be excluded. We don't have any plans for anything. So we will not speculate on how and when this will happen and, of course, we cannot control or influence or in any way guide how our shareholders sell or those about to sell their shares. So that's completely out of our control.</p>
          <p>We're just saying the board wants more flexibility depending on the capital bills and the performance and then, of course, the stock price development and evaluation and all sort of things come into the big blender then we turn it on, and out comes the decision which, of course, is the dividend or share buybacks. We just want to make sure we have mandate, so we cannot exclude a buyback.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
