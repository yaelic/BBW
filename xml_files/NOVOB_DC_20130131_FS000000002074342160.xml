          <p>Good day and welcome to the Q4 2012 Novo Nordisk A/S Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen, CEO. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and welcome to Novo Nordisk Conference Call regarding our performance in 2012, and the outlook for 2013. I'm Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen, the CEO. With me, I have the Chief Financial Officer, Jesper Brandgaard; and Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, our Chief Science Officer. Present are also our Investor Relations Officer. Today's earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our webpage novonordisk.com. As you heard, the conference call is scheduled to last approximately one hour and, as usual, we'll start with the presentation as outlined on Slide number 2. Q&amp;A session will begin in about 30 minutes.</p>
          <p>Turn to Slide number 3. As always, I need to advise you that this call will contain forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from expectations. For further information on the risk factors see the earnings release and the slides prepared for this presentation.</p>
          <p>Also note that the conference call is being webcast live and a replay will be made available on our Novo Nordisk website after the call.</p>
          <p>Turn to the Slide number 4. 2012 has been another good year for Novo Nordisk. Sales increased 18% as reported and 12% in local currencies. Sales growth was driven by strong performance in North America and International Operations, and China. Key sales drivers have been the modern insulins and Victoza. Amongst the modern insulins, in particular, NovoRapid and Levemir drove the growth.</p>
          <p>On the R&amp;D front, I note that the regulatory reviews of Tresiba and Ryzodeg is showing good progress in the major markets. With the approval of Ryzodeg in December 2012, both products are now approved in Japan. For Tresiba, price negotiations with the Japanese authorities are continuing. They're still expected to be concluded during this first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>In Europe, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Tresiba and Ryzodeg on January 21 this year. Authorization covers all 27 European member states and we expect to launch Tresiba in the first markets during this first quarter of 2013.</p>
          <p>In the United States, FDA Advisory Committee Meeting for Tresiba and Ryzodeg was held on October 8 last year. At the meeting, the Advisory Committee voted eight to four in favor of approving the product, with the recommendation for a cardiovascular outcomes trial, post-approval. The dialogue with the Agency continues to progress, but the Agency has not informed us of when it expects to conclude its ongoing review of the NDAs.</p>
          <p>Turning to the financials. Reported operating profit grew 32% and diluted earnings per share grew 30%. For 2013, we expect sales growth of 8% to 11% and we expect operating profit growth to be around 10%, both measured in local currencies. The solid performance has led us to revisit our long-term financial targets, which has resulted in an upgrade to two of these. Jesper will provide more insight into the revised targets later during this call.</p>
          <p>Turn to Slide number 5. We continue to track our social and environmental performance. In terms of social performance, the number of people estimated to use Novo Nordisk's care products has increased from 21 million to 23 million in 2012. The increasing number of people globally relying on Novo Nordisk treatment is also reflected in the growing organization. Novo Nordisk now employs more than 34,000 people.</p>
          <p>Assurance, including warning letter and re-inspections has followed this path of our social performance. Following current good manufacturing practice inspection by the FDA at our filling in Denmark in the spring of 2012, Novo Nordisk received a warning letter citing two specific observations in December of 2012. Novo Nordisk takes these observations very seriously and have in our response letter, which was submitted later in December, committed to taking the appropriate steps to address the concerns raised by the FDA. We do not expect the warning letter to have impact on our currently marketed products.</p>
          <p>With regards to environmental performance, we have in 2012 seen increases in Co2 emission, as well as in energy and water consumption. This development is driven by higher production volumes and phase-in of our new filling plants in Tianjin in China.</p>
          <p>Turn to Slide number 6. Effective January 31, 2013, Novo Nordisk executive management has expanded with two new members. Jakob Riis is appointed as Executive Vice President, with the responsibility for Marketing &amp; Medical Affairs and Lars Fruergaard J&#xF8;rgensen is appointed Executive Vice President, with the responsibility for IT, Quality and Corporate Development.</p>
          <p>This change lists the direct responsibility of these critical functions into executive management, while also broadening the group of senior managers. The biographies for the newly appointed Executive Vice Presidents can be found on novonordisk.com.</p>
          <p>Effective March 1, four corporate Vice Presidents in U.S. &#x2013; in the Novo Nordisk U.S. affiliate have been appointed Senior Vice Presidents and members of the company's Global Senior Management Board. The promotions reflect the increasing size, complexity and the strategic importance of Novo Nordisk's business and development pipeline in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Turn to Slide number 7, for a regional sales update. In 2012 North America accounted for 66% of growth, followed by International Operations accounted for 20% of growth, both measured in local currencies. Sales growth in North America was 19% in local currencies, reflecting a continuous robust market penetration of the modern insulins, in particular, NovoLog and Levemir. Victoza also continued to perform well, despite the launch of a competing product.</p>
          <p>The sales growth in Europe in 2012 was 2% measured in local currencies. Sales development reflects continued solid performance of Victoza and progress for the portfolio of modern insulins, where especially Levemir is doing well. Sales growth remains negatively impacted by declining sales of human insulin, a low insulin volume growth, as well as healthcare pricing reform.</p>
          <p>Sales in International Operations grew 16% in local currencies, furthered by continued penetration, and of the modern insulins, a robust human insulins sales growth and continued expansion of the GLP-1 market.</p>
          <p>Sales in Japan and Korea declined 2% in local currencies. Compared to 2011 the sales development in Japan and Korea reflects a negative impact from low insulin volume growth and a challenging competitive environment. The negative development in insulin is only partly covered by an increased Victoza, NovoSeven and Norditropin sales.</p>
          <p>Sales in the Region China increased 16% in local currencies. The growth was driven by modern insulin; especially, NovoLog Mix continues to perform well. Sales of NovoNorm our taper-based treatment of type 2 diabetes also contributed significantly to the growth in China.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide number 8. Modern insulins continues to exhibit strong growth in 2012, amounting to 15%, while Victoza also continues to steadily grow. 2012, the diabetes care franchise grew 15%, while biopharmaceutical franchise grew 2%, measured in local currencies. Modern insulins were the primary growth driver, amounting to 55% of growth followed by Victoza accounted for 39% of growth both in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Sales of NovoSeven increased 2% when measured in local currencies. The growth in NovoSeven was driven by strong sales in Japan and North America. Sales in NovoSeven were in general negatively impacted by strict budgetary controls an increased inhibitor patients participating in clinical trials.</p>
          <p>Sales of Novotropin increased 8% in local currencies. The sales growth was mainly driven by North America and International Operations. Novo Nordisk is now the largest company in the growth hormone market with a volume market share of 24%.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide, please. In the last 10 years, the global diabetes care market has grown close to 10% in value annually, with injectables growing more than 15% annually. In this period, Novo Nordisk expanded its leadership position within diabetes care and currently the company holds 26% value of market share of the global diabetes care market, up from 24% at the end of 2011.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide number 10. In the last five years, the global insulin market has grown more than 15% in value on an annual basis. The growth in value has been driven by volume growth and a gradual shift from human insulin to modern insulins, as well as an increased penetration of devices.</p>
          <p>In the growing insulin market in Novo Nordisk has been able to sustain a strong position, and today the company holds 46% of the modern insulin market measured by volume.</p>
          <p>Turn to Slide number 11 for an update on Victoza. Sales of Victoza reached DKK9.5 billion in 2012. This reflects all the performance driven by North America and Europe, as well as continued penetration in key markets across International Operations.</p>
          <p>Victoza has exhibited a steady sales growth trend, with the average of quarterly increases of approximately DKK200 million. Going into 2013, we expect the quarterly increases to be slightly lower, primarily as a result of further competitive pressures.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., Victoza sales continues to be largely unaffected by the launch of a competitors' products. Victoza is gradually increasing its market share and now accounts for approximately 62% of the GLP-1 market by value in the United States.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we continue to see strong uptake of Victoza across all key markets, and Victoza remains the leading GLP-1 product, with a market share of 76%.</p>
          <p>With this, over to Mads for an update on research and development.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars. Please turn to the next slide. The regulatory reviews of Tresiba and Ryzodeg continue to progress, with the recent filings in nine additional countries and, most recently, submission of Tresiba regulatory review in Argentina.</p>
          <p>As previously announced, the European Commission granted marketing authorizations for Tresiba and Ryzodeg for the treatment of diabetes in adults in January 2013, and the label text for both products is now available online at the EU Commission's website.</p>
          <p>As previously mentioned, label will also apply to a large number of country approvals outside Europe and the label text acknowledges superiority of degludec on a number of parameters, including overall and nocturnal hypoglycemia and fasting tests for glucose control, as well as an increased dosing flexibility.</p>
          <p>Novo Nordisk expects to launch Tresiba in the UK and Denmark during the first half of this year and in other European markets throughout the rest of 2013 and 2014. Ryzodeg has now also been approved in Japan, but price negotiations for Tresiba are also expected to complete this quarter, immediately to be followed by launch.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. the FDA Advisory Committee voted 8 to 4 in favor of approving the insulins, with a post-approval commitment to perform cardiovascular outcomes trial. Following the ADCOM meeting, the FDA regulatory process has continued to progress; albeit, we have not been informed about a deadline for completion of the remainder of the process.</p>
          <p>Please turn the next slide. As announced last December, DUAL II, the last Phase 3a trial for IDegLira, the once daily fixed-ratio combination of insulin degludec and liraglutide has been completed. The trial was double-blinded, one-to-one randomized treat-to-target trial conducted in 400, mostly longstanding, type 1 2 diabetes patients previously treated with oral anti-diabetics and baseline insulin.</p>
          <p>Intriguingly, and from an Hb1c baseline in the high 8% percent range, IDegLira reduced Hb1c with almost 2 percentage points, hence bringing most patients to target through convincing control of both fasting and postprandial glucose levels.</p>
          <p>In spite of this both, hypoglycemia and nausea rate were very low and treatment was furthermore accompanied by an average weight loss of five pounds. Together with the results from Q1, Q2 confirms the highly competitive profiles of Tresiba and Victoza in combination, regardless of when in the type 2 diabetes treatment cascade the product will be used in the future.</p>
          <p>Novo Nordisk is planning for regulatory filing of IDegLira in the EU mid-2013 and in the United States as soon as possible during the year, pending marketing authorization of Tresiba.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide. As announced in December, a series of Phase 1 proof of principal trials for a number of different fast-acting formulations of insulin aspart called FIAsp have now been completed. FIAsp is a novel insulin aspart product that has been designed to allow for instant absorption already within the first few minutes of injection through the tailored use of formulation recipients that have been selected on the basis that they all occur naturally in the human body.</p>
          <p>The formulation selected for Phase 3a development more closely mimics the healthy insulin secretive response to a meal than does NovoRapid, as shown on the slide. This enables the improved post-prandial glucose control, as well as more flexible timing of insulin administration in connection with the meal.</p>
          <p>Importantly, FIAsp will piggyback on the excellent safety of today's most used prandial insulin product, NovoRapid. Novo Nordisk expects to initiate the Phase 3a program called onset towards the end of the year. Onset is expected to include around 3,000 people with types 1 or 2 diabetes and both multiple daily injections and pump infusion regimens will be investigated in the onset program.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide. Novo Nordisk has completed a four-week clinical pharmacology trial investigating the use of the liraglutide as an adjunct to insulin therapy in people with type 1 diabetes. The trial showed that the liraglutide treatment neither compromises the glucagon response during hypoglycemia nor other counter regulatory hormonal responses.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, liraglutide interim requirements and body weight decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Also, the continuous glucose monitoring data suggest that patients may increase the time spent in the glucose target zone, following combined Victoza and insulin treatment in type 1 diabetes.</p>
          <p>Finally, and importantly, the clinical data from this trial appear to confirm the overall safety profile of liraglutide. In the second half of this year, Novo Nordisk expects to initiate the Phase 3a program, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (16:20) adjunct, and including around 2,000 people with type 1 diabetes.</p>
          <p>Finally, within diabetes, Novo Nordisk has initiated the first Phase 1 trial with LAI287, a novel insulin analog that potentially opens up the therapeutic paradigm with a once weekly insulin administration. The molecule thus represents the very latest within the evolution of rational protein backbone and cycling design at Novo Nordisk. The trial investigates the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and dynamics of LAI287 in approximately 80 healthy volunteers in type 1 diabetes subjects.</p>
          <p>Within our biopharma pipeline, NovoThirteen, known as Tretten in Canada, has now been launched in Canada and Denmark. In the U.S. Novo Nordisk has now resubmitted the biologics license application.</p>
          <p>Turoctocog alfa, a new recombinant coagulation factor VIII intended for prevention and treatment of bleeding in people with hemophilia A, has now also been submitted for approval in Japan, Australia and Switzerland.</p>
          <p>Within hemophilia B, we have completed recruitment for the pivotal Phase 3a trial for the long-acting N9-GP, for which results are expected towards the middle of the year.</p>
          <p>For N8-GP targeting hemophilia A, we have following a pre-planned interim analysis of the baseline lead in characteristics, decided to expand the ongoing pivotal Phase 3a trial by approximately 40 patients. Consequently, the trial is now expected to be completed in the first half of 2014. For both of these projects, and contingent upon positive trial outcomes, it is expected that completion of pre-submission preparations, including all product supply activities, will result in around one-year time period between trial completion and regulatory submission in the first markets.</p>
          <p>Finally, and as previously announced, Novo Nordisk has decided to discontinue further development of anti-NKG2D as a treatment for Crohn's disease.</p>
          <p>With that, over to Jesper for an update on the financials.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mads. Please turn to Slide 16. In 2012, sales increased by 18% measured in Danish kroner to DKK78 billion and by 12% in local currencies. Reported gross margin improved by 170 basis points to 82.7% in 2012.</p>
          <p>Improvement was driven by favorable product development in North America and positive impact of product mix, due to increased sales of both modern insulins and Victoza. The improvement in the gross margin includes a positive impact from currencies of 70 basis points.</p>
          <p>The non-production related costs increased by 12% in Danish kroner to DKK35.8 billion and by 8% in local currencies. S&amp;D costs increased by 13% to DKK21.5 billion and by 8% in local currencies. The growth in local currencies is primarily driven by the expansion of the U.S. sales force and other costs to prepare for the global launch of Tresiba.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, costs increased due to sales and marketing investments in the selected countries in IO, as well as the Chinese sales force expansion that took place mid 2011. Growth in sales and distribution costs is partly offset by a reversal of provisions for legal disputes.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D cost increased by 13% to DKK10.9 billion and by 11% in local currencies, mainly driven by development costs related to the ongoing Phase 3 trials for liraglutide in obesity and the Phase 3a trials for IDegLira. Within biopharmaceuticals, R&amp;D costs are primarily related to the continued progress of the portfolio of development projects within hemophilia and the Phase 2 trials for anti-IL-20 and rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
          <p>Operating profit increased by 32% in 2012 to DKK29.5 billion. In local currencies, the growth was 20%. Net financials showed an expense of DKK1.7 billion in 2012, compared to an expense of around DKK450 million in 2011.</p>
          <p>In line with Novo Nordisk's treasury policy, the most significant foreign exchange risks for group has been hedged primarily through forward currency contracts. Reflecting the portfolio of foreign currency exchange hedging contracts, the foreign exchange result was an expense of DKK1.5 billion, compared to an expense of around DKK300 million in 2011. This development reflects losses on foreign exchange hedging involving especially the $US due to its appreciation versus Danish kroner, compared to the prevailing exchange rate level in 2011. The effective tax rate for 2012 was 22.9%.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide. The two graphs illustrate the development of the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen versus the Danish kroner. The tables on the right shows the updated annual impact on operating profit of the 5% movement in each of our key invoicing currencies and the current extent of hedging for the same currencies.</p>
          <p>During 2012, the average exchange rate for the U.S. dollar versus the Danish kroner was approximately 8% above the level in 2011. The Japanese yen was approximately 9% above the level in 2011. At present, the value of the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen is below the average seen in 2012.</p>
          <p>Please turn to Slide 18. Novo Nordisk expects sales growth in 2013 of 8% to 11% measured in local currencies. Given the current level of exchange rate versus the Danish kroner, the reported sales growth is now expected to be around 4.5 percentage points lower than the growth measured in local currencies.</p>
          <p>The sales outlook measured in local currencies reflect continued robust penetration of the modern insulins, a continued steady Victoza performance, and a positive sale contribution from Tresiba, primarily in the U.S., EU, and Japan.</p>
          <p>The sales drivers will partly be countered by a challenging operating environment in major markets, including price pressure, macroeconomic conditions in many International Operations' markets, and intensified competitive pressures. The outlook also includes an assumption of generic competition in 2013 to our oral anti-diabetic product in the U.S.</p>
          <p>For 2012, operating profit growth is expected to be around 10% measured in local currencies. This reflects significant costs related to the expected global launch of Tresiba, the expanded U.S. sales force, as well as sales and marketing investments in China and in a selected number of countries in International Operations.</p>
          <p>Given the current level of exchange rates versus Danish kroner, the reported operating profit growth is now expected to be around 7 percentage points lower than the growth measured in local currencies.</p>
          <p>For 2013, Novo Nordisk expects a net financial income of around DKK1.5 billion, reflecting gains associated with hedging contracts, following the depreciation of the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen versus the Danish kroner, compared to the exchange rates prevailing in 2011.</p>
          <p>The expectations to gains related to currency hedging contracts is, however, more than offset by the expected significant negative impact on reported operating profit from the depreciation of the same currencies versus the Danish kroner.</p>
          <p>The effective tax rate for 2013 is expected to be around 23%. So, given the improvement in net financials compared to 2012, the growth in net profit is at presently expected to be double-digit percentage point in 2013.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures are expected to be around DKK3.5 billion in 2013, primarily related to investments in filling capacity, a prefilled device production facility in Denmark and new office facilities also in Denmark. Depreciation, amortization, and impairment losses are</p>
          <p>expected to be around DKK3.0 billion and free cash flow is expected to be around DKK22</p>
          <p>billion.</p>
          <p>All of the above expectations are based on the assumption that the global economic environment will not significantly change business conditions for Novo Nordisk during 2013, and that currency exchange rate, especially for the U.S. dollar will remain at the current level versus the Danish kroner.</p>
          <p>Please turn to Slide 19. At the Annual General Meeting on 20th of March 2013, the Board of Directors will propose a 29% increase in dividend to DKK18 per share of DKK1, corresponding to a payout ratio of 45.3%. For 2011, the payout ratio was also 45.3%.</p>
          <p>In addition, The Board of Directors has approved a new up to DKK14 billion share repurchase program to be executed during the coming 12 months. Novo Nordisk will initiate this program in accordance with the Safe Harbor Regulation. Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken in Denmark will lead &#x2013; will act as a lead manager of the program and will in this capacity repurchase share on behalf of Novo Nordisk for an amount up to DKK3 billion during the trading period starting today and ending on the 29th of April 2013.</p>
          <p>Please turn to Slide 20 for an update on our long-term financial targets. Novo Nordisk introduced four long-term financial targets in 1996 to balance short and long-term considerations, thereby, ensuring a focus on shareholder value creation. The targets were subsequently revised and updated on several occasions and Novo Nordisk has now reached the performance level stipulated in the four long-term financial targets and the target levels have for two of the targets, consequently, been revised.</p>
          <p>The revised targets assume a continuation of the current business environment. Significant changes to the business environment, including the structure of the U.S. healthcare system, regulatory requirements, pricing environment, competitive environment, healthcare reforms, and exchange rates may significantly impact the time horizon for achieving the long-term targets or require them to be revised.</p>
          <p>The target level for operating profit growth remained at 15% on average. The target still allows the deviations in individual years if necessitated by business opportunities, market conditions or exchange rate movements.</p>
          <p>The target level for operating margin is increased from 35% to 40%. This is expected to be enabled by continued robust sales growth, coupled with gross margin expansion for product mix and pricing, as well as further productivity improvements in the manufacturing areas. For non-production related activities, the operating margin expansion is expected to be supported by a modest development in administrative costs and scale advantages within sales and marketing, whereas continued investment is envisioned for research and development activities, which are expected to grow in line with sales.</p>
          <p>The target level for operating profit after tax to net operating assets is increased from 90% to 125%. The raised target reflects the expectation of a continued robust operating profit growth, combined with a stable effective tax rate and limited &#x2013; relatively limited increase in net operating assets.</p>
          <p>The target level for the cash-to-earnings ratio is maintained at 90%, as expected continued growth in International Operations and Region China will gradually impact working capital requirements. As previously, this target will be pursued looking at the average over a three-year period.</p>
          <p>This concludes the financial update. Now back to you Lars for some closing remarks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much, Jesper and Mads. To summarize, 2012 was a good year for Novo Nordisk. We delivered strong financial results. We managed to strengthen our position in the diabetes care market, where we today hold a market share 26% of the value. Furthermore, we're seeing significant progress in our clinical development pipeline. We believe this promising pipeline puts Novo Nordisk in a unique position of strength for the future.</p>
          <p>We are now moving into the Q&amp;A part, where I kindly ask all participants to restrain themselves to two questions. Operator, we're now ready to take the first question please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi Peter Hugreffe, ABG. Thank you very much for taking my questions. First of all, in terms of the inspection you are mentioning from FDA and the subsequent warning. Could you elaborate in terms of it has had any impact on the Tresiba approval process? And also is there any read through to the talks with EMA.</p>
          <p>And then, secondly, in terms of the Tresiba approval process with FDA, could you elaborate a little bit in terms of the dialogue you're having and maybe to come with some comparisons with the dialogue you had with the &#x2013; on Victoza? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. This is Lars Rebien here. I will deal with the issue of the inspections and Mads, if you would care to comment on the quality of dialogue with the agency in the United States compared to Europe.</p>
          <p>In regard to the warning letter, it has had no impact. It was a U.S. inspection, so it has no impact on the situation vis-&#xE0;-vis Europe, and it was a routine cGMP inspection, which took place at several locations of our manufacturing sites, to which some observations was made, to which normally, as we do, Novo Nordisk has responded.</p>
          <p>Apparently, the response from one of the aseptic filling plants here in Denmark has not been sufficient to satisfy the agency and hence, in December of 2012, we received a warning letter covering two specific observations and some points under these two specific observations, and it is a little bit unusual that we announced and we received then a warning letter in advance that the FDA has not posted the warning letter on their website, which they usually do.</p>
          <p>And therefore, we would like to restrict our comments to the technicalities of this warning letter, as we are in the process of ensuring that our response, which was submitted towards the end of the December, is complete and satisfactory to the FDA and until we've had such dialogue, we intend not to comment on it. It has had no impact on our marketed product and we don't anticipate that it happens.</p>
          <p>It has not been linked to Tresiba either, but we have to be, of course, cautious in the sense that the FDA has certain sanctions towards companies spanning all the way from closing warning letters, to re-inspections, to operating plants under the consent decree to postponing approval of new applications. However, these are the measures the FDA has, but we cannot speculate in any of those yet until we've had a dialogue on our recent submitted response. Mads?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So, if I got it right, Peter, the question relates to a comparison of the nature of the dialogue with the FDA post-ADCOM in the case of Victoza versus Tresiba. That's a little bit of a broad question. What I can say, though, is that if you go back to those days in 2009, where we had the ADCOM under Victoza, there is no doubt that it was pretty much about risk, i.e., there was really no true clinical discussion about the benefits in terms of the clinical views of Victoza and quite frankly, a lot of the discussions after the Victoza had come also had to do with the overall clinical review, but, which at that point, clearly had only been partly underway.</p>
          <p>Hence, there was not only a focus on all the topics of that particular ADCOM, including C-cell safety and so on. There was also a lot of very detailed clinical discussions right up until the very happy end on January 25, 2010, when we got the approval. I would say it's a fair statement that for Tresiba, there has been more discussion of benefit and risk, i.e. was it true benefit risk evaluation that took place at the ADCOM on November 8?</p>
          <p>And, obviously, some of those comments that were &#x2013; or issues that were discussed, hypoglycemia benefits, potential for cardiovascular risk profile, et cetera, et cetera. They have obviously, as you can imagine, popped up as discussion items and things where we have had queries from the agency even since the ADCOM as a natural part of that process.</p>
          <p>Obviously, also, Novo Nordisk has adapted to the discussions in that. Of course, we are at the point where it's natural that the company does submit its various suggestions, including the package insert language, and so on, but obviously, at this point, we are not at the point of discussing the specifics of the label, and I think that is as far as I would go at this point. It is a constructive dialogue. It is progressing.</p>

        </plist>

          <p>And we will take our next question from Sachin Jain of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Just two. Firstly, on the fast acting insulin analog, could you clarify what's taking the time before you started the Phase 3 only at the end of this year, just what's the delay for that? And then related, is there any plan for premix with Tresiba? I'm not sure you commented on that. That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is a very broad question around the Victoza obesity program. As we approach the Phase 3 data, I wonder if you could just clarify the positioning you intend for this product? That's something you've refrained from discussing to date, but wonder if you can just discuss broadly the BMI populations, the extent of diabetes overlap, and potentially how you plan to use the sleep apnea study that's coming out midyear? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Lars Rebien here. I'd like Mads Krogsgaard to comment on your first question, then I'll come back on obesity and what our thinking is in terms of positioning on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so Sachin, first of all, the PS project, just for you to understand, has seen a whole range of clinical activities where we ended up in the final round between 2 frontrunner candidates, where once we select one of these and that has been taking place very recently, we need to make sure since we're leapfrogging over Phase 2 and directly into to Phase 3 that we also have sufficient amount of stability data for the company to conduct a full-blown Phase 3 program.</p>
          <p>This is a new product. It's a new brand. This is not, as such, a follow-on compound. We are developing this as a new brand. And obviously, you will need for this new product, the stability data, and normally, Sachin, it's not an issue, because you have Phase 2, and there's ample time to do Phase 3 stability studies.</p>
          <p>Here, we are actually, as I mentioned, leapfrogging into Phase 3, which gives us not so much time to do stability. When we say towards the end of 2013, I can tell you one thing. We'll do it as fast as we can, and I'll be more specific on Phase 3 start later on in the year.</p>
          <p>Whether PS can be used together with Tresiba is really a very good question and Novo Nordisk is never leaving any stone unturned when it comes to neither engineering nor formulating various combinations of our protein, so we can even discuss that at some later point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Mads. Then on to obesity, you're correct. We are approaching the final date where we will get the Phase 3 data on obesity. We have actually for some time discussed and communicated our intended positioning, which, of course, depends on the data, will be that we intend this product to be used for individuals with a BMI of 35 and above, but also with comorbidities such as elevated lipids, high myocardial infarction, high blood pressure, et cetera. And so this is a population which is severely obese, who probably have had weight problems for several years, have participated in several programs to try and lose weight, and where now the weight has become a health risk to them, and something needs to be done unless they progress to diabetes or progress to an even more serious metabolic or cardiovascular situation.</p>
          <p>So, in these individuals, we believe we can justify the use of potent pharmacological entities such as liraglutide. And we think also, indeed, we can justify the relatively costly intervention, because you got to remember that it is used in a higher dose than what we typically use today in diabetes, and hence you should also count on it being linearly priced, such that the application for obesity will be some 40% more expensive than the current daily consumption for people with type 2 diabetes.</p>
          <p>It is the intention that longer-term that we will follow up those individuals in the cohorts that had pre-diabetes, which can be recognized from their clinical parameters, whether or not their diabetes changes or whether we can postpone over longer periods of time their diabetes from progressing, or pre-diabetes for progressing into diabetes.</p>
          <p>So, those are the types of population we'd like to position the drug in. And this is a significant opportunity if you look at it from a market perspective, because if we take the United States, we're assuming that that population which has this drug is similar to the size of the current diabetes population in the U.S. So, needless to say, there is big need and there is a big potential, if we can show that it's effective &#x2013; sustainably effective, but also, that the side effect profile is benign. Mads, do you have anything you would like to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Only just to corroborate that the drug population, even though we've abided with the FDA's demand for just taking anybody above 30 or anybody above 27 with a comorbidity, the fact the matter is that the patient Lars is describing is the average one in the trials. So, the BMI average will above 35 and the amount of people with pre-diabetes will at least be 50% at baseline. So, we are actually, funnily or interestingly enough, discussing more or less the population that Lars is describing also as the target.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there is &#x2013; okay, sleep apnea is a very specific comorbidity related. The physical kind of sleep apnea we are talking about is related to severe obesity, and the way we're doing that is going with some very focused specialist centers where we are measuring all the hallmarks of sleep apnea, and seeking to improve those in a study in limited population, but with sophisticated metrics, and that one will actually report slightly later than the others, but it will still be kind of during the summertime.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Richard Vosser from JPMorgan. Thanks for taking my questions. First question just on the gross margin and COGS. The fourth quarter had a substantial improvement in the gross margin, much more than the other quarters. Just wondering if you could give us some details of the improvements there? Anything specific to that quarter that saw the very low COGS or very high gross margin?</p>
          <p>And then as we go into 2013 with currency headwinds, I suppose potential remediation costs around FDA inspections, could you give us some help on how that could develop? And then secondly just on Tresiba and just &#x2013; we've seen the label in Europe, you've now got the label and it looks to have all the nocturnal hypoglycemia, et cetera, as you've mentioned on there. Just wondering your pricing strategy in Europe, how that's panning out and what you think that's going to be? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Jesper, why don't you take the margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Both for the fourth quarter and then also how you look at it going forward into 2013. And then, Mads?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is correct, Richard, that we had an unusual strong fourth quarter. We're always a little bit cautious in looking at our production cost with the capitalization rules, et cetera, there is for the amounts produced. But everything else being equal, it was a strong quarter with a high capacity utilization in our diabetes care units. And I would not hope &#x2013; I would not expect that we will have the same degree of capacity utilization fully into 2013 partly also related to services surrounding the full scale-up of the Tresiba production facilities that we have made ready.</p>
          <p>So I think the average for the year is a better guiding point for where we're going to end. So, I think if you take at the starting point for the year around a gross margin of just below 83%, and then, I hope we will be able to improve on that in the 50 basis points to 100 basis points, like we have done in previous years. We are at current facing a negative currency impact on the gross margin in the ballpark of around 20%. You did ask for specific cost in relation to remediation cost related to the warning letter, and I would say that we're not expecting any very significant cost &#x2013; it is not expected to involve significant restructuring or rebuilding of these facilities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Then, maybe, perhaps I should answer the question on the situation in Europe and pricing of Tresiba going forward. Clearly, the biggest potential that we have for Tresiba is going to be in the United States. It's also where we are having a more liberal pricing environment, and obviously, we need to justify the price to the different managed care organizations and the insurance companies, but we will get to that as we move along.</p>
          <p>When we talk about Europe, we have stated all along that we need to see a premium on Tresiba in Europe, because the European price level is, to some extent, linked to our export private markets, and because many of the export private markets in emerging markets are referring back to home country, both for approval, but also for reimbursement status and price, and so the balance for us is that we probably need to take a higher premium in Europe, which to some extent can slow down the penetration and the rollout in Europe. Out of consideration to get a decent price in overseas market, this is probably the best mix. Jesper, did you have any further comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I actually made a misstatement, because I got the currency impact ballpark effect of 100 basis points. Of course, it was a 20 basis point negative impact and not a 20 percentage point, I apologize for that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we will take our next question from Martin Parkh&#xF8;i of Danske Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Martin Parkh&#xF8;i from Danske Bank. First question on the long-term targets to Jesper, now, you're guiding. I guess your long-term target is on the three to five years horizon, so if we assume that you're hitting a margin of 40% in four years, and keeping up with 50% annual EBIT growth, you actually need to make a top line growth of more than 13% a year. Should we actually &#x2013; should we assume that your top line actually will accelerate from the 12% level we saw underlying in 2012?</p>
          <p>And then, the second question goes to liraglutide in type 1 diabetes. Could you review the timeline, and then also, could you give some elaboration on the commercial opportunity you see there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Martin. Well, there's some model issues that we have to dig into, with regard to the long-term financial target and the top line and the growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, Martin. If the world was so perfect that you were able to model your financial performance so that it exactly hits the target at the same point of every time you put them forward, it would be easier to be an analyst. Invariably, I think we have historically always moved with the targets in rounded numbers.</p>
          <p>I think it's largely that we will see an increase in our turnover level if we are successful with getting the approval of Tresiba and having that momentum behind our franchise and as we have also alluded to before, both Lars Rebien and I, when we had Tresiba on the market, it improves our situation in terms of actually starting gaining market share within the diabetes care segment.</p>
          <p>It enabled us to launch into the biggest single insulin market in the world, the long-acting segment in the U.S. and hence, that should actually provide for everything else being equal and acceleration of our top line, but let's see how the approval process goes, let's see how the label trends are, but the equation level is clearly within the long-term target of the continuation of a double-digit both in the top line and linked to that, then, the expansion in market. Whether they'll hit each other at the exact same year, we'll have to see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, this is Lars Rebien here. Just in addition to this, we have to anticipate that there will be some kind of rebalancing of the public projects in the United States and not this year and maybe not even next year, but in the three-year to five-year time horizon, it is not unlikely that some initiatives will be taken which may also impact the healthcare sector and as we know it. Typically, pharmaceuticals are being impacted as a result of that. So, that is why we are being somewhat cautious about giving you too-bullish top line numbers, despite of the fact that we do believe that we are in the best competitive position that we have ever been with the launch of both Tresiba and Ryzodeg. Mads, LATIN, the trial of using the Victoza in type I diabetes what are the timelines and any commercial potential in this as you see it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, first of all, there is no doubt, Martin, that when you look at the commercial potential, everybody who has type 1 diabetes worldwide is today under, you can say, typically multiple daily injections with insulin, and what the potential is here is a new paradigm where you use the GLP-1 analog, in this case as a rapid site, as an adjunct to insulin.</p>
          <p>The rationale for that, which we've confirmed in the clinical study that is just completed, is that you &#x2013; by reducing the excess glucagon that is also present in type 1 diabetic subjects, you will, first of all, reduce the need for insulin. You will also have the appetite suppressant effect that makes you lose a bit of weight and become more insulin-sensitive, which further improves the problem, and what we have seen both in anecdotes and investigator-initiated trials, but also in our own, is that it seems as if the time spent in the in the near-normal glycemic zone is enhanced.</p>
          <p>So for the patient, there's a lot of value in actually getting into better control or reducing the amount of hypoglycemic effects at the same prevailing HbA1c level, while also harvesting benefits on body weight and insulin sensitivity and insulin dose.</p>
          <p>So that's what we're going to set out to study in two major trials, one bigger than the other, because it's a superiority trial, and they've been negotiated with the FDA and EMA very recently, and the first one will start in the second half of this year, that's the one year trial and the other one, which is a six-month trial, will start soon thereafter, such that they are both destined to complete with the estimated approval, if we are lucky at the end of 2016, but as soon as we can.</p>
          <p>So we're really winning the series. There are millions of people with type 1 diabetes out there and we'll have to look at the profile emerging from Phase 3 before I can be more specific about the sales, but of course, it's sizeable.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hello. It's Michael Novod from Nordea Marking Company. Just a follow-on to the obesity questions. I guess we will also start to discuss whether you will be required or not to do pre-marketing CV trials for Victoza in obesity. Can you put some more flavor to that? Are there any progress in the discussions with the FDA, had you had more discussions around this and what should we expect now when we see the data that reports out very soon?</p>
          <p>And then, the second question, maybe you could try to put some flavor on the difference to the guidance range on the top line between the 8% and 11%. Is that where the Victoza grows DKK150 million per quarter or DKK200 million per quarter, is it the Prandin generics? Can you try to give some more flavor on the actual split?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Michael. Mads, where are we in regards to CV3 or post-approval on using liraglutide at the higher dosages for obesity? And where is the FDA on that in your assessment right now? And then, Jesper will comment on the range for the top line guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's our assessment having discussed with the regulators that the obvious initial things to do are to combine and do meta-analysis of what exists of pre-existing trials where CV has been measured, including the lead program, the scale program, the Phase 3b trials for Victoza in diabetes. And it is with the admittance from regulators and ourselves that the dose are not the same, i.e., 1.8 versus 3, but so is the body weight not the same and hence, the exposure typically is only 30%, maybe 40% different between the two populations. And there is an understanding that the overarching pathophysiological elements underlying large-vessel disease are somewhat similar whether you are a 45-year-old obese woman or a 60-year-old diabetic male, for that matter.</p>
          <p>So that's the initial approach. If, somehow, that creates unclarity and uncertainty, a next step that has by no means been concluded could, of course, be to look into interim analysis of, for instance, the LEADER trial, the CV outcome trial for liraglutide, which will have been very well progressed at that point, because the event rate we are witnessing in that trial are at least on par with what we had predicted when we initiated the trial and there's already a commitment to update the European Medicines Agency vis-&#xE0;-vis such an interim anyhow during the process before 2016. So that is a multi-step process, and we'll take the amount of steps that are needed to satisfy regulators, hopefully with good outcomes.</p>
          <p>These tests would not involve a pre-approval CV outcome trial. That, in my mind, would only occur that's my personal view, would only occur in the event that the point estimate of all the things I just mentioned to you were to be in excess of one. And it would take quite some drive from where we are today to bring it above one, as you recall from the CV meta-analysis that was done as part of the Victoza approval process.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and then on to the growth expectation for 2013 and commenting on them in local currency terms. If we look at the growth in 2012 in local currency terms, it was 11.56%, so if you take the 11.5% and then look at 2013, the first thing is, of course, and that has been an issue for a while, is the uncertainty surrounding the potential of having generic competition for our branding activities in the U.S. That could deduct a percentage point from our sales and is expected to impact sales this year.</p>
          <p>We could have &#x2013; we also believe that Victoza growing at a slightly lower level in a more competitive environment in 2013 and also growing from a bigger base and hence the relative contribution being smaller in 2013 will deduct another percent. And then you are down at around 9.5%, which would be middle of the range, then you could say, well on top of that, you may have some Tresiba effect. I think we, at this point of time, and until we have the U.S. approval, we'd like to be a bit conservative on that.</p>
          <p>And on the other hand, you could say &#x2013; on the negative side, we did have some significant contract wins. The KMR contract we talked about in 2012 has clearly added to our growth in the U.S. We're not going to have that growth element in 2013. So hence, overall, that 9.5% midpoint feels comfortable at this point in time. And as we get through the year and hopefully get more clarity on Tresiba, we will have to revisit that again, but this is the range we go with for now.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Jesper. I think that was very, very clear. Ladies and gentlemen, let's have your last question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we will take our final question from Brian Bourdot of Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. It's Brian Bourdot at Barclays, calling from London. Two things I'd like to ask you about, please, firstly, LAI287 and secondly, Tresiba. Firstly, I'd just like to ask you how LAI287 is engineered, please? Is it acylated? Presumably, it's not PEGylated, and does it have the potential, you think, to possibly serve the needs of all patients requiring basal insulin therapy? And that's my questions on LAI.</p>
          <p>Secondly, on Tresiba, just wondering how confident you are that approval will come in 2013, and I ask that question from the point of view of the significant review times that FDA has taken over some diabetes medicines in recent history and I guess one of these is thinking about Victoza. You've already talked about that, but another one that I think of is <mark type="ph" /> elagut (57:05) and where the FDA has approved it with a commitment for post approval cardiovascular safety studies, albeit after a very lengthy delay. So, any thoughts on that, please? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mads, talk about LAI287.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So, Brian, very briefly, LAI287 does actually represent, you can say, a case where we've had to look into our own publications and the textbooks about why is that even the longest-acting insulins tend to have a very brief circulation half life. The longest one I know about is Tresiba, with a circulation half life of, like, four hours, and <mark type="ph" /> pro lantus (57:44) is about 20 minutes.</p>
          <p>So, and that is because the curious mechanism of the body, which is insulin receptor mediated uptake, i.e. endocytosis followed by degradation. So, what we've done is map that process and then we've looked at how can we manipulate that system? And the way to do that chemically is by both introducing modification at the level of the human insulin skeleton, i.e. creating a true analog while also, you can say, modulating the character of the substituent that you're attaching, i.e. the fatty acid side chain.</p>
          <p>And this has not been trivial, because we needed to make a &#x2013; you can say, a step change in the half life that we've seen from, for instance, Tresiba to create an analog, such as 287. This has been all benefit from that and that is in doing everything we've done, you also engineer a degree of metabolic stability into the molecule that may even lend itself to the use for all regimens, in which case you will have the benefit of the long circulation half life, which can then buffer against the day to day variability for such an agent when given orally.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the review times of Tresiba, if I should continue?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't you do so, Mads?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your turn.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. You have to then mind a couple of things, Brian. Some examples with very long review times, they are also precipitated by complete response letter being interjected. In the case of Victoza, the review time was 20 months, which was we thought was a long time, to be frank, but that was without a complete response letter and my view is that we are in this dialogue with agency and unless we get a complete response letter, the dialogue has progressed to an extent that going beyond 2013 without the complete response letter would be somewhat of a surprise to me.</p>
          <p>Of course, I cannot speculate on the reason of a complete response letter, but I can speculate that we feel that we have a very compelling case for a very safe analog, also on the various aspects that we had discussed at the ADCOM. And I think we presented that case quite clearly as a part of the outcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess, Mads, it is usually so that the FDA follows the recommendation  from the ADCOM, so it would be kind of surprising, let's put it that way, if we were to receive a complete response letter.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, so we are anticipating that we're going to launch Tresiba all over the world during the half of this year. And we thank you very much for your attention and we will stay tuned, and I'm sure we'll be having much more conversations during the next couple of days on this, and, of course, also as we progress, and we're allowed, I'm sure we'll still have your continued interest. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect.</p>
