          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the conference call of Intesa Sanpaolo for the presentation of the 2010 Half Yearly Results hosted today by Mr. Corrado Passera, Chief Executive Officer. My name is [Kiara] and I will be your coordinator for today's conference.</p>
          <p>I will now hand the call over to Mr. Corrado Passera. You may begin, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Good afternoon to everybody, and thank you for being with us. We are navigating the financial crisis according to the route and to the course we have outlined to the market on several occasions. We're doing what we committed to do. And the sustainability of our earnings are in our opinion, the result of a number of very clear strategies that we are pursuing quarter after quarter. Sustainable revenues, very low leverage, very low level of risk as low as possible, strong attention to operating cost and efficiency and certainly a high level of concentration on liquidity and balance sheet solidity.</p>
          <p>By following these priorities we are delivering results in the first quarter, in the first semester 2010 that are in line with our targets. And this is a satisfactory result because during the semester we had at least 2 reasons that have made our task a little bit heavier. The Greek crisis and the write-downs we had to do on government bond portfolio, its mark-to-market unrealized losses but in any way it's about &#x20AC;100 worth of write-downs.</p>
          <p>And certainly a level of market yields that is lower than expected, we keep saying the same thing quarter after quarter, we are probably at the very bottom of the cycle in this respect, but for sure, a company like ours very much focused in commercial banking takes the cost, suffers let's say from this very low level of market yields.</p>
          <p>The cycle, we see some sign of positive movement. The 2 evidence of this change in the cycle might be the small fall in the pipeline of non-performing loans, you will see our stock and our flows are moving in the right direction in this second quarter of the year. And we also are experiencing a small increase in credit demand. At the end we are in the business of providing credit and at the very low level of the demand for credit in the previous quarters has been an area of concern. We see some changes toward the second &#x2013; to the last part of the second quarter we experienced something like that.</p>
          <p>We are working on the new business plan, 2011, 2015 because we believe that the regulatory environment will be clear enough by the end of the year. And that's why we have launched a formal exercise, internal exercise to get &#x2013; to be in the position to illustrate to the market the new business plan next spring. I will elaborate a little bit on that not very much during the course of the presentation.</p>
          <p>Let's take the presentation itself, page 3. Page 3 is the summary of the main event of the first semester in the second quarter 2010. First point, the net income of the &#x2013; at the end of June in line with our expectation, 1.7 billion, it's an increase of 7.4%. The net income was up versus the same semester of last year in all business units, obviously with the exception of the Banca dei Territori, the domestic retail operation. And these kind of results as I said, are satisfactory enough despite &#x2013; because of the negative effect we suffered in terms of write-downs on the trading portfolio.</p>
          <p>As far as the domestic retail operation, obviously this is a division that suffers the most from the net interest income at its lowest level due obviously to historically low market yields. But the more we look into the potential of this division, the more we see untapped areas of improvement and untapped potential for growth in the next years.</p>
          <p>I was mentioning before some early signs of cycle recovery. Customer loans up at the end of the quarter, let's see what happens in the next 2 quarters. And the stock of net non-performing loans down versus the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>We are proud of the loyalty of our customer base because the constant growth in customer financial assets has been confirmed also in the last month. And on the other side, our continued exercise in reducing structural cost is certainly something that is making our P&amp;L sounder. High liquidity and low leverage remain competitive advantageous. We are proud of, in both areas for what we have done, and we consider this to remain competitive advantage of ours. One last, but very important point is the increase of 40 basis points in our Core Tier 1 that is now very close to 8%, Tier 1 to about 9%. So we're very much in line with our target without taking into account the effect of the Fideuram listing.</p>
          <p>Page number 4, net income, you'll see the trend &#x2013; the quarterly trends on the left-hand side. And the semi-annual trend on the right-hand side. If we take the last quarter, the second quarter this year, the net income adjusted for main non-recurring items is beyond &#x2013; is above &#x20AC;500 million.</p>
          <p>Page 5 is the point I made before on the bottom line results of all the business units, all of them as you see on the right-hand side are very much higher than June 2009 with the exception very clearly and easily explainable of the Banca dei Territori. The new business plan of the Banca dei Territori will address the means in the areas of commitment for making this division profitable and more profitable even in a low interest yield environment.</p>
          <p>Page number 6, the early sign I mentioned before, some customer loans increasing at the end of the semester in the quarter, more or less throughout all the segments of our customer base. Page 7, stock of net non-performing loans, wherever you look on the page, you see minus signs and you see a trend that is self-explanatory. We believe this trend will be confirmed also in the next quarters for sure, we are more than in line with our yearly targets. Some of the notes you have on the right hand side will be discussed more in detail in other pages of the presentation.</p>
          <p>Page number 8, I was mentioning before the loyalty of our customer base, the financial assets of our customers keep growing and that's a very important sign of the relationship we have been building in the centuries, the decades and also in the last few years. The customer financial assets have grown 17 billion versus the end of 2009. The assets under management have grown almost 5 billion versus the end of 2009. And also in the second quarter 2010, the net inflow has been positive by 2.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Cost reduction, page number 9. Year after year and I have to thank all the people in the bank because keeping &#x2013; extracting structural cost in an organization like ours is not that easy, but year after year the signs remain negative. We are also &#x2013; we are having a minus 1.6% also in the first quarter of 2010. And we expect a good trend also for the second part of the year.</p>
          <p>Page number 10, liquidity. As you know, this is an area of very high focalization by our bank. We wanted to be in line with Basel III even in the worst possible application of Basel III. So today given that &#x2013; then the agreement that has been reached is a little bit more relaxed. That gives us some flexibility. In any case you'll see that we keep financing loans to customers with direct customer deposits. The amount of eligible assets that we are presently not using, but that are available remains at a very high level, &#x20AC;65 billion.</p>
          <p>And what is important on the right hand side bottom of the page, the placements that are in our plans for the second part of the year, the &#x20AC;16 billion are or can be done almost entirely on the retail network. Last two points I want to attract your attention on are the second dot where well-balanced net inter-bank position is written. We are keeping these very strong position on the inter-bank position on the inter-bank market and as long as the market relaxes a bit this is an area of flexibility for our sales. The last but one point is the point I made before on the 2010 maturities.</p>
          <p>Page 11, leverage remains a competitive advantage. We remain amongst the very strongest in the European ranking. I think that leverage is an important index for the sustainability of the whole industry and we decided to keep a very prudent position in this respect.</p>
          <p>Page 12, capital ratios. I would define them more than adequate at this point. If you take the pro forma capital ratios that means the capital ratios after the benefits of M&amp;A disposals already signed is close to 8%. For a bank with our level of risk, this is in our opinion a very safe level, 7.9 Core Tier 1, 9.1 Tier 1 and 12.4 total capital are ratios very comfortable.</p>
          <p>The other two columns you have on the right-hand side before the total are the effect in terms of capital ratios coming from disposals or IPOs we have already in the pipeline, while the other column is the, let's say, the emergency actions in case we would need even more strength in terms of capital ratios, that is something that I do not expect at all. The figures you have in this page already embed the dividends pro forma accrued during the year. We have assumed the same level of payment of last year. So we have half of the dividends distributed last year already accounted for in these capital ratios.</p>
          <p>Page 13, the summary of the overall outlook of the bank and the confirmation of our strong commitment to have a 2010 net income a bit higher than the 2001 &#x2013; 2009 results. Now let's go rapidly through the consolidated results line-by-line and then we will have the divisional perspective.</p>
          <p>Page 15, the main results in terms of consolidated accounts, net interest income up 2% in the second quarter. This is one of the main results, one of the main evidence of the possible turning point in the cycle. After several quarters we have a positive sign in the net interest income and we consider this figure a very meaningful one. Net fee and commission up 11.5% in the first semester, second quarter more or less in line with the first.</p>
          <p>Operating cost, as I said before, down with some seasonal effect in the second quarter as almost always. Net adjustments to loans that's the other sign of a turning point maybe, down 26% in second Q 2010 versus second Q 2009, down 14% semester over semester. So we are now at 83 basis points annualized, that is more than in line with our commitment in terms of reduction year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Page 16, the summary of the P&amp;L of the first semester. If we follow the little arrows we had a very good performance of the net fee and commission that we will analyze later is certainly very satisfactory performance of the insurance business, the remarkable performance in terms of cost reduction and the higher than expected reduction in net adjustment to loans that together with the capital gains we had planned for the year make the net income up 6.4%. The capital gain coming from the sale of the branches to Cr&#xE9;dit Agricole is not included in this figure yet.</p>
          <p>Second Q, similar trends with a very strong point on the first line. The 2% increase in interest income is an important figure. As I said before, commission's in line, and the total operating income, especially if we take into -- if we exclude the effect of the write-downs in the trading profit, would have a plus sign. We will elaborate on the trading income and with the possibility that the write-downs come back very early in the next quarters. Net income up, but that's obvious given the capital gain coming from the sale of the security services.</p>
          <p>Page 18, the summary of the balance sheet, loan to customers minus-3 a good performance in terms of customer financial assets, both direct customer deposit and indirect customer deposits with a more than satisfactory trend in asset under management.</p>
          <p>Page 19, net interest income at the consolidated level. You'll see on the right-hand side the red line that is the desperate trend of the euribor rates, while if we see the levels of our quarterly net interest income after many quarters, we see a positive variation between the first and the second quarter this year.</p>
          <p>On the right hand side, you have the yearly analysis, and on the bottom of that side the average volumes. Don't give too much meaning to the trend in mid and large corporate figures, because those are mainly due to extraordinary increases in the first semester last year because of the crisis. And as far as the large corporates are concerned, a number of them, also with our help, have been able to place a number of &#x2013; a large number of bonds. So have changed the part of their position with these very successful issues on the market.</p>
          <p>Page 20, the analysis of the changes of the main events in terms of net interest income in the quarter. The left-hand side and in the semester right-hand side. What makes the plus 2% of the second quarter an interesting figure is also the source in the roots of this change. They are small  figures but both volumes and spreads have contributed to this increase.</p>
          <p>On the right hand side, we have the analysis year-on-year, June-on-June, where, obviously, given the trend in both the volumes and the market yields, both volume and spreads have been largely negative. The hedging facilities we have prepared in the last years have compensated for a part of this decrease. For sure, the overdraft charges change in terms of legislation has had a quite large cost. Part of this cost, part of this effect is compensated on the commission and fee income, but for sure is a heavy duty.</p>
          <p>Page 21, we consider the trend in net fee and commission income satisfactory both at the quarterly level and at the yearly level.</p>
          <p>Page 22, the assets under management were 6.2 billion net inflows in the first semester, a positive figures also in the second quarter, good contribution from commissions and fees coming from this area to the overall results. And what is certainly interesting is the improvement in the mix of the mutual funds asset you see from June 2009 to June 2010. The more value added fronts have gone from 21% to almost 27%. That's good news for the future, but for sure the real area for growth and improvement of results is still very large mix amount of monetary and bond funds that will have to be progressively, at least partially switched toward more value-added for the customers kind of funds.</p>
          <p>The last figure I want to point your attention is the last line of the page where we remind that we have 189 billion worth of assets under administration and this is a mine of resources that in the interest of our customers should be, at least partially moved to asset under management.</p>
          <p>Page 23, the trading profits, actually it's not a profit in the second quarter of this year mainly due to the write-downs connected with the sovereign debt crisis during the second Q and the write-downs, the mark-to-market and so the unrealized losses we had to take on our trading portfolio. We consider this quarter an extraordinary one, we believe this kind of activity will have a running rate much closer to the last two quarters and as I said that we expect the 100 million mark-to-market to come back given the very short residual life of the securities we had to written down.</p>
          <p>Page 24 is the breakdown of the trading profit. Customers, capital markets obviously also the capital markets have suffered from the situation in the last &#x2013; second quarter of the year and the treasury and prop trading portfolio had to take &#x20AC;100 million worth of unrealized losses.</p>
          <p>Page 25, insurance business confirms a very satisfactory performance. A lot of effort is being put in this area. A lot of effort will be put in this area as soon as we can proceed with the consolidation of the four insurance companies we still have in the group because of previous antitrust problems, but we believe we will be able soon to rationalize this area and entrap a certain amount, a significant amount of cost and revenue potential for the bank.</p>
          <p>Page 26, cost trend in line with what we have been doing in the last years. As I said before we have added a further structure of cost reduction of 1.6% in the first quarter of 2009 and this reduction refers to all the different components of our operational costs &#x2013; operating costs.</p>
          <p>Page 27, cost of credit if you look at the quarterly analysis, we have enjoyed a 26.2% decrease in the second quarter of this year versus the peak that was the second quarter of 2009. If we look at the quarterly figures, we are at an annual pace of 25 basis points well in line with the outlook we disclosed in March. If we look at the right hand side of the page the decrease versus the first semester 2010 is 14.4%.</p>
          <p>Page 28, strong reduction in the stock of past due loans, that's an important point because past dues is the beginning of the pipeline, is where the pipeline of the non-performing loans start and if we start reducing the loans that enter the pipeline or the pipeline gets progressively emptier. We had a decrease of 1 billion in net past due loans in the second quarter. The stock of net substandard loans has gone down by almost 1% and the stock of net non-performing loans has gone down by more than 1%.</p>
          <p>Page 29, the quality of the coverage we have in our balance sheets, the coverage of doubtful loans guarantees included stays in around of 124% a comfortable figure. That's the main reason why we keep having repayments from doubtful loans structurally higher than their net book value.</p>
          <p>On the right-hand side, you'll see the amount of the reserves we have on performing loans. It is increasing despite &#x2013; we made it increase despite decrease in the total loan portfolio. And so the coverage is increasing from 659 basis points to 73 basis points, we're talking about almost &#x20AC;2.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Same figures division by division at page 30. And the analysis of the inflows of new doubtful loans, we're talking about gross not net, but also if we look at gross as a new substandard loan flow, we have a trend that is positive and the trend in net new doubtful loan, sorry, in new doubtful loan gross is also decreasing quarter after quarter.</p>
          <p>Page 32, I will not go into the details, is the very balanced portfolio of loans we have in terms of the different business areas and in terms of industries on the right hand side.</p>
          <p>Page 33, a lot of details on the exposure we have outside of Italy, the rest of the world represents 23% of our total exposure and the exposure with the four countries that have been an area of attention for the world; the Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain &#x2013; they represent 2% of our total exposure. In the appendixes &#x2013; in the annexes you will find all the breakdowns country-by-country also by kind of customers.</p>
          <p>Very rapidly through the third chapter of the presentation, the divisional results. I know you will have a long afternoon with other presentation, so I will go very, very rapidly through them. Page 35 is the summary of all the divisions, but let's just look at the single, each single division. Banca dei Territori page 36, lower than last year in any respect with already some good reaction in terms of costs. The number of actions that have been taken will already have a benefit in the &#x2013; during the course of this year and I'm very happy about the kind of managerial and professional reaction this division is having despite having the market against in terms of a market yield.</p>
          <p>Page 37, Eurizon Capital, our asset management company all in line, very positive figures, 2.6 billion positive net collection in the first quarter. Growing synergies with the Banca dei Territori, this is key because this factory is really the supplier and the advisor company to our 8000 branches throughout the world and to our 17 million customers. They have introduced a number of new products and new lines of portfolio management. We are talking about a company that excluding the economic effects of purchase cost allocation has provided 55 &#x2013; 56 million worth of net income in just one quarter.</p>
          <p>Page 38, Corporate and Investment Banking, very strong performance, very low level of risk. So a very, very satisfactory performance, just look at the net fee and commission income and also the trend in terms of trading profit despite the strong effort in all the business units cost being kept under strong control, a negative figure also in this division. 51% increase in income before taxes. The strong reduction in net adjustment to loans is in my opinion, the result also of the very effective proactive approach this division has been able to apply to its customer base. And in many cases, we have anticipated problems and we have been able to manage also difficult situations just by managing them. Public finance, an increase in net income, strong attention on cost, new loans coming 2.1 billion in the first quarter of 2010. Obviously, we are suffering, but it's an automatic effect of the decrease in spreads that is an automatic effect with most of the contracts we have in this area of business, an interesting area for the potential to have.</p>
          <p>International Subsidiary Banks Division, very satisfactory. Revenues are up, costs down, cost of risk down. So almost 30% increase in net income. Strong reaction to the problems they suffered in few countries. These figures already embed the impact of the strange &#x2013; let me call it strange, Hungarian extraordinary tax that was applied on bank assets. So certainly in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Banca Fideuram &#x2013; Banca Fideuram will be listed as you know, is pursuing its business plan with very strong managerial determination, everything is moving very, very strongly in the right direction both in terms of revenues, in terms of costs and the overall result despite some extraordinary negative elements very much in line with the business plan with which the bank will be IPO'ed. In the first half of the year 1.4 billion positive net inflow of customer financial assets and cost income exactly where it has to be.</p>
          <p>Conclusion, page 42, I mean all these points have already been repeated, we are satisfied with the figures of the quarter and the semester because they are in line with our target, obviously we are not happy and we will be happy again only when our bank will be back to the results you know very well. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon everyone. The first question is on trading income which has been quite poor in this quarter for obvious reasons. Looking at what you said during the conference call, you mentioned the run rate is in line with the previous quarters, now, with 130 millions in the fourth quarter and the 220 in the first quarter 2010, so I'm just wondering what is your reference run rate for the trading income. That's the first question. The second is on the capital position, the quarter one has improved from 7.2 to 7.7%, which is a 50 basis points increase, but the earning contribution is only 30 basis points. So just wondering whether you can tell us where the other 20 basis points are coming from? And finally on the cost of credit, in the Corporate Division it was 35 basis points, that was very low, I'm just wondering whether you foresee a same level of cost of credit going forward? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Okay. Back to the first part of the question about trading income, as I was saying, it's very difficult to make a very precise forecast of the run rate. We consider for ourself a reference-running rate something that is the average between the previous two quarters.</p>
          <p>As far as the change in the Core Tier 1 figures, you have the explanation in the second and the third dots in the page. So the adoption of the IRB method for residential mortgages and the benefit from the neutralization of the effect on valuation reserves of debt securities available for sale, this &#x2013; if that was your question.</p>
          <p>Cost of credit for the Corporate and Investment Banking Division &#x2013; obviously, it's another impossible question and another special impossible answer, but we're very confident about the capability of this division to anticipate and manage credit problems.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, I have a few questions. The first one is regarding the available for sale reserve. You mentioned 100 million of unrealized losses on Italian treasuries that will be paid off fully in one year. Can we know the level of the available for sale reserve for what regards bonds? Then as far as I have understood, in the last few days you mentioned the possibility that Intesa might go on with acquisition, especially in the Central and Eastern Europe. The question is at what would you like to be the non-domestic contribution to the group revenues, let's say in three years? Then there is a lot going on regarding asset management in Italy. We have seen Popolare di Milano and Monte dei Paschi doing something and there is UniCredit. Yesterday we had Cr&#xE9;dit Agricole saying it would have an interest in Pioneer. Can you share with us your position regarding horizon, please? And is there any update regarding the timeframe of the IPO of Banca Fideuram, please? Thank you.</p>

          <p>I will start with the &#x2013; we'll leave the first question for a second in order to get the exact figure. Acquisition outside of Italy, we want to look at any opportunity in Central, Eastern Europe and in countries that we consider interesting and we kept doing it, but we also today at the Board meeting, we had nothing on the agenda. We believe the contribution to our overall results might increase slightly and then we will explain exactly on the occasion of the business plan how much. But let's assume a small increase in the overall contribution by what we call Subsidiary Bank &#x2013; International Subsidiary Bank Division.</p>
          <p>Asset management, as you know, in the last few years we have considered different possibilities. We have also looked at possible acquisitions, then we decided not to do it. We have a medium-sized asset management company on which we are investing, where we see a lot of potential in terms of collaboration with our banks both in Italy and in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Mediterranean area. We have nothing and we don't want to have anything on the table in terms of external deals.</p>
          <p>We are certainly investing to make this company as effective and as efficient as possible.</p>
          <p>Fideuram will be listed. The timing will be given by the market. Happily enough we've not forced any more to do it under the pressure of insufficient capital ratios. We have already achieved the level that are comfortable for a bank like ourself. But our commitment to IPO Fideuram in the next quarters is confirmed.</p>
          <p>The answer to the first question in the reserve for bonds on AFS is &#x20AC;900 million on the balance sheet from a regulatory point of view. So for the calculation of the capital ratios is 450 million.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We always said that the business plan can be completed, and then presented only when the regulatory scenario is defined. As you know, the Basel Committee has taken an important step in the last weeks, and an agreement on a number of rules has been reached. We still do not have the new levels of capital ratios that are required, that will be required. We expect most of the big questions and most of the big figures to be clarified by the end of the year. So if that is the case, and we will present the business plan designed around new regulatory scenario next spring. It's very important for us because not only in terms of capital ratios, but consequently in terms of our capability to pay out, to distribute as much dividend as possible whatever is in excess of the capital required and what is needed for financing growth, makes such a difference that before having these figures and having this clarification any commitment in terms of business plan is impossible.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon to everyone. Just a couple of questions. First of all on net interest income, it was in the second quarter better than in the first for the reasons that you explained, the volumes and the spread. And considering the level of the short-term rates, in the third quarter I would expect further improvements in Q3. Is it the correct way to look at it? And secondly, I found quite important the reduction in the non-performing loans, and also the comments you made on the improved demand for credit. And I was wondering if it is possible to add some more color on what sectors are producing these improvements the most? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually we have your same view. We expect rates -- market rates to improve slightly, to keep improving slightly. So we expect a positive effect in terms of net interest income in the next two quarters.</p>
          <p>Demand for credit, the industries and the sectors and the companies that are showing this attitude are mostly concentrated in the four areas that are more export-oriented. We are experiencing an increasing pace of activity in all the companies that are active in the area of &#x2013; in the industrial automation, in the area of agribusiness, in the area of fashion and related industries, in the area of whatever has to do with the home products. So these are the 4 main areas. Even if a number of companies that have gone through very, very strong restructuring and efficiency exercises in the last 2, 3 years are now showing in any industry a good sign of recovery.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And yes, good afternoon. I just wanted to clarify a little bit on the hedging policy. If you could provide some more details on what would happen if there continues to be a flattening of the yield curve? My understanding is that you are a swap receiver and that the swap was taken for a certain period that probably will expire sometime next year. What happens if rates remain at this level of &#x2013; or medium and long-term rates keep falling when you renew the swap, you will probably suffer a big reduction in net interest income or am I wrong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Luckily enough, you are wrong, because we have been able to extend the duration of these hedging facilities and if the interest rates remain very low the same way or almost the same way they are today the old 2011, for sure the old 2012 will be fully covered by the hedging facilities.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have just two questions. The first one is on your, as you said in the press release, your conservative management policy. I think the market recognized you did a great job in preserving the profitability of the bank in such tough times, but now you've interrupt the conditions to change and become a bit more aggressive in order to reduce the gap in profitability you have with most of your European peers considering that regulation is likely to be softened and postponed at the new capital regulation and there are also, as you said some early sign in economic recovery. In other words, are you concerned that your conservative policy can become at some point a disadvantage for Intesa in the European context?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on funding. It's been a tough second quarter for banks in terms of assessing the market. You said that very clearly in the press release that you don't need to access the market until the end of this year. How sustainable, how long this can be sustained for you when you will need to come back to the market and if you can share with us what potentially can be the funding need for next year and if you saw some sign of improvements in access to the market in the last weeks? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First point is a very important point because you are very right. We decided to face the crisis with a very prudent approach. Thanks to this approach, we have been amongst the very few banks -- probably the only one amongst the banks of our size -- that has gone through the crisis without asking for any support by shareholders or by governments. You're also right when you say that some conditions might change or might already been changing and that might give us some flexibility and give us some possibility to release some of the brakes, if I can use this word. But the different policies will be affected very differently. We are not and we will not change our quality policy in terms of credit risk. As you know, in a number of occasions and also in a number of segments and product lines, we have decided to lose part of &#x2013; a little part of our market share because we believe that the quality of the portfolio is the main solidity factor of a commercial bank. And in that respect, we will not release that policy.</p>
          <p>We had a very strong policy in terms of interbank market position, and we kept this position around zero for all the crisis period. That is a policy we might slightly release if the situation keeps improving the way we see it improving. We have applied a very strict, no mismatching kind of policy in terms of funding, also because we expected the Basel 3 requirements to be very strict. We will remain very prudent also in this area, but that's another area where the brakes can be partially released in the next quarters if the situation keeps improving.</p>
          <p>The second question is about funding. We &#x2013; you have to take into consideration two elements. The [Foreign Language] -- the maturities in 2011 are in around of 40 billion, but 60% of this 40 billions are retail operations.</p>
          <p>On the other side, as of today, we have an excess of long-term funding in around of 30 billion. So you see, it will depend very much on the development in the credit demand because we don't want to remain in an excessive, in an excess of funding situations. And in any case, given the mix of our maturities, we can say that even if the market becomes very difficult, we can cover all our needs with retail deals. But that's not what we expect to do. We will keep accessing the market, but our needs, after the very stringent policies we decided to apply in the last two years, gives us a very large degree of flexibility.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Couple of very quick questions. The first one is, very detailed, if you could give the balance of goodwill and intangibles for this quarter, because I believe it's not disclosed, and we can't calculate the tangible equity otherwise.</p>
          <p>The second one, if I look at page 20, net income, would it be possible to split, to the extent that you can, the contribution between customer and securities, at least an estimate. And the last question would be, if I look at the balance of trading and available for sale this quarter and last quarter, obviously it's gone up quite a bit, I think it's 35 billion from 4 times to 5 times tangible equity. This is the way I look at it. Do you look at this way as well or, in general, do you focus on overall leverage, and could you provide a little bit more detail as to what drove that increase? Is it more collateral that you're holding or is it that you basically decided to take advantage of the fact that yields were clearly too high at the end of June, and as we have seen that the yields on the Italian government bonds have been pretty much collapsing since then? Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I kept you waiting because we cannot understand the third question. I'll start by giving you the answers on the first two. In terms of equity, total intangible is in around of 24 billion and 19 billion is goodwill. As far as the second question, if I understood it correctly, page 20, all the benefit coming from operating impacts, 100% is from customers. But the third question is not &#x2013; we have not understood it.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have a couple of questions. The first one is on the guidance for 2009 &#x2013; sorry, 2010 net profit. You said that you expect a higher net profit this year. And my question is, do you agree that to make more profits in 2010, you need more capital gains on top of the 200 million that you will make with the deal with Cr&#xE9;dit Agricole? So more than the 200 million to reach your target? And the second question is on loan-loss provisions, which were at 83 basis points in the first semester, if you have the idea that this is a reasonable projection also for the full year or it's too early to say? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question, we confirm our expectations in terms of profits, net income higher than in 2009 without any other capital gain more than what we had already signed with the Cr&#xE9;dit Agricole. So we don't need any other capital gain. The 83 basis points loan provision on an annualized basis is certainly a good piece of news, but it's too early to say that we will be so below last year. We expect at this point -- we have a reasonably strong expectation that we will be below last year, but I would not take the responsibility to use the 83 as the new guidance.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Two questions. The first one is on capital ratio. If I understood properly, the benefit that you enjoyed in the first half of the year, thanks to the migration of some mortgages in terms of other <mark type="inaudible" /> been in the round of 13 bps. At the beginning of the year, you quantified in around 20, 25 bps the overall benefit from moving the accounting, thanks to budgets here. So my question is, is it correct to say that there are some additional 10 to 15 bps of benefit in terms of Core Tier 1 from change in accounting. Second question is on past due. If I understood properly, is it a 1 billion reduction? But it's not clear to me if this has to do with a change in accounting policy or it's a genuine improvement in terms of inflow or value? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First part of your question, you're right. Theoretically, there is some reserves in terms of the effect of the change in the models. But it's too early to make any more precise estimate. The decrease in past dues is 50% accounting mechanism and 50% realities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask my third and last question? You already explained that probably the hedging facility will be extended. So that that will not be a period in which we will have a drop in one shot in terms of net interest income, but &#x2013; my question is, I understand that now you're taking benefits of the bet that you take on the curve, some 12 to 18 months ago. So I don't understand, apart from saying there might be some additional benefit from enlarging the hedging facility, that such benefit will be equal, will be in the same amount of the benefit that they are currently enjoying. So to cut it short, probably the hedging facility will provide some benefit, but not to the same extent you're enjoying at this very stage, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not. If market yields remain at the level they are today, given that the same &#x2013; that the amount of hedged deposits is more or less the same, and given that the level at which we could create this hedging facility is more or less the same of the one we had before. If interest, if market yields remain at the level they are today, we can expect a net effect very similar to the one we had in 2009 and 2010. Also in the next two years.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Only one question on the Banca dei Territori. It seems to me that you're not very happy about the performance, and this will be the object &#x2013; one of the objects of this business plan. I was wondering, without stepping into the details of the next business plan, if you can give us an idea about what are the critical issues for the Banca dei Territori? And what is that that you wouldn't be happy about it, and how do you envisage to improve the performance overall I would say in Italy, given the current economic situation and the expected probably low growth as consensus believes? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think &#x2013; I mean, at least I tried &#x2013; to say almost the opposite. I'm not happy, nobody's happy because of the market yields. I'm very happy about the commitment and the results this division is achieving despite historically low market yields that make the markdown almost invisible.</p>
          <p>The critical issue from a structural point of view is a market issue, and that has to do with market yields. Retail operations develop value, especially &#x2013; or in the large part in the area of deposits. Today, deposits do not provide any sort of contribution. But for sure, we have identified a long list of things where both in terms of revenues and in terms of efficiency, the division will continue to improve its performance, even in a low interest rate environment.</p>
          <p>Just to give you some example, the investment we are making both in the asset management company and in the network in order to enable our people to sell and to support back our customers in terms of asset management products might bring, as we all know, hundreds of millions of higher commissions, just a small percentage of the asset under administration that move to assets under management would create hundreds of millions of euros. A different mix in the investment fund portfolio would also bring same kind of effect.</p>
          <p>And that's an example, but also in the area of revenues, we could make also other examples; because there are areas of activity that even if important are still limited, take the different lines of insurance.</p>
          <p>In terms of cost and efficiency, it's a matter of many different things. We are now in the position to design a much better than before our branch network, thanks to the fact that we have given the same IT system to all the branches. And in the area of branch organization, in the area of field coverage, we have important projects under way.</p>
          <p>IT systems will play an important role in simplifying a lot of procedures that today are very cost inefficient, and where we have identify areas for improvement. The area of the profit organization is another important area of cost saving, the pressure we are getting from the market yield environment is in the direction of accelerating all the projects we had for the next years. And we actually &#x2013; we have started implementing some of the projects that were due for 2011 and for 2012.</p>
          <p>So obviously, nobody is in the Banca dei Territori is happy about the pressure they are suffering in terms of results, but the kind of reaction that we are putting on the table is very remarkable.</p>

          <p>Hi. You have been talking about the potential from efficiency from the merger of the insurance operations after you gain a full control of Intesa Vita. I know that this is probably a subject that you would like to expand in the business plan, but it will be quite interesting if you can give us a bit more color. Obviously, it would be very interesting if you can give us a bit of an anticipation in terms of the size of these potential synergies. And I have another question which is generally related to cost control. Also in this quarter, you have been doing very well on this front; but you are the most efficient Italian bank. So going forward, what you expect on the cost line? Do you think that you can extract even more synergies and more efficiency from your operations, how do you see this line involving over time? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Early to talk about exact figures on the consolidation of the four insurance companies. But you can certainly count on a few dozens millions worth of cost synergies.</p>
          <p>What I count on is also a good number of revenue synergies, because when you have as today &#x2013; as we have today four different companies that cannot advertise their products, because we have &#x2013; we are forced to have four different brands even in the same city sometimes, it's impossible to properly design the product offer, to properly design the sales effort, and certainly to properly perform the advertising and promotion activity.</p>
          <p>So the main effect we expect from the consolidation of the four companies &#x2013; take for example, the IT systems. I mean out of the 150 million worth of cost, there is certainly a big figure in terms of savings. Cost control will have to have minus sign year after year. It's the world and the market that asks for that and we will do it.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're saying that it does not fit the model, so it's not rational what is happening on the market. Now I think that the market was very low, was extremely low, was &#x2013; if I can use this explanation, that was not rational the previous level. So we expected a higher increase and actually we expect some more increase because the 43 basis point level had no real meaning in itself.</p>

          <p>We have a question from Lawrence Rosenberg from MacKay Shields. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just maybe clarifying a couple of other things that have been asked before if you don't mind, and going back to specifically the last question, you showed on slide 19 that the quarterly net interest income was about 2.5 billion, so call it, just for simplicity, 10 billion annualized and the average euribor rate that you show is 43 basis points. Just theoretically speaking, if you added 100 basis points to that, which is something I think you've shown in your annual report in the past, what would be the impact on net interest income before the hedge and after the hedge?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we are not a quantitative model like that. But if you see what happened in the last two years, we lost because of the 4 percentage points almost &#x20AC;3.5 billion and we recovered through the hedging facility in around 1.2. That is what happened in reality.</p>
          <p>Will it go the other way around, the euribor rates move 100 basis points upward? Difficult to say. But if you ask me an estimate of what happens in terms of better markdowns and lower &#x2013; a little bit lower markups and the net effect in the hedging facilities, probably 100 basis points would bring something between 300 and &#x20AC;400 million worth of effect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And if you don't mind, going back to the loan demand you had said in recent months that the lending has improved, I was just wondering if you could talk about is that specifically an improvement in demand for loans or is that more that the banks as a whole are becoming a little bit more interested in lending now that there is greater clarity on the regulatory front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's a real change in credit demand because take our example, we have never reduced the loan offer even during the worst period from a regulatory point of view because we had reserves and liquidity well in excess of what was requested. So now take another evidence of what I'm saying, we had lines of credit already granted to customers, but not used by customers in the around of 60 billion. So what I'm talking about -- and I hope this trend will prove to be true and will be confirmed in the next quarters -- but what we experienced in the last part of the second quarter was a real change in the demand for credit by our customers and mostly it was related to export-oriented companies. The other component was the household request for mortgages that with this kind of interest rates become very interesting for them.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. And just finally if you don't mind, my last question. It's been great to see how well you've managed your cost base through this difficult environment. I was just wondering because now the merger is a few years old, I realize you have new projects that you're working on, but can you just give us a rough sense, I mean, how much longer, how many more years, say, runway would you have to keep costs flat at the group level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So for how many more years will we keep the cost flat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, given the amount of projects you have in the pipeline, which I am sure you'll share in more detail when you release the industrial plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the next &#x2013; in the three years of the business plan, they will have to be at least flat but probably we will have to find a way to put a minus also for the three years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>The question comes from Pascale Decque from Natixis. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, everyone. I understood you didn't want to quantify the minus number on cost and I still have one more question is on Banca dei Territori. I'm very surprised by the evolution of the cost of risk there. It is still growing. This is the highest over the last six quarter, if I am not wrong, not mentioning the fourth quarter, which is always very seasonal in Italy. This is not the case at UniCredit and Monte dei Paschi recertification and this is for me very counterintuitive, knowing the track record of Sanpaolo network, for instance. Then I wanted to have your view on this very surprising situation to me regarding the cost of risk of Banca dei Territori? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it is not that surprising. It's a sort of lagged effect, especially in the segment of the small and medium-sized companies. These are companies that had accrued reserves in the past and have more recently and only after a certain period of time ran out of reserves. So we hope and we will do our best to make the last quarters to be the top in the history of Banca dei Territori. But still we have to see what happens in the next few months. No, no, it's not that surprising given the characteristics of those small and medium-sized companies and given the combination of personal and company finances in those companies.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] I have a very simple question. You talk about your commitment on cost, it would be nice if you can tell us also, which do you think is the most important line that you're looking at more than cost? Is the net interest income going forward? Or you're more focused on the provision line in the P&amp;L &#x2013; in the new normal P&amp;L? What do you think you should be more focused on? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I always hate these kind of simple questions. But the answer is not probably a satisfactory one for you, because if we want to get back to the net income figures we have already experienced, we have to work very obsessively on all the different lines. For sure, the 3.7 billion worth of loan provision we had last year was at least &#x2013; were at least twice as much versus the normal figure for a bank like ours in non-crisis situations. For sure, what I said before about net interest income is in itself the single largest component of the recovery in terms of our results, but at the same time, we expect some recovery in market yields, but it will take some time to get back to where we were in 2007. Commission is an area that will be a source of satisfaction because of the big investment we're doing in &#x2013; on assets under administration and assets under management. Cost is the obvious &#x2013; and costs have attention by all of us because that's really the only thing that is in the hands of the company and that's our duty to keep it flat as your &#x2013; colleague of yours was saying, or minus, as we hope to show in the business plan. So these are very three big components and we cannot make it without any one of them. Sorry, we will have to take care of all of them.</p>

          <p>If there is no other question, I want to thank all of you. We tried to be as transparent as possible. As I said, we are satisfied about the way the bank is reacting to the crisis, not happy yet. We hope we will make you happy with the business plan. Thank you very much indeed.</p>
