          <p>Okay. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. Apologies for being late. As you know, we're not renowned for short answers, and that doesn't help with TV. So it went a little bit longer than anticipated.</p>
          <p>Can I just say today &#x2013; we got someone in the audience, Rod Smith, who is our Deloitte partner. He's had a huge challenge with health, and this is the first time I've seen him back at work. And it's fantastic to see you and looking so fit, Rod, so thanks for joining us here today.</p>
          <p>All right. No doubt, many of you have had the opportunity to read through the presentation. So I'll attempt to move through it reasonably quickly and give sufficient time for questions from both here and, of course, online.</p>
          <p>Really, the highlight of this year quite frankly has been the ability of the Woolworths business in difficult circumstances to really deliver another solid result, and it really indicates that we are building something of a sustainable growth for the longer period. So we are 85 years old in December 5, and we're certainly aiming to be at least 100 years old as a period Australian company.</p>
          <p>I think, more importantly, what we are seeing is that the reinvestment in our businesses, particularly in our brands, is starting to show tremendous uptick. And that is very encouraging for the years coming through. Our new store rollout continued very strongly, as today our refurbishments we've had done some significant new growth initiatives launched during the past 12 months.</p>
          <p>And more importantly, we've got a strong balance sheet and a strong cash flow that says enormous things for the fortitude of the Australian economy and its enhancement of sound Australian companies to perform even in difficult circumstances. So we think that's good news for Australian companies and good news for the Australian economy.</p>
          <p>No need to remind people in this room that we've got a 52 versus 53 weeks, so we've got both the statutory numbers but also the pro forma, so the 52/52, which is obviously the underlying growth of the business for your view.</p>
          <p>The number that I think is really important, of course, is the net profit after tax, up 12.8%, and it's slightly ahead of our guidance. It's still got a 12 there, and of course we had a little bit of a tick that took it just past the 12 with the tax changes that were announced just prior to the end of the financial year. But more importantly, that profit doesn't actually have any substantial property profits in this particular year, which the previous year did have.</p>
          <p>So let's have a look at some of the highlights. We are continuing to invest in our store network. We had some 195 new stores net after brand changes and closures, 131 new businesses.</p>
          <p>More importantly, with the new brands, we've got 40% of the Australian Supermarkets now in the new format, 15% of the BIG W, 17% of the Consumer Electronics, and 13% of the New Zealand Supermarkets in the new formats. And in each case, all of them are working and delivering well ahead of what we anticipated, which is terrific news.</p>
          <p>In terms of supply chain, we've got further enhancements to our network. In the past year we've opened two new centers, one in Melbourne, one in Sydney, to take care of our five billion plus liquor business.</p>
          <p>In Queensland for some time, which, I think, ours sales there are probably approaching $1.5 billion. We have been exclusively serviced by Metcash through their subsidiary ALM. We've now secured a new site, and we'll be open for business from the first day of the new financial year, that's FY'11, and that particular site will service our liquor business in Queensland marketplace, a substantial business.</p>
          <p>We also have a new site that we are commencing in Tasmania, and that will service both our own business and, of course, through our JV of some 27 years with Tasmanian Independent Retailers, the independent retail sector in Tasmania. We're also working on upgrading some of the facilities in New Zealand, extending, one in particular.</p>
          <p>More importantly, all of the new investment within our supply chain in supermarkets is now exceeding the business case. So not just moving, they are actually exceeding the business case and Geoff and the team have done a fabulous job over the last 12 months. Geoff, of course, taking over from Julie in the past 12 months, and we're delighted with the metrics we're getting out of our supply chain in all of our businesses.</p>
          <p>Clearly, we've got a multi-pronged moving to engagement of the customer in a far more deep way than we have in the past, and each of these have been reasonably successful. If I just focus on the credit card for the moment, it's true that we haven't got the targeted numbers that we had, that we set the target before the GFS. But what is really terrific is that the average spend on these cards is well and truly at the industry average, as is the outstanding balance.</p>
          <p>But I think the key metric is that 74% of the spend on these cards is actually outside of the Woolworths Group, so it's actually become their main credit card, as opposed to just the store card. And more importantly when we track those credit card numbers, because a lot of them are attached to other cards like the EDR, so we can actually cross reference.</p>
          <p>We can actually see that those that have taken up the credit card are increasing their basket size spend within the Woolworths Group, particularly in the supermarkets where they come back regularly on a week by &#x2013; and that's actually growing, which is terrific.</p>
          <p>So for those that are shopping in BIG W and Supermarkets now, they come in, spend $30 more, they get their petrol discount. They also pick up the Qantas Frequent Flyer points, and little bit later, we'll have Dick Smith and also other brands that will also participate in the Qantas Frequent Flyer program, not necessarily in the petrol discount.</p>
          <p>I think the important thing here is that what we're seeing, even before we really get in a big way into relating to our customers in a way that we haven't done in the past, and we've started that journey. Without us even doing that, we're seeing a material shift in the basket size for those that have linked their Qantas Frequent Flyer membership, and I think about six or 700,000, Richard, have actually joined, took advantage of our free offer to join &#x2013; Qantas' offer actually to join the Frequent Flyer for nothing.</p>
          <p>That we're able to track people that have linked the cards both before and after they're linking and after they link, we've just seen their basket sizes jump up, and remain up, and when we do some special offers, we see a jump again. So we think this is a terrific offer. We got over a million people now have linked, and it's &#x2013; they're joining in tens of thousands each week. So it's something that's just going to continue to grow, particularly we think as we add more and more of the brands into the offer.</p>
          <p>I've already talked about that. So the prepaid mobile, once again another alliance or joint venture or whatever you like to term it, with Optus becoming a Virtual Mobile Network Operator utilizing the Optus network has been, one where we have to go back and readjust our business plans, because the initial take-up has greatly surpassed what we initially thought it would be.</p>
          <p>Customers just get this is a really simple offer. It's really cheap. It's text and talk. It's 2G, which is the bulk of the market. We now believe that on the back of this we can move into the other segments, 3G, broadband, et cetera going forward. So this is off to a great start, and we've got some great expectation, even greater expectations when we first started.</p>
          <p>One of the things I'm most happy about is the repositioning of Consumer Electronics. We now have 77 stores, including two in New Zealand that have got the new brand and new ranging, et cetera. The comparable stores for the entire Dick Smith stores in Australia for the last year were 13.4% up. For those 70 odd that have been changed, that number is significantly higher than that.</p>
          <p>I think the most pleasing thing is when we look at the EBIT for the year; we had a really challenging first half, but the second half for the Australian business, which includes the Tandy and the Powerhouse, the brands we are exiting, EBIT was actually up 54% on a comparable basis for the second half. So it was a great turnaround, and certainly the improvement in margin on the back of an improvement in sales is a great formula going forward.</p>
          <p>The new stores in New Zealand also off to a great start, the one in Queen Street in Auckland had a fabulous opening. We also have started the mobile Techxpert, so we now have a national offering attached to each store where we have home service reinstallation, problem solving et cetera et cetera and it's been taken up fantastically. Online has been a strong growth, so last week I looked and that was 140% up on last year.</p>
          <p>This morning we actually launched our next phase of our online offer with Dick Smith with a substantial enhanced customer experience in both selecting product, customer knowledge but also completing the transaction. And we believe that this will have fantastic growth going forward based on the fact that we've had a really clunky side up until now that's actually been growing dramatically. The fact that we now have a much enhanced, so we've got great hopes for them.</p>
          <p>New Zealand Supermarkets, as we mentioned at the half we completed the heavy lifting for the first three years of changing the foundations in terms of systems and buying and fresh and private label. So they're in place.</p>
          <p>And we've started with the rollout of the new formats, which is the version of the 2010, those new stores delivering great double digit sales. We've also started the program, I think we've got about 50 or 60 completed, we'll have 90 by Christmas of new stores that we won't refurbish initially, where we're putting in standard and fixed stream, which means that the margin management shelf planogramming software that we bought in as part of the system change and initiated in December, now means we're able to manage our margin in a far more sophisticated way than we've had before. You need standardized shopping to do that, so that does really starting to show some benefits as well.</p>
          <p>But more importantly, all our stock from Christmas, now that we have got every store rolled out both at DC's and our stores and our forecast for vendors improved dramatically. So our service into our DC's has improved dramatically, as service from our DC's to our stores has improved dramatically and likewise our installed service label to our customers. And the metrics are now pretty much close to the Australian metrics and that does a lot for your like-for-like sales going forward.</p>
          <p>More importantly, the financial result for New Zealand in a &#x2013; halfway the New Zealand economy really hit the bottom, improved by some 17.3% and adjusting for the royalty that's paid by the New Zealand business back to Australia was actually up 19% on last year, so that was a great result for Peter and the team.</p>
          <p>Private label and control brands continue to motor along and we've introduced quite a number of them in all of their businesses other than in petrol over the last 12 months, this year we have done that <mark type="inaudible" /> or don't know about it. You haven't? Good.</p>
          <p>And some of them been are just fantastic result, so Platinum Blonde for instance in the beer category, our first foray into self brewing has been a runaway success and all of the others that are being introduced into the marketplace were also doing well. But Homebrand in particular has been a marvelously strengthened brand over the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>We've had some help in that growth, so truly we bought the Macro business as one property and people growth plan for our Thomas Dux and before Christmas we'll be having quite a number on to the present three that we have in the fleet.</p>
          <p>The Langton's secondary market for premium wines has been also a great success and of course, the ability of having one of the Australia's wine masters as part of our team now, is meant when you're going to the Dan Murphy's store, the ones that have been linked.</p>
          <p>Langton's, you'll see all the recommendations for the Langton's writings system I'll guess you call it for the wines and I believe they are the best. And of course Gage Roads underpins our growth into self brewing, so fairly soon we'll be launching the second of our BE brands on the back of the Platinum Blonde. So our report card, just focusing on either statutory or the pro forma sales and up single-digits that's a tick, if we exclude petrol a slightly better tick.</p>
          <p>EBIT outperforming sales is a tick and EPS out growing EBIT is a tick on both cases and CODB once we exclude petrol and hotels as we always do and take out the effect of any property profits which are a contrary on our CODB then we get a tick there in 20 basis points.</p>
          <p>EBIT is up by 13.4% and underlying that is the strength of the Australian Food and Liquor business, where we can see that on a pro forma basis it was up 17.4% and that profit after tax up 14.9% was a good result. CODB, as I mentioned before we've cracked the 20% for the full year which is one of our long-term targets, we still have a 19 in front of CODB, so we're very happy with that.</p>
          <p>Gross margin, excluding hotels, has ticked up a bit. I can track that back very carefully to mostly to the supply chain area with DST conversion with the new two DC's. And of course, we have converted our fresh chicken deliveries from DST to centralized distribution as well. Private label mix has helped quite a bit. And this is actually been achieved in the face of some significant price reinvestment by all of our brands in growing top line sales.</p>
          <p>Dividends per share, the Board confirmed 56 cents as the final dividend, so 104 cents for the year, up 13%. Pay-out ratio is in line with where we've been in the past. Australian Supermarkets had a terrific year. When we did a review at the end of the year of how the 2010 is returning on investment, they're actually improving their sales gap on the peer group and improving their EBIT outcome. So it really is a great endorsement of what's happened.</p>
          <p>We've also just reengineered &#x2013; value-reengineered the CapEx program and we believe well, we've just done and taken $600,000 out of the capital for 2010. So we've still got a few hundred to go yet and that will certainly make it a little bit cheaper. The other great thing is sustainable store program. The new ones have now ticked over a year and they are delivering in excess of 30% reduction in carbon footprint with a lot more things that are on trial at the moment to add to that. So we're really happy about that.</p>
          <p>Inflation in July has ticked down a bit, internally down a bit 2.9%. And more importantly, we're off to a great start in July. So I just had a look at the <mark type="inaudible" /> numbers before coming in for the first number of weeks in the year and <mark type="inaudible" /> numbers are growing in the mid-eights and our next biggest competitor is growing forward year-to-date in the low four. So we're off to good start, but one swallow doesn't make a summer. But it certainly was a good start to the year. Likewise, liquor rollout was off to a really good start as well.</p>
          <p>Petrol; tough year, but great to get the EBIT result that we did. It was really tough going in that first half with high petrol. The lower average pump certainly doesn't help you fractionalize your cost that improved as the petrol prices are come down, but EBIT at 1.9 cents per liter is pretty much in line with the previous year just a tick ahead.</p>
          <p>The epump is proving to be a great success. Lots of anecdotal and emails in from particularly moms that love the fact that they can no longer have to leave their kids in the car while they go into pay. They love the fact they can actually be with the kids and not leave them there.</p>
          <p>In liquor, off to a great start this year, but we had another boomer of a year in liquor. Dan Murphy's, BWS and Supermarkets all delivered. Dan Murphy's is now is actually over taken another two and it's now our largest &#x2013; overtaken BWS is our largest single brand, and the largest single brand in the country.</p>
          <p>And it was a year where we add a quite a number of stores particularly in the BWS Group, and we now have over 100 Dan Murphy's and we've got all the sites locked in for 150 sites to be in place over next few years. Our Langton's and Gage of course were a great addition to them.</p>
          <p>New Zealand Supermarkets, I won't go on with anymore. I think the result in the second half was a great credit to Peter. I think more importantly, the sales in July and &#x2013; actually June, July, the last quarter and into July have been really strengthened and as we rollout more refurbs and the rerec products we see a good response from customers. So we're thinking we are hitting in the right direction.</p>
          <p>I think the other thing that's really important here is that they substantially downsize their office since the half, so we've redeployed over 100 people out of <mark type="inaudible" />. So they have moved into new jobs elsewhere in the industry &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; within our company, quite a few coming across to Australia, particularly in IT and in the finance area. And that was done a very smoothly and done in a way that make sure that we looked after the jobs of those that being a great part of team in New Zealand.</p>
          <p>In BIG W, this was just an outstanding result, great first half, Julie, second half, but a great team effort to crack $200 million I think was terrific to be up 24% over last year, nearly 26 over on the pro forma basis was terrific. This is 11 quarters now, positive comp growth. For the first time in BIG W's history, and I am not sure I am aware of too many general merchandize-centered businesses that have done this. We actually made a good profit in every month of the year, last year and normally most general merchandize businesses have couple of profitable months around Christmas and Mother's Day and the rest I'd say they are breakeven or hang on to your coat.</p>
          <p>So we have moved to a whole new platform here in BIG W and there is no doubt that our business model is correct. We will continue to fine tune as we go forward. What you will see in the next 12 months is that we have got a &#x2013; already started a huge program. Of the 17 stores we have got converted we know what things actually work really well and we got a program where we're going to retrofit all of those ahead of the refurbishments and that will mean that over the next little while we'll convert 90 stores that will have all the basic elements of the really successful BIG W model that we have at the moment. So we are pretty happy about that, and the team there have done a fabulous job.</p>
          <p>Hotels, was a challenging year. On our pro forma basis, EBIT was up 3.3%. As you know many other hotels in the industry weren't be reporting positive EBIT for the year, so Bruce and the team have done a marvelous job here gaining comps holding up which is really important for us.</p>
          <p>The challenges have been around over the bar sales and restaurant sales, but the good news is that, they are starting to see some good sign, particularly in the restaurants in the last month or two. Obviously, going forward, the big thing we are preparing for is the licensing regime change in Victoria that we think will be a very good thing for our business in the next couple of years.</p>
          <p>Consumer Electronics, I think I have spoken enough about that. Once again, I think the new management team or basically our brand new management team in the last six to nine months, Dick Smith have done a marvelous job in garnering all the efforts and power of the team there and turn the business around. And the profit result was just in the second half was fantastic and we are going to build on that this year.</p>
          <p>In India, the property market has now cooled off again, so our partners back into the business have rolling in new stores. And we think that we are going to have another good year in India. We have already had a couple of months where we have actually made a slight profit so we think that we are getting close to the point where we won't be having a minus next to that number in the next couple of years.</p>
          <p>Now I'm going to ask Tom to come up and talk to the things that you are probably most interested in, and that's some of the balance sheet and cash and other metrics. Thanks, Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mike. Good morning everyone. I'll just talk a bit about the balance sheet and the cash flow and just run you through some of the key line items. The key message here is that all these balance sheet and cash flow remain particularly strong which gives us a great opportunity, continue to invest in the business and growth and continue to find new growth opportunities with the flexibility to invest in those.</p>
          <p>So in terms of our balance sheet, our inventory is up about 9% behind our sales growth because we had a increase in the level of import or indent stock coming into the country plus the impacts of the dollar, plus we restocked two new liquor DC's during the period, and I'll cover a bit more of our inventory when I get to the main slide.</p>
          <p>Payables are pretty much in line. The net tax balances, I just want to point something out there, we actually got a lower tax provision this year because of the way the tax installments arose. We actually paid more tax this year and that's reflected in the cash flow as well, just a timing of those payments.</p>
          <p>The net repayable debt, we operated the year, full year we paid the dividends and the CapEx and we drew down about 282 million which is a pretty good result, considering the activity we had going on.</p>
          <p>Our cash flow, our EBITDA is up about 11%. The cash from operating activities before interest and tax is up about six. I'll put on a slide the impact of the creditors and some of the analysts that follows page quite closely have already determined that that was going to be an issue because of the starting point last year but it is in &#x2013; according to settle, it all washes out in due course.</p>
          <p>Net interest paid was up because of a higher borrowings through to &#x2013; due to the CapEx program and the tax paid is up significantly because we &#x2013; if you remember I spoke about a deduction we had last year, which was a one-off deduction and the second component is we paid about $50 million more in tax payments this year than last year.</p>
          <p>We spent about $1.7 million in CapEx, slightly down from last year and last year had the $228 million worth of sales of &#x2013; proceeds of sales from the distribution centers, which wasn't an issue. So our free cash flow as a percentage of NPAT was about 43% compared to 55.</p>
          <p>I have included just a view of our group cash flow over the five years, just to show you how the CAGR looks over those periods and basically cash from operating activities is inaccessible equal to the EBITDA growth, just shows you the strong cash generating nature of Woolworths.</p>
          <p>The average inventory days, just a bit more on this. As you can see, if you remove the impacts of the liquor and the indent stock, we are about flat on inventory days last year. Petrol had a bit of a distortion during the &#x2013; between this year and last year because of the movements in cost prices. That actually, if you remove that, we're actually down about half a day, so sort of had a half a day impact. That being said, we are about flat on last year.</p>
          <p>We're still targeting one day and the areas obviously that we will be focusing on next year are in the liquor area to ensure that we get the efficiencies from the new supply chain additionally in New Zealand where we've got the advantage now having rollout stock management systems into New Zealand, so that will improve the days on hand in New Zealand as well.</p>
          <p>In terms of shareholder payouts, we always put this slide on which shows that over the period we returned over $7 billion of capital to our shareholders and I'll touch on capital management in a moment.</p>
          <p>In managing our capital structure we are very focused on maintaining our capital strength. During the period, which has been quite a turbulent period as everyone here knows, we've maintained our credit ratings, we're one of the few companies that haven't &#x2013; hasn't had to raise equity during the period to shore up it's balance sheet and I think it just shows the strength of the balance sheet and how we manage it from a &#x2013; maybe somewhat conservative nature. But in these times it certainly proved a major advantage.</p>
          <p>So whilst capital management remains an important issue and we have got a nice feedback of the franking credits there. Considering where the debt markets are, the equity markets and the uncertainty over the economy, we won't be undertaking any capital management at this time, however, as always, we'll review it and as events change and given other factors that are going on at the time, we'll reassess it as we go forward.</p>
          <p>In terms of debt refinancing, we only have a $350 million long term U.S. debt facility to be refinanced in 2011. And during the period, if you remember, I had talked about we were going to refinance some uncommitted working capital facilities with committed. We did that during the period, we raised U.S. $700 million through the Asian debt market. We were heavily oversubscribed with a lot of interest in debt investors investing in Woolworths. So that was a very successful outcome.</p>
          <p>The returns on funds employed, just up a tick at 31.9% and the return on equity pretty much flat mainly impacted by the shares issued on the DRP and on the employee share schemes. Thanks, Mike.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tom. The rest of the slides other than the one that we'll have at the end is very familiar to most of this audience, so just a brief history around where we've been. Project Refresh, reorganizing the business, focus on cost. Second one, reengineering through Mercury our logistics, and the third one of course is what we now know as Jupiter, and that is basically &#x2013; had we actually leverage what we have of the knowledge and the expertise we developed in the supermarkets into the rest of our business and new business opportunities going forward.</p>
          <p>Strategy and growth, this is really the underpinning of everything that we do within Woolworths and that is really making sure that what we put in place, what we spend on is actually all about our longer-term future and something that will actually enhance our ability to be a sustainable and growing business in the longer-term. We put ourselves out there by sharing with you our internal targets in the form of our scorecard that we share with you each half, and there is absolute focus in the business and making sure that we continue to have ticks on each of those going forward.</p>
          <p>As Tom said, we also have a very good understanding of the importance of having a very sound and safe and a business not overly exposed to risk and clearly a strong balance sheet, strong cash flow and the credit rating that we've been able to maintain is a key part of making sure that we are very disciplined in all of our investment be it a new store, a refurb and new piece of equipment and new software package that forward actually gets approved, we need a solid business case that we sign off on, and then annually for at least five years we go back and we test to see we've actually got that return. If we don't, then someone has to sing for their supper. Thankfully we haven't had to do that very often at all.</p>
          <p>Key growth initiatives haven't changed from the past number of years. So it's all about driving our core business and whilst yes we are looking at invigorating our offer all of the time by adding to our existing businesses and looking for new growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>It is really important that we never lose sight of the fact that the strength of our businesses in fact in our core retailing businesses, it's all about building a sustainable growth platform for the future.</p>
          <p>Leveraging our supply chain expertise, we're now seeing the fruits of that in just six months within New Zealand. We are starting to see the fruits of that in Dick Smith and in BIG W as well. So BIG W at the moment is now starting to rollout their version of AutoStockR so it's basically the same product that is being customized for general merchandize. And already we are seeing some really terrific improvements in in-stock and working capital metrics from those stores. So we think that's going to be a great thing for our business going forward.</p>
          <p>Likewise, we've done the same throughout our liquor business. So they now have AutoStockR right through the business, in the previous years as you know we put AutoStockR through our fresh businesses as well. Private label continues to motor on and there is no doubt having a look at some of the products that the guys have got in production at the moment, I think we are going to surprise and delight Australian customers over the next 12 months with some terrific products.</p>
          <p>Global sourcing, we've now fully established the office in Shanghai and it is doing terrific business for us focusing on the industries that are centered around the north of China in conjunction with our office in Hong Kong. We've also established a new buying office for the subcontinent and that office is in Delhi and we expect that we will be able to get some benefit from that fairly soon.</p>
          <p>I won't go into the customer engagement strategy. I think I said enough about that earlier but it really is going to underpin our sustainable like-for-like growth for many years to come within all of our businesses.</p>
          <p>Financial services, switch was a huge investment for us. It will be the foundation for many of our efforts going forward. To-date, we've had 100% on-time and at the appropriate speed of our ability from the service which was something we were never &#x2013; in the past 20 or so years since the electronic transactions came to being that we could experience. So it's been a wonderful investment for us.</p>
          <p>In-store financing for Dick Smith has been launched in conjunction with HSBC. Gift cards are amazing growing business for us, and you'll see gift card malls are starting to appear in all of our businesses. They are already in Dick Smith and you'll see prior to Christmas in many more. And we now have 600 ATMs that we have in a &#x2013; not our joint venture, but an arrangement with the ANZ Bank and we're very happy with the performance of those.</p>
          <p>We also understand, given the numbers that we see of the entire business that they are still continued available growth in all of our businesses in the Australian and New Zealand marketplace. In terms of growth options, very, very careful and very cautious, but confident when we make the decision is the way that we go about it. So we did spend a lot of time doing our homework.</p>
          <p>Our recent announcement on hardware has been the end of, of what we decided to do nearly three years ago. So we have spend a lot of time understanding the best way of going about this, so be rest assured anything that we do and there's nothing eminent that we're about to announce, but if anything else in the growth area that is in the business that we're not presently in, be rest assured, the same amount of vigor has been undertaken by the Woolworths team to ensure that we de-risk any new ventures.</p>
          <p>We're going to continue to reinvest in our businesses. There's no doubt when we go back and look at the returns that we're getting from what we've been invested in, we really see that we're getting a good bang for our buck, in particular with the supermarkets as I mentioned before. We are seeing it even enhanced return from those 2010c stores.</p>
          <p>Our property plans are in place. <mark type="inaudible" /> which is our in-house property development company is now probably the largest development company in the country in terms of shopping center development. We've taken up the slack.  The GPT's actually haven't been our biggest partner in development for many years, it's actually been the small and medium developers.</p>
          <p>So we're being working with them or standing in for them in many of the developments to make sure that our new store program doesn't hold at all and today, if things are going particularly well. It does mean, however, for a short period of time we will take some land on balance sheet until no yields return and obviously we'll go back to flipping them for sale and leaseback.</p>
          <p>So our guidance, there is no doubt that the country did reasonably well &#x2013; well, they did far better than just about every other country during the GFS, and there's no doubt that there were some significant assistance to retail, particularly discretionary retail, through this stimulus program in the past 12 months.</p>
          <p>We don't believe that that spending will be replicated in the next 12 months, although there's no doubt that not all that was actually spent, some of it was saved and some of it was actually used to pay down debt and we will see that discretionary spend will continue to be influenced by macroeconomic factors either positively or negatively by movements in interest rates petrol prices and in particular, about individuals' confidence in their present and future employment, because there's no doubt if you're worried about your company you work for, or worried about your job in particular, you will become a saver rather than a consumer.</p>
          <p>So it's on net basis that we provide the following guidance that we expect in the coming year that group sales will grow in the upper single-digits, excluding petrol. And we're not sure which way petrol prices are going. The present indications are perhaps they're going to go up rather than down. And we also expect that EBIT will continue to grow faster than sales in the coming year, and net profit after-tax will grow in the range of eight to 11%.</p>
          <p>The guidance excludes the effect of the hardware strategy recently announced. Clearly, the banks transaction has to complete. If it completes, we believe the profit from the banks organization will more than cover the expenditure, not the CapEx but the expenditure of the joint venture in the coming 12 months.</p>
          <p>So with that, ladies and gentlemen, I'll open the floor to questions to Tom and myself. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Shaun Cousins, JPMorgan. Just in terms of Australian Food and Liquor, can you just talk a little bit about given the very strong comp growth that you had in the second half, was there a greater level of reinvestment in price or was the cost of loyalty quite significant, because it seemed as though the pace of margin expansion, while very strong, was a little bit softer than what you had in the first half and you actually had lower comp growth. So I'm just trying to think about operating leverage should have been a big positive, what are the other factors there that we're not aware of?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, there's no doubt we continued our price reinvestment. Our cost inflation for the year in Supermarkets was higher than our sell inflation. So &#x2013; but that's no secret, we've done that every year, and we'll continue to do that, and we've got a reward from it. I think it's really important to have a look at when you're comparing other players in the marketplace, have a look at the quarters that they're based on.</p>
          <p>So it was a really great fourth quarter, a really great second half, and a really strong one the year before as opposed to one that looks good on one that was either flat or negative. So really important to do the numbers around dollars. So even if the two biggest players grew at the same rate, $600 million extra goes to the bigger guy over a quarter, and of course, that just means we grow market share.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's our target for the next three years, but it doesn't finish there. We've identified that there can be more than 150 &#x2013; 150 is we've got the license and we've got the block of land. So it's &#x2013; we'll add to that as we go forward.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's the business model that counts. So being first doesn't really count. It's actually being in a position where you really understand what's going to drive the business, and there's no doubt that our business model is very different to the competing business model.</p>

          <p>And maybe one for Tom. Just quickly in terms of depreciation, maybe this is a 27, 25 week issue, but looks as though depreciation in the second half went down on the first half. Is it purely weeks or is there something else that we're not seeing?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Phil Kimber from Goldman Sachs. Just a clarification on what tight trading for the discretionary retail businesses means. Does that mean lower growth rates or does it mean negative growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It means lower growth rates. Look when I say discretionary, there is no doubt when you look at say Harvey's sales last year, he was on record saying furniture and other large appliances were really tough. What we've shown this last time and in previous downturns is that the majority of our businesses is actually in basic commodities. So it's at the margin for us, to be quite frank, because we have shown that we're able to withstand tough times.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then a question on New Zealand. I think the cost of doing business in the second half fell 25, 30 basis points thereabouts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean you've talked a bit about what's driving that, should we look at what the history was for the Australian business costs of doing business and use that as a good guide for what you might be able to achieve in New Zealand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's the challenge we've given Peter and the team, and I've got no doubt now that we've giving them the opportunity, so a big driver of course. Now our order stocker program actually cuts an enormous amount of costs out because in our business if you handle a product more than once, then it has really bad effects on your cost, really bad effects on your margin because typically there's something that's going to happen, that's going to go out of date, get lost, get damaged or whatever. So that has been just a revelation.</p>
          <p>And it's been really interesting talking to the guys and girls at the stores in New Zealand. I guess they were a bit skeptical at first that it could make such a difference. But now they are looking at empty stock rooms and empty capping and full shelves. They just think it's the best thing since sliced bread, and of course, from a customer's point of view the availability on shelf is a big tick for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I guess, moving on to liquor from...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, but I should say we're not declaring victory in New Zealand just yet. We're off to &#x2013; our last half was a really great start. We're confident we're going to have a really good year in New Zealand this year. But we've got a long way to go. We've got a lot of stores to refurb. We've got 23 new stores in the pipeline; we've got to get them open. But we're going to have &#x2013; we've built the basis for a sustainable good business in New Zealand, but no victory flag yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Then moving on to liquor and the supply chain strategy there. One of the things that you got in the Supermarket business was significant trading area expansion, working the farm better, for want of a better expression. I mean, is that opportunity available for liquor as you take control of the supply chain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Dan Murphy, yes, there is. And probably what we'll do &#x2013; we think the floor space for Dan Murphy is actually about right. I think the newer stores we'll probably build with a smaller back room, because we did have significant direct deliveries up until the opening of these particular facilities.</p>
          <p>In BWS, they've never had a back room that was a disaster trying to operate, and now they just love the fact that order stocker just sends them in exactly what they need at the right time. And they no longer have to climb over things in their little back room. So I would think in BWS it just means that the process now actually fits the footprint we gave them in the first place. So the guys and girls have been very patient in BWS, and now I think we've made it a lot easier for them to work safely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can ask one last one on the Supermarket refurbs that the absolute numbers is low, which I think you had alluded to last sales results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I did. Yep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think it's because you're doing bigger refurbs in the sense of what's actually being done in the stores, fridges and the likes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So does that mean that the uplift from those refurbs is bigger than the previous ones from a sales and profit space?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So let me just try and take this. There were two different styles of refurbs. So there was 2010 and the 2010c. So the 2010 was a full refurb, including new refrigeration, etcetera, etcetera, and we got the best sales and the best margin improvement out of those. There are a whole bunch of other stores that had been refurbished in recent times that didn't need huge changes in refrigeration, but they needed d&#xE9;cor changes and flow changes and some additional equipment and change the front-end, etcetera. They returned us really good return, above what we required. But we've basically finished those. So the ones we're doing now are the rest of the ones that are due for their refurbishment. They actually give us a really good return, because they are a significant change for the customer.</p>
          <p>As a group, when I put the 2010cs and the 2010s together, measured against those that haven't versus what we got the year before, the sales uplift versus that group, and the EBIT uplift versus that group has actually strengthened in the past 12 months. Now, to what degree we put it down to that? I can only put it down to that because everything else like the Qantas frequent flyer program, etcetera, is available through all of them.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I haven't actually been into that one; I've been into probably about six that are pretty much identical. I think it's a very pretty store. I think it's a very expensive store. There is no doubt the CapEx is significant, and I would suggest that looking at the labor that you need to run particularly the fresh foods, it will be one that will have a significant impost in terms of labor cost per sales. And anecdotally, that's the information that's flowing through the marketplace, so that's the case.</p>

          <p>Okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I guess that will give you an indication.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of private label, private label overall is obviously taking significant share in the Supermarket, but can you talk about the relativity between Select and Homebrand and particularly in those categories where they both operate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Homebrand's been around for 20 plus years, so it's had great growth on a really sound base. So it's approaching $1.5 billion brand in itself. So it's a big, big brand. Select, of course, has got a much higher growth rate, because there is a much higher share of new products that have come in the last 12 months and products that are still growing their share.</p>
          <p>Where they're in the same category, hopefully, they actually are targeting different purchasing occasions. So there is the value entry price point product, and of course there is the product that offers a little bit more.</p>
          <p>I think we really are going to focus over the next little while on making sure where we have both of them in a category there is a real, real strong and clearly understood role for both of them by the consumer. I think in one or two the lines were a bit blurred because quite frankly Homebrand quality has improved dramatically over the last three years. So we just need to make sure Select is &#x2013; takes that leap to keep the gap.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And In terms of &#x2013; there seems to be a big push in television advertising towards Homebrand. Is that just a function of the times or reflective of a renewed emphasis on Homebrand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I won't &#x2013; I wouldn't say a big push. I think we've had a couple of goes with some tarps, with a pretty quirky sort of TV ad that actually did some good for our Homebrand sales. But I wouldn't say there's a big concerted push. But it's &#x2013; in tough times value entry price products are a key part of peoples' baskets, and it was important to &#x2013; just to alert people of the fact that over the last three years what's in the tin and what's in the can has actually improved dramatically. So if they had memories of 10 years ago buying a generic product as opposed to today, getting them to go back and try it just makes a huge difference. And that's why Homebrand has been a marvelous success in New Zealand, because they've tried it for the first time and realized that it's such a great product, that it actually has won. There's been lots of media cross referencing taste tests and ingredients tests with other products in the New Zealand market place, and Homebrand has won quite a number of those.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Record margins this year, 4.7% always considered a bit of a rule of thumb and I guess this has been harking back to guidance in the past, a 4% EBIT margin for this sort of business was about right. Is there any reason why, I guess we're thinking about margins going forward, is this a sustainable number, is there a structural reason why it should be higher than 4%. Just be interested to hear your thoughts there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think when you look around discount department stores around the world that are good solid businesses, between four and six is considered to be good, so I wouldn't consider 4.7 to be the high watermark for BIG W. But don't read into that, we're focused on just getting that margin up, we're actually focused on growing the business.</p>
          <p>We've got a long way to go, we've only got 150, how many stores, really? 157 now. So we think there's at least 200 spots for us, and we just need to make that business even bigger. It's now by revenue the biggest general merchandise business in the country. We're not the biggest EBIT margin business in the country, but as we grow bigger and fractionalize our costs, and are able to take advantage of further global sourcing opportunities, we think that we can actually grow both the top and the bottom line.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well when I said the new format. That's &#x2013; if you went to Ralph's Hill in the west of Sydney, you'll see most &#x2013; in fact all of what we are going to roll out. But it's really important that like the Supermarkets and like Dick Smith, you don't just say well this is it for the next five years. You've got to do two things. You've got to continue to involve the one that you are, but you need to have a separate group thinking about well what's going to win in ten year's time, because as the 2010c reaches its maturity you need to actually be thinking about, well what's a supermarket in 2020 going to look like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just and &#x2013; now &#x2013; going back to Shaun's question and the number of Dan Murphy's, is there a way to think about Dan Murphy's in terms of Dan Murphy's per supermarket perhaps, is there a &#x2013; any sort of guidelines there that you are willing to comment on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we've ever thought about it in that way. We think about it in terms of as all businesses in terms ahead of population, so we know what a Dan Murphy's &#x2013; what population we need and what spend we need to support one. We've recalibrated that, because we had a much bigger coverage in the early days, but we recognize now we can actually get the same metrics out of a smaller population. So the density we think is actually going to be a bit more than we thought maybe two or three years ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the 69% payout ratio, I understand the reasons for no capital management at this stage. You must have been tempted perhaps to lift the payout ratio in the absence of some sort of buyback perhaps.</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what I guess, well as you're balancing up expectations from shareholders there...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We have the benefit of a wide ranging number of shareholders, significant Australian shareholders, mom and dad shareholders, significant international shareholders, mom and dad shareholders internationally, and many of them write to me personally and to Tom and to the Chairman on their view. And the view is from here to here. And some are all about special dividends and giving it all away, others are saying don't give any dividend. Others are saying, let's have a buyback, let's get that 1.2 billion back into the hands of shareholders, the international guys are going phew.</p>
          <p>So we have to balance that, and the board I think has done the appropriate thing in the environment that we are in, but as Tom said, as the environment changes, then the Board reserves the right to actually reconsider their position regarding capital management.</p>

          <p>Seven? Seven, seven open, so that'll give us 10. And there may be one or two others before the year end, it just depends on where they're at &#x2013; it's really important now to get that group in, because we need to bid down the business model, and make sure that a small number can actually support the central costs. And then when we've got that right, then we roll out. So do the first couple down, tweak the model, add a few more, tweak the model when we are right, then we push the button. Craig?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just firstly a question on the number of refurbs looking to do across the group in FY '10, I think it was 360 in FY '09, do you have a number that you're looking at in FY '10 &#x2013; the refurb number has increased in dollars, is that following <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>

          <p>I was just &#x2013; I guess at least the number &#x2013; the dollar amount has increased in terms of the refurbs, and I wanted to know whether that was following a high number of stores or whether obviously as Phil's question asked earlier about the increased cost on a per store basis in Supermarkets, is that the same across...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No it's going down, it's going down. You know, you can never a say a refurb is refurb because it depends on how many fridges, but if I take a like-for-like &#x2013; take the standard stuff around lighting and fixturing and flooring and other stuff. Zigy Quensiky who heads up our construction area has been working hard for the last six months and we've just completed one where we have taken $600,000 out of one where you couldn't tell the difference.</p>
          <p>So on a like-for-like basis, we believe it will actually take the cost down, likewise in New Zealand and in Dick Smith we have done continued valued engineering, which they have an internal team to actually take the cost of the refurb down without actually changing the customer experience. When you do the first couple it's the ant's pants, then you've got to just make sure you use your leverage to get the cost down and that's exactly what we are doing in each of them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm interested in the balance sheet position in terms of the fixed charges cover, years ago it was a measure that you would talk about it more and the minimum was around 2.2. Is that fixed charges cover, it's running at three, what is a comfortable amount for the company?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our bank covenants were about 1.75, so we're way above our bank covenants. But we're going to manage not only that ratio but a range of other ratios to ensure that we maintain our A- credit rate. But we &#x2013; that &#x2013; it's &#x2013; three is a good number, we're quite comfortable with it. We have the capacity if we wanted to do capital management, but the question is when as I mentioned before.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just lastly turning actually to the hardware announcement from the other day, just a follow-up question with regards to the investment. I think it was Lowe's made an announcement suggesting 100 million U.S. investment per year for four years and the media seemed to have extrapolated that to 1.4 billion. I just want to understand exactly what that number is for the...</p>

      </speaker>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, there is &#x2013; they have mentioned a number, but there is a range of numbers depending on whether we do purchase of land and build this as leasehold and then of course if we purchase land how quickly you actually flip them into sell and leaseback. So it could be this, it could be that, it very much depends. Now at the moment, what we're seeing is a combination of both lease and product and land that we've bought, appropriately zoned, so how that pattern pans out will depend on whether it is the number that Lowe's said or something less or something slightly more. But what we have agreed is that we've agreed the high watermark between us and the high watermark is everything we would need to do if we had to do everything that was buy land and not necessarily flip it in the first couple of years.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just the first, just following-on from Craig's question there, just in terms of that 500 million in your CapEx it seems for property developments, does that include anything for the hardware acquisition of sites or anything?</p>

      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. And then with Dick Smith Electronics, I suppose your gross margins in there are sort of sitting in the mid-20s, and you look across the industry they're in the low 20s. Is your expectation as you keep pushing the mix towards the growth carriers like your flat panels and those sorts of things that will continue to fall?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look there is no doubt. It doesn't matter whether it's computer or flat panel, that's not where you make the money. It's actually in selling the brackets, selling the cord, selling the service, the installation, selling the warranty, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, that's where money is made.</p>
          <p>And that while we are putting a lot of effort into training, particularly sales training for our people. So you can sell a hell lot of flat screen TVs and a hell lot of laptops, but if you don't actually sell the bag and the software and everything else with it, well you get the sale but no margin. So it's really important that you have got sales people that actually understand where &#x2013; and you incentivize them to actually deliver gross margin on the sale.</p>
          <p>We are doing a lot better than we used to. We've got a lot of upsides still to come but the new store operations team are really focused on making sure that they understand where the money is, particularly a young guy that hits up the ops, his background, he was a fantastic seller fellow and he has really got everyone enthused and we are seeing good signs there. It was a great result for the Australian business this last half but there is a lot more to come.</p>

      <speaker type="q">

          <p>And just one final question. I was interested in the commentary around New Zealand, you said there were 70 stores at 2,000 square meters or less, are you viewing that as far as a competitive disadvantage in terms of the size and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No. We see it as an opportunity to increase the size of them. So you will see that with some of the above &#x2013; over and above our new stores we've actually made some acquisitions of property around existing stores to enable us to extend them going forward because they're in great locations.</p>

          <p>When you actually look at your CapEx, you're spending about 1.7 billion, you're going to over two billion next year and yet you're only guiding or you're only achieving 10% net PAT type of growth. Now, I am not criticizing the net PAT growth, that's good net PAT growth. But the amount of capital that you're spending, now if we strip that what you'd be getting for organic growth which would be around that probably five to 6% level, the amount of growth pick up in net PAT doesn't seem to be coming through given the level of CapEx that you are spending. Now the question is, is this just &#x2013; you're going to be diluting returns in the first couple of years to get future growth or is the CapEx, you are just not going to get the &#x2013; or when are we going to get the return for it, because right now it doesn't seem to be coming through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, clearly David, refurbishments in particular where a lot of that additional CapEx has gone gives a return over a number of years that's our business case. We build the business case over five years for and in some cases seven years for a refurbishment and it gives a return &#x2013; an additional return over that time. So it's actually about when it comes on board and its time and its lifecycle as apposed to the rest of the team.</p>
          <p>So giving a &#x2013; a tried answer to that actually is not possible. You actually need to track a number of refurbs over a number of years and do the build on it. We are very comfortable when we look at the individual stores, we &#x2013; and I know that you and I have had this conversation in the past, that we actually have a very rigorous program of making sure the business case for any expenditures meets our internal financial targets. And then we go back every year for five years in the case of property and refurbishments and check that we've got it.</p>
          <p>And except for the case where competitors actually just turned up that wasn't planned in year one or a freeway's being built through the car park or something like that; 90% of the proposals exceed their business case, because the guys are usually conservative, it is about 5% that are on the business case and about 5% that for those reasons might be just a little bit behind or they might just in many cases they are out because they're delayed in opening. So they might be a year behind.</p>
          <p>But I'm very comfortable with the guys that are doing it and whilst you might not be able to readily identify it in the numbers on a micro level, we look at every single piece of investment we do whether it's a piece of equipment or a software package. If we don't get a return on it, we don't spend it, simple as that.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Michael your inventory days, I was a bit disappointed to see that flat. Now I understand that you're looking to get a day out and you basically mentioned that you're looking to get it out from liquor, but I'm disappointed, it appears that Australian Supermarkets, the days inventory aren't falling any further, it seems that that seems to have troughed out, is that an accurate reading from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think when you adjust for the fact that we've bought in quite a number of indented products that actually rose in price, because they're bought in American dollars, the physical amount of inventory has actually come down. So when we looked at the units, it's down substantially. The value of it has gone up a little bit. If you actually strip that indent out I think you will find that Australian Supermarkets were down 0.8 of a day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you've got a lot of indent in Aussie supers? I didn't think you would have that much?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we buy quite a bit &#x2013; supers includes liquor, so we buy quite a bit of liquor from overseas and there is some private label that does come from overseas.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, general merchandizing in Supermarkets is about 90% internationally sourced.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my final question, I think Tom did a great job the other day of giving me a history lesson. I just wanted to go back and have a look at particularly Consumer Electronics in New Zealand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When you entered New Zealand, the business is generally generating about the same level of New Zealand dollars in EBIT as it is today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you, you made some pretty big statements around three or four years ago as to what you were going to do in that market. And you spend a lot of money refurbishing stores and bringing supply chain in. And in Consumer Electronics in 2006 and 2007 you guys also made some pretty big statements as to what you were going to do in that market. And your EBIT in '06 was 64 million and JB Hi-Fi's was 39. And today your EBIT is 55, and JB's is 134. My question is, you've made big statements as to what you are looking to do in new markets, and you're looking to go into hardware.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What lessons would you have learned from those two experiences that you might take heed of when you're entering the hardware market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Make sure you've got the right people in charge. That's number one, make sure you've got the right people in charge, because the fundamentals of doing it haven't changed. It's making sure that you've got the right team that can actually deliver and that's been the big change that's happened in Consumer Electronics. So I think when you look over history, I think we've probably had more hits than misses, and all business has some hits and misses. I think our track record of hits versus misses would stand up against many Australian companies. But I acknowledge that we may have said that, Dave.</p>
          <p>In terms of hardware, one of the greater statistics that has come out in looking around the world is, if you look at the large format hardware, if you go to American markets, typically per head of population there's one of those per 90,000 people. Elsewhere it's about 120, 130. In Auckland it's 130. In Australia it's close to 0.25 million people per big box. So we think there's an opportunity there.</p>

          <p>Thanks and good morning. Michael, you're going to launch a beer product called Dry Dock shortly. So looking at that liquor space, the control on private label, do you see that liquor has the same level of opportunities as a percentage of business as grocery?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right. Well, apparently it is, not being a beer drinker myself but those that are experts, Bruce Mathieson thinks it's going to be a bit of a winner, and he actually knows a bit about beer. And now, I've forgotten what your question was. I'm sorry.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>Private Label control label in liquor, does it have the same potential as a percentage of revenue that it does in grocery or could it be bigger?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and it's probably &#x2013; actually it's bigger now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. BIG W, I think I heard the question earlier you've got one new store in a new format. Is this the store format where you are dropping decorative and you are going to roll out 90 of them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No we've actually got 17 I think, from 20 now, 24 now so the number is going up by weeks. So 24. Basically what we are doing, there are a number of destination categories that have a different effect and a lowering of fixturing and some &#x2013; and obviously the signage and the front end treatment and a whole host of other customer facing things that are generating great value.</p>
          <p>So we want to make that 27, 90 as quickly as we can and so we are up and running with that and we should be able to do that for less than $1 million per store.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the categories you are dropping, are those that you're going to introduce in your hardware offer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not dropping any categories, sorry I must have missed that. We are not dropping any categories. What we are doing is highlighting categories that are really of interest to our BIW W customers. So Baby is a good example of that. Health and Beauty is a good example of that. What else would there be? Intimate Apparel, bras and things like that has been a great winner for us, huge growth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This question might have been asked earlier of Tom but the 504 million for property development net of sales in 2010 has that got hardware sites in it or out of it, you haven't explicitly mentioned it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think I &#x2013; well, obviously you did mention you weren't on for the whole thing.. There is a combination of leased sites, and sites where we'll own the land. In the case of where we own the land, of course, we will have some payment for land. But that is not a material number per site. In the case of leased sites, of course, we won't be paying any capital till we start fitting out the box itself, and that won't happen in the coming year for any.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>Greg, there is a small amount of property in the 2009 number that is not material.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So for me it would be an off balance sheet vehicle to &#x2013; which might be funded in an appropriate way to fund the purchase of property.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. Well this is the last question from me, we'll drop a few names in here, would Ian Morris be a good CEO for the hardware business?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think he's got a background in B&amp;Q in the U.K. market. But I know Ian, he's actually a really good retailer and a really good guy. But I think Steven and the Board at the warehouse have probably got him well and truly focused on bringing the warehouse back to its former powerhouse status.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so the closing question is you're not going to take your share from 10% of that business to 100% of business and get the people as well?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>Hi, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple of quick questions. Do you value the franking credits at all? And if so how do you assign a value to them, they're not on the balance sheet, etcetera?</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />
          </p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you ascribe zero value to them?</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />
          </p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in terms of your decision as to capital management versus acquisitions versus organic growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, that's a duel question. There is no value in the financial statements at all in relation to the franking credits. But are they valued well it depends on who participates in the buyback, so they're of value to the shareholders, and depends which market you are in.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />
          </p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will get you another one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the answer is yes, who participates in the buyback is a question of &#x2013; at a fact point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom that was a good way of making sure I couldn't ask a second question. But associated with that, you as Board of Directors need to come up with a view as to how you think those franking credits are going to be valued in shareholders' hands in determining what you're going to do. So I'll go back to do you ascribe a value to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the analysis, we do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And looking at the inventory days with the fact that you're probably going to be looking at an increased level of imports coming through over the next 12 months, you've got another Liquor DC coming through, you're going to have an increased level of private level, etcetera, etcetera, shouldn't we be looking at inventory days increasing in Australian Supermarkets over the next 12 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think &#x2013; well, overall, depending on how much we import, the overall days may increase, but the key if we take out the import inventory and just look at the pure retail businesses, our target remains and the discipline on our business remains to try and take a day out a year. It's a really healthy discipline, that's why we keep saying it, if we get to 0.8, then it's okay, if we get to 0.5 well next year we've got to do a bit better. So the imported inventory is something you take possession of a lot earlier, obviously because it's &#x2013; you take it when it gets on the ship. What we're also doing is spending a lot of time at looking at how our international supply chain works and we're in the process of putting a lot of effort just how that makes more efficient, how we get inventory from A to B across the sea, and I think there is quite a lot of advantage to be taken in that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the other thing that you should be wary of is that as in Supermarkets, you need to get the DCs in place, and they are just in place down, we've got the Queensland one to come. There is a long tail of slow moving items in every business and in Dan Murphy in particular, there is 20% that are 80% sales and there's the 80% that are 20% and it takes you quite a while once you move from a direct store delivery where you actually carry all the safety stock at store level, as opposed to the safety stock at your DC, because you can refurbish or replenish pretty quickly.</p>
          <p>It takes you a &#x2013; the best part of eighteen months to actually, you don't want to fire sale that stuff because it's good stuff, but it just takes time to get down to what we call the MPL, which is the Minimum Presentation Level, which is the kickoff for the next one. And already with the newest Dan Murphy that has been put on, the working capital investment has actually being reduced quite somewhat by some new ways of merchandising the product. So we believe that over a period of time, the average inventory for a Dan Murphy store on a price constant basis should come down, and substantially.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Final question for me is, looking at the Qantas frequent flyer tie-up can you give us an indication as to what that's done for your sales generation in Australian Supermarkets since it's launched and also a feeling as to the take-up rate of the personalized e-mail offers that you're sending out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The personalized e-mail take-up rate is really terrific. Would I say we're world leading it? Not yet but we're just &#x2013; we're getting better and better and better at it everyday. In terms of what it's meant for our business, it's material. It's been &#x2013; it's actually exceeded my expectations to be quite frank.</p>
          <p>We originally &#x2013; I don't know, 12, 15 months ago actually had some help from some people and we actually got some academics from Canberra to do some econometric modeling of consumer anticipated behavior and gave us some data that I found very hard to take and to believe. But I have to say they were pretty close to the mark now.</p>
          <p>So when we did our business case to go in, we cut it back pretty dramatically because we thought the Board would laugh at us because it looked pretty strong. But I'd have to say that it's been really good for us.</p>
          <p>I don't think we really understand yet the power of it, particularly as we're getting 10,000 or more each week, in some cases 20,000 a week or 30,000 a week depending on our push joining up. You know BIG W the first week we put it into BIG W, BIG W had a boom over week.</p>
          <p>You know we've got Dick Smith coming up fairly soon in October and then we'll gradually keep working through the brands over time and it will just continue to build and really just engenders loyalty to the Woolworth's Group, because every time I go there and I get close to getting on the plane to Hamilton Island for nothing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I was just wondering, if these are sites that are currently zoned for retail use or they would require re-zoning?</p>

          <p>Combination thereof, but most of them would be in the appropriate zone.</p>
