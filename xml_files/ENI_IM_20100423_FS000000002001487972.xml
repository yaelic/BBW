        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our first quarter results presentation. Here with me today are Claudio Descalzi and Domenico Dispenza. We will be happy to answer to your question at the end of the presentation.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of 2010, the market fundamentals had a mixed impact on Eni's result and the end of the cycle in general. Oil prices increased by 72% compared with the first quarter of 2009, while European refining margins, which averaged $2.40 per barrel, was down 55%. Finally, the euro showed an appreciation of 6% versus the U.S. dollar, averaging 1.38 during the quarter.</p>
          <p>As usual, I would like to remind you that Eni's results are affected by several issues, including the seasonal nature of demand for natural gas and petroleum products used for residential heating, which peaks in the first quarter of the year and is at its lowest in the third quarter. Therefore, Eni's operating profit and change in net debt in the first quarter cannot be extrapolated for the full year.</p>
          <p>Moving to the results, adjusted operating profit in the first quarter was &#x20AC;4.3 billion, up 15% year-on-year, thanks to the higher contribution of the Exploration &amp; Production division, partially offset by the weaker performance of the Gas and Power and Refining &amp; Marketing divisions.</p>
          <p>Adjusted net profit in the first quarter increased by 4% to &#x20AC;1.8 billion as a result of a stronger operating performance, which was partially offset by the higher adjusted tax rate, up 4 percentage points in the quarter as a consequence of the increased contribution of the E&amp;P.</p>
          <p>Hydrocarbon production in the first quarter increased by 2.1% compared to the same period of 2009, averaging 1,816,000 boe per day. This increase is due to the production ramp up and new field setups, mainly in Nigeria, Congo and Gulf of Mexico, as well as lower OPEC cuts of 26,000 boe a day.</p>
          <p>These positives were partially offset by the negative impact of PSAs of 47,000 barrels per day, mature field declines, facilities downtime in Norway, Kazakhstan and China due to the harsh weather condition recorded in January and lower gas uptake from Libya.</p>
          <p>When compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, production was down by 70,000 boe per day. This difference is mainly due to the positive one-off effects registered at the end of 2009 related to royalties received in U.S.A. and to the negative effect of the facilities downtime recorded in January '010, as well as lower gas uptake from Libya.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the economic performances, the first quarter adjusted operating profit of &#x20AC;3.1 billion was up 44% compared to the corresponding quarter of 2009 mainly as a result of higher hydrocarbons realization in dollars, increased production sold and lower exploration charges. These positive elements were partially offset by higher operating cost and DD&amp;A, as well as by the appreciation of the euro versus the U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>The overall gas volumes sold in the first quarter of 2010, including both consolidated and associated companies, decreased by approximately 6% year-on-year totaling 28.9 billion cubic meters. The decline in volumes is mainly due to increased competitive pressure in Italy, which was partially compensated by steady trends in sales on the European market.</p>
          <p>Adjusted operating profit decreased by 7% compared to the same period of 2009 mainly as a result of lower sales and weaker margins. The first quarter adjusted operating profit doesn't include &#x20AC;21 million of gains from a settlement of non-hedging commodity derivatives associated with the future sales of gas and electricity at fixed prices.</p>
          <p>Gas and Power adjusted pro forma EBITDA for the first quarter of 2010 was &#x20AC;1.4 billion compared to &#x20AC;1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2009. Results in the Marketing segment declined by 28% mainly as a result of lower volumes sold and the lower margins in Italy due to the increased competitive pressure, as well as the unfavorable trend in energy parameters. These negative factors were partially compensated by the impact of the re-negotiation of certain long-term supply contracts, as well as supply optimization measures.</p>
          <p>The regulated business generated &#x20AC;379 million, up 11% versus the first quarter of 2009. The increase mainly reflects the new tariff system that recognizes fewer gas costs and the higher volume transported. Finally, international transportation, which for the time being still includes and TAG, TENP and Transitgas showed as a result &#x2013; a result substantially in line with the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>In Refining &amp; Marketing, utilization rates declined to 70% in response to the weak trading environment. The first quarter recorded an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;94 million compared to an operating profit of &#x20AC;55 million in the same period of 2009.</p>
          <p>This loss mainly reflected the lower refining margins due to weaker relative prices of products to oil feedstock costs. Marketing activities delivered a weaker operating performance due to lower demand for oil products.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of 2010, the results of the Petrochemical business have improved with the operating loss down to &#x20AC;59 million from the &#x20AC;111 million operating loss of the first quarter of 2009, driven by a recovery of demand for product and benefiting from cost savings.</p>
          <p>In the Engineering &amp; Construction sector, the first quarter adjusted operating profit amounted to &#x20AC;289 million, up 6% versus the first quarter of 2009. The other activities and corporate shows an aggregate loss of &#x20AC;122 million versus a loss of &#x20AC;113 million in the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of 2010, operating activities generated cash flows of &#x20AC;4.6 billion. On top of this, the proceeds associated with the second installment of the disposal of SeverEnergia to Gazprom and those associated to the sale of non-core upstream assets located in the North Sea contributed &#x20AC;700 million, bringing the overall cash generated to &#x20AC;5.3 billion.</p>
          <p>The cash flow generated financed the CapEx of &#x20AC;2.8 billion and even considering a negative exchange rate effect of approximately &#x20AC;400 million as a consequence on the appreciation of U.S. dollar in the period, the net debt has been reduced by &#x20AC;2 billion. Accordingly, net financial debt as at the end of March amounted to &#x20AC;21.1 billion and the debt-to-equity ratio decreased to 0.39 when compared to 0.46.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. And now, together with Claudio and Domenico, I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from Mr. Alejandro Demichelis from Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Two questions, if I may. The first one is when you talk about this increased pressure on the gas market in Italy, both for volumes and margins, how much lower do you think that the market will stabilize for you? And the second question is, maybe you can update us on where exactly you are in the disposal of the North Sea assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well starting from the disposal of North Sea assets, as I have already stated in my presentation, those marginal assets have been already disposed of. The disposal process has been completed and the related consideration has been already counted in. So nothing else in our program, as far as the North Sea assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Italy, as you know, and once Europe where you need to collect that. The first aspect is the decrease of demand and confidence of Eni's. The second element is the effect of, which of course is impression now. So what I can say that we're expecting Italy to be down in 2010 as in 2009. I hope that we can say it's less than we had in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And looking beyond what you see now, I mean 2010, do you think that the market will start stabilizing beyond that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know that a decrease in consumption leveraging Europe has been around 6.6%. It will be considered in 27 counties. This clearly is in fact the combination of stable consumption in the residential sectors and other decrease around 9 to 15% industrial sector, in the power generation sectors.</p>
          <p>We are now seeing some signs of a recovery, probably we can say that energy we will see an increase of around 3%, 4% in demand, but it will take, of course, a little bit of time before this. I expect this recovery that's already started to continue in the next year or so, is my guess. That in 2012, 2013 probably we could go back traditional consumption levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very clear. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Iain Reid from Macquarie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A question for Claudio. Firstly, with a big increase in the Perla reserves, could you say what the development planning is for the field now? Could it potentially be an export facility, LNG or whatever? I think you previously said you were going to use the gas for developing your heavy oil facility there. And secondly, I wonder if you can update us on the situation at Karachaganak with respect to the negotiations with the government and the potential for phase III? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well firstly, regarding Perla, as I said last time that the reserves are confirmed and higher than the expectation of last year. And at the moment we have a final project for domestic disposal of this gas, especially for power generation and also, as we said, for the existing upgrader and gas injection. And for the future the main attention will be made on the upgrader that we have for our project.</p>
          <p>It's clear that we have additional gas. At the moment, we don't think about any LNG because the demand in terms of domestic industrial gas injection and downstream upgraders are absolutely enough to dispose of the gas we have, at least in the short, medium term.</p>
          <p>Karachaganak, you know that we are discussing with the authorities to start the discussion and inside the joint venture and be the first party. And we are discussing the results to our administration process that we are ongoing and also about other issues. I think that is that we are in early stage, so I can't more on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay then. Can I ask just one further thing? On the OPEC, there's obviously been a slippage in OPEC compliance. Is this something which you think is going to be permanent for the year now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>OpEx, if you compare the OpEx of 2009, we have an increase. Our average OpEx in 2009 was 5.3. Now we are at 6.3 more or less. And &#x2013; sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>OPEC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, OPEC, sorry, OPEC. I said OpEx, sorry. OPEC in first quarter is likely less, it is minus 4,000 barrels per day. We consider flat. Sorry, I understood OpEx.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Okay, great. Thanks, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Mr. Jon Rigby from UBS. Mr. Rigby, please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. The first is a follow-up on the gas market question. I appreciate we're very early into the year, but 1Q is obviously an important quarter. Do you feel more or less comfortable with the EBITDA guidance you gave at the strategy presentation as you sit right now having seen how the first quarter transpired? And I guess that's particularly the issue for 2010 and 2011?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is just there has been some headlines rolling through on some changes to liberalization of the Italian gas markets, and particularly talking about caps on wholesale gas volumes. I just wonder whether you are able to comment on that whether it has any significant or material effect on Eni or whether the sort of get outs are within the plans that you already had? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, a difficult question. The first during our strategy presentation we said, in fact, next four years we will average the same we saw that we had in 2009. I can confirm this is our target. <mark type="inaudible" /> as I said before, <mark type="inaudible" /> competitive pressure that we would recover in the next year when demand will recover.</p>
          <p>And the second issue, we just know now because this has been an issue just with the Council of Ministers this new law on liberalization. We cannot say up to now a clear indication due to factors. But what we understood, there would be an impact on Eni, but the impact is more in the same position we will or we should build additional capacity in the Stogit system <mark type="inaudible" />. And on the other side, if we expect to increase storage capacity, it will be some penalty from that. But I cannot say I would consider it a major factor from that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So just to clarify, you're saying that if the plans that you have for storage are sort of compliant with the requirements, you think that the ultimate effect on your business is quite low as you understand it right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We would expect we would expect a decline and the penalty is really marginal in the period. Of course it's a little bit different people if we do not expect a new plan of building additional storage capacity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, yes. Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Ms. Lucy Haskins from Barclays Capital. Ms. Haskin, you may proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And good afternoon, gentlemen. Could I ask about the change in the oil price assumption that underlies your production guidance for this year and whether that has any knock on impact in terms of your guidance on dividends? And also if you could give a little bit more clarity in terms of where you might see that sort of volume guidance on your new oil price assumptions, other than just kind of slightly better than last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have reviewed, as it is already stated in our press release, that for 2010 we have updated dollar estimate with record $76 per barrel. And as we have already stated, reviewing our strategy presentation, but however, it is useless to say that the final decision will be taken by the Board of Directors that we meet in July, in July as far as the dividend of 2010 is concerned. But however, I would recall that as far as 2010 is concerned, we have already given a guidance to pay a dividend of &#x20AC;1 in 2010, in line with what we have recognized for '09.</p>
          <p>But however, in the event the conditions, the present condition will prevail also in the future when we prepare the new 4-year plan in October, September, October, we retain the option to change the scenario of assumptions and to rebase the dividend. But dividend, I would like to emphasize, dividend that must be sustainable over the new 4-year plan. So we do not exclude this possibility, but we'll analyze the situation in September, October in preparing the new 4 year plan.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Irene Himona from Exane. Ms. Himona, you can proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. I have two questions, please. First, could you give us some guidance for full year depreciation charge and the average tax rate on your $76 oil price? And then secondly, looking at the Gas and Power result, the 1.26 billion and I'm sorry if you've addressed this already, can you identify the Forex effect in that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the tax rate, the tax clause and tax rate is concerned, for the E&amp;P sector we estimate to be able to maintain the same level of 60%, which is the tax rate which affected the first quarter results. We expect to maintain the same level of tax rate all over 2010.</p>
          <p>Then your question was...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Mr. James Hubbard --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no. As far as the overall tax rate is concerned for the E&amp;P, but considering that you can take it as a whole, we are considering an increase over the year by approximately 3%. We are expecting the debt, the E&amp;P, compared to the other generation. So this is the reason why compared to what we have achieved in 2009 we are expecting an increase in average tax rate.</p>
          <p>Then as far as DD&amp;A are concerned, in first quarter '010 we had a network figure of almost $11, $10.7 per barrel and all over 2010 we expect as well to grow expecting to reach something more $11 per barrel. So a slight increase in the remaining part of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the Gas and Power Forex effect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the Forex effect, we have &#x2013; is more effect in the first quarter, a limited effect in the first quarter '010 which was limited to &#x20AC;40 million compared to a more significant effect in the first quarter of '09, which was in the region of &#x20AC;170 million because since we are covering the price of the gas, for sure that we had a more stable period in the recent past. And accordingly, the effect of the derivatives that we have put in place in order to cover those transactions, they say no doubt electricity for sure generated a lower amount compared to the first quarter of 2009 where the price situation was significantly higher compared today with the present situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. James Hubbard from Morgan Stanley. Mr. Hubbard, you can proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks. Two questions, please. Firstly on Zubair in Iraq, I guess you would have covered this in your upstream seminar, which is coming in June now I think, but just ahead of that what should we be looking for over the next 12 to 18 months as the key developments in Zubair? What are your targets over that time horizon? I see some other holders of acreage in Iraq have already made substantial contracts abroad for Zubair's drilling. And then in Uganda there are reports that you are still looking at the country. I'm wondering are you so keen on Uganda that you're looking at the country as a whole outside of the acreage that the currency incumbent players, such as Tullow own or are you only interested in existing acreage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just Iraq, Zubair. For the next three years, we have a utilization plan, so that means that the bottleneck in those regions is reduced in facilities. We have a target in the first 2 years to increase production from the existing production of about 200,000 barrels a day to about first phase of 450 after three years to 680,000 barrels per day. That is utilization plan. Meanwhile, we are starting the full field development, which would be development that will bring us 1.2 million barrels of production. And we already install our people. We are working since February.</p>
          <p>And the bottlenecking already started and we are also looking at awarding contract for January through the summer. Because for the first year we are not operating directly, but through our partner, an Iraqi company, day company.</p>
          <p>So for the other question about Uganda, as you know, we reviewed in actually in January, February. We feel that we are just confident enough because we are already looking for new exploration activities that are close to our operations. We operate in the area, not far from that area in the West Coast. And we're already looking for new possible exploration activities. And they are not looking <mark type="inaudible" /> that we would drill in January.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Barry MacCarthy from RBS. Mr. MacCarthy, please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just two questions. First, a follow-up on Zubair. If the activities on the ground with your people installed as you said since February, have those gone according to plan or according to your initial schedules? And the second question, Claudio, please what FIDs, what project FIDs do you expect to take in 2010? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I think that the operation in Zubair following the schedule. I mean the first fall and the first milestone was baseline, it was actual baseline that we took in February. And we have also started the first operation in the facility. So I think that continue. We could install and trust people in the country, so I think that we can expect the schedule and the programs of 2010.</p>
          <p>Also, we started two months later because in the first schedule we thought to repurchase stock in January, but at the end of the day we start at the end of February. But fortunately because of all the water we get done in Nigeria in the last two years, so we had already a lot of preparation, people ready to start. So I think what we can I'm sure that we can respect our target for 2010. Talking about the new FID for 2010, Barry?</p>

          <p>So for 2010, we have already taken the FID for Kitan, that is our Australia project, and we're going to take a second FID Kerzak, that is our project in Algeria, is the second project after the acquisition of First Calgary. With the First Calgary we acquired managed 2 projects, one is MLA and the other one is Kerzak. So we're going to also finish the gas project, the gas project. We're going to sanction the limitation phase over there.</p>
          <p>And also the <mark type="inaudible" />. And also for the Angola offshore, the Block 15/06, the west Angola. And in Russia some was created. We tried to have early for the early production <mark type="inaudible" /> 2013 we are going to sanction the final project by end of this year. That are the main projects for 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I've just got two questions. The first is actually on market share associated with sales in terms of the tightening gas market. Do you get a sense that the Adriatic LNG Terminal was operating at full capacity in the first quarter so we can try and work out to see if you've got a situation of continuing decline in market share that is only ramping up? And secondly on Angola, can you go into any more detail on the new discoveries you've had in Angola with regard to size since the flow rates are not fantastic, I suppose they're fine for smaller Angolan wells? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well for the first question, the Adriatic LNG terminal I would say is operating nearing full capacity. Last year <mark type="inaudible" />. As a fact of this, in fact there is more gas into the market and with even less demand we expect a reduction on our market share in Italy, while we think that the volumes <mark type="inaudible" /> Italy will remain stable or even grow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So for Angola, Angola exploration, the Block 15/06 is really a very successful story. We already drilled 7 wells. Remember you that our commitment in the first exploration phase was to drill 8 wells. So we are going to finish the first phase by June 2010 well in advance, so practically 18 months in advance of the exploration of the first exploration phase. We have discovered 2 hubs in the east and in the western side of the block and we have already discovered more or less 1.3 billion barrel of oil and gas.</p>
          <p>So it's a remarkable discovery that we made and the first hub, as I told you, is ready to be sanctioned by the end of this year and we try to fast track also the second hub to be able to put into the two hubs by the end of this four year plan by 2013. So that is possible because we are going to use all the synergies with the existing development that we have in Angola, so I think that that is a very good story. And now we have to drill the last well in south in the Central Gulf and we plan also additional progress for exploration wells in Southeast. So I think that we're going to have a lot of participation from these offshore blocks.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. Just the one question. It was actually on your CapEx. You've guided again to a full year 2010 figure of close to 14 billion. I recall from the strategy presentation that you were talking about the E&amp;P spend this year being around a billion higher, so 10.5 versus 9.5 in '09. So if that's higher and group spend is roughly flat, I was wondering where the offset is coming from? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the CapEx, the higher CapEx is coming especially from new projects when we look at the new project in terms of the oil projects. So today there is one project because we have to &#x2013; we are going to spend more or 100%, 600 million for the 2010 rehabilitation phase. We have also additional spending in Venezuela for <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>And also in additional spending in with respect to 2009, here in Angola, 4 discoveries that I mentioned before. So that is a new way to accelerate the oil discoveries. And that is offset with other gas project that we delayed, as I already said in the previous meeting. And gas project in Libya and gas project in Egypt and also the phase III that has been postponed in Karachaganak.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sorry, the question was more if your E&amp;P CapEx is going up by &#x20AC;1 billion, what is going down by &#x20AC;1 billion elsewhere?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Since we wanted to maintain flat our, we want to maintain our target that we have declared during our strategy, which means that the increased spending of E&amp;P is compensated by the minor spending of other business line, predominantly something less is forecasted in R&amp;M some million euros and in Engineering &amp; Construction segment. So all-in-all the reduction in the spending of these divisions compensate more or less the &#x20AC;1 billion spending of E&amp;P.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I didn't quite catch that. You were saying it's R&amp;M and Engineering?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

          <p>Combined?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I thought Saipem was indicating flat CapEx this year rather than a reduction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course the materiality of the measurement of the spending for Saipem is different compared to us. So for sure there's more difference since we are talking about just 1 billion of additional spending of E&amp;P. And when we say this amount is compensated, it is almost entirely compensated, not entirely. It means that there is an unbalance of a few hundred million euro.</p>
          <p>And accordingly, the major spending is recorded in that Refining &amp; Marketing, which spending is postponed through 2011 and also some millions euro less is forecasted from Engineering and Construction division. So also Saipem is interested not so material amount, but also Saipem is capable to deliver few millions euro of minor CapEx.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. Also just to clarify, on the E&amp;P CapEx you mentioned, would that number, the 10.5, include signature bonuses at 25 and possibly Zubair as well in Iraq?</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. I would like to have just a clarification on your tax rate for the full year because you mentioned an increase around 300 basis points compared to last year? So are you targeting around 59%, is it correct?</p>
