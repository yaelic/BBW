        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning everyone. Good morning to everyone in the room and those watching via our webcast. Welcome to our Results Presentation.</p>
          <p>I'm Alison Cooper, Chief Executive. I'm here with Bob Dyrbus, our Finance Director. Our Chairman, Iain Napier, is on the front row here. And actually, we have a fairly formidable front row with the whole senior management team here, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:23). Please take your chance to catch up with them, catch up with the team afterwards, if you haven't, over coffee.</p>
          <p>Over the last two years, we made great progress in shifting our strategic focus to put consumers at the heart of our business and drive organic sales growth. It's been a rapid transition, and I'm excited about the progress we're making. We've got quality brands delivering quality growth, sustainable sales driving sustainable returns.</p>
          <p>Our success is built around differentiated approach that's focused on applying our understanding of consumer motivations to realize the potential of our portfolio, and fantastic brands and products that offer consumers the best tobacco experiences. And this is fueled by our winning culture, our people and our values. It's not just what we do, it's how we do it.</p>
          <p>The response from our people to these changes has been remarkable. A united focus on sales, on building total tobacco brands and consumer experiences that deliver high-quality, sustainable growth. A great job, everyone, and thank you.</p>
          <p>Our business model is familiar to you. We apply our sales-growth drivers and key enablers to maximize the growth of our total tobacco portfolio, driving high-margin sales to generate cash that we use to reinvest in the business and create value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Our focus on driving quality growth whilst effectively managing costs and cash delivered a number of highlights in the year. We increased tobacco net revenues by 4% and grew revenues of our key strategic brands &#x2013; Davidoff, Gauloises Blondes, West and JPS &#x2013; by 13%.</p>
          <p>We're generating great momentum behind these brands. They now account for around 30% of our total stick equivalent volumes, and their success was a key driver of the 10% revenue growth we achieved in our Rest of World region.</p>
          <p>Tobacco operating margins remained strong at 42%, with tobacco adjusted operating profit up 4% and adjusted earnings per share growing by 8%. Free cash flow was &#xA3;1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>You'll have seen from the RNS that we've written down the value of our Spanish goodwill due to further deterioration in Spanish economic indicators. The impairment charge is a non-cash item and has been excluded from our adjusted results, and Bob will talk more about this later.</p>
          <p>And in terms of supporting sales growth, we've been increasing investments behind our key assets, ensuring we balance investments with price, mix and cost management. Our focus on maximizing value has increased returns to shareholders by over 40% in the year, up to &#xA3;1.5 billion, including share buybacks of just over &#xA3;0.5 billion, and the buyback program is ongoing. And we're again increasing our dividend payout ratio up to 52.5% of adjusted earnings per share, with the Board proposing a final dividend of &#xA3;0.739, bringing the total dividend for the year to &#xA3;1.056, an increase of 11%.</p>
          <p>The strong performances we're delivering across the portfolio highlights the quality growth we're generating. The volume and revenue growth from our key strategic brands was excellent, and although fine-cut volumes were flat, we improved revenues by 13%.</p>
          <p>Our overall stick equivalent volumes declined 2.7%, but were flat excluding compliance with Syrian trade sanctions and the impact of Ukraine and Poland, where there's been a steep decline in the legal markets. This reflects the performance of our key strategic brands and the strong growth we're achieving in make your own tobacco.</p>
          <p>Our premium cigar division had another great year, growing volumes by 11% and revenues by 10%. And in smokeless, we continue to go from strength to strength in Scandinavia.</p>
          <p>We're driving momentum behind our key strategic brands, and here you can see how we're driving that growth through the lens of the business model. Starting at the bottom of the wheel, with reinvestment. This year, we increased A&amp;P behind these brands by 26%. There's been further investment in CapEx, product quality, innovation and our people to support sales. Every pound we've invested in these brands has generated over &#xA3;5 in sales, with pricing and innovation boosting performance.</p>
          <p>These brands already generate excellent gross margins, and we improved them again this year, in both percentage and absolute terms. And finally, strong cash flows. After A&amp;P, net brand contribution was up by 13%, and we'll continue to support our total tobacco brand growth with further investments in the coming year.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at how each of these brands performed. We grew Davidoff by 9%, achieving very good results in Asia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe, where we're gaining volume and share at high margins. Our success in the king-size superslims and the launch of a queen-size variant continues to drive sales. And we're accelerating momentum with the launch of Davidoff iD, the new king-size range in standard and GlideTec packs. This is a major portfolio initiative in the second half, and through iD, we're opening up the Davidoff experience to a much broader consumer base, making the brand more accessible to more consumers in more markets.</p>
          <p>In just five months, we've launched iD in 19 markets, including Global Duty Free, generating very positive consumer feedback and strong initial sales that are supporting the further growth of Davidoff. The international rollout continues, and iD will be launched in lots more markets by the end of the year. It's a fantastic addition to the Davidoff family, as you can see from this video.</p>
          <p>[Video Presentation] (07:00 &#x2013; 08:21)</p>
          <p>And for those of you who haven't seen it yet, there's a sample of the art used for Davidoff iD around the coffee area outside to look at before you leave.</p>
          <p>We delivered another great performance with Gauloises Blondes, building on its strong base in the EU and driving sales in emerging markets. Volumes were up 11%, with excellent results in Africa and the Middle East. Innovation and portfolio and management initiatives continue to support the brand's growth momentum, including Tactil with GlideTec and the crushball variant in France, and new additive free cigarette and fine cut tobacco launches in Germany.</p>
          <p>The turnaround we achieved with West has been another real highlight of the year. We grew volumes by 5%, with particularly good results in Eastern Europe and Asia Pacific. Innovation has been central to West's strong performance in these regions, with queen size, king size superslims and crushball variants enhancing the brand's profile in high-growth segments. We've also significantly improved West's position in Turkey through new pricing and customer engagement strategies, with volumes up over 50%.</p>
          <p>JPS had another good year, generating very strong results in the UK and Australia, where the brand resonates strongly with value seeking consumers. Gains in cigarette, and both roll-your-own and make-your-own fine cut tobacco were the key drivers of growth, supported by innovation initiatives including JPS GlideTec in Germany, and crushball in the Netherlands.</p>
          <p>Our enhanced sales agenda has initially focused on our key strategic brands. The priority two years ago was to get these brands really motoring with consumers to drive sustainable sales growth. You've seen the results we're delivering, and as I demonstrated with the strategic brand, the growth model, we're going to be building on that going forward. But we're also actively managing core heritage brands in the portfolio that have significant untapped potential. Four of them are on this slide, News in the EU, Bastos in Asia Pacific, Maxim in Russia and Fine in Africa and Asia Pacific. They're among several brands in our portfolio with strong heritage, brands that resonate with consumers, and we have initiatives underway to add to the growth of these and other heritage brands.</p>
          <p>Our world leadership in fine cut tobacco is a real strength of the business and a great place to be in the current economic environment. We know the category and the consumers better than anyone else. And excluding Poland where there's been a significant and rapid increase in the use of non-duty paid tobacco, our volumes were by 4%. Including Poland volumes are flat, but revenue grew strongly by 13%. This reflects some great successes we're achieving in core EU markets, particularly in the high growth make-your-own sector. We improved make-your-own volumes by 8%. Excluding Poland, they were up by 20%. A number of strong brand performances are driving this growth, including JPS and Fairwind in Germany, West in the Netherlands and Ducados in Spain. We also grew volumes in papers and tubes by 4% and 8% respectively, adding to our margin generation from fine cut consumption.</p>
          <p>Our premium cigar division, which includes Habanos and other premium cigars, continues to perform well. We delivered very strong results in emerging markets through luxury Cuban cigars, with excellent growth in China, Russia and the Middle East. And we're also driving good growth in the USA. Limited edition launches continue to support sales, and overall we increased volumes by 11% and revenues by 10%, with emerging market volumes up by 7%, net revenues climbing 16%.</p>
          <p>Our Scandinavian snus portfolio had another great year, building on what has been a strong track record of growth. Volumes were up 53%, with revenues improving 46% and our market shares increasing in both Sweden and Norway.</p>
          <p>We've made great progress with our innovation pipeline this year, as we focus on creating new consumer experiences. We've been broadening our range of crushball offerings, accelerating the international rollout of GlideTec and expanding our range of queen size variants and superslims. We've also been applying our expertise in blends, launching a fresh blend of West and additive free blends in cigarettes and fine cut tobacco for Gauloises. These are all scalable initiatives based on consumer insights and designed to deliver high returns.</p>
          <p>GlideTec's been a particular focus this year. This leading pack innovation provides smokers with choice and reinforces brand differentiation. We've rapidly scaled this initiative, improving the performance of our key strategic brands as well as heritage brands such Lambert &amp; Butler and Fortuna. L&amp;B's position in the UK has been strengthened and Fortuna is gaining share in Spain, and as a result of these successes we're improving sales mix. In total, GlideTec's delivered sales of over 1 billion cigarettes in 13 markets, plus Global Duty Free, and there's more to come.</p>
          <p>Our success at building total tobacco brands is also about our pricing and excise strategies. Price/mix doubled in the last year with innovation and our key strategic brands' significant drivers of mix. We're enhancing our pricing analysis in a number of markets and broadened price &#x2013; brand price options, for example, with different formats, adding to consumer choice and the quality of our growth. And we're continually improving our customer engagement approach. This is the conduit to the consumer where we're driving availability and advocacy of our products. One of our centers of excellence is Australia where customer engagement has been integral to the share gains we've made this year. This is a great place to be with plain packaging on the horizon and gives us confidence in our ability to build on our track record of success.</p>
          <p>Applying our growth drivers and consumer understanding across our footprint is key to driving sustainable growth. We see many future opportunities in the EU. Yes, there are some economic and regulatory pressures and these are likely to persist, but we've got the portfolio and the expertise to continue growing in this highly profitable region. Our bias is on driving revenue and profit performance, whilst actively managing our market share positions while strategically balancing shares, revenues and profits, and with innovation supporting price/mix; we focus on maximizing return. Despite the weak environment, we grew EU revenues by over 3%. Operating profit was up by 4%, up by 8 &#x2013; almost &#xA3;80 million in absolute terms.</p>
          <p>In the USA it's about making the turnaround happen, and we're implementing a very clear plan to strengthen our competitive position and build our sales momentum. Working with the sales growth drivers and our consumer understanding, we've developed a fresh focus on driving growth on a state-by-state basis. Through customer engagement we're strengthening retail partnerships, and we've stabilized USA Gold and Sonoma as a result of new cigarette pricing strategies. This was rolled out across 19 states in the summer after a successful trial phase, and our cigarette share has been on an improving trend since then.</p>
          <p>The excellent performance of our premium cigar portfolio meant we improved volumes by 11% and revenues by 10%, and we'll be building on this strong growth going forward. We've also got a number of innovation initiatives in hand to support the broader portfolio. So we're heading in the right direction; it'll take time. We're driving change on a large scale and we're focused on further improving our position.</p>
          <p>In our Rest of World region, our focus is biased to quality, volume and share growth, and we see considerable future growth opportunities across these markets. Our investments are weighted towards supporting growth in this region and enhancing momentum behind our key strategic brands. We made excellent progress in the year, growing revenues by 10% and profits by 7%. Strong performances in a number of markets, including Russia, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan and Australia contributed to our regional success story. And applying our consumer understanding to our total tobacco brands is realizing our growth potential across our diverse footprint. We're in a great position to build on this growth going forward.</p>
          <p>I now hand you over to Bob to take you through the financials.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Alison, and good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>I'll start with an overview of the results. This table includes the reconciliation between reported and constant currency numbers. I'll be focusing on constant currency adjusted numbers for all of my comments. Results have been adjusted and presented on our usual basis, with details in the appendices.</p>
          <p>Tobacco net revenues were up 4%, with positive price mix offsetting volume declines, whilst logistics distribution fees were down 1%, a robust performance given the economic climate. Tobacco adjusted operating profits grew 4%, and logistics adjusted operating profits were up 2%. We continue to invest in the business to drive long-term growth, whilst generating high tobacco margins of over 42%. And after tax, at an effective rate of 23%, earnings per share grew by 8%.</p>
          <p>Reinvesting to support growth is a key element of our business model. Last year, we made further revenue investments in the business of around &#xA3;200 million or over &#xA3;0.15 in earnings per share terms, split evenly between A&amp;P, brand and product initiatives, and investment in people to support sales growth. Even with this investment we grew EPS by 8%, and the cash we're reinvesting is delivering excellent returns with strong revenue and profit growth in our key strategic brands, fine cut tobacco, cigars and snus. We intend to make further incremental investments in 2013 to continue sustainably growing revenues and profits.</p>
          <p>Before moving on, some brief comments on Spain, tax and interest charges. Further deterioration in the Spanish economic indicators means that under IFRS the value of goodwill previously allocated to Spain has been reduced by &#xA3;1.2 billion. This is a non-cash item, an accounting requirement that's been excluded from our adjusted results in line with our normal policy. Overall, Altadis has been performing as expected since the acquisition in 2008, delivering returns in line with our expectations and ahead of risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital at the time of the deal.</p>
          <p>Our average all-in cost of net debt improved to 5.5%, and 5.5% is our current guidance for 2013. The net interest charge was stable in constant currency terms, reflecting higher dividend payments, a full year of the share buyback, and increased working capital. In terms of tax, our tax rates should remain at around 23%. This is sustainable and is the benefiting from the lowering of UK corporate tax rates and the introduction by the UK Government of more beneficial rules for the taxation of foreign profits.</p>
          <p>In logistics we grew profit by 2%, an excellent result given the challenging operating environment. In tobacco logistics, price increases and cost-saving initiatives have benefited results, offsetting cigarette volume declines. In non-tobacco logistics, our pharma business improved sales by gaining share and expanding direct distribution, and our lottery business grew by adding new points of sale.</p>
          <p>Our closing adjusted net debt for the year was &#xA3;8.8 billion. Working capital increased by &#xA3;500 million, reflecting the unwinding of a timing difference in our Italian logistics business and strategic decisions we've taken to support growth such as extending our leaf durations and investing in our sales agenda.</p>
          <p>Cash remains a priority, and following last year's working capital investments, we'll continue to actively manage our position. Net capital expenditure with &#xA3;303 million and is expected to be slightly higher next year, reflecting ongoing investment in capacity to meet demand in growth segments and to continue building our innovation pipeline. Tax and interest was &#xA3;200 million lower than last year, while dividends and buybacks combined were &#xA3;0.4 billion higher, as we increased returns to shareholders. The net impact of foreign exchange and other cash flows on net debt was minimal. The appendices contain further details on our debt maturities.</p>
          <p>If I step back from the detail of these results, what stands out for me is how well the business is delivering. Alison's highlighted how the strategy's delivering &#x2013; driving revenue growth across the portfolio, how we're building total tobacco brands to drive quality growth. Our revenue performance is equally encouraging from a footprint perspective. We generate 91% of group revenues from the EU and the Rest of World region, and we grew those revenues by 6% in the year; an excellent result at any time but even more so given the economic backdrop in some markets. And yes, the U.S.A. has been a driver on the group's overall performance, but we're implementing a plan to strengthen the business with encouraging initial results. Next year will have its challenges like any other, but we're moving forward from a very strong base, which brings me to 2013 where the focus remains on building momentum across our regions.</p>
          <p>First quarter trading last year was impacted by market weakness in Spain and trade destocking in Ukraine. Our overall volumes were down 7% but adjusting for these factors they were down less than 4%. The difficult conditions in Spain persist, and although trade destocking in Ukraine was a one-time event, there's ongoing weakness in the market. As a result, Spain and Ukraine will continue to have some impact on us in the first quarter of 2013. However, underlying momentum remains strong and we expect further good performances across our portfolio in the year. Despite weakness in the EU operating environment, we see many opportunities to continue growing revenues and profits.</p>
          <p>The action we're taking in the USA should deliver a turnaround in performance and there are significant growth opportunities for us in our Rest of World region. Our key strategic brands are delivering excellent results in these markets, and we'll be building on this strong momentum by continuing to grow shares and volumes.</p>
          <p>I'd like to close my section with a few words about our focus on value creation. We drive our business to maximize shareholder returns. Since 2010, we've nearly doubled cash returns to shareholders, up 95% to &#xA3;1.5 billion, by growing dividends and through our ongoing share buyback program. We'll be building on this and we'll continue growing dividends per share ahead of earnings per share.</p>
          <p>Thank you. I'll now hand you back to Alison.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Before I wrap up, I'd just like to spend a few minutes on how we see regulation. There's a lot of noise on regulation, particularly out of the EU, that drives a perception that developed market like the EU are the real drivers of regulation. But that's a very simplistic view. The countries that tend to take the lead on regulation are show here on the slide. Most of them aren't the EU and we have a comparatively low exposure to these markets.</p>
          <p>The news flow surrounding regulatory issues can also create a perception of rapid change. But again, the reality is somewhat different. The actual progress of extreme regulation is on the whole slow. For example, if I look at display bans, on average only two countries a year have introduced bans over the last decade, and the potential progress of plain packaging is likely to be even slower, as the legal hurdles are considerably more complex to overcome.</p>
          <p>Whilst we're clearly concerned about plain packaging on a point of principle and particularly the impact it will have on illicit trade, we don't believe it will have any real impact on consumption levels. Extreme regulation like display bans hasn't really reduced smoking incidence, and we don't believe plain packaging will either. We know how important the brand experience is to consumers and don't see this changing in a plain pack environment. Consumers will still want branded reassurance regardless of the pack.</p>
          <p>We'll continue engaging with governments and regulators to seek balanced, rational solutions, and won't shy away from challenging disproportionate regulatory proposals. And we have a strong track record of growth in an environment of ongoing regulation. Given our strategic focus, we're confident in our ability to build on this going forward.</p>
          <p>I began today by talking about the change that's been driven through the business over the past two years. It's involved making choices, and I believe we've made the right choices to deliver long-term growth. We've put consumers at the forefront of everything we do and applied that to a portfolio that offers consumers unrivaled choice. Our strategic approach to maximizing the potential of our portfolio is delivering sustainable results. We're building total tobacco brands and consumer experiences that are delivering high-quality growth across our market, and there's more to come.</p>
          <p>Our footprint priorities are clear. We'll be further driving revenue and profit growth in the EU, strengthening our position in the USA and targeting the significant growth opportunities we have in our Rest of World region. Our success is down to the things that set us apart; our total tobacco expertise, our approach to consumer insights, and the motivation of our people and the values that bind them. These are unique to Imperial and that gives us broad opportunities for future growth, to build on the momentum we're generating, to deliver long-term sustainable return to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Thank you. We'll now take any questions you may have. As usual, the presentation is being recorded, so please can you wait for the microphone and give your name and organization before asking your question.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon Leinster, UBS; couple of questions if I may. First of all, given you're splitting out the US operations, is that now considered core or strategic? And do you think the turnaround will actually see an improvement in profits next year? And secondly on &#x2013; you mentioned obviously the &#xA3;200 million increase in A&amp;P this year and mentioned there'll be further investments next year. Can you give a sort of quantum as to how much that would be and whether you think A&amp;P as a percentage of sales will be increasing again next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It's interesting. As I was watching Bob presenting that, I was anticipating this question. We split the US out in both sections to give you a feel for how the balance of the business is performing. Am I feeding back here? I am; aren't I? You're right now. How the balance of the business is performing if you take out &#x2013; sorry for the pun, the drag of the US on the business.</p>
          <p>We're clearly not giving up on the US. We've got very clear strategies in place. We've got some very successful test work that's being done on pricing in 4 states, which we've now rolled out to 19, and we've got ambition to absolutely turn that business around over the course of the next year. But we're really trying to be helpful to get people to understand, if you look at it from an EU, Rest of World dynamic where you can maybe see some more comparative growth rate to some of our competitors in the industry in the international arena, quite how we're performing. So, it wasn't meant to try and sideline the States in that chart. Also John, just make a couple of words on the progress we're making on the States, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:59) opportune moment to do so. You need a mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Yes, we've made considerable progress in the US in the last number of months or in this year in 2012. At the half-year results we presented to you that we've put in place new management with a new Regional Director.</p>
          <p>We've also made a lot of changes in the management team underneath, and importantly, in the structures that support that management team in the US. As already presented, we're really taking a state-by-state approach, which is quite different for us in having had a strategy across the United States, and that state-by-state approach is leading to a very different pricing strategy but also a very different customer engagement strategy.</p>
          <p>What you've seen is providing early, good progress in terms of our market share, which we fully expect to be able to continue going forward. And there's more to come from a portfolio and from an innovation perspective, not just in cigarettes but also on the mass market cigar business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think that also helps you to get a feel for what's happening with that investment money. And your question highlights the point that I was keen to avoid, which is a small &#x2013; a &#xA3;200 million in A&amp;P.</p>
          <p>Bob mentioned there are three aspects here that we're supporting our portfolio with. Yes, there is some uplift in A&amp;P; there's also increased investment going into the product, so into quality, into innovation, those initiatives that I was highlighting during the presentation; and also into people effectively, either further sales forces in certain markets, further marketing capabilities in the business. So, it's a range of investments we're putting into the business and you can also see the slight uplift in capital investment this year as well, which we see going forward.</p>
          <p>So, that investment is not just A&amp;P. There has been an increase. But as you can see from the model that we demonstrated earlier, we're putting this money behind high margin growth initiatives. So, the additional 26% investment we put into our key strategic brands delivered 13% net brand contribution growth for those brands last year. So, this isn't putting A&amp;P out there and hoping it might return something maybe in five years' time. This is very disciplined investment behind brand growth and we've done that within the overall delivery of our group margin of 42% this year.</p>
          <p>So, we're not looking at diluted activities here. And we will continue to do that going forward. I'm not putting a number on next year, but we will manage it as we've done this year through the way we've managed the total portfolio, we've managed the returns on the additional investment we've put in and the therefore ensure that we don't dilute margin.</p>
          <p>Well, go right. Let's go to the back. Adam?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Adam Spielman from Citi. Can I follow that up, on that precisely almost last sentence you said? Historically, Rest of World has always seen pretty good margin expansion. And this year, organic operating profit growth was slower than organic sales growth and hence margin declined. I just want to know, is that likely that for next couple of years we're going to see margins going down in that region as you invest behind these brands? So that's one question; and I suppose, on that why did it go down precisely? And then secondly, can you be a little bit more precise about your new pricing strategy in the United States? I mean, do you have a new price point? If so, what is it? Are you saying, in future we will always price below Altria in the States regardless? I mean I don't &#x2013; obviously, I don't know what it is, but can you just be precise on what that is and how we should think about that? And I guess the third question is, can you give us a figure for what you expect volume growth will be in this fiscal year coming up? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we're down the model? First of all, the Rest of World margin; I mean this is always going to be a difficult one to unbundle for you without giving you all the precise details of what's going on, because clearly what brands are growing is important within this. You've got a market mix perspective as well, so we're very successful in certain emerging markets as some people would like us to be, that would be dilutive to margin. So, there are various mix issues going on there. The focus from our products and portfolio growth though has very much been towards the higher end.</p>
          <p>So if you look at our Russian business, for example, in the last year, we've put investment behind that business and you can see the share so far hasn't moved significantly, but actually the quality of that share has improved significantly in terms of growth in Maxim, growth in Style, growth in Davidoff, growth in West in the last year. And therefore, the focus, I can assure, you is around quality volume growth in these markets, but you are bound to get at times a market mix impact there as you are more successful in a lower margin market, for example, than a higher margin market. But we look to balance that within our overall group numbers to make sure we don't have any significant dilution on group margin off the back of it. But that's one of the things we have to actively manage.</p>
          <p>If I look at the USA and pricing, we are very clear on what we're trying to do on price. We've done extensive modeling across the states and on a state-by-state basis. We've got conjoint modeling of pricing to look at where our brands need to be positioned to be successful. We're very clear on what we're doing in that regard. That's where the tax was focused on the four states to get that pricing right. That was successful. That's what we're rolling out. I'm not going to be any more specific than that. On the volume, at the moment we haven't got any further update in terms of the external guidance that's out there. We're quite comfortable with where the market is sitting at the moment, but we will look clearly to look for further growth opportunities if we can find them.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just come back on &#x2013; just to clarify that, on the Rest of World question, you said there is a bundle with different geographic mix. I guess, should we expect fiscal 2013 to look pretty much like fiscal 2012 with the same sort of geographic mix offsetting positive brand mix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think overall we're not looking at any significant shift in margins for next year. There might be a little bit as we invested it more in Rest of World. But overall I'd say we'll manage the total portfolio globally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps I could add to that as well. In terms of some of the detail behind it, there was also the timing of price increases. So if we actually look at the individual regions, we do &#x2013; we've all seen margin build in &#x2013; within just about every one of the regions; there was a slight lift in terms of the Ukraine, in terms of &#x2013; a slight impact on Eastern Europe. But also with pricing coming through second hand &#x2013; second-half margins were an improvement on the first half year margin, and the second-half margins were actually an improvement on the full-year &#x2013; therefore the full-year margin by definition.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Chris Wickham from Oriel Securities; just a couple of things. I was wondering perhaps you'd give us a bit more detail on where things are in Eastern Europe, because obviously we've seen quite a lot of bad stuff in the last couple of years in Southern Europe for different reasons. I mean you talked about a lot more counterfeit and a lot of volume going in that way. I was wondering what you can talk about, whether or not we're going to see quite a lot of bad stuff in that region in the next couple of years and if so, what can be done about it.</p>
          <p>And I was wondering if we can just go back to your earlier comments on regulation, where you had that sort of list of 10 countries. And obviously that list does not include the USA, which at times has been a bit of a difficult place, more from a litigation standpoint than regulatory, but clearly are showing signs of actually being much more focused on sort of scientific measures and things like that. And there's this scope for the US to become more important as an opinion former and something which should generate perhaps a more positive contagion than some of the countries on your list of 10.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm going to kick off with the two of our biggest markets in Eastern Europe, which is Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine clearly we've highlighted since the beginning of the year as being a market that's been difficult for us this year, first of all, because of the change in distributor arrangements and the de-stocking, but now what we're seeing in an overall softness in the market.</p>
          <p>And our forecasts for the market next year is still &#x2013; are still not very positive. It's still quite a significant decline for next year for the Ukraine. In that environment our share is off very slightly, but we're not really wanting in the Ukraine to partake in going really cheap in the market in order to try and combat illicit trade or combat what some of the competition are doing in the market. We're focused in the Ukraine over the last few years on really building a very &#x2013; much stronger value quality portfolio in that market, very successfully migrating our portfolio up from the lower price brands that have dominated it historically, and that's something we're looking to protect in this environment.</p>
          <p>So that's where our strategies sit. We're clearly still focused on profit in that market, but we want to maintain clearly the quality of the portfolio within that. But I think it's going to be another tough year for the Ukrainian market with an increase in illicit from both within its borders and other factors as well impacting that market.</p>
          <p>Russia, as I say, the portfolio is &#x2013; it's got some very strong performances within it currently. We're building on that. We've got very good ambitions for Russia for 2013. There's excise clearly in the wings, which the current levels we're looking at we think is very manageable. We're focused on dealing with that in our strategies for the year. There tends to be noise about potentially other higher excise increases. I think those have largely been killed at the moment, but that comes and goes in terms of noise. And clearly, there's a lot of regulatory proposals or plans as well in the market which will come into place over the next few years, but it's stuff we're very much used to managing. So I would suspect Russia next year, I don't see any specific huge impact in terms of the market size shifting. But clearly, we do have to watch out in terms of excise and how that develops in that market.</p>
          <p>Would you rather leave that afterwards or is that fairly, fairly &#x2013; fairly full on. So I think anyone? <mark type="ph" /> Mike (41:21), do you want to pick up on the USA and the regulations we see there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the simple answer to your question is that the US does have the potential to lead the regulatory approach globally. The issue currently is that it's frustratingly slow and now with &#x2013; the market is almost paralyzed currently because of the scientific approach that is being taken.</p>
          <p>So, on the one hand I absolutely applaud the approach; on the other hand, commercially it's causing a few issues. I think it's a welcome contrast to the quit or die philosophy that a lot of the regulators have, and the encouraging thing is the FDA is also talking to the industry. So, they are trying genuinely to come to the right sort of conclusions. I think it's slightly too early to say whether they are ultimately going to be a rational regulator. The signs are good. It's just taking a long time to get there currently. But I think they do have the potential to set the agenda globally.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Erik Bloomquist from Berenberg; two questions. Firstly with respect to products that are of reduced harm or reduced risk, can you update us on where Imperial is? We understand that you have a small stake in an e-cig company. How do you see that developing and can you update us on what you see Imperial doing in that area? Second question is with respect to the UK, brilliant growth there this year again; but how long can the UK consumer absorb those kinds of price increases and so how do you see that market developing? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You framed your first question from a perspective of reduced harm, reduced risk. I think the lens we are looking at all of this is from a consumer experience perspective. So, we're not looking at it from can we find different ways of delivering nicotine. That's not our strategic focus. What we're looking at is the consumer experience of tobacco products, the consumer experience of smoking, the ritual that's involved and how &#x2013; are there other things we can do building on our total tobacco portfolio that also provides consumers with new experiences.</p>
          <p>So, that's our approach. That's why we're looking at &#x2013; we've got this interest in an e-cigarette business that we're working with and looking at currently. And that's how we'll approach any other things that we look at and want to add to that portfolio. So that's our frame. It is from &#x2013; building on those consumer experiences, building on our total tobacco portfolio.</p>
          <p>If I look at the UK, you've seen a very significant price increase from us this year of &#xA3;0.25, so that's much higher than our historic norm. That was a decision we took because of the level of excise that the government has been taking recently. And we really felt that it was important to make sure that from a manufacturer perspective we were getting an increase as well. But we are managing our portfolio within that.</p>
          <p>So in the UK, the consumers still have a broad range of price points and opportunities, both within cigarette but also in fine cut as well. So, it's not always our intention to try and take very significant price increases, but given the volume impact of the excise increases in the market, we thought that was important this time around. But we're continually managing the portfolio. We're trying to move our heads away from thinking about the &#xA3;0.25 price increase to think about really the broad band of price offerings we're giving to consumers in the market, which we continue to do in the UK. We'll continue to build on that as well in the balance of this year with some plans that we have currently. Jon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Jon Fell from Deutsche Bank. Three things related to the investment in the sales agenda. So first of all, Alison <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:38), you mentioned that in that &#xA3;200 million there are basically three different types of things, you've got the products, investment in people and marketing capabilities, as well as A&amp;P. But if you lumped all those things together, could you give us some idea of what the percentage increase in all three of those things, &#xA3;200 million, would represent?</p>
          <p>Secondly, I remember that there was quite a big step-up post the Altadis transaction in your overall marketing. I forget whether it was 2008 and 2009. And this seems like a reasonable-sized step-up as well. So I know you don't want to quantify next year, but in terms of the impact it might have on group margins, do you think that the drag would be smaller next year or about the same from whatever incremental you do?</p>
          <p>And then finally, on cash flow, I just wonder if you could expand a bit more on what, in terms of working capital investment in the sales agenda means? And is that a one-off thing or are we going to see more of that next year as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, highly unusual to get three questions from you.</p>
          <p>The first one &#x2013; I think we might come back to you on the first one in terms of what we want to talk about in terms of the overall increases in the different areas. I mean the A&amp;P one's on the top of my head. It is ahead of our net revenue growth. The A&amp;P percentage growth is roughly 9%. But the other two I think we have to come back to you. That's not specifically in my head in terms of the overall percentage increase.</p>
          <p>You're right to look at it from a margin perspective, I think, in terms of the increase we put through next year. I think it's the best way of looking at it, rather than saying it's a chunk of money, because we're managing the investment to make sure we get the returns. I hope I demonstrated with that model I showed you earlier with the key strategic brands. So it's not just a question of putting investment in that may pay back sometime.</p>
          <p>And therefore I think the margins &#x2013; you can see where it's sitting this year, around the 42%. I think we're going to be managing around that sort of level next year as well. And clearly, we're not just putting money in next year. We're also looking at some opportunities as well to how we further fund that with some cost initiatives next year to help support that too. So that's a gross number, if you like, if I was to quote you a number I know that's in our plan for next year and not a net number, with some of the support we'll do some cost initiatives too behind it.</p>
          <p>And then, Bob, do you want to pick up on the cash flow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, cash flow. Essentially, I mentioned three elements in terms of cash flow. The working capital. The &#xA3;500 million. Order of magnitude, about &#xA3;100 million was actually the timing difference on logistics. There was price increase in Italy at the back end of last year, so that benefited last year to an extent, not this year.</p>
          <p>And the increase in leaf stock duration. And this is on strategic stock on certain of our products. It's not just we're increasing leaf stock, but we've <mark type="ph" /> taken these (48:35) for continuity of supply, were something to happen on those leaf types that are most critical to us. So we've extended that. That's a gain of roundabout another &#xA3;100 million. So that's -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Largely Davidoff...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's largely Davidoff. And then the remainder is effectively a working capital shift, some &#x2013; obviously, as you've seen the amount of activity that we've had at the back end of this year &#x2013; obviously before launching, you're going to need to do stock builds and other things, so that will vary.</p>
          <p>I think actually, if you stand back, so I don't see us doing a significant investment into working capital going forward. I can't talk about if there's an excise change on anything. Obviously, that change is the dynamic for the year-end because of the amount of cash that flows through the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>But if you stand back, <mark type="ph" /> consecutively (49:27) over the last four years, we took out &#xA3;1 billion of working capital. The following year we took out &#xA3;200 million of working capital. Last year was flat, and this year, we've taken a strategic decision on &#xA3;100 million, and there's been a bit of build, but that's despite four years of sales growth. So we're not doing too badly. We haven't lost the plot, honestly.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. James Bushnell here from Exane BNP Paribas. Two questions please.</p>
          <p>Firstly on your net revenue growth, you've said excluding the Americas this year it was plus 6%, the headline was plus 4%. Given you've said you have a turnaround plan for the US and you would hope it to get better, should we expect more than 4% next year? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>Second question, are you concerned about France? For the past few years now, cigarette prices have been rising above the rate of inflation. Is there a risk that this profit will stop growing in the next couple of years? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of the revenue growth &#x2013; the 6% I think is a really good result in terms of revenue growth for 90% of the business. As we've said, we want to address the US element of that.</p>
          <p>I'm not looking to try and shift forecast for next year currently, but we clearly do want to see good revenue momentum and volume momentum in the business. And I think what we're trying to demonstrate here is that, if we can sort the US out, clearly there are some good opportunities within our overall business momentum to really get revenue growing very successfully for us.</p>
          <p>If I pick on France, France has got lot going on. A lot of noise, as well. I mean, we saw a lot of activity on the shares &#x2013; I think it was early September &#x2013; after Le Figaro picked up an article that was a month old, talking about regulations in France and suddenly everybody knee-jerked, which is partly why I made the comments earlier around people have got to get their perception and reality aligned up a little bit on some of these things.</p>
          <p>I think in France for me &#x2013; total tobacco portfolio is really critical for us. And yes, there are pressures we see now in the market &#x2013; on the market size in France from a cigarette perspective. But overall, we don't expect the market to be down sort of 3% next year because I think fine cut will compensate for some of the cigarette weakness. And we've got to therefore keep pushing, in terms of the fine cut portfolio and playing the total tobacco portfolio in that market, which has been very successful for us in other EU markets that have similar dynamics.</p>
          <p>And we'll have the other 13 questions later? [laughter]</p>
          <p>And David, at that back. I though you hadn't turned up, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I know I was late, sorry. Swedish matches, rather a lot going on this morning.</p>
          <p>Just on the A&amp;P again, it feels like the last couple of years you talked about an uplift in A&amp;P, and it felt that maybe that was done, and then you weren't going to invest again, but we've seen another uplift. Is it getting &#x2013; is it more expensive to get the sales reaction that you're looking for, or are you accelerating the attempt to get that sales uplift? I just want to get a feel of whether you've kind of changed the phasing of that?</p>
          <p>And then just on the UK, just wondered whether you can talk about whether you've seen everyone play the game, in terms of following on pricing? JT seemed to have followed after a few weeks' delay. Have you seen everyone else play the game or is someone dragging their heels, which is making you discount a little bit on that gross price? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the A&amp;P point, I think previously, we'd said we're increasing A&amp;P in line with the increase in net revenue. That's where we've been. But I've always been at pains to point out that it's not just an A&amp;P game, and there are other things you can invest in, particularly in the tobacco space, that are important for getting sales growth moving.</p>
          <p>And those we've talked about, around the product &#x2013; and you can see that coming through in these numbers &#x2013; and also around overhead where we see sales force requirements, and then investments in marketing capabilities in the business, as well.</p>
          <p>So it's always been broader than just about the A&amp;P growth. I think the increase you've seen in A&amp;P this year is very much around the initiatives we've had happening, particularly at the back end of the year. You've now had some exposure &#x2013; hopefully a bit more today &#x2013; to Davidoff iD. You can pick up on that later, David, before you leave, if you've missed out on it beforehand, because that's been a key initiative for us.</p>
          <p>So I think the A&amp;P is very much around where we see the consumer opportunity and where we see what we need to do to support that. And that clearly varies by market, as well as depending on what opportunities we have from a marketing perspective. So it's not a policy decision as such. It's very much around the opportunities we see, and where we see the returns, then we'll invest behind it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other comment was the UK. In fact, we took a price increase in July. Effectively, everyone now has followed. There was a delay. They followed up to September. BAT has gone &#xA3;0.25 on everything apart from Pall Mall, which they've gone a &#xA3;0.19 &#x2013; they went up to &#xA3;0.20. Effectively the equivalent of &#xA3;0.21, a slight reduction compared to the &#xA3;0.25 on everything else.</p>
          <p>But &#x2013; and there was a delay inevitably. For those of you who bought shares on a weekly basis, you would have noticed, while we were price disadvantaged, we might have lost a little bit of share. But when prices get back into line, we will probably gain a little bit of share, to pre-answer that question.</p>

I mean I know you're not quantifying the uplift on A&amp;P, but would you say this year was a &#x2013; particularly back-end of it, I guess &#x2013; a high-launch period &#x2013; Davidoff iD is a part of that &#x2013; and then next year, there's less of that? Or in terms of what you're formulating for next year there is a very similar steady run rate of similar Davidoff iD developments? Just trying to get a feel for whether there was a phasing in the back end of this year.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I don't think that there was anything that shifted the needle significantly, because when you're talking pipeline sales, you're not talking huge volumes. So it's not as if it's going to significantly shift the needle, because we had a number of initiatives at the back end of the year.</p>
          <p>There are initiatives phased through this year. We have got things running into the first, second quarter. I don't think it's going to be quite so maybe backend-loaded as it was last year, because if you think about the cycle we've been running through, with the sales growth agenda where a lot of these things have been coming to fruition over the last 12 months, and then Davidoff iD particularly in the last quarter. So I don't think it'll maybe be as lumpy as that, shall we say. But we've got quite a lot of planned for next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. This is Fulvio Cazzol from Goldman Sachs. Just a couple of questions. Firstly on leaf, can you give us a bit of an indication what inflation was in 2012 and what you expect for 2013?</p>
          <p>And then secondly on the Altadis cost synergies, if I remember correctly, this should have been the last year where you benefited from incremental cost savings. Do you see any further potential cost savings initiatives to replace those as we go into 2013, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'll just take the cost point, and then I'll let Walter comment on the leaf inflation.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, you're right, we've now closed Berlin, so we've finished the whole program for Altadis finally. We absolutely keep our eye on cost and cost opportunities, and we continue to do that. It's part of the Imperial DNA. And we've got a number of opportunities this year. We're going to look to further progress.</p>
          <p>We need to cost-optimize is what I'd say, to make sure, if we want to fund further investment behind the growth, that we're making sure we're reallocating, putting our money in the right place in the business. So we have got a number of initiatives this year to look at making sure we can fund that top-line growth investment from other cost initiatives in the business, and we'll continue to do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I would just say that, in fact, in terms of the Altadis cost synergy, if I take a look at what's been done across the group as a whole, I mean I won't say Altadis cost synergies came through. There were more cost savings in other parts of the business than the Altadis cost synergies that we're talking about here.</p>

          <p>Walter, on leaf inflation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. My name is Walter Prinz. I'm in charge of manufacturing and leaf purchasing.</p>
          <p>In terms of the leaf cost, I think last year, we had a roughly 3% to 4% leaf inflation. Of course, we also have a lot of initiatives in place to mitigate this type of leaf inflation. For this fiscal year, we are looking in a similar area of 3% to 4%. So there are no big issues around the world.</p>
          <p>The only, I would say, pressure which comes on the leaf market is driven by China. More or less, the Chinese are buying more and more leaf in our areas, which is affecting the industry. So the total consumption, except China, is going down. So, the overall leaf market is more or less in balance. So there are no hiccups, which we had a couple of years ago. So, I think we are looking at a very stable environment.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Martin Deboo, Investec. A couple of questions on pricing. I guess the linking theme is how do you get the balance between pricing and volume right for the short and long term, as you've sort of touched on, Alison? One is...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you like the job?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. [laughter] When do I start? Right, on that bombshell, sorry.</p>
          <p>Fine cut &#x2013; price mix was 13%. It just seems like a big number. Is there some technical mix effect I've forgotten? Or I guess the question is, are you pushing that too hard and prejudicing your long-term share position?</p>
          <p>And just building on Eric's question about the UK, there was an article in The Grocer the other week by somebody, I can't remember who they were, suggesting that the tobacco industry was narrowing &#x2013; retailer margins in the UK on tobacco just aren't adequate. Clearly they have a vested interest. But in the sense that there's a profit pool in UK that's available to you, the retailer, the taxman, and you've got to get that balance right, in terms of your long-term availability, is there any danger you push things too far in the UK from the retailers' point of view, given display ban and all the other pressures that are on the industry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm looking out to see who wants to comment, but I'll comment first, which is &#x2013; I mean what would you expect retailers to say, as the first comment to that one. Clearly, there's always in every market, that's part of how you cut the profit pool up effectively &#x2013; how you divvy it up. And it will always be part of the negotiation with retailers.</p>
          <p>I think a lot of the noise is from the multiples, very often, in that regard, as well. And in reality, I think the independent trade is hugely important to us at Imperial in the UK, and is also I think a very critical channel as well going forward. Particularly if we're looking for &#x2013; at our agenda around advocacy and availability, the independent trade is hugely important for us.</p>
          <p>So yes, it's something we continue to manage, continue to look at as part of the profit share juggling equation, because clearly we need the retailers on side with our customer engagement agenda we have as one of our key sales growth drivers.</p>
          <p>Dave, if you want to add to that &#x2013; yes, I think that's broadly the point. This is &#x2013; it's a permanent tussle in most markets, in reality. I don't think there's any heightened concern in the UK around it. I think it is a comment in The Grocer.</p>
          <p>If I look at fine cut, we've had &#x2013; strategically, I think Bob showed you a great chart in the Runnymede awhile ago that showed you the overall profitability that we get from these brands, and how profitable it is for us on a global basis.</p>
          <p>There are clearly some markets that are higher-margin and some markets where we build positions as we've done in a number of Central European markets, as we did initially in Spain, which was from a lower margin base to build the segment, to build the consumer pull into the segment. And then we've been building margins off the back of that and also segmenting the market. We've done that quite successfully this year with Fairwind, for example, in Germany to make sure we can add to our growth potential.</p>
          <p>So we very much look at fine cut as something where we do want to make sure we build the profitability and maintain the profitability in that segment. And you'll see that when you look at some of our shares in fine cut is we are willing to cede some share, if we see it in the better interest of the overall profitability of the segment. But we'll use the same type of approach that we've used for cigarette, in that we'll find things to put underneath and to therefore rectify that share and hold that share position over time. But we do come from some very big share positions in a lot of markets because we've created the segment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing is you're actually looking &#x2013; and we quote volumes actually on a stick-equivalent basis. A significant growth area within fine cut is within make your own, and we have different levels of expansion of tobacco therefore for the &#x2013; and therefore, different excise payables.</p>
          <p>So what might appear on the &#x2013; and we are always guilty of talking about &#x2013; that is our price mix, not the consumer price mix. The consumer will probably be seeing flat or potentially even reduced pricing on something that's a positive price mix to us. So we tend to be guilty of stripping excise out of everything we talk about.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Robin Asquith with JPMorgan. Just a question about the uplift in the investment, the &#xA3;200 million. Perhaps I could aim this at the Head of Marketing.</p>
          <p>Just looking at how you see the benefit of this increased uplift, relative to other consumer sectors. So if you put &#xA3;200 million behind tobacco to get a certain amount, if you put &#xA3;200 million in a household products company perhaps, do you get a &#x2013; is it difficult &#x2013; more difficult to get the benefit in tobacco for any particular reasons or is it easier?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...the household goods bit on that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, it's not A&amp;P. It's a broad spectrum of investment I think that requires a bit more understanding as we don't do advertising, yes. We do invest in consumer experience and in consumer rituals. That's very important. The second important part, we are focusing this investment in our core assets. So the model that was shown here, that every incremental investment we're getting &#xA3;5 back, for every &#xA3;1 we're investing we're getting &#xA3;5 back, I must say this standalone is a very interesting investment to be done in very high margin categories and brands. Secondly, I would say, it's in the high end of the FMCG. I think very few brands or global brands in the world are growing at these rates with a return on investment &#xA3;1 to &#xA3;5. So, I think this is absolutely outstanding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, one aspect of tobacco I think is that because we've got various restrictions around what we can do, what's left with what we can do is actually far more measurable and far easier to track returns on than other things other FMCG companies can do. And I think from our perspective, with our investment discipline sort of served us well over a number of years, that's really coming through very strongly in what we're doing in applying that extra &#xA3;200 million behind the core brands in the business.</p>
          <p>I think I'm allowed two more, according to Gerry. Chas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi; Chas Manso from SocGen; two questions from me. First, the &#xA3;200 million; I mean that's 250 bps of sales. Could you tell us &#x2013; how much of that &#x2013; sorry, I'm going to start again. What costs have you cut in order to find that 250 bps to reinvest or has it been pure gross margin improvement from better pricing? And the second question is on the momentum in the EU, and clearly that has been getting progressively worse over the year and over the final quarter, so I guess we need to be factoring that in for the FY 2013. But seeing as you're not looking to move guidance at the moment, there must be some other area that's doing better than expected. And I was wondering what those better-than-expected areas are? Is it the UK and Americas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean first of all, the cost optimization that we've done to support the &#xA3;200 million growth, I mean it's lots and lots of it. I mean we did an extensive zero-based budgeting exercise across the group sales organization at the beginning of the year to really evaluate the returns that we were getting on the money we were applying to various initiatives on a very granular basis. And that involved a reallocation of funds in various parts of the business to make sure that we were putting our money in the right place. So, it really is lots and lots of little bits. It's not a question of we've just gone out and Walter saved another 20% on leaf bill last year or anything like that. It's not like that. It's just the cost discipline in all aspects of the business and always to make sure we're putting the money behind the right brands, the right initiatives in the business. So, that's &#x2013; I can't give you anymore granularity than that, I'm afraid. But it's lots of bits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think we actually &#x2013; and I was using the term, it's actually reinvestment. So, it's a question of tempo. So, it doesn't necessarily have to &#x2013; what it sometimes come from is for after-sales growth. You saw what's happening with the key strategic brands. Now, those are our high margin brands and therefore as they generate additional margin, we are able to invest incrementally. So, it's more &#x2013; there's reinvestment as well. You don't have to &#x2013; it's not a zero-sum game on that basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the market for next year, yes, I mean Spain is not going to be an easy market again next year. There are a number of markets that are going to continue to have pressures, particularly on cigarettes. But again, we see the fine cut growth opportunity in most markets in the EU continuing to increase over the next 12 months. So we'll keep playing the total tobacco portfolio, but as you can see also in the Rest of World we've got a lot of opportunities coming through there and we'll continue; it's Africa, Middle East, it's Eastern Europe and it's Asia Pacific for us. We've had a fantastic year, particularly in Asia Pacific this year, which we've got some big ambitions for, for next year. But it'll continue to be on those three regions where we really see the growth potential and particular for our key strategic brands; 14% growth in those key strategic brands in that region last year and we'll keep adding to that and we'll roll out as well. The model that you've seen so successful on those <mark type="ph" /> KFBs (01:09:29) and some other core heritage brands as well. So, you saw there Fine, for example, in Asia; you saw Bastos in Asia. We've got some other key brands there that we can &#x2013; we can &#x2013; we're going to start to work onto; Maxim in Russia, for example.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask about fine cut tobacco? Rogerio Fujimori from Credit Suisse. Just one quick question on fine cut tobacco and particularly the trends that I saw in the second half, Germany good, Spain, and basically the rate of decline seems to be moderating versus the big declines in recent years. Is it more A&amp;P spending or is something changing? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really around positioning the portfolio. And in Germany, we've done very well with the portfolio in terms of the share gains we're getting. I mentioned we added two &#x2013; that was Fairwind this year. Overall, make your own is where the growth segment is in Europe. And if I take Poland out of the equation because of this unusual tobacco issue that we've had, make your own has grown by 20% for us this year, which is a really great result. And it's really around getting the portfolio right in the market, using some of the technical expertise we have around &#x2013; our expansion technology produces a far better tobacco, and some of the consumers get involved with it. It's not something they just smoke. They get involved with the quality of the product. It's far better than any of our competitors. I think it's an area we do have real expertise in and we'll continue to leverage that with consumers to grow further in 2013.</p>
