          <p>Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter net income was $1.11 per share excluding $0.01 gain from the sale of workover rigs in Russia, up $0.02 sequentially and $0.19 above the same quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Oilfield Services Q4 activity growth was strong at 6.2% sequentially, helped by Artificial Lift and Completions product sales. In addition, there was increased third-party revenue on IPM projects. WesternGeco reported very strong multiclient sales; however, this was offset by the seasonal drop in the high margin Marine activity due to vessel transits and dry docks.</p>
          <p>Oilfield Services generated $1.5 billion in pre-tax operating income, up 30 million from the third quarter, but margins declined by 116 basis points to 28.2%. By area, Oilfield Services highlights were as follows. My comments are on sequential basis. North America pre-tax margin declined 151 basis points to 25.4% due to continued erosion of pressure pumping stimulation pricing in the U.S. land market and weather related operational restrictions in the Rockies. This was partly compensated by increased activity in Canada and a better quarter in the Gulf of Mexico with a gradual return of drilling rigs after last quarter's hurricane season.</p>
          <p>Latin America pre-tax margin was 158 basis points lower to reach 22.1%. Activity on margins improved in all GeoMarkets with the exception of the Mexico/Central America GeoMarket, where revenue increased but the impact of the flooding in Mexico project startup cost and increased third party revenue negatively impacted the overall Latin America margins.</p>
          <p>For ECA, the Europe/CIS/Africa area, the pre-tax margin declined 130 basis points to 27.9%, as Russia exhibited the seasonal slowdown at the beginning of the winter season of offshore Sakhalin. Strong activity was reported in the North Sea, Caspian and Continental Europe GeoMarkets.</p>
          <p>Middle East &amp; Asia pre-tax margin increased by 36 million, but in percentage terms declined by 65 basis points to 35%. Improvements were recorded in the Arabian GeoMarket with higher equipment sales and overall increased activity in both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The India GeoMarket benefited from strong deepwater exploration activity. And in Asia improvement in the China, Japan, Korea were offset by declines in the Thailand/Vietnam GeoMarket on reduced exploration.</p>
          <p>WesternGeco pre-tax income was $272 million with a sequential drop in margin by 452 basis points to 34.1%. Marine activity and margins dropped as a result of the seasonal repositioning of the fleet with increased transit time and dry docks. The reduction in Marine margins could not be compensated by the surge in multiclient sales.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate was 20.4%, slightly lower than last quarter reflecting the continued shift of activity from North America to the rest of the world. In 2008, we expect the effective tax rate to remain in the low 20s. However, there may be some quarterly volatility due to the geographic mix of activity.</p>
          <p>The earnings for the quarter included $33 million of expenses relating to stock-based compensation costs, in line with the previous quarter. We expect this expense for the full year 2008 to be approximately $108 million, a $44 million increase over 2007. At year-end, net debt was $1.9 billion, significant liquidity events during the quarter included $557 million for the stock buyback program, $984 million for CapEx including multiclient and $699 million for the Eastern Echo transaction.</p>
          <p>CapEx excluding $65 million of multiclient surveys capitalized was $919 million for the quarter, reaching 2.9 billion for total year 2007. CapEx for 2008 is expected to be $3.8 billion including $2.9 billion for Oilfield Services and $870 million for WesternGeco of which $365 million is for the vessels acquired through the Eastern Echo transactions.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we bought back 5.8 million shares for $557 million at an average price of $95.65. This brings the total share buyback under the 40 million shares repurchase program announced in April '06 to 29.9 million shares for $2.2 billion at an average price of $72.53 per share. The Board of Directors approved a 20% dividend increase, representing a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share reflecting the positive long-term outlook.</p>
          <p>And now, I turn the conference over to Andrew.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Simon. Good morning everybody. Schlumberger revenues in 2007 grew by 21% driven by strong demand for oilfield services, particularly in the overseas areas where year-on-year growth reached 31% in Middle East and Asia, 30% in Europe/CIS, Africa, 29% in Latin America. By contrast, North America remained essentially flat with 2006. All technologies showed double-digit improvement, with Drilling &amp; Measurements, Well Testing and Integrated Project Management recording the highest overall growth rates.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter strong sequential growth contributed significantly to this overall performance. However, the quarter's results were impacted by a number of events that resulted in less than satisfactory margins. These included a less favorable Oilfield Services revenue mix with lower pricing and well stimulation related activities on land in the United States, a number of exceptional and seasonal weather effects in the U.S., Mexico, the North Sea and Russia. The expensing of significant startup cost associated with the IPM, Mezosoico Alianza projects in Mexico, where the second half of 2007 saw Integrated Project Management mobilize and start 17 drilling rigs within the scope of these projects.</p>
          <p>An increased Marine utilization of the WesternGeco fleet through vessel transit and dry dock inspections that overweighed a sequential 83% increase in multiclient sales. However, with the exception of the pricing for well stimulation related activities on land in the U.S., these events were largely seasonal and do not reflect any change in the underlying trends.</p>
          <p>Looking at the quarter in more detail, the sequential growth of 3% in North America was led by the Canada GeoMarket with increased demand for Well Services and Wireline technologies. Activity partially recovered from the hurricane season in the U.S. Gulf Coast with higher demand for Wireline, Well Testing and Well Services activities, and SIS product sales were higher across the North America area.</p>
          <p>However, this largely positive performance was offset by continuing price erosion in well stimulation related activities in U.S. land GeoMarkets as well as by seasonal land access constraints in the west and lower activity in Alaska. In Latin America, sequential growth reached 9% overall and was seen in all GeoMarkets, primarily driven by IPM activities in Mexico and Central America, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela, Trinidad &amp; Tobago.</p>
          <p>Increased demand for Well Testing Technologies and higher Artificial Lift and Completions Systems product sales in Latin America South, together with increased Artificial Lift and Completions Systems products sales in Mexico, Central America and Peru, Colombia, Ecuador contributed to these results.</p>
          <p>In Europe, CIS and Africa, the sequential growth of 4% was driven by the North Sea GeoMarket with increased demand for Wireline and Well Services technologies, together with higher Artificial Lift Systems and SIS product sales. Greater demand for Drilling &amp; Measurements in the Caspian GeoMarket increased sales of Artificial Lift in North Russia, and high demand for Drilling &amp; Measurements, Well Services, and Well Testing in Continental Europe contributed to growth. Performance was partially offset by the usual seasonal slowdown in Sakhalin and continuing subdued activity in Nigeria.</p>
          <p>The Middle East &amp; Asia area recorded double-digit sequential growth of 10% as the Arabian GeoMarket saw high demand for Drilling &amp; Measurements and Wireline services, as well as higher Completions and Artificial Lift Systems and SIS product sales. Sequential growth was also driven by higher demand for exploration-related Drilling &amp; Measurements technologies and Artificial Lift Systems in Qatar. Increased demand for Drilling &amp; Measurements and Well Testing services in Japan &#x2013; China, Japan, Korea, and higher deepwater exploration-driven demand, for Wireline and Drilling &amp; Measurements technologies together with SIS product sales in India.</p>
          <p>Among Oilfield Services technologies both Well Services and Completions Systems made a significant progress during the quarter. New Well Services technologies including members of the Contact family of staged fracturing and completion services penetrated further into a number of key markets with a broad range of efficient and effective stimulation services. In North America, StimMAP and AbrasiFRAC technologies saw greater interest on activity where their respective abilities to place fracturing treatments more accurately and to treat all productive sands in a single operation led to increased production at lower cost.</p>
          <p>AbrasiFRAC technology was also deployed in Saudi Arabia for Saudi Aramco where coiled-tubing was used for a private treatment in a natural gas well to result in an increase of production tenfold.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere in Saudi Arabia, StageFRAC technology was evaluated on two natural gas wells, where improved production rates and increased estimates of ultimate recovery led the plants for further deployment in future horizontal gas wells.</p>
          <p>Completion system secured a significant contract for the Reslink ResFlow passive inflow completion technology in addition to increased sales in the quarter. This award followed tests by Saudi Aramco in both sandstone and carbonate reservoirs which showed excellent correlation between the production logging program and simulations developed by Saudi Aramco and Schlumberger. This success came just 12 months after the acquisition of Reslink by Schlumberger.</p>
          <p>At WesternGeco, full-year 2007 revenues increased 20% over 2006 while pre-tax operating income grew by 31%. Q-Technology revenues reached 1.14 billion, up 57% versus 2006. Overall, vessel utilization for the full year was 93%.</p>
          <p>The fourth quarter results however were hit by the seasonal effects of vessel transits and dry docks which led to lower overall vessel utilization and which was significant enough to outweigh the exceedingly strong sequential increase in multiclient sales which were up 83%.</p>
          <p>The strength of the seismic market, particularly in Marine led us to review our long-term plans for the fleet, and this led to our acquisition of Eastern Echo during the quarter. The six high-performance vessels on order offer high capacity and are ideally suited to the exploration and developed markets of the future. Our plans are to equip all six vessels with Q systems as the boats become available in 2009 and beyond.</p>
          <p>In another acquisition, we acquired an additional 5.5% in Framo Engineering taking our holding to a majority of 52.75%. A Norwegian-based company, Framo provides multiphase booster pumps, flow metering equipment and swivel stack systems, and is an important contributor to subsea engineering projects.</p>
          <p>Shorter term growth presents some more complex picture than the immediate past. Natural gas drilling in North America is not expected to vary greatly in the absence of any severe winter weather in the remaining two months. High utilization of the existing offshore rig fleet worldwide and limited new builds entering the market during the year will not only limit growth but will also make activity vulnerable to rig operating efficiency. However, growth in land activity outside North America will remain strong, while seismic exploration services worldwide will remain in high demand both on land and offshore as the industry gears up for the expanding exploration cycle.</p>
          <p>Within this context, technology that assists our customers in mitigating risk in exploration and development projects, increasing recovery factors and improving operational efficiency will remain at a premium.</p>
          <p>In the longer term however, current levels of drilling are increasingly insufficient to meaningfully slow decline rates, improve reservoir recovery or add sufficient new production capacity. The explosion in exploration licenses awarded in the last three years, the continual expansion of the number of new offshore rigs being ordered for delivery through and beyond the end of the decade, and the industry-wide, as well as our own plans to increase both CapEx and research and development spend are clear indicators of future growth. It is our view that only a global economic recession that lowers demand can flatten this trend.</p>
          <p>In line with this positive outlook, I am pleased to announce that the Board of Directors has increased the quarterly dividend for the fourth consecutive year. And I will now hand the call back to Malcolm.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, let's start with seismic here. And on the one hand, the rhetoric and the message with respect to seismic in terms of visibility of revenue growth and customer demand being extremely buoyant is encouraging. On the other hand, one would have expected that backlog would have been stronger quarter on quarter, and I am just curious as to what's going on, on that front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And why is your assumption of backlog is weaker Bill?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

          <p>Sorry, sorry, sorry. No, well, it's about the same as it was last year, and it depends what your bidding tactic is. If you look at the number of inquires to bid, there is no decline, in fact there is an increase.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, that I understand. Maybe asking the question differently, what percentage of your fleet is basically contracted into 2008?</p>

          <p>The available vessel months is probably, still available, booked vessel months is about 60%, available is about 40.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Switching gears to North America, Andrew, was the preponderance of the weakness quarter on quarter with regard to margins attributable to pressure pumping pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then going forward, if one assumes that, and no doubt, a sort of difficult question to answer, but I'm going to try it anyway, in terms of asking it. Assuming flattish drilling conditions in North America, relative to Q4 margins, what is a reasonable expectation for the evolution of margins as they unfold in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that's a very difficult question to answer, because we are now probably, have a reasonable outlook on what our portfolio is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are flat out at lower prices and therefore it's a question of how much operational efficiency and reasonable cost savings you can generate. But I don't, all I will say is, I don't think you will see another precipitous decline, I'll probably regret this, I don't think you will see another precipitous decline from now on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so with regard to the evolution of your cost cutting and rightsizing of the business, is that pretty much behind you?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, for the Eastern Hemisphere, margins were down, I understand the mobilization issues in Mexico impacting Latin America. I guess the first question is two parts; a) is there mobilization issues in Eastern Hemisphere markets in Q4, and b) how should we think about mobilization impacting margins as we go into Q1 and '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that the bulk of the, I don't think you should call it mobilization, it's startup costs rather than mobilization, Michael. I think that the bulk of it was in Mexico but we did also start up some projects in Russia. But on the scale of things, they were tiny compared to Mexico. And going forward, yes, we still have rigs to mobilize in Mexico in Q1. We haven't quite finished mobilizing those projects. So there will be some much lesser degree I think of startup cost in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So much more consistent with what we'd seen before Q4 in Mexico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then secondly, Andrew, if I think about the interpretations that are likely to come out of this conference call, perhaps you could maybe mitigate some of that concern and give us a few &#x2013; just a bottom line of what you think the key takeaways ought to be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the key takeaway is that as of today, worldwide, 93% of the jack-ups are utilized, 97% of the semi-submersibles are utilized, and 100% of the drill-ships are utilized. And the actual additions this year relative to the size of the total fleet are tiny, which means that offshore activity will be extremely vulnerable to rig moves, any dry docking, any &#x2013; anything that impacts the operational efficiency of the fleet. And therefore, as I've put in the comment, the scope to grow offshore in '08 is relatively limited. The scope to grow onshore is still fairly unlimited, but as we all know, mobilizing projects onshore takes a long time. You only have to look at the delays we have seen in some of the Eastern Hemisphere countries in the last year, to realize that the extent to which activity is going to increase is going to be good, but it's not going to be great.</p>
          <p>North America, I really don't think I have to make any more comments about. And then finally, if you look at the number of exploration licenses that have been let out in the last three years, all around the world, you have to believe that seismic is going to be very strong again. So overall, I see 2008 as a transition year into a cycle which is going to be dominated offshore, because I don't know whether you follow the numbers, but the number of offshore rigs on order in the last quarter of this year increased by 14. So, you know the, you have a huge wave of 160 offshore rigs for delivery from now through to 2011. So this, Michael, for me is the transition year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually I think that the strongest element of our portfolio in 2008, which uses a little bit of everything of what we do, is going to be IPM.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And then, the classic technologies will still, I think in, everything to do with DD-MWD-LWD, continue to be very strong, and Wireline will shift gradually towards more exploration, and Well Services, we will wait for a recovery in Canada and the U.S.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Just a follow-up on the last question, IPM becoming a driver in 2008. Does that mean that there will be some margin pressure, given that IPM tends to have a lot of third-party revenues booked, clearly it's good for cash flow, but as we model margins, they should maybe be a little bit lower, is that the right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, actually, Ole, we're going to do a study on that in the first quarter and decide how we disclose it to you. Because, as you rightly point out, as IPM grows, it becomes a significant portion. And if you remember, once before we did actually tell you what revenues were at that level. So let us do a study, and if we think it's really material information, we will make a disclosure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that would be helpful, I think. Also looking at your CapEx for the oilfield, in '06 it was 50% up, in '07 we grew by half that, and in '08 you are guiding to about half of that growth again. Does that sort of reflect that your business is becoming more mature or is it a low point in '08, is 13% really sustainable to justify the kind of growth you've been posting for the past few years?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that there was an awful lot of catch-up in the previous few years. And actually seismic is increasing hugely, and it will be even higher in '09. And the other segments, it's quite difficult to sort of make a balance at this point in time, but there could be a re-acceleration in '09.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great, good morning. Thank you. Andrew, question I have for you is, you are parsing through your comments here, you talk about the complex near term, you obviously give one potential negative on North America, or negative on North America, potential on &#x2013; negative on offshore, and then two positives. Do you think in aggregate those, the positives completely offset the negatives, or is there a little bit more risk on the negative side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I'm trying to say that I still think that in the, while there will be extremely healthy growth outside North America, there is still a slight assumption that it's going to, maybe I'm wrong, but a lot of people are assuming that it's going to be a bit better than I think in 2008. It's a specifically 2008 event.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, the, you know, getting some kind of feedback from certain investors and clients about a perception of the margins peaking for your business, I think predicated on your outlook for exploration and technology, how would you counteract that argument that your margins have kind of peaked and they might not improve from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that I would say that, if &#x2013; the purely demand-led pricing has peaked. But as the cycle moves more towards exploration, complex offshore developments, there is no reason why we shouldn't see our margins reassert themselves.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would like to focus on your commentary in the press release, and I think you have said it several times here today, that shorter-term growth presents a more complex picture. Does that mean you think for the next couple of quarters we're actually slower sequentially, and if that's the case, does that, is that a domestic or an international or a seismic commentary or is it some combination of those?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, by slower, you mean negative, Dan?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's correct. Yeah, I mean are we...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the only risk of negative is still in North America. Internationally, the growth will be there, but it may be a bit slower than some people are assuming.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess my takeaway from the call is, basically you feel expectations are a little high, and so, over/under for revenue growth internationally, is 15% year over year, something like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I just think there are some people out there, not everybody, whose expectations for international growth are a little too bullish, Dan.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I would anticipate that's going to change after this call. The, I guess the other question I have is, as we look at....</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>I'm with you, okay. And then as it relates to North America, I will follow up with Malcolm just to try and understand the numbers, but I want to hear you say it, the other businesses, if we looked at Wireline or Directional or LWD et cetera, any softness in pricing or activity in those businesses or share for you guys?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so our planning assumption is that the famous coupling will not take place at least this year, and therefore any drop in OECD demand for oil and gas will be more than offset or will be countered by the increase in India, China and the Middle East to a point that it will not affect the oil price to a level where our customers will seriously curtail their plans.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>You guys are so careful with your outlook comments, and us simple-minded sell-siders are very focused on numbers. So obviously international growth is still good, not as good as last year, but it was really phenomenal last year, but we are still talking probably in the teens for overall international growth in '08, is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be a reasonable assumption.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I guess the big question is margin assumptions or incremental margin assumptions, right? So when you say that some people seem to be a little bit too bullish on their expectations, I guess, what I am reading into is there's some guys on consensus that seem to be a bit high, one of those came down this week, but are you concerned with overall expectations reflected in estimates in stock prices or just for the people that are kind of outliers right now?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>I'm concerned that generally the assumption on the level of international top-line growth is too high.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that I think is a fair assumption. Does that mean there will be degradation in overseas margins, I don't really think so. We obviously won't have the same capacity for incremental margins that we had at 30% growth when you are in the teens.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Is there, because margins swung from 32% to 38% or whatever they are doing, is there kind of an average margin that you guys think, or could you possibly give us a little bit better guidance for the future....</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very difficult, because it's almost impossible to understand what the margin is going to be until you know the nature of the multi-client sales you've made in the quarter.</p>

          <p>It's not so much Marine, it's &#x2013; I mean, Marine when you have transit or dry docks, you get hurt badly, because you can't cut cost for the two weeks you are in the dry dock or wherever it happens to be.

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. And then final question, the seismic, the vessel, the vessel move, I guess I was a little surprised because in Q2 we had moved a lot of things around, we had a lot of downtime. And then we hear about it again here in Q4. And did some markets soften up, so we had to move....</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, Dan, there is a summer market and a winter market. The summer market is a very high price market in the North Sea.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And the winter market is a lower price market on the coast of Africa and the Mediterranean, et cetera, et cetera.

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. A couple of different things I guess, coming back to some of the same questions, but just if you could help us understand in the US stimulation market, presumably the pricing has rolled over with respect to contracts, and that process would apply to more of your customer base in perhaps 1Q and 2Q; is there some additional pricing pressure that's offset perhaps by cost efficiencies and volume? Is that the right way to think about the stable outlook that you are presenting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I think the &#x2013; when I say that we know more about North America in 2008, I am saying that because we rolled over a fairly high percentage of our contracts already. And therefore, we have a better visibility of where we are going. And as you point out, the risks that remain are the prices at which we renew contracts that have not been renewed, and the efficiency of our cost containment measures.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. Just as a follow-up to that there is &#x2013; just curious about what pressure on recently renewed contracts you may be experiencing from your clients, just them coming back saying, hey, I hear pricing is continuing to drop, and what else can you do for me? Have you found any reopening like that?</p>

          <p>Thanks. Just wanted to touch base on international margins. You said they were somewhat stable or expecting them to be somewhat stable going forward, but in the fourth quarter we did see them trending down implying incremental margins were going to be a little bit lower; just what are the dynamics that allow margins to be stable in the international markets in '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I actually didn't say they would be stable, but the &#x2013; I tried to point out that the events in the fourth quarter that affected international margins were largely either seasonally weather related or related to the mobilization of startup costs with IPM projects. And therefore, with the exception of US land pressure pumping was somewhat exceptional in nature. So the question that I was asked earlier is, on revenue growth that is considerably lower than 2007, can you maintain margins overseas, and generally, I said yes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yet another question on North America; you have been somewhat negative for quite a while now, and that's obviously turned to be correct, now seeing some stability, but maybe reading too much into your comments as people often do, but what you seem to have kind of taken out of there is kind of a longer-term bullishness with respect to activity levels driven by decline rates out there. Do you think we have &#x2013; just by your actions at least, I am wondering if you think we've maybe turned the corner or created some kind of base level of production or maybe it's your concern about recession, but just wondering if that has changed?</p>

          <p>I think we are at a level that can probably sustain the current level of production for some time. So I don't think that's the case in Canada. So I think that '08 is a plateau year.

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Our analysts over there, they are projecting the major producers to increase spending by about 17% in '08, then moderating a bit in '09. And as the largest service company over there in Russia, would just like to hear your views on the spending growth rate over there particularly how you see that trending over the next couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that to fulfill their ambition of increasing production 2% a year I find that figure a little low, the 17%. I would anticipate that if they maintain their objective of increasing oil production by 2% a year, they will spend more.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now how linked do you think that is to the tax regime on the upstream companies? My understanding is that the tax regime is pretty onerous over there, so they are not really incentivized too much. Do you think &#x2013; what do you think the likelihood of that changing is, and do you think that's kind of the key to opening that market up a little bit further for you guys?</p>

And I think that the government will &#x2013; if it &#x2013; I think the government thoroughly understands that if it needs people to invest more it's going to have to raise that ceiling, and I suspect it will get raised.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and a different subject. You talked about a $5 billion backlog in IPM work. Considering that probably most of that's probably in Latin America, I assume you are already shifting capital down to that market like you have mentioned the startup costs. Just wondering if the Tupi discovery kind of changes your plans? I guess in other words, will you be shipping even more capital down to that market in advance of expected higher activity levels in that region?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that the Tupi discovery is not an IPM prospect, but in terms of the overall level of activity in Brazil, I suspect that given the delivery of new rigs it's far more an '09 phenomenon than an '08 phenomenon.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Andrew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Jim.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple of questions. First of all, Andrew, follow-up on the international E&amp;P spending outlook, and I am relating it back to my survey, but it shows growth in international spending of 16%. If you look at past years, where you've had a very high oil price environment typically beginning of the year budgets get revised upwards. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It seems to me we could be looking at the year of international spending growth, let's just say of 20% plus like we saw in 2007. I believe on the last call, you said that you would think that your revenues internationally would grow faster than the rate of international E&amp;P spending internationally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only distinction I would place on that Jim is whether that spending is on land or offshore. And to the extent that it is more to, if it was offshore, I would have no hesitation whatsoever in saying we would grow faster than the spend. But I fear a lot of it is on land in 2008 where, as you know, our revenue or the service intensity per rig is not the same.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you be disappointed if at the end of the year, looking at your revenue growth internationally, and it was in the teens, if your three major competitors on average all showed meaningfully higher international revenue growth? Now granted they are coming from smaller bases and I understand that, but, do you think that it's possible that you may grow at a meaningfully lower level than your three major competitors internationally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would be very, very disappointed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's good to hear. I would hope you would be. Just switching gears to a strategic question, would you be interested in buying relatively new US stimulation equipment on a reasonably sizable basis, and either moving that equipment internationally or consolidating it into your domestic fleet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I mean, a lot of the equipment that's been built in the US is not going to go international because it is not suitable. But no, I suspect for international, we would build our own. Small amounts of equipment that might become available in the US in distressed circumstances, we would certainly look at, and I stress, small.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. And my final question is, certain of your competition is alleging on recently very large IPM contracts in Mexico that you've been bidding very aggressively much less than on prior phases of that same contract and presumably at lower margins, because they are now certainly more interested in bidding on IPM work in that market. Comments on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would suspect I know exactly what bid you are talking about and I would just remind them that we have had an infrastructure in place for 10 years and therefore our cost of operation is probably much &#x2013; very different from theirs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How about though the relationship &#x2013; if I am pronouncing right it something like Chicontepec III, but relative to II which is comparable size that you're bidding something like $250 million less on the entire project?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To my knowledge there is no outstanding bid on Chicontepec at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay that's what I had. Thanks.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Next we will go line of Robin Shoemaker with Bear Stearns. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, just a couple of quick questions, just on &#x2013; I know you're going to do a study on the IPM issue, and can you just remind us now on your IPM projects, the range of revenues that come from third-party, which might be as low as X% and as high as Y%, just to give us a little bit of a sense there as what that number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm willing to say that it can be all the way from 10% to 50%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For example, we don't necessarily own the rigs we use and therefore we contract rigs from drilling contractors. And therefore obviously the whole rig rate would fall into third-party revenue when we put it on the customer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, sure. And Integrated Project Management as a percentage of your international revenue is, where kind of are we now looking at this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would &#x2013; I haven't actually calculated it for 2008, but we're somewhere in the &#x2013; between 10 and 15% I would say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just one question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Including the Schlumberger Services.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, 10 to 15%. One further question, on Eastern Echo as you acquired six vessels and we saw your, certainly your rationale reasoning for expanding the fleet. When you looked at the total vessel expansion, seismic vessel expansion, Eastern Echo plus others, did you come to the conclusion that there were not enough vessels overall being built to meet demand or how does that work out in terms of the total expansion of the seismic vessel fleet, given that we have found ourselves in the past with over capacity in this arena?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually we evaluated all the potential acquisition candidates in the seismic field, and there are two elements here, one is the number of vessels and the other is the time to market. And our calculation assumed that the price we pay for Eastern Echo, the price to complete the vessels and the availability of them would mean that the financial returns would be very satisfactory. So, we weren't actually thinking in terms of total market, we were thinking in terms of how we could expand our own fleet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and the total market size you expect to grow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are more and more confident that there will be no issues with Marine utilization in 2009 or 2010. And certainly I think the large players, ourselves and PGS and CGG, all have enough 20-year old vessels to mitigate the situation if that turned out not to be true.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And next we'll move to the line of Michael LaMotte with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Andrew. Quick follow-up, I just want to make sure that there is clarity on sort of this revenue and margin talk for '08. Clearly, on the international side, talking somewhere in the teens for revenue growth. On the issue of margin, I think when people think growth in IPM or a higher IPM mix, we think lower margin, that's not what you are saying, correct, year-on-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, what I'm saying Michael is that the degree of third-party revenue that we have from the IPM contracts is growing. And therefore, we are going to do an exercise to look at whether or not we disclose that to you every quarter in such a way that you can assume that that has a lower margin in the Schlumberger Services, and therefore you can make some adjustment. I mean I'm assuming that the Schlumberger Services, be they to IPM or anybody else, we can produce satisfactory margins in 2008 compared to 2007.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so, when we think of mid-teens....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Overseas sorry, overseas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So when we think of teens revenue growth, would that be including or ex IPM?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It would be including IPM.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Lastly, with the decelerated growth in international and capacity growth on a part of, a lot of your competitors in those markets, are you concerned at all about a capacity overshoot in this year of transition of '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that, as I tried to point out in the third quarter, capacity overshoots will be in local markets and not general. That's why, actually that's one of the reasons I used the word complex.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In other words, market intelligence is going to be very important in 2008.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Andrew, a couple of quick follow-up questions from before. In the press release you mentioned a three-year wireline logging contract for Petrobras, can you give us a feel for how much of their future business that encompasses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I hate getting into these discussions of individual contracts, but it's one of the largest contracts we have ever signed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so, with Tupi in line that would imply that it represents a fairly large share of their future business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yeah. I mean, I think the size of Schlumberger is such that it's not any one contract in any one country that is going to move the needle for you guys. But, in as much as there is a big expansion of Petrobras' offshore rig commitments in 2009, yes, it will turn out to be a very big contract. And it may or may not be Tupi, it may be other fields. I don't, I'm not actually aware what their drilling plan is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. And then another service you guys recently introduced or you have been doing some jobs with is the StimMAP LIVE service.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Real-time frac monitoring.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's got to be fairly small so far, but it's in an important play. Can you give us a feel for the growth potential of that technology and perhaps even leading to market share gains and stimulation for you guys?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that, so you're quite right to point out at the moment we have actually not a great deal of capability to do it real-time, because the difference here is the fact that you're doing it in real-time. And therefore you can have people monitoring the frac application and changing the job as they frac. So, it's more I think in function now in 2008 of how many crews we can field to do that. And I know there's a substantial increase, but it's coming up quite a low number. So, and will it improve the quality what we do and therefore allow us to capture market, yes, I suspect it will.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the last question before I turn it back, is coming back to the TGS-NOPEC joint venture in the Gulf of Mexico....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You guys are contributing the vessels, the Q-Technology, what is TGS bringing to the table, I'm a little bit unclear on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>TGS is bringing to the table the fact that they had a great deal of pre-commitment from customers for this survey, and the fact that they have a much larger sales force than we do. And it's &#x2013; as I said it's opportunistic, it makes sense to do it. It may &#x2013; it doesn't &#x2013; you shouldn't read anymore into it than that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And I will try to be quick. Andrew, I was a little surprised at the &#x2013; maybe the extent of the implied startup expenses on the two Mexican contracts, with IPM getting larger, is that something that we are going to need to factor in when we make our quarterly assessments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that if it's in a new area as the Mezosoico and Alianza contracts are, because they're in South Mexico, not in the North. And you &#x2013; we had &#x2013; we mobilized 17 large drilling rigs, they are not small, in six months, you can assume there are going to be start-up costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Or when you season out a large project, you should assume some degree of start-up cost, particularly if it's within an area where we're not already working.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then second, the seismic kind of quarterly earnings pattern, this is the first time in a while that 4Q was below 3Q, is that likely to be the pattern going forward with Marine becoming so important now relative to multi-client or is this just a...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, Kevin it's quite difficult to tell, because as I said earlier, what happened this year was the lot of the North Sea, the North Sea boats which normally move in Q3 actually moved in Q4. So I can't &#x2013; I wouldn't be able &#x2013; I can't give you an honest answer on that now. What we will do I think is give you better information going forward, when we know about dry docks and transiting. But we were caught by surprise by these late moves this year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, I guess one last thing which you probably won't answer, but on the contracts that you signed for stimulation in the U.S. '08 versus '07, is pricing down in the double-digits?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
