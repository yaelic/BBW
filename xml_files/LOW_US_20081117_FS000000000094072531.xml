      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. And thanks for your interest in Lowe's. Following my remarks, Larry Stone will review our operational performance, including what we're doing to manage the business in today's challenging environment. Then Bob Hull will review our financial results.</p>
          <p>The third quarter continued what has been a very difficult period for our industry. As many external factors weigh on home improvement sales. Our negative 5.9% comp for the quarter was within our guidance but short of what we hoped to deliver.</p>
          <p>Contributing to our results: hurricane preparation and recovery spending aided comps by an estimated 100 basis points in the quarter and, as we anticipated, outdoor categories benefited from more seasonable weather as we cycled last year's drought conditions in many parts of the US. In addition, in a tough sales environment we continue to gain market share, a function of our commitment to great service and our ability to capitalize on the evolving competitive landscape.</p>
          <p>But the pressures on the consumer have intensified over the past 90 days as unemployment has risen, equity markets have spiraled downward and concerns about the broader economy have grown. When combined with falling home prices driven by excess supply and weak demand and exacerbated by tight credit markets, it paints a challenging picture for consumers in the near term.</p>
          <p>Highlighting those challenges, and likely compounded by the distraction of the equity markets and interest in the election, we saw a slowdown in sales in the last week of October which has continued into the first two weeks of November.</p>
          <p>We continue to see the greatest sales weakness in bigger ticket discretionary products and the weakness is most pronounced in areas hardest hit by the housing slow-down. The bottom 20% of housing markets, those with the biggest home price declines, delivered double digit negative comps while the top 20% delivered nearly flat comps in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Although they're difficult to find, there are a few bright spots. It seems housing turnover is bottoming and September's housing numbers include the first year-over-year increase in the seasonally adjusted annual rate of existing home sales in almost three years and was driven in part by distressed sales of foreclosed homes.</p>
          <p>Estimates suggest that as many as one-third of September sales related to foreclosures. Based on data from our customer database, it appears purchasers of foreclosed properties spend similar to traditional existing home purchasers.</p>
          <p>In addition, energy prices have dropped dramatically in the last few months with the price of gas dropping nearly 50% from the peak just four months ago. Many other factors are impacting consumers today. We hope falling energy prices will provide a steadying influence on consumers' wallets and their confidence in the future.</p>
          <p>And a Lowe's specific bright spot; in October, Lowe's was named by JD Power as the number one appliance retailer in the U.S. for customer satisfaction measured on many attributes, including sales staff, installation and delivery service, store environment, product selection and price, this is clear evidence and just one example of how our stores are providing unmatched service and selection to capture market share.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, since the balance of the macro factors that impact our business remain weighted to the down side and at least in the near-term signs indicating consumers are retrenching further, we feel it's prudent to continue to take a cautious approach, plan conservatively and ensure we're well positioned to capitalize on opportunities as they develop. Despite the challenges of a weak demand environment our employees did a great job controlling costs and improving efficiency allowing us to deliver third quarter earnings per share of $0.33, which exceeded our guidance.</p>
          <p>It's these efficiency gains with a continued commitment to great service that ensure we'll be well positioned for an eventual improvement in demand. Our focus today is on the fundamentals of retailing. While we must always keep an eye on the future, now is not the time to stray from the basics of providing great service, great products and great value for consumers.</p>
          <p>As many economists are forecasting a recession, we're confident in our ability to continue to capture market share as weaker players struggle in the current environment. We're also hopeful that early signs of stabilizing housing turnover, an eventual loosening of credit in the mortgage markets and declines in fuel and commodity prices will lead to stabilization in demand for home improvement products. But regardless of the external environment, we continually strive to become more efficient and remain nimble enough to react appropriately in an uncertain environment.</p>
          <p>Finally, I'd like to congratulate Jimmy Johnson, Chad Knaus, Rick Hendrick and the entire team at Hendrick Motor Sports on winning their third consecutive NASCAR Sprint Cup championship, only the time in NASCAR history that the title has been won by the same driver three consecutive years.  Lowe's is proud to be partnered with such a great organization and have them represent the Lowe's brand each week on and off the track.</p>
          <p>Thanks again for your interest and I'll now turn it over to Larry Stone to provide a few more details on the quarter. Larry?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Robert, and good morning.</p>
          <p>As Robert mentioned, the broad based macro pressures weighing on the industry will continue into 2009. This morning I'll provide details on our third quarter results and discuss how we're managing through this challenging environment while balancing our focus on maximizing near-term results and driving long-term shareholder value. As expected, our third quarter results reflect tough sales environment. Only four of our product categories had positive comps for the quarter: building materials, outdoor power equipment, seasonal living and nursery.</p>
          <p>Our performance in building materials and outdoor power equipment was driven by demand for hurricane-related products, including asphalt roofing and generators. Thanks to our storm recovery team, we were able to quickly reopen stores in hurricane-affected areas and our best-in class distribution network ensured our stores were stocked and ready to assist customers with their cleanup and rebuilding efforts.</p>
          <p>Driving results in seasonal living were strong sales of pellet fuel and pellet stoves as consumers shifted towards alternative heating products in preparation for winter. Also solid sales in outdoor living products in our warmer year-round markets helped drive this positive comp.</p>
          <p>Nurseries performed well as homeowners continue to take on smaller projects that enhance their outdoor space. Easier comparisons from last year's drought in addition to strong demand for fountains and outdoor accessories helped deliver a positive comp for the quarter in this category.</p>
          <p>Other categories that performed above the company average include lawn and landscape products that also benefited from last year's drought as homeowners completed some of the fall lawn maintenance they put off last year. Above-average performance in hardware was driven by increased demand for flashlights and batteries in hurricane-impacted markets and reflects consumers' desire to make their home more energy efficient and minimize winter heating bills we had solid demand for air filters and programmable thermostats which helped rough plumbing perform above the company average.</p>
          <p>Despite the pressures weighing on consumers they still appear willing to complete smaller projects that maintain and beautify their homes. This is evidenced by the relative strength in our paint category, the number one DIY home improvement project. Additionally our lumber category performed better than the company average driven by solid demand for fencing in hurricane impacted areas.</p>
          <p>Despite the weak sales environment, our continual focus on inventory management resulted in a decrease in comp store inventory for the quarter. And, as we enter the fourth quarter, we are comfortable with our inventory levels.</p>
          <p>In August, on our second quarter call, we highlighted fact that outdoor products outperformed indoor products and aided our second quarter results. For this comparison we defined outdoor products to include not only nursery and lawn and landscape products but any product predominantly used outdoors. We anticipated this performance would continue as consumers seemed willing to take on smaller outdoor projects, but as the year unfolded we would see the typical seasonal shift away from these categories.</p>
          <p>Outdoor products out-comped indoor products by approximately 800 basis points in the third quarter but were approximately 30% of sales versus 40% of sales in the second quarter. This decline in mix of outdoor products contributed to our lower comps quarter-over-quarter. Importantly, while many of our product categories are comping negatively we maintained our long trend of market share gains.</p>
          <p>Looking at results on a regional basis we continue to see a wide range of comp performance as two regions achieved positive comps while eight regions had double digit negative comps. Positive comping areas include one region in the Ohio Valley and our region that includes Southern Texas and Houston. The solid sales performance we experienced last quarter in the Ohio Valley continued in the third quarter. This is an area that did not experience the overheated housing market that occurred in other regions of the country. Our southern Texas stores have performed very well for several quarters, but during the third quarter we experienced increased demand for hurricane-related products in these markets which resulted in the strong comp performance for the quarter.</p>
          <p>But the negatives far outweigh the positives. While there are recent signs that home price declines are bringing buyers back to the housing market, the pressures of some of the country's weakest housing markets are significantly impacting our sales in our Western Division as all four regions had double digit negative comps in the quarter. Our Florida regions improved slightly during the quarter but still posted double digit negative comps and two of our Northeast regions also had double digit negative comps in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Consumers in these regions remain pressured by weak housing markets but the recent volatility in the financial markets and the uncertainty leading up to the election appeared to have further impacted consumers' willingness to tackle home improvement projects. Driven by consumers' hesitancy to tackle bigger ticket discretionary projects, specialty sales performance in the quarter fell below the company average.</p>
          <p>Our whole house carpet installation promotion continues to resonate with consumers. However, during the quarter we saw demand soften in this product category. This contributed to installed sales performing below the company average.</p>
          <p>On the special order sales front we saw pronounced weakness in cabinets and countertops, fashion plumbing and lighting, leading to below-average comp performance for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Reflective of the macro pressures weighing on consumers on a regional basis, we saw our largest year-over-year declines in both installed sales and special order sales in the West and in Florida.</p>
          <p>Encouragingly, commercial business sales continued to post comps above the company average. Our focus on professional tradesperson, property maintenance professional and repair remodeler continues to drive solid sales results.</p>
          <p>Despite the external pressures weighing on the industry the promotion environment remains rational. We continue to use our rolling 18 month promotional calendar to support our marketing message that highlights basic home improvement projects that consumers are doing to maintain their homes.</p>
          <p>We have not wavered from our everyday low price strategy which we'll continue to emphasize going forward. And to further convey the value message many consumers are looking for today we'll continue to use our new lower price initiative as a tool to build traffic, transactions and ticket.</p>
          <p>Despite the soft demand for discretionary projects according to third-party estimates we increased unit market share in 13 of our 20 product categories in the third calendar quarter. This is a clear indication that customers continue to choose Lowe's for their home improvement needs.</p>
          <p>As I stated earlier, we anticipate the external pressures weighing on the industry and consumers will continue into 2009. We're navigating through these challenging times, cutting costs where we can while maintaining our commitment to deliver excellent customer service and drive profitable growth.</p>
          <p>In all sales environments, we're always working to identify ways to improve store productivity and operation efficiencies. Our flexible staffing model provides us with a tool to match sales hours so we have the right people at the right time doing the right job.</p>
          <p>During this challenging sales environment, we're making continual efforts to match hours to sales. However, driven by the soft sales environment, we deleveraged payroll by 81 basis points in the quarter.</p>
          <p>In conjunction with our cost control efforts we remain committed to providing great customer service. In fact, our third quarter customer focus scores showed customer service and satisfaction continues to improve, demonstrating that while we're reducing payroll to match lower sales we're also making the right decisions to ensure our stores are ready to serve customers.</p>
          <p>In tough times like we face today, we have a solid foundation on which to build and we remain focused on executing the basics better than anyone else. I'm confident we're making the right decision, focusing on the customer and driving efficiencies that position us to increase market share and maximize the opportunities in the marketplace. Being consumers' first choice for home improvement in every market is our driving goal as we manage the business for long-term success.</p>
          <p>Thanks for your attention. Now I'll turn the call over to Bob Hull to review our financial results. Bob?</p>

          <p>Thanks, Larry, and good morning everyone.</p>
          <p>Sales for the third quarter were $11.7 billion, which represents a 1.4 % increase over last year's third quarter. In Q3, total customer count increased 3.4% but average ticket decreased 2% to $65.64 cents. Year-to-date total sales increased 0.9% to $38.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Comp sales were negative 5.9% for the quarter which was within our guided range of negative 5 to 7%. Looking at monthly trends comps were negative 7.2% in August, negative 5% in September and negative 5.7% in October. For the quarter, comp transactions decreased 3.5% and comp average ticket decreased 2.3%. We estimate that hurricane-related sales positively impacted our third quarter comp sales by approximately 100 basis points. In addition, we believe that comps were positively impacted by approximately 50 basis points due to favorable comparisons with last year's drought-impacted third quarter.</p>
          <p>We experienced building material inflation in the quarter driven by roofing which had approximately 50 basis points positive impact on third quarter comps. With regard to product categories, the categories that performed above-average in the third quarter include lumber, building materials, rough plumbing, hardware, paint, nursery, seasonal living, outdoor power equipment and lawn and landscape products.</p>
          <p>From a regional perspective, eight of our 23 regions had double digit negative comps for the quarter. The double digit negative comp regions were in the West Coast, Northeast and Florida markets.</p>
          <p>Gross margin for the third quarter was 34% to sales and decreased 29 basis points from last year's third quarter. The decrease in gross margin was driven by a number of factors. The mix of items sold in the quarter had a negative 10-basis point impact on gross margin. Higher fuel prices increased cost of goods sold and negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 10 basis points.</p>
          <p>Deleverage on distribution fixed costs caused approximately nine basis points negative impact on gross margin in the quarter. Lastly, we review and reforecast our accrual for vendor programs on an ongoing basis. Based on current and projected sales trends we expect to achieve fewer volume rebate dollars than we originally predicted. The reversal of these accrued vendor volume rebates negative impacted Q3 margin by eight basis points.</p>
          <p>Slightly offsetting these items was positive impact of 10 basis points from lower inventory shrink. Year-to-date gross margin of 34.3% represents a decrease of 24 basis points over fiscal 2007.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A for Q3 was 23.2% of sales which deleveraged 160 basis points driven by store payroll, insurance, bonus, fixed expenses and credit.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, store payroll deleveraged 81 basis points driven by negative comps. In the quarter, we experienced 46 basis points of deleverage and insurance expense associated with comparisons to last year's self-insurance reserve adjustment for workers' compensation and general liability. However, this deleverage was less than approximately 100 basis points of deleverage that we expected as we continued to see favorable trends in this area.</p>
          <p>Bonus expense deleveraged by 36 basis points in the quarter as we achieved more performance targets this year versus missing many of our performance targets in 2007.</p>
          <p>In addition, rent, property taxes utilities and other fixed expenses deleveraged approximately 20 basis points due to the comp sales decline. Also, as expected, we did experience 11 basis points of deleverage related to proprietary credit due to higher losses than last year.</p>
          <p>This deleverage was offset slightly by leverage in in-store service and advertising expense in the quarter. Year-to-date SG&amp;A is 22.1% of sales and deleveraged 96 basis points to the first nine months of 2007.</p>
          <p>Store opening costs of $31 million leveraged nine basis points to last year as a percentage of sales. In the third quarter, we opened 39 new stores with no relocations. This compares to 40 new stores with no relocations in Q3 last year.</p>
          <p>Depreciation at 3.3% of sales totaled $385 million and deleveraged 35 basis points compared with last year's third quarter, primarily due to negative comp sales and the addition of 154 stores over the past 12 months.</p>
          <p>Earnings before interest and taxes or operating margin decreased 215 basis points to 7.2% of sales. Year-to-date operating margin of 9% represents a decrease of 153 basis points over the first nine months of 2007.</p>
          <p>Interest expense at $65 million deleveraged 13 basis points as a percentage of sales. This deleverage was caused by the additional expense associated with last year's bond deal and lower capitalized interest costs associated with fewer stores under construction.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, total expenses were 27.4% of sales and deleveraged 199 basis points. Pre-tax earnings for the quarter were 6.6% of sales. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.3% versus 37.6% for Q3 last year.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share of $0.33 for the quarter exceeded our guidance but decreased 23% versus last year's $0.43. For the first nine months of fiscal 2008, earnings per share of $1.38 were down 13% to 2007.</p>
          <p>Now, to a few items on the balance sheet, starting with assets; cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the quarter was $322 million. Our third quarter inventory balance of 8.3 billion increased 552 million or 7.1% versus Q3 last year. The increase was due to square footage growth of 10.2% from this time last year offset somewhat by 3.7% lower inventory in comp stores.</p>
          <p>Inventory turnover calculated by taking a trailing four quarters cost of sales divided by average inventory for the last five quarters was 3.98, a decrease of 12 basis points from Q3 2007.</p>
          <p>At the end of the third quarter, we owned 87% of our stores versus 86% at the end of the third quarter last year. Return on assets determined using a trailing four quarters earnings divided by average assets for the last five quarters decreased 275 basis points to 7.7%.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the liability section of the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with accounts payable of $4.8 billion which represents a 24% increase over Q3 last year. The increase is attributable to ongoing efforts to improve vendor payment terms and the timing of purchases in the quarter.</p>
          <p>We ended the quarter with $249 million of short-term borrowings. This was comprised of 189 million of Canadian debt to fund our expansion there and $60 million of commercial paper outstanding.</p>
          <p>During the depths of the credit crisis with our A1, P1 commercial paper rating we received daily indications from our banking partners that the commercial paper markets were available to us at reasonable rates. While we felt good about our financial position in Q3 we knew that we would need to access the commercial paper markets in the fourth quarter given the strain and uncertainty in the financial markets we decided to test the waters in Q3 and were able to confirm that the CP markets were available to us at attractive rates.</p>
          <p>Our debt to equity ratio was 29.7% compared to 35.1% for Q3 last year. Our leverage target remains 1.2 times lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR for the first three-quarters and due to the seasonality of our cash flows, 1.4 times at year-end. These targets were established based on our goal of maintaining a strong single A credit rating and an A1 P1 commercial paper rating which has proved to be prudent in this environment.</p>
          <p>At the end of the third quarter lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 1.35 times which exceeded our 1.2 times target for Q3.</p>
          <p>There were no share repurchases in the quarter and our outlook does not contemplate any share repurchases for 2008. We will continue to evaluate market conditions and diligently evaluate our options to balance financial flexibility against the opportunities presented in the market.</p>
          <p>Return on invested capital measured using a trailing four quarters earnings plus tax adjusted interest divided by average debt and equity for the last five quarters decreased 378 basis points for the quarter to 11.5%. Now, looking at the statement of cash flows, year-to-date cash flow from operations was $4.4 billion, an increase of 573 million or 15% over the first nine months of 2007.</p>
          <p>The strong cash flow from operations growth versus last year is driven by the growth in accounts payable I noted earlier. Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. There continues to be a great deal of uncertainty related to the financial markets, housing and the state of the consumer.</p>
          <p>In addition, we did see a slowing of sales trends beginning in the last week of October. These factors are contemplated in our outlook. We expect fourth quarter total sales to range from a decrease of 3% to an increase of 2%, which incorporates the opening of 33 to 38 new stores. Comp sales are estimated to decline 5 to 10% to last year.</p>
          <p>EBIT or operating margins for the fourth quarter is expected to decline by approximately 330 basis points to last year as a percentage of sales driven by expected store payroll deleverage of approximately 180 basis points as well as depreciation, fixed costs and gross margin. We're forecasting diluted earnings per share of $0.08 to $0.16, which represents a decrease of 41 to 71% compared to last year's $0.27.</p>
          <p>For 2008, we expect to open 115 to 120 stores resulting in an increase in square footage of seven to 8%. We're estimating a comp sales decrease of 6 to 7% and total sales to range from flat to last year to an increase of approximately 1%.</p>
          <p>For the fiscal year, we're anticipating an operating margin decrease of approximately 190 basis points driven by store payroll as well as depreciation, fixed costs and gross margins. We're forecasting an effective tax rate of 37.4% for 2008. As a result, we expect diluted earnings per share of $1.46 to $1.54 for the year. For the year we expect cash flow from operations to be approximately $4.4 billion, up about 2% over fiscal 2007.</p>
          <p>In addition, we forecast total capital expenditures of approximately $3.9 billion with roughly 300 million funded by operating leases, leaving cash CapEx of approximately 3.6 billion for 2008.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Bob, you had originally guided for the quarter EBIT margin to decline I think it was about 290 basis points.  You obviously came in better than that.  What were the major drivers there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Deb.  The main driver of the better than expected EBIT performance was insurance expense.  We had guided to roughly 100 basis points of deleverage in the third quarter cycling against a large self-insurance adjustment in Q3 of 2007.  We continued to see favorable trends in that area this year as a result we only had 46 basis points deleverage versus the expected 100 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then Robert, you had in your opening remarks talked about obviously the tight credit markets.  What are you doing to help your customers with regards to liquidity and also what kind of trends are you seeing with regards to credit card penetration etcetera in the store?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start and I'll let Bob follow up on it.  Our credit card penetration I think is down about 100 basis points from what we had seen previously.  We think part of that is obviously we talked in the second quarter conference call about the impact of stimulus checks coming in and consumers using that versus credit availability, and then also I think you have consumers more and more maybe moving towards the upper end of their credit line so they don't have open to buy.</p>
          <p>Certainly we did not &#x2013; in the more robust economic times we did not loosen our credit standards.  But certainly we have, or GE Capital has gone through a review and evaluation of our credit limits with under certain FICO scores have taken a look at that and on the lower end they have actually pulled down some credit limits some which we think is prudent in the current environment.  And I'll let Bob give a few more specifics on what we've done along those lines.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Robert.  Deb, as Robert indicated proprietary credit as a percentage of total was down about 100 basis points Q3 this year versus Q3 last year.  We also saw a similar reduction in credit cards.  So as a result we have seen a pickup in cash, check and debit card transactions year-over-year, again consistent with what we saw in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>As Robert indicated, we did &#x2013; GE came to us with some suggested changes in taking a look at the scoring.  They have increased the FICO cut-off score to extend credit to new applications as well as did reduce balances to some of those lower end FICO scores that did reduce the credit limits to the balances for a number of the consumers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot.  And good morning.  I'd like to focus on the guidance for the fourth quarter.  Based on the work that we did to kind of try to back into your implied fourth quarter EBIT guidance issued on the second quarter call, it would seem like you would have expected about a 200 basis point decline.  Now you're looking for something somewhat greater than that.  I'd like to know how much of that relates to the fact the sales band is wider, down 5 to 10, instead of down 5 to 7?</p>
          <p>And then specifically, is the vendor rebate issue a big issue for the fourth quarter and is the insurance line item that you cited in answering the prior question factoring into that movement at all?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure Matt.  This is Bob.  Certainly the drop in the sales guidance is the factor that contributes the lion's share of the greater than expected deleverage than you might have implied on the Q2 call.  Store payroll deleverage goes up 100 basis points entirely driven by the decrease in sales.  As you know, from a cyclical standpoint our Q4 is our lowest volume quarter and we're going to have our third straight year of negative comps in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The volume rebates we anticipate margin impact of five to 10 basis points in the fourth quarter so not dissimilar to what we saw in the third quarter.  Other items, we had about 10 basis points of advertising leverage in Q3.  That flips to about 10 basis points of deleverage in Q4.  Really just based on the timing of how the calendar was laid out for the year.  So those are the big drivers of really going from your number of 200 basis points of EBIT decline to roughly 330 as outlined in our guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's basically SG&amp;A rather than gross margin and it's primarily volume driven.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.  Gross margin might be slightly worse in Q4 than Q3 but nothing dramatic.  The lion's share of the change is in SG&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to follow up, doing the arithmetic on that it would then look like your expenses per store would essentially flatten out in order to get certainly to -- if you were to look at the lower end of your sales guidance &#x2013; to get to the low end of your earnings guidance your SG&amp;A per store would probably need to be essentially flat with last year having declined something like eight out of the past 10 quarters, do you feel like you still have more room in absolute terms to take SG&amp;A dollars out if sales remain difficult?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think there's still plenty of opportunity to reduce costs but we're going to do it in a prudent manner.  We're not going to sacrifice the Lowe's brand.  We're not going to sacrifice the relationship we have with consumers.  We do feel like there's a lot of things out there that we're looking at testing and studying regarding cost reduction but we're going to do it in a prudent manner.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and good morning. Could you really just aggregate your comp outlook in 4Q and compare it to 3Q? So how much of it is the trend? The minus 5 and minus 10, how much of that is the trend at the end of the quarter versus could you quantify how the seasonal shift, the mix of seasonal business changes in 4Q, how much that might pull your comp down for 4Q and also the factors that you mentioned previously on the drought, the hurricanes and so forth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure Chris, I'll start and let others add color as appropriate.  First, from an outdoor category perspective, Larry gave you the color around how that's defined, which is products primarily used for outdoor application.  That's roughly 30% of the mix of business in Q3 drops to 20% in Q4.  In addition, as I mentioned in my comments, we had about a 50-basis point benefit from drought impact in the third quarter.  We're expecting no impact in the fourth quarter.  And then finally the biggest result of the change in outlook is the slowing trends that started the last week of October.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, this is Robert Niblock, just a couple other things.  As we look to what we're comping up against from the fourth quarter of last year, our comps got more negative through the quarter.  So our easiest comparisons are ahead of us.  So certainly right now we're going up against our toughest comparisons from the year-ago period.  If you also layer on top of that the fact that the Thanksgiving holiday has shifted about a week.  So that delays the kick-off to the holiday selling season of holiday-related products.  So there's a little bit of a calendar shift there from that standpoint.  And then just as we mentioned in the comments, the disruption you saw around the interest in the election, everything that was going on in the financial markets caused an impact in our comps in the last week of October and into the first two weeks of November.</p>
          <p>So taking that all into account, we think it's appropriate to be cautious.  We think it's appropriate to give a wider range, because certainly we expect things to improve as the consumer moves back to normal as we get closer to that Thanksgiving key kick-off date for the Christmas and holiday selling season and as we get to easier comparisons.  But given that all of those are future items and there seems to have been more, much more negative than positive macro economic news coming out on a daily basis, we think it's prudent to be cautious.  Widen the range and adjust the other guidance -line items of guidance accordingly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So then just to check that math.  The drought benefit of 50 basis points, that goes away.  And then this outdoor seasonal mix, that's 80 basis points that comes in to a drag in 4Q; is that right?</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, gotcha.  And then from the expense perspective to follow up on previous questions how should we think about SG&amp;A dollar growth going forward?  You've been able to pull that down over time.  Are you getting to that point next year where it will get a lot more difficult and how should we think about the change in inflation and commodity costs and other wage costs going forward?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I'll provide the same answer I provided Matt.  We still think we're seeing a number of opportunities to reduce costs.  We're very active in a number of initiatives.  It's just very tough for those to be reflected when you're in a negative comp environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, it's Robert.  Certainly, things like if fuel prices continue to decline the cost of moving goods reduces fuel and commodity prices. That helps reduce our operating costs, certainly there's a big component of that in a lot of what our vendors manufacture.  So to the extent you continue to see that, you hope that some of the price increases that we have experienced over the past year to 18 months would lessen and in certain situations potentially start to reverse depending on the extent of those drops in fuel and commodity prices.</p>

          <p>Our next question will come from the line of Gregory Melich with Morgan Stanley.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, guys.  Two questions.  First, Bob, on the payables you said it was basically extending terms and also timing.  Could you get a little more specific on that given the importance of that payables growth to the cash flow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, the timing of purchases within the quarter did have an impact.  Later purchase in the quarter means you don't have the opportunity to pay for it.  When we think about forecasting year-end, we think payables will be up roughly 10% Q4 over Q4.  Inventory will be up 5 to 6%.  Again, that's driven by a 7 to 8% increase in square footage for the fourth quarter.  As a result, we're forecasting AP to inventory to be roughly 51% at year-end, which compares to roughly 49% for the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  And then the second question is you talked in the release and I think Robert you talked about as well or Larry, how the project sales have pretty much just gone away.  Can you give us something to put a number on that, like how many tickets you do or what percentage of your sales are on tickets above $1,000, just to get a sense of how close that actually is to being zero?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, we don't give out information of the sales by the ticket size but certainly the pressures in the third quarter really came in several areas, namely kitchen cabinets.  We had a really tough quarter on kitchen cabinet sales in the third quarter.  And certainly we had a couple things that we kicked off in the latter part of the third quarter on kitchen cabinets that did show some positive response in terms of sales.  But overall for the quarter those categories were down quite a bit.</p>
          <p>As you head into the fourth quarter, the large ticket installed items normally decline just due to seasonality.  We'll do carpet jobs up till next week and then carpet kind of levels out as a lot of people are trying to get ready for the holidays and the same with kitchen cabinets.  That business always declines in the fourth quarter compared to the other quarters.  But we're looking at all the different categories that we install.  Certainly as I mentioned in my comments, the whole house carpet installation programs worked well, our whole house blind installation programs worked well.  But you look at some of those ticket sizes, especially on blinds, they're not as large as a carpet job and certainly not as large as a whole house or a kitchen cabinet job.</p>
          <p>So we've got a lot of plans and programs in place and there again we just think that consumers right now are just kind of sitting back and kind of waiting to see how things play out before they tackle those larger projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, it's Robert Niblock.  Don't think that those large tickets, tickets over 500, $1,000, have completely dried up.  There are certain things that Larry talked about such as cabinets and countertops and those areas where the consumers pulled back kind of on the discretionary side of the home remodeling, home repair business.  But as we talked about in our overall comments, you look at outdoor power equipment.  A lot of that being storm-related response to better seasonal conditions this year versus last year's drought. You saw a substantial increase in big tickets in that category.  If you look at something like building materials driven by roofing, insulation and some of those other things we talked about you saw substantial increase in large ticket purchases in those areas.  So overall yes those large tickets are up.  It's being more impacted in kind of the those discretionary type purchases and major purchases.  Yeah, there are still customers out there that are putting in new kitchens but there are many of them that are also sitting on the sidelines and impacting those areas of the business.</p>

          <p>Just a follow-up from before.  Just to confirm these last three weeks, the first couple weeks in November, you're running below that five to 10 comp for the quarter?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  You commented that the gross margin expectation in 4Q is &#x2013; it sounds like similar perhaps a little worse than 3Q.  Can you just give more color within gross margin what you see going on in terms of costs from suppliers especially in an environment now where commodity and input costs are changing pretty meaningfully for them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eric, this is Larry Stone, I'll start and let Robert and Bob weigh in on it.  Certainly with the decrease in fuel prices we see costs have potentially started to come down.  But as we capitalize fuel costs into our inventory we have got to sell through those layers of higher cost.  So we really think it's probably going to be the first quarter of '09 before we start to get a lot of impact from that.</p>
          <p>But we've worked with our suppliers and pushed back on the increases we were getting 12, 18 months ago and certainly the decreases have started.  A lot of &#x2013; anything fuel-related you can certainly see it.  So we think there's a lot of opportunity as we head into next year if fuel prices continue where they're at or stabilize and we don't have that dramatic swing like we had back at the early part of this quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Maybe for Bob; the operating cash flow guidance for the year ticked down if I heard you correctly to 4.4 billion and that's kind of where you're trending, where you are year-to-date, actually.  So it looks like you're predicting a pretty de minimus level of operating flow level for the fourth quarter if I heard you right.  I was wondering if you could speak to that and then, secondly, if the &#x2013; your targeted leverage ratio which I think was 1.4 times, if that's what we should still be looking for for the year as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the cash flow, you're right, expected cash flow from operations in fourth quarter is roughly flat.  Two items impacting that; first decline in earnings of roughly $200 million; the second is as I mentioned earlier the timing of purchases.  So as the AP to inventory percentage flattens out from 58 to 51% Q3 to Q4, that's impacting the cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Second question regarding the debt target. Were you asking about where we're forecasting for year-end?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>It's actually right where we thought we'd be when we first planned the year, be about 1.6 times.  The only change is because we've done a relatively good job with working capital throughout the course of the year we were able to call the convertible debentures in the second quarter, otherwise a little bit worse earnings offset by lower debt because of the convert call.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, thanks a lot for taking my question. On the weakness you started to see in the last week of October and extending into November, what did the distribution look like from a markets perspective?  Was it most acute in the weak housing markets or did you start to see some of the other markets that had been holding up well decline suggesting that the macro economic concerns are starting to overweigh housing issues in other areas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, this is Larry Stone.  Basically the weakness that we found in the last couple weeks of October is pretty much across the whole US and I really think it had a lot to do with the election, upcoming election and with the fuel prices were finally starting to trickle down a little bit which was helping consumers.  I just think the uncertainty of the election and then the real impact of the financial markets, I think, had a lot of people kind of in a sit on the sidelines, see what's going to happen.  So I think those two issues had more to do with it than anything the last couple of weeks of October.</p>

You made a comment that you're seeing investment from buyers of foreclosed properties that were similar to what you see with non-foreclosed properties but are you also seeing &#x2013; what are you seeing in regards to the amount of investment that banks are willing to put in such that it might change the relationship between housing turnover and your comps moving forward?</p>

          <p>Michael this is Greg Bridgeford. We are seeing spend rates from the research that we've done into our customer transactions from the standpoint of a housing turnover related to a change of ownership from foreclosure, similar to a normal change of ownership spend post possession of the house.  We haven't been able to dive in and detect bank spend to fix up a house, for example, for sale.  But we can tell you that we've been tracking this for about nine months and we're trying to get a feel.  But right now our research tells us that the spend post possession of the house in a foreclosed situation in our markets seems to be a very similar spend to what we're finding from a normal turnover of housing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Two questions.  First for Larry.  Larry, hope you could speak a little bit more about the appliance category given that it is kind of one of the big ticket categories but has an interesting mix of both discretionary and nondiscretionary pieces in it.  So what have you seen in that category especially as you went into late October and November and how are you thinking about the promotional environment there?  Looking especially at some of your competitors, especially Sears.  So first question there for Larry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Colin, on the appliance category, we still had a pretty decent quarter overall in appliances.  We still gained according to third-party measures in terms of dollar share and unit share and draw rate versus the competition.  We think the fourth quarter, I mean so far we've not seen anything irrational in terms of advertising and so forth.  We think that our plans we have in place for the quarter are real solid.  As we always state all the time that we will react if things come out and certainly we've got our 10% price guarantee on the major appliances that we'll not only match the price but beat it by 10% if called to our attention.  But we think the fourth quarter should be pretty solid.  The weeks leading up to Thanksgiving are normally pretty good appliance weeks.  And then traditionally those purchases will tail off a little bit as you get near Christmas.</p>
          <p>But we think business is still pretty good out there.  The products like high efficiency laundry as we've talked about many times continue to gain share as consumers still will pay couple thousand bucks for a high efficiency washer and dryer.  So we think that ties into this whole thing about energy efficiency and at the same time the higher ticket purchases are driven by that.  So overall it's mixed but it's still pretty solid compared to the other parts of our business.</p>

          <p>Colin, we've looked very hard at what kind of impact we're seeing in the marketplace from a price perception standpoint for all of our competitors, and we are able to track it pre-campaign, campaign and post-campaign.  What we have not seen is a material change in price perception on the part of customers from the standpoint of any of our competitors' campaigns that have been run recently.  And that is as recent as a month ago.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then did you actually make any price changes in your own portfolio in response?</p>

          <p>Colin, this is Larry Stone.  Certainly we've had NLPs for the last five years.  And when the competition did come out with their program, our price shoppers looked at the markets and there's a few items that we did have to make adjustments on.  But there again it's a program that we've had in place for several years.  Consumers have reacted well to it.  But nothing that was out there that we had to overreact to.  I mean there's always items that are price shoppers going up and go down, so forth but nothing that really gave us a lot of heartburn on the new program that was announced by the competition.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey guys, Scott Ciccarelli. I guess I wanted to follow up a little bit similar to Colin's question.  Can you guys just talk about the competitive environment specifically your assessment regarding consolidation activity with the huge number of smaller players out there?  I know a lot of questions tend to focus specifically on your biggest competitor but I'm kind of curious what you guys are seeing in terms of the financial strain that must be occurring with all the other smaller players that are out there? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, it's Larry Stone.  I'll kick the question off.  There's a lot of publically traded companies that we can track and certainly there's some competition, Stock Lumber and 84 Lumber have announced quite a few closings, and that's really two companies that sell a lot to new home builders.  You kind of understand what's happening there.  We get a lot of field intelligence from our store managers in the various markets of smaller independents that are going out of business.  It could be a carpet store, an appliance store, a hardware store, lawn and garden shop or so forth.  But most of those companies are not publicly traded companies.  So it's all anecdotal information that we get from the field.  Greg Bridgeford compiles all this and we keep a running list of what's happening in each market.  So it really helps us to better understand the markets, what's taking place and helps us really understand the more opportunity we have and how we might want to mix differently in those markets to go after the business that's being left in the market by a competitor closing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Scott, this is Greg Bridgeford and if you look at &#x2013; I agree with what Larry said.  If you look at the trends we're seeing out there, it's that the businesses and Larry's right it is anecdotal, and it's a lot of information we're getting market by market on especially on local independents.  Businesses and entities associated with new residential market and businesses associated with large project sales, specialty dealers, we believe are under considerable strain right now.  And so as Larry said we take all that information in.  We understand what opportunities that affords us and the ability to be there for the customer during these times.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it fair to assume you've actually seen an acceleration in the process just given the anecdotal evidence you're hearing at the store level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think an acceleration, I think just a continual closing of smaller businesses as things continue to tighten up.  And quite frankly with the way things have been the last few weeks and so forth we think it will probably accelerate as we go into '09.  But as far as thinking that we can list all those different suppliers and so forth and come up with a hard fast number right now would be pretty tough to do.  But we do look at it on a weekly basis and really try to take into consideration the opportunity that presents for Lowe's in those markets.</p>

          <p>Scott, this is Robert Niblock.  I think when we &#x2013; the information we get back from our field organization, store managers about what they're seeing change in the competitive landscape in their market, you generally hear about more changes, closures, those types of things taking place in those areas that have been most heavily hit by the decline in housing prices.  So the California, the Floridas, the areas in the upper Midwest that have been &#x2013; that are heavily impacted by the automotive industry, you generally hear more entries coming back in as far as local competitors that are struggling, going out of business, liquidation sales, whatever the case may be.</p>
