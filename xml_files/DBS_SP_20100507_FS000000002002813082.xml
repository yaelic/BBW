          <p>Hi, good afternoon everyone. Welcome to our results, Quarterly Results media briefing. Today Sok Hui, our CFO, will kick-off today's session by giving you a brief overview of our financials. After this &#x2013; after Sok Hui speaks, Piyush will talk a little bit about our progress made on the priorities that Piyush last revealed when he met you in February. And thereafter we will have our Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>So without further ado, Sok Hui, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. We earned 532 million in the first quarter, up 17% from a year ago and 8% from the previous quarter. Operating trends remained strong. Revenues were higher and business volumes continue to grow across customer segments. Non-performing loans and allowance coverage improved. The overall performance was tempered by low interest rates and a normalizing credit environment, which reduced loan yields for certain products and dampened margins.</p>
          <p>Loan growth was more broad-based this quarter. Consumer lending activity remained healthy, as housing loans grew 6% in Singapore and 4% in Hong Kong from the previous quarter. Business loan growth, which had been weak for several quarters, rose 3% in Singapore and 1% in Hong Kong. We saw an increase in our market shares for housing loans Singapore and in Hong Kong, as well as business loans in Singapore.</p>
          <p>However, net interest income fell 5% from lower margins. Non-interest income fared strongly, rising 45% from the previous quarter as treasury income benefited from better trading conditions as well as customer flows. Fee income declined as investment banking revenue fell from the previous quarters' strong levels, but was higher than a year ago.</p>
          <p>Expenses were kept at the previous quarters' level. A rise in staff costs in line with revenue growth was offset by lower non-staff costs. We set aside additional allowances, mainly for existing for non-performing assets to the Middle East. At 97 basis points of loans, specific allowances remained higher than normalized levels, but were lower than the previous quarter. NPLs improved to 2.7% from 2.9% in December.</p>
          <p>Net interest margins declined from 2.02% in the previous quarter to 1.93%. Market interest rates reminded at historic lows during the quarter, while the credit environment normalized. These factors contributed to a reduction in yields on housing loans and trade finance loans.</p>
          <p>With housing loans remaining competitive, we have differentiated our products by offering longer-term fixed rate tenors. While yields on these fixed-rate loans are higher than floating-rate loans, they have proven popular as they offer customers greater visibility on their monthly repayments. This has enabled us to gain market share. The higher loan volumes have also alleviated the impact of margin pressures on interest income.</p>
          <p>Net fee income fell 5% from the previous quarter to 341 million as investment banking revenues declined. However, investment banking revenues remained healthy. They were up 59% from a year ago and the pipeline is strong. Contributions from other activity such as loan-related and trade and remittance activities remained strong.</p>
          <p>Other income rose to 306 million from 87 million in the previous quarter. Background market conditions as well as higher customer flows resulted in a three-fold increase in trading income to 230 million. Customer flows rose one-third from the previous quarter, and accounted for more than half of treasury non-interest income this quarter.</p>
          <p>Expenses were little changed from the previous quarter at 702 million. Staff costs rose but were offset by other expenses. The previous quarter had included seasonal costs such as year-end advertising and promotional activities, as well as higher accruals for technology projects.</p>
          <p>Hong Kong's earnings rose 41% from the previous quarter to 180 million as non-interest income, expenses, and allowances improved. Net interest income fell 6%. However, loans grew 2%, driven mainly by housing and corporate loans. Net interest margin narrowed 9 basis points to 1.8%, reflecting lower yields from corporate and housing loans. The disposal of higher-yielding securities also contributed to the lower margins.</p>
          <p>Non-interest income grew 31% from better trading opportunities, strong sales of treasury products, and gains from disposal of investment securities. Fees declined as investment banking and loan related income fell from fourth-quarter levels. Expenses declined 4%, resulting in a cost to income ratio of 40% from 45% in the previous quarter. Allowances fell 81% to 7 million as NPLs declined to 1.6% from 1.7% in the previous quarter. There were lower charges for new NPLs and higher writebacks from corporate repayment.</p>
          <p>Our non-performing loan rate improved from 2.9% at end December to 2.7% as a result of customer repayment. The NPL rate for all regions either improved or was stable from the previous quarter. Based on a prudent classification standard, 41% of assets recognized as non-performing are still current in principal and interest. The allowance coverage improved to 92% from 83%. If collateral was considered, the coverage rose from 108% to 119%.</p>
          <p>Our capital position strengthened with the addition of retained earnings and a reduction in risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 and total capital adequacy ratio of 13.4% and 17.1% respectively were comfortably above regulatory requirements.</p>
          <p>The Board declare a first-quarter dividend of $0.14 per share. The DBS script dividends scheme will be applicable to the dividend. New shares will be issued to shareholders who elect to receive the dividend in script at a price which is at a 5% discount to the average of the last sales price for DBS share on each of 20th, 21st and 24th May, 2010. DBS will maintain the frequency of its dividend payment for the first and second quarters of 2010. With effect from the second half of the year, DBS will move to semi-annual dividend payments. There are no other changes to DBS dividend payout policy.</p>
          <p>In summary, we have had a good start to the year. Business volume growth has become more broadbased with a strengthening economic upturn. Revenues are higher, even as interest rates remain at historical lows and the credit environment has normalized. Non-performing assets and allowances for the quarter have declined. Our allowance coverage remains healthy. We remain focused on executing on the strategy that Piyush has laid out. Together with our strong capital and liquidity, we are well positioned to capture opportunities across the region in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>Thank you. I will now hand you over to Piyush.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Sok Hui. I'm just going to carry on sitting here. I guess the &#x2013; the main thing I wanted to talk about is, I was mentioning to some of you outside, right? So I am a strong believer of the fact that banking is all about execution, right, and you sort of build a business brick-by-brick. It takes time to lay the foundations and build it brick-by-brick, so our focus has been very clear.</p>
          <p>We outlined nine priorities, and we are focused on moving the needle across each of these nine priorities. And if you look at a broad level, we've started seeing traction across several of those. As Sok Hui pointed out to you, we're actually quite pleased that, as you know, one of our biggest issues at DBS is, I call this the unbalanced balance sheet. We got this problem of surplus of swinging dollar deposits. And in the long term, the right answer to that is to balance our balance sheet better, right? To grow out our Singapore Dollar asset base. As I mentioned before, we don't want to do it by driving pricing down, because that would be a foolhardy. However, we do want to do it by leveraging our distribution, our points of presence, and our ability to create differentiated product in the market.</p>
          <p>And we're actually quite pleased with the progress we've made in the first quarter. Our overall loans for the Group grew about 3.5, 4 billion, but we made substantial progress in our Sing dollar loan book. Our market share in Sing dollar loans is beginning to climb quite clearly month after month for the last three, four months. And we're doing it principally because we're being able to distribute more through our branches.</p>
          <p>Our percentage of origination through the branch network is beginning to increase, and we are doing it because we're offering the longer tenor fixed-rate loans, the three- and five-year product, which we can do because of our deposit base. So that's been a positive. As you can see from this market share over the last four months or five months &#x2013; not just the mortgage loan but also the business loans in Singapore, has begun to go up, and to have 1 &#x2013; 0.1, 0.2% of market share growth in a quarter is actually very material. And if we keep this up we might hopefully get a percentage or so of market share growth in a year, and that's what allows you to actually start addressing the fundamental issue we have, of getting a better mix between our deposits and our loans in Singapore.</p>
          <p>But then before the other things which from a pure number standpoint I'm quite pleased about in the quarter, we started making progress with the second big thing we said we've got to do a better job on, which is cross-sell. So we've been very heavily loan driven in our revenue mix, and being able to diversify non-loan revenues is the other part of our Singapore franchise that we have to focus on.</p>
          <p>And frankly across the Group, our &#x2013; particularly in our treasury products, our improvement of our customer flows to our prop businesses has been very encouraging. We've started being able to refocus at a customer level, at a portfolio level, and both in the consumer side of the business and in the corporate side of the business we've started seeing a shift, in terms of the cross-sell from customer flow. So, we feel fairly good about that.</p>
          <p>Our overall performance in Hong Kong for the quarter was very strong. And so Hong Kong seems to us as clearly turned the corner, and we should be able to start seeing Hong Kong continue to contribute strongly to Group results. And so, as you know that was one of our priorities. We feel fairly good about the progress we've made on that front.</p>
          <p>Specifically, if you &#x2013; in the Singapore context, apart from the loan market share, the other piece that you wanted to do in Singapore is &#x2013; to go back to our priorities &#x2013; is to really create a dominant leadership position in the payments space. We've been able to do a few things in this quarter which again have been fairly encouraging. We launched our mobile banking offering two weeks ago maybe, two and two and a half weeks ago. And I'll be honest, our internal estimation was that we'd probably get to about 70,000 signed-on customers in a year, but we got 70,000 signed-on customers in two weeks. And so, to me this is just a very important reminder of how much not only is the shift happening anyways, but our ability to actually participate in the new way of banking is extremely powerful. So that's something we did do very good.</p>
          <p>We &#x2013; next, please. As you know, the other piece in Singapore have been focused on, we've really got to make the POSB network start contributing for us in a meaningful way. And to do that we really focused on to a couple of things, one we focused very hard on making sure that, as I said before, we improved the sales productivity of that network. So we don't have the data &#x2013; a chart here for you, but we're clearly beginning to originate more of our lending and our investments from that network. The other thing we focused on is to improve the service around the network, and again we've done that by doing a bunch of these things.</p>
          <p>We've actually put some more people into the process. We are expanding the opening of our POSB Express branches, we have about six of them, we are going to take them up by another four. Our mall branches are four which we opened full service, we are expanding that, we are going to do another four which are full service on Saturday up to 7:30 in the evening. So we are going to do that. We've figured out some obvious things we can do to change the process, for example putting up MySavings accounts on ATM cards, so that should be in place by the end of May.</p>
          <p>So a whole bunch of different things to improve the service quality of our peers, we think. We've pointed out before we've &#x2013; we had employed earlier 60 senior citizens to help with the service of the branches. We found that very productive, and so we doubled that. So we now have 120 of those. So a bunch of things that are on service.</p>
          <p>And then particularly around making sure we stay focused around the two segments that are important to us: the senior citizen segment and the children segment. So we did a few things to create product awareness and products catered to the senior market, like the Active Card. We also did some things focused on the kids' market. So we signed up with nine of the hospitals in Singapore to do a babies goodies bag; we did coin deposit boxes. But bottom line, we are trying to focus on both ends of the market which are important to us.</p>
          <p>We decided we're going to put some money against the ATM and our self-service machine network. As you know we've always had the largest network, but that notwithstanding we've had queues at several of our locations. So we are going to add another 100 ATMs in the course of the year, we did I think 16 so far in this quarter. We are trying to locate them, A, right next to the locations where we have a lot of ATM traffic, but also in the SMRP stations to be able to get a broader reach. So hopefully that should allow us to improve, again, service and throughput.</p>
          <p>Actually we also managed to just improve the uptime on our ATMs. Our uptime used to 98.5% in December and by doing some early diagnostics, we figured out a way to figure when an ATM is likely to go down, and so we sort of fix it before it goes down. So our uptime is up to 99.2% from 98.5, and that 0.7% of uptime means tens of thousands of customers will not be inconvenienced when they visit one of our ATMs as we go forward.</p>
          <p>Finally, we did a lot of stuff in Singapore. We did a lot of stuff around this whole customer-centricity that we talked about. We made progress in terms of voice and being able to manage as a multinational company, right? So this is one of the priorities we'd laid out, that we really have to put in place a framework to run a multi-country organization. So we've done &#x2013; we've actually worked on adding bench. So made some announcements in our private bank, some time ago, we've interchanged the leadership in our internal action services. We've actually added to our bench in our finance function and our consumer function. So we've actually started beefing and boosting up our bench strength in a lot of places.</p>
          <p>But perhaps equally important, we started putting in place a management framework which allows us to manage across countries in fairly standardized way. So we've cleaned our matrix organization with some very clear rules of management. We've &#x2013; are in the process of putting together very standard terms of reference reach for our country management forums and management committees.</p>
          <p>So the intent is, we manage in a simple way. But customers can get the same experience from us and expect the same experience from us in multiple countries as they deal with us across boundaries. And so bottom-line, if you go back to the nine things we say we focus on, we're going to focus on Singapore. I think we give us a check mark, I think we're making progress there. We said we would do stuff in Hong Kong. I think we have work to do, but I'm encouraged by the early results, partly because of the environment and stuff done before, not necessarily because of <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>We said we'd focus on the geographic mix of our businesses, I didn't talk about that. As in the last few quarters, in the first quarter our growths out of India, Indonesia, Taiwan, China, are very strong, and that clearly the organic shift of our business is happening, so that's something which is good. Actually we have got a taskforce working on it, so we still have work to do to build out a regional SME platform, and on the web. So item number four and five, we have started the groundwork; it will take some time for us to start seeing the results of that. And then as I said, on the customer experience we're making progress on the number eight, we are making good progress.</p>
          <p>Actually on our technology and infrastructure, we are interestingly making good progress there as well. We've &#x2013; our technology rollout of our standard system, we went live in Korea and we went live in India in this quarter. And so by the end of this year, we're pretty sure we should be able to go live in most of our markets ex-Singapore, Hong Kong. So I actually feel good about the progress we made on that one as well.</p>
          <p>So the intent of this only to give you some sense underlying the numbers. We are very focused on execution. We are focused on sticking to those nine points of the strategy. We are focused on actually working with the nuts and bolts to move the needle. And I thought it would be good to give you a sense of that, a sense of comfort that we are actually doing the things that it will take to start &#x2013; which we should be able to demonstrate in our financial results in the course of the year.</p>
          <p>Okay, so we're happy to take questions.</p>

          <p>Actually, our exposure &#x2013; our corporate exposures I think are as close to zero as they can. I don't think we have any exposure at all, frankly. Maybe the small incidental, but nothing &#x2013; and our markets-based exposures are also de minimis. We have almost nothing there of any consequence. I think we have some exposure to a bank in Spain, to the leading bank in Spain, but it's not material.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think for many months now, analysts attached to the bank also has been saying that in <mark type="inaudible" /> do very well, once the interest rate revert, go up, and there has been expectations that it should go up by the end of the year, but it looks like now with the situation in &#x2013; I mean, this fear of contagion. If interest rates don't rise by the end of the year, will you be in trouble with your yields and your interest margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I don't think we're in trouble. So just to categorize, how I would answer to it is yes, as we've always maintained because of our long Singapore dollar position, we're very vulnerable to the interest rate cycle, and we are very advantaged if the interest rate cycle starts moving up. Interestingly, because you know rates are going up around the region, I don't expect that to slow down. Australia has had how many ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Four.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...the fourth interest rate hike already, right. Malaysia tightened, India's tightened, China's had another, through the reserve thing, tightening thing. I don't expect any of the regional currencies to stop tightening, I expect that will continue. Unfortunately, we are principally impacted by the U.S. dollar rate, because the Sing dollar tends to be symptomatic with a move in synchronicity with the U.S. dollar. And yes, if the second shoe drops sort of if there is a broad contagion in Europe, it is possible that dollar rates start &#x2013; or stay low longer than expected. Right?</p>
          <p>So, my own bias was that dollar rates will go up in the second half of the year, and we were actually calling for 50 to 75 basis points, a rate hike by year-end. On balance, I think the U.S. economic situation still warrants staying tight, because if you look at fundamental demand in the U.S., core retail demand, it's outperforming. Frankly I was surprised, the savings rate in the U.S., after peaking at 6.7, is now back into the mid 2s, right? And you can see that. Retail sales are up, growth rates and GDP are up, and a zero interest rate policy, which is what the Fed has right now, is just not consistent with the growth rate and the level of retail and consumption demand in the U.S. So, my bias is still that rates are likely to go up.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we all know what's happening in Europe, right? And so, there is an unexpected set of events. So, what bearing that has on interest rates is difficult to call. But a long answer to your question; the bottom line is if rates don't go up, then it will take us longer for us to recover our income streams. That is correct.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Where do you see market spreads going? Your friend Ivibo during a recent briefing talked about how they would like to see better pricing for mortgages. So do you see mortgage spreads rising, and where is your &#x2013; what's your view also on the property market? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gabriel, if you had noticed in the last few weeks, spreads have already inched up in Singapore after they hit rock bottom in March, if you look through April and now in the last four to six weeks, spreads have been increasing. You could, in some pockets and some situations, get loans at SIBOR plus 50 or 70, by and large, in March. You could get up to 70; now loans are all up to SIBOR plus 100 basis points. So you already start to see &#x2013; and I think partly that's a reflection of the property price environment. So as property prices keep rising up, I think banks begin to start getting a little more cautious and start pricing the higher levels of property prices into the spread. So again, and I don't think it's going to go through the roof, but I think margins have already firmed up from their bottom.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, there are no further questions at this &#x2013; okay, Peter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter Hops from Data Bank. I wonder if you could give me some color on, I guess <mark type="inaudible" /> biggest contributor to net profit. With net interest income your biggest contributor to net profit, I wonder if you could talk about the low growth in loans? Of course we've seen OCBC talk about 12%. They've had a very strong year, I wonder if you could sort of reflect on the low loan growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually Peter, if you look at OCBC numbers, if you ex out their acquisition, the loan growth is not 12%. Their loan growth about in line with our loan growth. Our loan growth in Singapore actually, which has been a large part of our focus, is actually higher than OCBC, because I showed you the market share numbers, right? So, we've been growing loans faster than most people in the market. So actually in Singapore loans, I'm quite comfortable with where we are and the pace of loan growth that we're seeing. We are growing about 3% for the quarter, all right? And that puts us on track at low double-digit for the year, which is actually, given the nature and state of the market, not a bad place to be.</p>
          <p>So, the question is really outside of Singapore. OCBC had stronger loan growth in their markets around the region, principally Malaysia, Indonesia, which is where they are. As you know, our principal markets are Hong Kong, and Hong Kong loan growth has not been that robust. The Hong Kong property loan that we have &#x2013; all our loans have been flattish in Hong Kong. Right? And that reflects the nature of the Hong Kong market.</p>
          <p>As we go forward, our opportunities are to start building out our loans in the other countries, so India, China, Indonesia. And unfortunately, again in an organic way, it takes time to build that. Right? So with &#x2013; we can grow far in term of moving the needle on our entire 130 billion loan base. So the contribution of these countries, where it's beginning to be material, it still takes some time for it to move the needle on the entire loan base.</p>

          <p>On the wealth management side, you made this high profile hire recently, and there are some other changes that are happening. In terms of hiring and in terms of the overall business, what direction do you see, say this year? How many people do you want to add into the private bank, and generally, wealth management overall, how much do you think long-term should contribute to your overall earnings?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The wealth business &#x2013; and let me just start with that. When I say wealth management for &#x2013; we think of the wealth management business as a continuum between mass affluent and ultra-high net worth, or the high net worth. So, which means in our context, referring to the brands we have, Treasures, which we manage in the consumer bank, and the private bank, we really see as all part of one integral wealth management. We manage it in different places, as a lot of people do, from a branding and marketing standpoint.</p>
          <p>So the totality of the wealth management business, we believe, is going to be a critical part of what DBS is. That's why it's one of our &#x2013; if you go back to our nine priorities, we say there are really two regional business platforms we want to build out, our wealth management platform and our SME platform. And we think both of these will be a material part of our total income. I don't have a finite specific number on what percentage wealth management will contribute. But they will be a material part of our business, so we will focus on them.</p>
          <p>What we've done on both sides, on the Treasures side of the business, we really started already adding staff. Right? And so we expect to add several hundred people altogether in the bank, of which a large portion of it will be relationship managers in the mass affluent business, in the Treasures piece of the business. And that will be both in Singapore and around the region, which we've already started doing.</p>
          <p>On the private bank part of the business, it is likely that we will also add staff, but it is premature because we haven't got the leadership on board. And our high-profile hire only starts in July. And so, when the high-profile &#x2013; I come to say that we'll sit down collectively and come up with a plan and a blueprint on how we vision intend to grow that business. The underlying theme is, we hope to be able to run a common operating model which spans both Treasures and the private banks. So in the back office, middle office, we will try and drive for synergies and scale benefit. At the front-end, in terms of the products, the coverage model and servicing, we'll run different models. But yeah, we will invest in the business.</p>

          <p>It is. Well, it's a competitive business, but the good thing is, you know, this is a growing market. And remember, the wealth creation in Asia is one of the phenomenas of our time, right? There's more wealth being created in Asia today than you see historically anywhere in the world. There are more millionaires being created every day in our part of the world than anywhere else, and the wealth is <mark type="inaudible" /> it's a big market. And a rising tide carries all boats. So I just think that there's enough of a pie, and enough growth in the pie for everybody by and large to be able to prosper and grow.</p>
          <p>You've obviously got to have a competitive position and a competitive edge, and as I said before, we are advantaged because of the Singapore card. In Singapore, the Singapore cachet plays well in this market, and DBS has some obvious pedigree linkages which allow us to benefit in that space. We are also advantaged because we have a full suite of offerings. So we have a brokerage company, we have a strong presence in the thing asset management, we have a very strong treasury and markets business. So as we go to Hong Kong or to Taiwan, right, we're really known for being a very progressive bank, but that's because our capability to structure product for high-net-worth individuals is actually cutting edge, it's right up there with any of the global big boys, if you will.</p>
          <p>So based on our strength &#x2013; financial strength and our pedigree, based on our product suite and our product capability, and finally based on the fact that we really have a large customer base that we can move up the stream. Right, so in Singapore alone, you have 3.5, 4 million customers everybody who is rich has got an account with us somewhere. So, our ability to use our own data analytics and build that thing up is actually quite differentiated.</p>

          <p>Hi, Piyush. Could I get an outlook on the economic recovery? I mean, UOB just announced its results, and it says that the economic rebound could be volatile. They just reported 700 million of net.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the &#x2013; I think the economic recovery is in place, but uncertain. I mean, the events of the last couple of weeks in Europe are &#x2013; they stare you in the face. But there have always been some question marks about how robust is the recovery all around.</p>
          <p>I think by and large the Asian recovery has been strong. I have gone on record saying people who are sort of questioning the decoupling theory in Asia, I actually believe that the events of the last two years have borne out the fact that at a economic level &#x2013; not necessarily financial markets, but at a macroeconomic level &#x2013; Asia has indeed decoupled relatively from Europe and North America. Not entirely, because those are big important export markets for Asia. But in a relative sense, if you see the pace and shape of Asia's rebound, relative to the rebound in the U.S., it's quite stark. Right?</p>
          <p>And if you look at Asia's rebound, well some of it is obviously linked to the U.S. and Europe export market; a lot of it is to do with intra-Asia exports and consumption demand in Asia. And so, it just seems to me that Asia's recovery is likely to be more stable than global recovery, but even Asia is definitely impacted by what happens. So if there is a complete dropping of the other shoe in Europe, I'm sure Asia is not going to be able to continue at the same pace that it has so far.</p>

          <p>Hi, can I know what's your exposure in Thailand? And what are your views on the country? And then separate part would be in terms of the more outpayment for your dividends, is there a reason why it was changed? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, our exposure to Thailand is &#x2013; geez, I don't know the exposure of Thailand number of the top of my head, but again it's not a very material number. We have some Thai clients and there is some exposure, but it's not something which keeps me awake at night, in the context of what's happening over there.</p>
          <p>I think the situation in Thailand is &#x2013; I mean again, your guess is probably as good as mine. It's uncertain in terms of the politics of the situation. I have again said before, historically what has made me almost sanguine about Thailand 'til the last year or so is that the economics of Thailand seem to be de-linked from the politics, and so every couple of years there have been a change in government, but the economy has chugged along historically, and has been able to chug along.</p>
          <p>I think in the last couple of years, there is a greater degree of anxiety in investors, particularly in the markets, so it's less clear to me that the politics and economics can continue to stay that de-linked now and in the future. I think certainly there is a greater degree of disquiet and anxiety about the political situation, and my own guess is that 'til that doesn't stabilize, certainly from a point of view of incoming investments, my retirement might finding it to be a challenge.</p>

          <p>With Gabriel, I think the issue here is that in effect from the last quarter, we have initiated a script dividend scheme, which we would like to make available to all our shareholders. And to administer the scheme more effectively, we actually feel it makes more sense to revert semi-annual payments.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At the same time, I think we wanted to give our regional shareholder base some sort of advance notice, if you will, with regard to reverting to a semi-annual payments, and this is why for the first half of the year, we will still continue with quarterly dividends.</p>

          <p>All right. I think perhaps the last one or two questions. Alicia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I have two questions, both related to housing loans. Just now you said that the banks, as property prices rise continue to rise, banks are increasing their margins. Does that indicate that you're a bit discomforted by the strong property prices? Can you comment on your &#x2013; how you see the banks' exposure, given also the IMF report that Singapore's, 80% of all loans are going to property, and it's worrying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually I'm not worried about that, because if you look at Singapore's &#x2013; a large part of Singapore's property build which is HDB-related is actually very secure. So if you look at the history of Singapore mortgage and related property, there has been ups and downs like all cycles, but it's not been as volatile as some of the other countries in the region. In general, as I've said before, it's quite clear that there is exuberance in property and asset prices around the region, and that's true in China, that's true in Hong Kong, that's true in Singapore as well.</p>
          <p>And that has been fueled by very, very low interest rates. And a very low interest rate is then a lot of money -- actually it works both ways, it's cheaper to borrow to buy a place, and also your alternative investment opportunities are limited. So instead of getting this low rate in a bank you might as well go buy a property. It's in addition been influenced by inflows of moneys, all right? Because a lot of international flow is coming into the region. So I think it would be fair to say that there is clearly a increase in asset prices around the region.</p>
          <p>I think central banks have been ahead of the curve, in the sense they've been very conscious and go through frankly models of valuation and through specific loan-to-value policies in different markets. They've been trying to keep a handle on top of the process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. One last question. Hu La.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wondered if we could have an update on your exposure in China, because it's thought that China could slow down sharply, or worse. And how are you &#x2013; what's the risk management like and how <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, if you look at this unfortunately &#x2013; fortunately and unfortunately, it's a double-edged sword. Total China exposure on businesses are still not that huge. And so, we do have our exposures in the mortgage space, in the property space, but we've always tended to be conservative, so we are not at the leading edge of loan-to-values with the kind of financing we do. And frankly, we've been cautious over the last couple of quarters, in terms of the kind of lending we do in the mortgage space. Also, the regulator has been very focused in the last few quarters, they've been very focused about making sure end-user funds &#x2013; I guess the Chinese regulative process can be fairly granular, if you will, and they leverage that. So I don't see too much of an issue.</p>
          <p>The second part of the exposure is really in the SME space, so exposure to both customers from Hong Kong and Taiwan principally, who go up or not. And we do deal with those customers in that space. That space is the one which, if you wind up with a complete collapse of U.S. and Europe markets, that space is the one that tends to get hurt. Now fortunately or unfortunately, we took our lumps in that over the last couple of years. We saw provisions in the Hong Kong customer base a year ago that was really from that segment. So we think we've actually cleaned up a lot from where we were in the thing, so at this point in time we've done reviews of our portfolio but we think we are on top of it.</p>
