          <p>Please stand by. We're about to begin. Good day and welcome to today's Fourth Quarter 2009 Earnings Release Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. John Elicker, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Elicker.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us. The purpose of the call this morning is to review our fourth quarter results and outlook for 2010. With me today are Jim Cornelius, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Lamberto Andreotti, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Elliott Sigal, our Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer; and also for the first time Charlie Bancroft, Senior Vice President and our Acting CFO.</p>
          <p>Jim and Charlie will have prepared remarks and then Lamberto and Elliott will be here for Q&amp;A as well. I'll take care of the legal requirements first.</p>
          <p>During the call we'll make statements about the company's future plans and prospects including statements about our financial position, business strategy, research pipeline concerning product development and product potential that constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors including those discussed in the company's most recent annual report on 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. These documents are available from the SEC, the Bristol-Myers website or from Bristol-Myers Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>In addition, any forward-looking statements represent our estimates only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our estimates change. Jim?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. It was three years ago, January, 2007, when I first had the privilege of announcing and trying to explain results here at Bristol-Myers Squibb. I'm very pleased every quarter we've delivered on what we said we'd do. Fourth quarter this last year is no exception to that.</p>
          <p>Before reviewing our fourth quarter performance, which was very strong both strategically and operationally, I want to step back, highlight some of the key steps we took in 2009. The most recent in December we split off our remaining ownership in Mead Johnson Nutrition Company, making us a fully focused BioPharma company. As you know, this strategic decision and complex transaction was very well received and has created significant shareholder value in a tax-efficient way and lowered the number of Bristol-Myers Squibb shares outstanding as we go forward.</p>
          <p>Also of importance, we extended our ABILIFY agreement with Otsuka giving us 29 additional months of ABILIFY contribution to our sales and earnings. Just as a reminder, we expect that extension will be accretive by at least $0.30 per share in both 2013 and 2014 probably when we need it the most.</p>
          <p>We acquired Medarex, our largest pearl to date in our String of Pearls. In addition to full rights to the immuno-oncology compound ipilimumab we gain access to novel technology platforms, scientific knowledge and outstanding research people. We launched ONGLYZA in six countries including the U.S. and UK as we advance our robust innovation pipeline. The past year was truly transformational for Bristol-Myers Squibb. I can now say definitively that we've gone from becoming BioPharma to being BioPharma.</p>
          <p>With that as a background, let me turn to our fourth quarter results which capped a year of excellent execution across the company. In the fourth quarter our revenues grew 11%, or if I adjust those for the tail wind of foreign exchange, a 7% growth rate globally. And that's compared to the same period a year ago. Our key drivers, PLAVIX and ABILIFY, continue to have double-digit global growth. BARACLUDE, SPRYCEL and ORENCIA all grew 30% or more in the quarter, indicating how customers positively perceive the value of these recent launches. In our HIV portfolio REYATAZ and Sustiva franchise both had solid growth of nearly 20%.</p>
          <p>Along with top line growth we remain focused on executing our productivity initiatives and we are seeing improvements in our operating and pre-tax margins as well as in net income. Our non-GAAP operating margin improved by 300 basis points and our pre-tax margins are up over 200 basis points compared to a year ago. By executing at both the top and bottom-line for the fourth quarter, we realized an 18% increase in our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from the continuing operations. We also grew our full-year non-GAAP EPS from continuing operation by 24%.</p>
          <p>Financially, as you know, we've focused on cash flow management, and that is reflected by our year-end cash position of approximately 10 billion in cash and marketable securities which is competitive among our peer group. Translating that into net cash, that's a positive 3.5 billion and very strong. As a result, we continue to pursue acquisitions, licensing deals and partnerships through our String of Pearls strategy.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter we entered a global agreement with Alder for another pearl, ALD518, a promising monoclonal antibody for rheumatoid arthritis. You will also note from our press release that we are going to collaborate with our partners in Indianapolis, that is Eli Lilly and Company, to co-develop and co-commercialize what used to be called ImClone 11F8, a Phase III cancer compound. We hope to leverage our shared learnings working on ERBITUX to help bring this novel biologic to patients.</p>
          <p>A few weeks ago we submitted a filing to the FDA for a fixed dose combination of ONGLYZA plus metformin extended-release tablets. We believe this represents a future opportunity to further demonstrate the value of ONGLYZA. We're currently executing plans with our partners at AstraZeneca to improve ONGLYZA's growth trajectory. We're working to ensure patients and physicians understand ONGLYZA is an important treatment option for type 2 diabetics.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead in 2010 we're confident we can sustain our operational performance. We are providing a 2010 GAAP EPS guidance range of $1.94 to 2.04 and a non-GAAP EPS guidance range of 2.15 to 2.25 per share. Importantly, this guidance excludes the potential impact of comprehensive U.S. healthcare reform.</p>
          <p>On our near-term horizon, we have a May PDUFA date for our novel kidney transplantation biologic, Belatacept. We also expect to submit an application in the EU for the approval of Apixaban for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>Our R&amp;D continues to be very productive and is preparing our company for leadership in a number of areas, all unmet medical need. With strong operational results, disciplined financial management and a robust pipeline, we have what we need to execute our strategy.</p>
          <p>With that, I'm going to turn it over to Charlie Bancroft, our Acting CFO. Charlie, as you know, is a 25-year veteran of Bristol-Myers Squibb. He knows more than all of us combined. I welcome him to his first opportunity to address Wall Street. Charlie?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I will review our fourth quarter results and our 2010 guidance before we go to your questions.</p>
          <p>As Jim mentioned, we successfully completed the split-off of Mead Johnson during the fourth quarter. As a result, we are recording Mead Johnson as a discontinued operation. Therefore my comments will focus on our continuing operations or what is now solely our BioPharma business.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to report that our fourth quarter performance was strong. Non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations increased 18% versus last year. Solid operational performance reflected by sales growth in our BioPharma business, along with continued focus on productivity, resulted in yet another great quarter.</p>
          <p>The company posted fourth quarter net sales of 5 billion. Compared to last year this is an increase of 11% or 7% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Our fourth quarter net sales include a positive 3% impact from price and a 4% increase in volume. U.S. net sales grew 11% to 3.1 billion compared to last year, and internationally our net sales were 1.9 billion which represents an increase of 11% or 2% net of foreign exchange. Our underlying business is strong and we have had consistent sales growth this year.</p>
          <p>Let me walk you through some highlights of our products. In our Cardiovascular franchise PLAVIX sales were up 10% globally or 8% net of foreign exchange. In the U.S. our fourth quarter sales for PLAVIX were up 11% versus last year. This increase was driven by price and volume gains as prescription growth in the U.S. was up 4%. To date, Effient has had minimal impact on PLAVIX sales.</p>
          <p>At the end of December generic clopidogrel was available in 14 European countries and we have seen significant share and price erosion in certain markets, notably France and the UK. In our P&amp;L this is primarily reflected in equity net income of affiliates.</p>
          <p>In neuroscience ABILIFY worldwide sales were up 17% in the quarter or 15% ex-FX. About two-thirds of our sales growth in the U.S. comes from our indications for bipolar and major depressive disorder. Our strong clinical program for ABILIFY has led to the broadest set of indications for any atypical. As part of the extension agreement we signed in April last year, reported alliance revenue is lower by $16 million this quarter and that reflects the amortization of a $400 million up-front payment to Otsuka.</p>
          <p>Our virology portfolio has global sales of 21% versus prior year, and that's led by BARACLUDE, which was up 39%, the Sustiva franchise which was up 19% and REYATAZ which was up 18% or 13% net of FX. REYATAZ global sales growth is steady in the face of competition from new protease inhibitors launched in 2009. Nearly seven out of 10 new to treatment patients are prescribed either Sustiva or REYATAZ as part of their initial antiretroviral regiment. BARACLUDE global sales were 212 million in the quarter and BARACLUDE has market leadership in the EU, China and Japan.</p>
          <p>ORENCIA sales were 168 million in the fourth quarter. That's an increase of 30% or 28% excluding FX. In the U.S. ORENCIA sales grew 19%, and that was driven by an increase in total patients for ORENCIA although the market for IV patients was down slightly. We plan to submit the subcutaneous administration of ORENCIA later in 2010.</p>
          <p>In oncology ERBITUX sales in the U.S. were 163 million which is down 9% from prior year. ERBITUX sales in colorectal cancer have begun to stabilize despite a continued decline in the overall colorectal cancer marketplace.</p>
          <p>Sales in head and neck are down driven by a slowing market. Global SPRYCEL sales were 119 million. That's up 38% or 29% ex-FX. We expect to present the results from the SPRYCEL first line study later this year.</p>
          <p>And finishing with metabolics, ONGLYZA was approved in the U.S. in July and in Europe in October. We, along with our partners at AstraZeneca, have launched in the U.S., Mexico and several markets in the EU. We look to launch in a number of additional key markets in the near future.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter sales in the U.S. were impacted by stocking orders in the third quarter. We are making steady progress in our launch. Positive signs include improved access and reimbursement, an increase in brand awareness by physicians and positive trends in physician's intent to prescribe ONGLYZA.</p>
          <p>Now let me move to the rest of the P&amp;L. Our non-GAAP gross margin went down 110 basis points to 72.2% compared to fourth quarter 2008. Improvements in mix and productivity were more than offset by unfavorable foreign exchange hedging year-over-year. Full-year non-GAAP gross margin was up though 190 basis points to 73.3%. For the quarter we reduced our non-GAAP total SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales by 400 basis points from 31% a year ago to 27% in Q4 2009. And this is primarily reflecting our continued productivity efforts.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP R&amp;D expenses increased 10% to 935 million. R&amp;D as a percentage of sales was held relatively flat at 18.6% for the quarter. This was accomplished even with the investment in new pearls with Medarex having the biggest impact.</p>
          <p>Our effective overall company non-GAAP tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 15.7% for the fourth quarter compared to 13.4% in 2008. Remember, though, that our fourth quarter 2008 rate was favorably impacted by accounting for the full year R&amp;D tax credit in that quarter. The 2009 fourth quarter tax rate is lower than expected based on various items that in part impacted the total year rate but were only fully accounted for in the fourth quarter. We don't expect most of these items to carry forward into 2010.</p>
          <p>A few words on our cash, we continue our focus on cash flow and our employees have fully embraced this in our culture. We have excellent operating cash flows and continue to make great progress on working capital initiatives. This is clearly reflected by our full-year trade working capital improvement of over 800 million and that is against a good growth in our business.</p>
          <p>As Jim mentioned, we currently have $10 billion in cash and marketable securities and this provides us the financial flexibility we need to invest in potential business development opportunities to improve the company's earnings profile in 2012 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to guidance. Our 2010 GAAP EPS guidance is $1.94 to 2.04. That reflects expected milestone payments from existing partnerships and other specified items related to restructuring. Our 2010 non-GAAP EPS guidance from continuing operations is 2.15 to 2.25. This guidance excludes any potential impact of U.S. healthcare reform.</p>
          <p>The key assumptions for our 2010 non-GAAP guidance include revenue growth of mid single-digits. We expect gross margin to be relatively flat. A&amp;P should decrease in the mid to high single-digits. MS&amp;A should be relatively flat. We expect our investment in R&amp;D to be up in the mid to high single-digit range. And our full year effective tax rate should be in the 23 to 24% range. Now this assumes the extension of Subpart F in the R&amp;D tax credit in 2010.</p>
          <p>Let me close by restating what has been the case with our past several quarters. Our fourth quarter performance was solid. Strong sales growth with a continued focus on productivity resulted in an 18% increase in non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations. Across our organization we are dedicated to delivering our strategy and our commitments. Thank you.</p>
          <p>Now we're happy to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Charlie, and, Twen, I think we're ready to go to Q&amp;A. And just to remind everybody in addition to Jim and Charlie, both Lamberto and Elliott are available to take any questions you might have. Twen?</p>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> At this time we'll go ahead and take our first question from the line of David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks very much. Looking ahead I have a couple of questions. First, with respect to your upcoming analyst meeting on March 4, could you just characterize what type of long-term guidance you'll be providing just so we have a framework for what to expect on March 4?</p>
          <p>And then second, with respect to ipilimumab, Elliott, I was hoping that you would be able to comment on the outlook for the conclusion of the study? Obviously it's event-driven but I'm just trying to get my head around the notion that, while on the positive side it could be that the trial is taking longer to report because ipilimumab may be keeping melanoma patients alive longer,</p>
          <p>but on the other hand it might also make sense that the study could be halted early by the DSMB [Data Safety Monitoring Board] for ethical reasons if ipilimumab is substantially out-performing control. So if you could help frame that for us as well I'd appreciate it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David. This is John. Just a real quick comment on our meeting on March 4. I think the intent is to provide both a business and an R&amp;D overview and really at this point it's not, wouldn't be appropriate for us to go into any more detail than that. Elliott?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, David, this is Elliott, and the question was on ipilimumab, which we are excited about from the data we presented last year at ASCO [American Society of Clinical Oncology] as a very important pioneering effort in immuno-oncology and our first application we think could be in melanoma. The trial you referred to is O24, I believe, the survival study that is ongoing as first line in advanced melanoma and that is on top of standard of care, Dacarbazine. It's about 503 patients. The primarily end point's overall survival.</p>
          <p>Since it is event-driven to achieve the type of statistical significance we are hoping to achieve, I can't predict exactly. Our latest calculations are on average we may have the information internally in the fall. It could go into next year. It could be earlier in the summer. So the average is in the fall. We do have an independent DSMB. Their charter is one of safety. I don't expect necessarily an early determination. We do feel that we should run this study out to be very clear and characterize the effect of this agent.</p>
          <p>I will mention, however, that we have another survival study and this is in second line. And that is maturing earlier, and we will present that data, I believe, at ASCO this June. In addition, we have a Phase II study in lung that should mature in time for that. And at March 4 we'll outline our thinking about immuno-oncology and very different &#x2013; various opportunities in this area in addition to ipilimumab.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David. Twen, next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll go to our next question from the line of John Boris from Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the question. A specific question for Lamberto, when we look at all of the changes, Lamberto, that have gone on to the U.S. sales force model and the commercial model in particular on the GP side of the equation, it seems as though we're looking at materially flatter launch curves for new product opportunities. It seems maybe partly because of the more vigilant FDA and formularies seem to be somewhat difficult. But unlike most European countries it certainly does seem like the U.S. model is still a very attractive model from a pricing standpoint, but is this just a new era that we're in on the commercial model side? And how should we be thinking about products launched going forward here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is a very good question and obviously it is a question that we have been asking ourselves on a regular basis. I believe that there is good space for good products or unmet medical needs and the difference between what we had in the past and what we have now is probably the speed of the uptake is not where the products can. And I think that your question is also related to ONGLYZA and products could, if I might make a comment about ONGLYZA which is a good example of what we are talking about.</p>
          <p>I think we should not spend and nobody should spend too much time on the sales of ONGLYZA in 2009. This was what we consider the beginning of a long journey, a journey that we believe will be successful in a way that is in line with what I was describing before. Slower uptake than what we would have had with similar product but again ten years ago.</p>
          <p>There is still a big significant unmet medical need in diabetes. 40% of type 2 diabetes patients are not controlled on current therapy and ONGLYZA has a good efficacy and a good tolerability profile. So ONGLYZA and the other DPP-4's can help these patients. Despite the overall non-insulin anti-diabetic market remains flat in Q4 versus Q3 and despite this DPP-4 market grew only modestly at 3% we believe that the class, the DPP-4 class will grow and become a large and meaningful class.</p>
          <p>So we have a great product in that class and we are confident that we will deliver results with that drug. As a reminder the benefits, the clinical trial program has demonstrated that the benefits of ONGLYZA are there in achieving comprehensive glycemic control. So we believe that ONGLYZA in particular, not to give our DPP-4's in general, but ONGLYZA in particular will play an important role as a first add on to either metformin or SU.</p>
          <p>Now we have a number of key indicators that are encouraging. The brand awareness which is now over 65% and when we launched in the U.S. it was zero. And we had made a strategic decision at that moment, or until that moment, not to pre-market during the regulatory review. So we moved from zero then to 65% now. The number of physicians that are trying ONGLYZA continues to increase week over week, and those physicians who have prescribed ONGLYZA generally continue to prescribe. And one of the key focus areas that we have is to increase the number of physicians who try because when they try they continue. And we are make good progress in access to reimbursement with over 75% of target life covered and over 40% now in tier two.</p>
          <p>So in a world that is different than the world we knew 10 years ago, we are challenging our plans at all times. We are always identifying the opportunity, and we do it in a very flexible and aggressive way with AstraZeneca, new ways to optimize the marketing mix. And our goal is to drive awareness, try it and repeat. So going back to your more generic question, yes, the GP market in the U.S. is not the same market that we knew, but we believe that when you have a good product like this one in a good class with a big unmet medical need there is good space for growth. And AstraZeneca is totally convinced of the same.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. Next question, Twen, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll go to the line of Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. A couple questions for you. With Jean-Marc's surprise departure I'm wondering if Bristol still plans on sticking with the exact same String of Pearls approach? Or could we see Bristol change its approach to M&amp;A in any way? And on ipilimumab, when I think about how big that drug might be in the initial indication, I kind of come up with maybe a mid-sized product. And I'm wondering if you can help us think through how big you guys think that drug might be in the melanoma setting? And then a quick question on Belatacept, just your confidence level as you progress through regulatory review?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Tim, this is Jim. Elliott and I had started the String of Pearls long before I met Jean-Marc Huet. We'll miss him, but we have a guy with a different accent and 25 years of service so he, Jeremy Levin, the rest of our senior management team is as committed to the String of Pearls as we were three years ago. You know, we were trying to reconcile. We've either made a dozen pearls or ten, depends on how you count them. More importantly, the big ones like Medarex have really helped the overall strategy so that set of strategic activities continues. Elliot, or who's going to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lamberto, your comments on String of Pearls or size of market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, my comment on String of Pearls, I can only repeat what Jim just said. I mean, Jean-Marc was one of the team players behind String of Pearls but that's it, and we continue to be very committed. You know, take Medarex, that happened because of the interest and the passion of a lot of us and I think that it will be and we will be pleased with what is coming out and what will come out of Medarex.</p>
          <p>I think your second question was ipilimumab. I think ipilimumab is one of these important products that a manager like me who has been working in oncology for many years has been dreaming of handling in the marketplace. It is a great product for a very severe disease. We've almost nothing in terms of present standard of care, very, very inadequate standard of care. And if the clinical results are going to be there, we believe that there is a big space for that product in melanoma, in different stages of melanoma. And then there are the data that are coming out in lung and in other solid tumors and so we are all committed to ipilimumab and you will hear more about ipilimumab when we meet in March and later on.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Tim, you asked about Belatacept's regulatory review. We're heavily engaged with the FDA. At the same time we are preparing our submission in Europe. We're very active in the regulatory review and preparing for the advisory committee which has been announced to occur March 1. We expect advisory committees for all new molecular entities and the conversation will be on benefit, risk, as it commonly is. This is a novel immunosuppressant and we and the FDA both want to make sure that we have characterized both the benefits and the risk adequately and that we are approaching the market in the most appropriate way.</p>
          <p>So we will be discussing the benefits of what is needed in this area. Our goal is to replace calcineurin inhibitors where possible in order to achieve long-term improved renal function, graft and patient survival. That's the major medical need in this area. And the CNIs the standard of care are nephrotoxic and elevate risk factors in cardiovascular disease. We presented our one year data last year at May at the American Transplant Congress. You will, no doubt, see our two-year data at the advisory committee and that will also be presented in May at the American Transplant Congress again.</p>
          <p>We are presenting and advocating as we do with many of our medicines a risk management plan and enhanced pharmaco-vigilance to appropriately and responsibly follow in this specialty area any risks, the risks of PTLD that we've talked about and CNS infections will be discussed and their balance against the benefits. In this particular area, launching a product in a specialty group, I think, lends itselves to the new tools the FDA has and the sponsor can avail themselves of to ensure appropriate use and the maximum benefit. And that's what we intend to lay out March 1.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Elliott, a couple questions. With respect to SPRYCEL, can you help us to frame the opportunity in first line CML, specifically &#x2013; just curious to know your thinking on the potential for Gleevec, Gleevec adoption, especially patients who are well controlled? And then secondly, wouldn't Cigna be the right comparator at this point instead of Gleevec just given its superior results over Gleevec? So if you could help us to think about that? And then my other questions relate to ONGLYZA &#x2013; just curious to know your thoughts on how you think the DPP-4 class will grow in the face of the once weekly GLP-1? I think we're all surprised that how slow this launch has been just given how quickly Januvia ramped and the size and opportunity for the DPP-4 market. Maybe, you can talk a bit about how &#x2013; what you're telling doctors in terms of differentiation from Januvia. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jaime, first of all with regard to SPRYCEL, we are excited to be going through our first line data and first line CML against Gleevec. Our competitor's data was just announced at the end of the year. So I would anticipate if this were positive data, that we would go into review around the same time. The trials are somewhat different. I think since our competitor is suggesting that there can be improvements on the standard of care, SPRYCEL by running the study that they ran. This is an important opportunity for patients and for us to present options as Gleevec drawbacks perhaps become more in focus.</p>
          <p>And I don't feel that it is purely an opportunity of the new diagnosed patients. It is the opportunity to redefine what is developing resistance or inadequate treatment to Gleevec. And that is the reason we include it in our studies both complete cytogenetic response head-to-head with Gleevec from which we have so much experience and therefore is the only approved treatment and therefore the only approved and reasonable comparator right now. And why we also took advantage of looking at major molecular response. And when we see the data, and we will present the data at ASCO this year, I think people will get excited about the evolving treatment in this area. And there may be one or two new opportunities against Gleevec.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Lamberto Andreotti, and continuing on SPRYCEL. The way we see it is that obviously Gleevec is a well-established product. But still there is more that can be delivered in turns of efficacy also there. And therefore Novartis themselves with Tasigna and we with SPRYCEL believe that there is a space, not only to compete with Gleevec but to displace it. What we don't have better comparison with Tasigna but what we see is that in the indications that we both have now, especially in the U.S., we are doing much better than Tasigna. I think it's the ratio of us to them is two to one. And my understanding is Tasigna is more and more a third line product after failure of Gleevec and failure of SPRYCEL.</p>
          <p>Now the first-line data that they announced needs to be analyzed. We will have our own first line data. We will know that direct comparison. But I think that we will be able to position SPRYCEL for what it is, a very effective drug with an important role and an easy use of administration, once a day and without any food effect. Therefore there is a good space for SPRYCEL also in first line, if the data that Elliott will see and will make public confirm what we expect.</p>
          <p>As far as the ONGLYZA positioning, we are not against Januvia. We are not trying to get patients out of Januvia. Our goal is to establish a good product with a great profile in both efficacy and safety. I repeat, both safety and efficacy in the marketplace. And we can say that Januvia has done a good job so far in establishing the DPP-4 class, but we can do a good job too in establishing that class more. When we speak to doctors, we don't speak about Januvia. We speak about glycemic control, safety and I think that we think we talk to them about their understanding that metformin and SU are not always the possible single solutions to the problems of diabetes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I concur with that, Jami. I'll say that one of the big drivers and the long-term value will be the growth of the DPP-4 category, in general. And we'll have to see how that evolves. We remain very confident in that growth. With regard to clinical data flow on ONGLYZA this year, as you know, late in '09 we did submit our fixed-dose combination for the first once a day, DPP-4 metformin combination, and we need to hear from the FDA with regard to the PDUFA date and the acceptance of the filing, but this is an opportunity if it were to be a 10-month review for a launch of this first-in-kind product by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>We are also planning a European submission for the fixed-dose combination, and we have several studies being reported out this year. We will have a publication of head-to-head data with Januvia that was announced last year hopefully sometime this year. And at the ADA we'll have more safety data in renal-impaired patients, and importantly, head-to-head against sulfonylureas on top of metformin. So it's going to be another exciting year for, I think for ONGLYZA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jami. Next question, please, Twen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll go now to Steve Scala with Cowen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. May I ask, Lamberto, how do you view Actemra as a potential competitor to ORENCIA now that we have Actemra's label, its dosing profile, and its price? And secondly, two questions on filings for Dr. Sigal. First, your outlook for a DVT filing for Apixaban in the U.S.? Is that likely or unlikely, and also the latest status of discussions with regulators on OASIS 7? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's say that every time there is a competitor coming to the market we get ready for it but obviously we can understand the size and importance of that competitor only when we see the label that they get. And, as you know, the product was approved in January, the Actemra was approved in January for use only after TNF failure and include the REMS and from what I understand they also had a black box on the risk of serious infections.</p>
          <p>So there is competition obviously coming from Actemra in our second and later lines businesses where we have market share but we have a profile with ORENCIA, a profile of safety and long term sustained efficacy, seven years where the data published at EULAR last spring, that position well ORENCIA versus Actemra. So serious competitor but having seen their label and having seen their positioning, I think that we are very confident that ORENCIA can continue to do well in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mr. Scala, this is Elliott. With regard to the OASIS 7 trial, also called current or the high dose trial for PLAVIX, we are still in discussions with the FDA, with our partner. I don't have any particular news on that. With regard to Apixaban and DVT, we will be submitting in Europe our application sometime in the first half. We are planning discussions with the U.S. with regard to the data that we have on ADVANCE-1, 2, and 3 in preventing clots and complications with DVT. We may have more to update you March 4, on the overall plans for Apixaban and other programs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks, Steve. Can we go to the next question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez from Leerink Swann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Just a few questions, primarily questions for Elliott and then some for Lamberto. On Apixaban, just as it relates to trial design, Elliott, can you give us your views on if you see any design advantages over Rivaroxaban? There were clear differences in the choices made between the risk of the patients in your study, versus the choices made with a potential competitor and you chose the broad range of CHADS score patients. And I'm just wondering what you think that might mean relative to bleeding versus the accumulation of events and if there is any new information along those lines that could help inform our views on that specifically? And then separately, we did get the specific revenue numbers and have seen the prescription uptake.</p>
          <p>Your comments on ONGLYZA, if we were to extend them to your competitor Effient, would suggest, Lamberto, that perhaps we should envision better uptake for Effient in 2010. Is that something that you envision in your guidance, and if not &#x2013; or in your thoughts for PLAVIX &#x2013; and if not, what feedback are you getting from interventionalists with regard to that competitive landscape, and then what feedback are you getting from managed care? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So first of all, this is Elliott. On Apixaban, your reference to the atrial fibrillation studies; and I'll remind you that we're doing two of those, and one is unique to our program, AVERROES, which is a 5,600 patient study for patients that are unable to take Warfarin and who are currently treated with aspirin, and that will be a superiority study. And we may have the results late this year or early next year on that study. About 50% of patients with atrial fibrillation are not able or not prescribed for other reasons any anticoagulant, and 20% of strokes come from this patient population, so we felt this was an important area of unmet medical need.</p>
          <p>Now you referenced our choice of patient selection in ARISTOTLE, which is a broader study, for head-to-head with Warfarin. It will be about 18,000 patients. And yes, we did choose, compared to Rivaroxaban study design, a broader patient population, because we felt our label would be best served and the patients would be best served if we had experience in a whole range of risk type patients. So that was our major thinking. Our dosing, of course, is different to go after a benefit, risk profile that we think will answer the market needs for the most number of patients. That's basically all I can say at this point until we see the data from the different studies unfold over the next year or so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as far as PLAVIX and Effient are concerned, I have not changed my opinion on Effient. And I think that the stories of Effient and ONGLYZA are totally different stories, totally different marketplaces and above all totally different profiles. As far as PLAVIX is concerned, we continue to be pleased with growth, growth in all its indications. There is the additional important information that we got from the current study that indicates that patients that undergo PCI have reduced thrombosis, reduced major CV events. So this is another piece of information that is also important in the marketplace, in the small part of our total marketplace where Effient is going to compete with us, so totally different stories. We are very upbeat about PLAVIX and we continue to work diligently behind it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Seamus. Twen, I think we have time for only two or three more questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Tony Butler from Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I'm actually following up on a question that I'm not clear was addressed that Jami Rubin asked, and it was around the DPP-4s and versus the GLP-1s. And if you did address this, Lamberto, please forgive me, but how do you think about a weekly GLP-1? And even though I realize it's not in the market maybe today, how do you think about a weekly GLP-1 versus an oral DPP-4 given the HbA1c reductions favor the injectable? And then secondly, when you think about that how are you going to &#x2013; or how would you think about remarketing or pushing ONGLYZA even further? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we'll have to see how once it comes to the market what the weekly dose and safety profile looks like against the efficacy. I do think there is a definite place for the GLP-1s although they're injectable because of the weight loss that you see and the degree of A1c lowering. But I think that both approaches to the DPP-4 is very critical and the combinations that are going to evolve with Saxagliptin, ONGLYZA, because of its low mass and its high potency, I think still offer a significant opportunity. But we're going to have to see how this unfolds, and we are following that as you note.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And again obviously the GP-1 would have a role, but our focus is more on the oral products and the possibility of combining, adding on our product, Saxagliptin, especially to metformin. There is data that will come out in June, I believe Elliott, about us versus SU on top of metformin and if that data is interesting, there is more that we can do behind ONGLYZA in line with what I was mentioning before, I explained before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tony. Twen, can we have two more questions, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll go to the next question from the line of Catherine Arnold from Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I have three quick product questions. I just wanted to close the ORENCIA discussion with a number in terms of the share. You guys are experiencing failures versus treatment na&#xEF;ve given your label, if you could just update us on that. And then, Elliott, you hinted at some of the differences in the Gleevec versus SPRYCEL trial versus the Tasigna versus SPRYCEL trial. But I wondered if you could comment on terms of dose escalation protocol for Gleevec in your study versus perhaps what Novartis showed. And then I'll take those two now and I'll come back for the third. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start with the SPRYCEL trial. We allowed dose escalation of either agent according to the physician and the clinical need. And I believe you're referring to the fact that the escalation was not there in the Tasigna head-to-head. They did do two doses of Tasigna. We did one dose of SPRYCEL. To me, the most important aspect of the trial is the difference in the primary end-points. And the Tasigna trial used major molecular response and we used complete cytogenetic response. We had a secondary end-point for major molecular. And they had a second area end-point for complete cytogenetic. So there may be some discussion on the different interpretations across studies and regulatory impact of that. But we'll have to see when we see all our data and we're going to, hopefully, be presenting this at ASCO in June.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Catherine, I'm not sure I have the exact data so John will correct me later if what I'm going to say is not correct. But I believe that in new patients, the patients on therapy, that new two brands, overall we have a situation where Remicade has 51% and we have 49%. And our position is, obviously, much stronger in second and third line. I apologize. I don't have the data in front of me, but I know that in first line we have increased our share and we are now at 25% I believe versus 75% of Remicade in patients in play. So good progression in second and third line and some progress, good progress also in first line. And you remember our objective is to be the IV product of choice in RA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could just add, Catherine, we are pleased with the market response on our data that we updated the label for in terms of first line and the safety profile and the durability that's getting reported back. And I think all of this is impacting the uptake of ORENCIA. The big catalyst out of R&amp;D this year for ORENCIA is that we could deliver, although we're still awaiting some of the efficacy data, is subcutaneous ORENCIA and we will have a potential U.S. submission for the sub-cu version this year. In Europe we're working hard to expand the label to be more like the U.S. label.</p>

          <p>And we'll go to our last question from the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. Just two questions. First on generic PLAVIX in Europe, can you just update us on what kind of share you're seeing now for the generics in key markets, I guess particularly France, Germany and the UK? And then are you anticipating significant step downs in quarterly equity income relative to 4Q levels as we move through 2010? And then finally, just coming back to the String of Pearls. I know you've talked in the past about doing a lot of transactions that help to build your late-stage pipeline by 2012. I guess with the growing cash balances in the company and as we're creeping closer to 2012, does that inherently imply a shift to more later stage and potentially larger deals like we saw with Medarex last year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. This is Charlie. I was getting lonely. Didn't think I was going to get a question. So let me handle the PLAVIX EU. We have seen, as I mentioned in my comments, significant share erosion in the UK and price in the 80 to 85%. And in France, which is our biggest market overseas for Clopidogrel, we have seen share and price declines in 55 to 65% range. In where we co-promote with Sanofi in what we call Territory A, we record our share of the profits in net income of affiliates in our P&amp;L. And that number, as you saw in the fourth quarter, has gone down 27% net of FX, and is the impact we continue to see on the business flow, continually erode that line quarter-over-quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And about how to use the $10 billion in our bank and our, and the future of our String of Pearls program, we will continue to use our money in a very focused and disciplined way. Our priority in using our cash is for sure in business development. And we are focused on two types of deals, deals that can build our late-stage pipeline in 2011, 2012. And deals that can be accretive in 2012, 2013 that fall after the loss of exclusivity of PLAVIX and AVAPRO.</p>
          <p>Obviously we also consider other options for the use of cash, like share reports programs or etcetera, but we, our focus now is on business development. And when we look at companies and products as part of our String of Pearls program, well think of what we've done, Adnexus, of course and Medarex. We are looking for similar opportunity. We are starting and assessing a large number of opportunities. We look at small molecules and we look at biologic products in areas that are aligned with our key strategy areas. So the idea continues to be small and mid-size acquisitions that either repeat or complement our current portfolio of products that we have in the market or in development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So thanks, everybody for your questions and attention on the call. I'll turn it over to Jim for some closing comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Now I'll make these very brief. I'll end where I started. Here in 2010 we're 100% BioPharma. And what's that mean? Very focused, very lean. Our portfolio of products, we've not given up on PLAVIX. It'll be a substantial contributor to us until the patent expires here in the U.S. in the future. But we do have a very and more balanced portfolio going forward than we had three years ago.</p>
          <p>No more comments on financial flexibility, we're committed to cash dividends, aggressive look for the Pearls. And then let me close with just a short story. My colleagues who are on the table, and myself participated with the top 200 global executives right here in New Jersey last week. And I can guarantee you this is an impressive group. Their understanding commitment to the company is outstanding, and we intend to meet all the commitments that we make going forward. Thank you for your attention.</p>
