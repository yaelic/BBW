        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Diego. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Teva's Second Quarter 2009 Earnings Call.</p>
          <p>We hope you've had a chance to review our press release which we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the press release is available on our website at www.tevapharm.com. Additionally, we are conducting a live webcast of this call that is also available on our website.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Elana. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review Teva's results for the second quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>This was a very good quarter for Teva with record-breaking results, including record sales, gross margins, operating profit, net income and EPS.  Teva's net sales in Q2 reached a record $3.4 billion with gross margin of 58.5%. Our operating profit was $981 million, with net income of $742 million and all of this ultimately brought us to EPS of $0.83.</p>
          <p>Eyal will provide the rest of the details and the numbers. I would just like to add that we are especially pleased with our growth in sales in Q2, despite the ongoing negative foreign exchange effect, which in Q2 took nearly a quarter of a billion dollars from our top line. Overall, I believe our results this quarter provide quite a clear demonstration of the strength of Teva's growth momentum.</p>
          <p>Our growth in Q2 was driven by contributions from across our many businesses and geographies, as well as by the excellent progress we are continuing to make in the Barr integration.  In North America we had a very good quarter with sales of $2.1 billion, up 36% over Q2 '08, led both by sales of our branded products and by our US generics unit. We are especially pleased with the results of our exclusive launch of generic Adderall XR, which has already achieved 68% market share and is continuing to grow.</p>
          <p>Our product offering is in the US, is the strongest it has ever been. We are continuing to enjoy strong sales of products from both Teva's and Barr's generic portfolio and we have made great progress in integrating the two portfolios and in leveraging Teva's marketing, sales and distribution capabilities to further enhance the performance of the combined portfolio.</p>
          <p>In Europe, sales were up by 20% in local currencies over Q2 '08, to reach $732 million.  Sales were especially strong in Germany, Spain and Poland. Despite the turbulence that we have experienced this quarter in individual European markets such as Italy and France, as we look to the future we remain very optimistic about our European business.</p>
          <p>Our growth strategy is focused on achieving market leadership and we believe that Teva is uniquely well positioned to succeed in Europe, which has a total population of over 490 million and where there is still relatively low generic penetration in many markets.</p>
          <p>For Teva international business, Q2 was another excellent and record-breaking quarter, with sales growing by 35% in local currency to reach $481 million.  Results were especially strong in Russia and Latin America. Teva's international business is a major growth driver and I believe that our strong results quarter-after-quarter give us good reason to be extremely optimistic about the potential and the future of this business.</p>
          <p>Teva's innovative business continued to grow in Q2, once again achieving record-breaking sales. Copaxone grew 21% over the second quarter of 2008. In the US, in-market sales increased by 32%, further widening the gap between Copaxone and the number two product.</p>
          <p>According to IMS data, our market share in TRx reached a new record high of just over 38%. Outside the US, Copaxone grew by 5% or in terms of local currency, by 26% over Q2 '08. We expect Copaxone to continue to outpace the market growth and perform extremely well.</p>
          <p>And of course, Teva remains strongly committed to continue its research and development of our innovative neurology portfolio.  In June, we announced completion of patient enrollment in the BRAVO trial, the second Phase III clinical trial to evaluate the effect of oral laquinimod on the treatment of multiple sclerosis.</p>
          <p>Oral laquinimod is a novel once-daily oral immunomodulator that if successful, has the potential to become the preferred therapy for relapsing MS patients, offering the best benefit-to-risk ratio in terms of efficacy, safety and tolerability. This was also an exciting quarter for Azilect, which had in-market sales of $55 million, growing 31% over Q2 '08.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our global respiratory business, sales reached $189 million, up 13% over Q2 '08. The increase was driven primarily by strong sales of ProAir in the US, which maintained its market leadership position with 58% market share.</p>
          <p>We are continuing to work very hard on developing novel brands for our global respiratory franchise to further strengthen our position in this key area. Later this year, we plan to begin Phase III trials for nasal beclomethasone dipropionate HFA for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, the most common allergic disease in the US and abroad.</p>
          <p>As you know, we expanded our specialty pharma portfolio through the addition of Barr's women's health business, where in Q2 sales grew 4% to reach $80 million. During the quarter we introduced our extended cycle oral contraceptive, LoSEASONIQUE, and just this month we introduced the one-pill emergency contraceptive Plan B One-Step.</p>
          <p>We believe that this business has outstanding prospects for growth. We are targeting various means by which we can expand our offerings both in the area of oral contraceptives and in other area of women's health, and we also plan to leverage Teva's global footprint to take much of this franchise to Europe and to our international markets.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to report that our integration of Barr is continuing to run ahead of schedule and as I previously reported, we are realizing more synergies from this combination than we had initially forecast and we are realizing them more quickly than we expected.</p>
          <p>Other than $300 million of synergies which we initially announced or the 400 million which we announced in February, we now expect to realize closer to $500 million in cost synergies in the third year.  I'm also pleased to report that in the second quarter the acquisition becomes accretive.</p>
          <p>Before I turn into our outlook for 2009 and 2010, I would like to say a word about Teva's financial strength. Beyond the second quarter we improved our financial position by paying down approximately $1 billion of our debt.</p>
          <p>In addition, holders of our convertible debt elected to convert over $700 million of those convertible bonds during the quarter. This brought our financial leverage down from 34 to 27% and we expect by the end of the year to reach the same financial leverage that we had before the Barr acquisition, or even better.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to review our outlook for the remainder of 2009, 2010 and beyond.  As you know of course, legal and regulatory complexities make the timing of all product launches somewhat uncertain.</p>
          <p>That said, we are extremely pleased with the results of the first half of this year which have yielded revenues of more than $6.5 billion and EPS of $1.54, and we continue to be excited about the potential launch opportunities in the second half of this year. Therefore, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2009 which we provided at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>We continue to expect the second half of 2009 to be stronger than the first half, with quarterly net sales and EPS results improving sequentially. We expect EPS in 2009 to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.40.</p>
          <p>Looking forward to 2010, last quarter we provided guidance of EPS of 40 to 45% (sic) [30 to 35%] over our 2009 projected guidance. Now that we have greater visibility to 2010, we believe that we will be at the higher end of this range and that EPS will increase at least 35%.</p>
          <p>This is on the strength of a number of factors, including our launch of Venlafaxine, our generic version of Effexor Xr, as well as additional launches in the US, the completion of the take-back of Copaxone from Sanofi-Aventis in North America and enhanced synergies from the Barr integration, which as I just mentioned, we now expect to be approximately $500 million.</p>
          <p>But our growth does not stop there.  Later this year we intend to provide you with an updated long-term outlook for the Company. We are looking forward to the opportunity not only to update the 2012 outlook we provided in February 2008, but to take a deeper look at the years 2013 to 2015. The significant amount of analysis and planning already conducted by all of our units gives us great confidence that Teva will continue its growth momentum.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much and now I would like to turn the call over to Eyal for a more detailed financial review. Eyal?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Shlomo, and good day to everyone. I hope you have had an opportunity to review the press release we issued earlier today.</p>
          <p>Following a strong first quarter, the positive momentum in our business continues and we are reporting today a record quarter for Teva in terms of sales and non-GAAP operating income, net income and earnings per share.  Similar to the first quarter, results were driven by a good product mix, tight expense control and continued progress with our integration of Barr.</p>
          <p>During this quarter we strengthened the balance sheet and improved financial leverage with a reduction of our debt by $1.7 billion. Most of this reduction was achieved by paying down approximately $1 billion in short-term debt and by conversion of $719 million of convertible debentures to equity. This brings our financial leverage down to approximately 27%.</p>
          <p>Before I delve into the numbers, I would like to remind everyone that we are presenting GAAP and non-GAAP results. In our non-GAAP presentation we have excluded the following items this quarter, which are primarily related to the acquisition of Barr: $76 million of inventory step-up; amortization of purchased intangible assets totaling $151 million, of which $143 million are included in cost of goods sold and the remaining $8 million in sales and marketing; $42 million in legal settlements; $10 million in restructuring charges; and in addition, the relative tax effect of $58 million.</p>
          <p>You should note that the items excluded in arriving at our non-GAAP results in the second quarter of 2008 are not identical to those in the current quarter. On the one hand, in Q2 2008 we did not have an inventory step-up expense and we had a lower level of amortization, but on the other hand we wrote down auction rate securities. As indicated in the past, we present non-GAAP figures to show you how we as management and our Board look at our financial results.</p>
          <p>Let me begin by highlighting how foreign exchange differences continued to play a significant role in our results throughout this quarter. Similar to Q1, foreign currency differences greatly affected sales.</p>
          <p>This quarter it was by $256 million or 9% as the dollar strengthened against certain foreign currencies, primarily the euro, the Hungarian forint, the British pound and the Polish z&#x142;oty, the Russian ruble, the Israeli shekel and the Canadian dollar, all compared to the second quarter of 2008.  When we eliminate the foreign currency impact for the quarter, consolidated sales actually grew by 29%, with pharmaceutical sales in Europe growing by 20% in local currencies and pharmaceutical sales in our international markets growing by 35% in local currencies.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned to you last quarter, we believe that this is an important measure of our business as we manage the countries into a local currency and measure those sales and profits accordingly.  However, it is important to note that foreign currencies has a negligible impact less than 1% on operating profits. Teva's diverse geographical presence continued to provide us with a good natural hedge that mitigates much of the risk involved in currency fluctuations and minimizes the impact on our bottom line.</p>
          <p>Looking at consolidated results in US dollars, sales totaled $3.4 billion, an increase of 20% compared to Q2 last year. Non-GAAP operating income was up 44% compared to Q2 2008 and benefited from strong gross margins and tight expense controls.</p>
          <p>Excluding the items detailed above, non-GAAP net income was strong, up 25%, compared to Q2 2008, despite higher finance expenses and higher tax rates, as planned, both resulting from the acquisition of Barr.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share were $0.83, up 15%, compared to Q2 2008. In the second quarter of 2009 we had approximately 75 million more shares than in the second quarter of 2008, which are part of our earnings per share calculation, due primarily to the shares issued in connection with the Barr acquisition.</p>
          <p>Now let's discuss profit margins which were at record levels this quarter and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross profit margin, which exclude amortization of intangible assets and the inventory step-up, was 58.5% in the reported quarter compared with 54.7% in the comparable quarter of 2008, but similar to the non-GAAP gross profit in Q1 this year.</p>
          <p>The improvement in gross profit margin is attributable to the successful launch of generic Adderall XR and a higher contribution to sales from our branded and innovative franchises, including Copaxone, Azilect, respiratory sales, especially ProAir, and women's health products.</p>
          <p>Operating margins reached 28.9%, up from 24.2%, in the comparable quarter last year. The increase resulted from three main factors: Strong gross margin, as I just discussed; positive effect of foreign currencies; and low R&amp;D expenses.</p>
          <p>Speaking of R&amp;D, net R&amp;D expenses reached $169 million or 5% of sales.  The low net R&amp;D number this quarter resulted from reimbursements of approximately $40 million from our joint venture with Lonza.</p>
          <p>We announced a joint venture with Lonza earlier this year to develop, manufacture and market a portfolio of biosimilars. This joint venture became operational during the second quarter and as part of the agreement related to R&amp;D expenses incurred by Teva prior to the finalization of the agreement, were contributed and reimbursed by the joint venture.</p>
          <p>Despite the decline in net R&amp;D, gross R&amp;D expenses this quarter increased compared to Q2 last year and we remain committed to a plan to double R&amp;D output from the 2007 levels by 2012. For the full year, factoring out the reimbursement from the joint venture with Lonza, Teva's R&amp;D expenses are at a run rate of approximately 7% of sales.</p>
          <p>I would also like to point out that Teva's share in the joint venture expenses, approximately $20 million, is reflected in the line item called share in losses from associated companies, which is below the operating profit line.</p>
          <p>Sales and marketing expenses, excluding amortization of intangible assets, totaled $641 million in the quarter or 18.9% of sales compared to 17.5% of sales in Q2 2008 and a similar percentage in the first quarter of this year. Similar to the higher gross margins, this higher sales and marketing expenses are the result of higher contributions to sales of our innovative and branded franchises.</p>
          <p>Total G&amp;A expenses this quarter were $197 million or 5.8% of sales compared with 6% of sales in Q2 last year. We recorded $61 million of financial expenses in our Q2 2009 results compared with $9 million of non-GAAP financial expenses in the comparable quarter of 2008. The higher finance expenses resulted from debt incurred in connection with the Barr acquisition.</p>
          <p>Similar to Q1, the tax rate provided in Q2 2009 was 17% of pre-tax non-GAAP income. We continue to estimate our annual tax rate for 2009 at 17% compared with a rate of 10% in 2008. The increase in the tax rate resulted primarily from the fact that Barr's corporate tax rate is higher than Teva's and in 2008 we did not include Barr.</p>
          <p>Now let's have a look at our cash flow. Cash generated from operations amounted to $658 million. Our free cash flow, excluding capital expenditure of $148 million and cash dividend of $134 million, amounted to $376 million.</p>
          <p>The lower cash flow from operations was driven by two main factors. First, timing of significant US launches versus collection which will come in the third quarter and second, during the second quarter we paid approximately $80 million of Barr integration-related expenses, which we provided for as part of the Barr's purchase price accounting and were not reflected in the income statement.</p>
          <p>On June 30 we had approximately $2 billion in cash and marketable securities. Our total outstanding loans, bonds and convertible debentures stood at $6.7 billion, down from $8.4 billion at the end of March. During the quarter we had paid approximately $1 billion of our debt, approximately $800 million of our bridge financing loan and approximately $200 million in other short and long-term debt.</p>
          <p>As of June 30 the remaining bridge loan amounted to $630 million.  We remain committed to paying down the full amount of the bridge loan by the end of the year and expect to pay down most of it by the end of the third quarter.</p>
          <p>During the quarter the 0.5% and 0.25% convertible debentures issued in 2004 passed their conversion window. Through June 30, approximately $354 million of the 0.5% bond and $365 million of the 0.25% bond were converted, leaving the principal amount of these bonds at approximately $350 million combined for the two series.</p>
          <p>Subsequent to the end of the quarter, an additional $90 million were converted, so now it's below $300 million which is left to be converted. I would like to remind you again that a conversion did not impact the fully diluted share count and earnings per share calculation and these shares were already included in the diluted share count calculations.</p>
          <p>In total we reduced debt by $1.7 billion during the quarter, improving our financial leverage from 34% at the end of March to 27% at June 30. We now believe that by the end of the year our financial leverage may stand at 22% lower than our pre-Barr position, which was 24%.</p>
          <p>DSO or days sales outstanding amounted to 47 days this quarter compared to 51 days in Q1 2009 and 54 days in Q2 2008. These small sequential declines do not reflect significant differences in collection level, rather our DSO is impacted by foreign currency exchanges resulting in these small changes from one quarter to another.</p>
          <p>We calculated DSO as we always do after netting out from the receivables the sales, reserve and allowances.  Whereas our accounts receivable and SR&amp;A did not change materially, the decline in DSO resulted primarily from higher sales.</p>
          <p>Inventory days were 188 days, down from 191 days in March 2009 and down from 228 days in December. Similar to DSO, there wasn't a demonstrable difference in inventory level, rather the sequential decline we've seen in the past few quarters in inventory days resulting from the sale of Barr inventory, which was recorded in our books at market value rather than cost, known as the inventory step-up.</p>
          <p>Gross capital expenditure reached $151 million this quarter compared with 180 million in Q2 2008 and down from $160 million in Q1 2009. The acquisition of Barr added production capacity and reduced investments in capital expenditures compared to the 2008 level.</p>
          <p>Dividends, yesterday Teva's Board approved a quarterly dividend amounting to approximately $144 million. On a per share basis our dividend, which is declared in Israeli shekels, was NIS 0.60 per share. On the rate of exchange on July 27, which was yesterday of the shekel to the US dollar, this translates into approximately $0.0157 per share.</p>
          <p>That concludes my comments. Thank you all for your time and attention today. Now we'll be glad to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator instructions" /> Our first question comes from Randall Stanicky with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks very much, guys, for the question. Just on the Barr have been a lot more about than even you initially expected. Can you maybe comment on an additional acquisition that you've been talking about, if it's not on the generic side, can you talk about maybe where those synergies would come, your ability to drive top line and how we should think about any potential cost synergies and then I have follow-up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Randall, hi it's, Shlomo. I'm not sure if I well understand the second part of your question, could you be so kind to make it more clear?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I guess first is your interest still, maybe update us where your interest from the acquisition perspective is and then how should we think about any possible accretion from a deal if it happens to be on the branded side versus the generic side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You take it, Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Randall, I think your question is centered more about are we going to continue bouncing around the generic space or will we move more towards specialty or some other area. And I think what Shlomo has clearly said before is that we believe that the same type of capabilities that we have developed in the generic market, we can also apply to specialty or some other area that we might go after. Now this doesn't mean that Teva is going to necessarily run out tomorrow and chase down specialty companies. We've always said that we're going to be looking at products, technologies and companies, but I think as you think of companies moving forward, you should not limit your thinking to just generic companies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then so maybe on that, if we think about the new outlook pre-cast, which is now better than 35%, is there anything for deals factored into that number or is that still organic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Still organic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's still organic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just my final question, should we still think about the current or your previous revenue range for the year, I think it was 14.1 to 14.6 billion as the appropriate range as we think about top line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well first of all, as I reaffirm our guidance at the beginning of the year, it of course referred to the guidance, but what we should be and what you should try to look for, of course, is how we are going to see the foreign exchange in the coming six months. So it's with the uncertainties that are related to foreign exchange, this is where we are heading and that's what we should adjust in case that things are going to be changed in our turbulent world today.</p>
          <p>But I would like also to add to your previous question and just to make sure that we're on the same page, Teva's strategy is consistent and we are going to continue with our strategy as we see it now as a focused strategy. And, yes, we have a very balanced business model which we are proud of and we will try to, of course, enhance in the coming years with continuing momentum of growth, as I just said.  And that we explore and we examine many different of course opportunities, but as I always used to say when it comes to acquisitions, Teva acquire companies only if it's fit to our strategy.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>This is exactly as I said.  We are stick to our strategy and when we are going to have some modification we'll definitely let you know and I just said that before the end of the year we are going to add with you on our strategy for the coming years. So we will have another opportunity to briefly dive into the strategy of Teva for the coming years.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thank you for taking my question. A couple of quick ones on the branded side, I mean just to follow on, on Randall's point, on the branded side I know you guys can pretty much handle any kind of acquisition on the generic side, but when you think about the branded side, which is an area where you did not make the large acquisition before, about how big of an acquisition do you think is appropriate for you just in terms of &#x2013; and the amount of money you're willing to put at risk in one deal.  Is this essentially as big as the generic businesses or would you be looking to get at something smaller and I have a quick follow on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ronny, first of all, I think that part of our balanced business model is the current ratio.  It would of course move a little bit here and there, but generally speaking the 70-30 or the 65 to 35 doesn't matter, the real breaking point or inflexion point, that's how we see the business of Teva and this is our strength and this is our core competence. Having said that, one of our core competence is acquisitions and integration and the know-how how to do things and I believe that we can do the same that we did for so many years in so-called generic companies also in specialties and in some other business units that we would be interested in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and quick follow on regarding 2011 and 2012. I know that you are still working on your numbers, but one of the things that I was trying to make out to investors is if you're going have such wonderful growth in 2010 will it not be exceedingly hard to get better numbers in 2011?  We've seen a similar consensus a few years ago after the wonderful 2006 where there were a lot of concerns about 2007. I don't know if you can just point a comment about this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's why I think we would be patient here, we will come with the whole big picture and we'll give you a holistic overview on how we see the coming years, because more than one subject was referred to and we will be more than happy to do it toward the end of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, guys. I wasn't going to ask an M&amp;A question, but your comments have peaked my interest in that you've talked about interest in generics and specialty and potentially other areas. What are the so-called other areas that you would consider other than biologic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well for the time being I think it's about generic specialties and biosimilars also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for that classification. For Eyal, first of all, do you have a number for sales growth for the total Company, excluding the Barr acquisition at this point for the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, but I'm sure you can do the exercise with update with last year base, but we don't measure the Teva part separate from the Barr part.  It's fully integrated six months into the closing of the transaction.  It's almost hard to distinguish between the companies, so there are not two parts.  But if you want to take the base for last year, don't forget to add &#x2013; to reduce from that date about $100 million, which included products that we stopped selling as a result of the transaction and a one-time $53 million that Barr had and the Q2 of 2008 and then, of course, add the impact of foreign exchange for the comparative.  That's an easier compare, but as to the two parts, there are not two parts, it's one company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the Lonza JV given this is a new part of the model going forward, first, why wasn't the 40 million reimbursement excluded from non-GAAP and is the 20 million loss below the line a good run rate to you than the next few quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well first of all, for the $40 million we defined when we moved into what you guys call the catch-up PS model, we defined very clearly what we're going to exclude for the non-GAAP results and we followed this very, very, very, very strictly. So these kind of one-time pluses or minuses are not included and we will continue to report them in our non-GAAP results. As to the number, it's a one-time item. In the future most of the R&amp;D that was done in Teva and that will belong to the combined joint venture who has already contributed, we might have a few more million down the road, but not as many.</p>
          <p>What you see below the line, the $20 million our share in associated companies that were not consolidated, that is a direct result of this one-time. This is our 50% part of that $40 million.  In the future, at least for the rest of 2009, we're going &#x2013; we're not going to see these kind of numbers. The numbers that will be our share of the extent of the joint venture are going to be significantly lower. Now I mean if accounting treatment was not a little crazier, these numbers should be included and should be a part of Teva R&amp;D expenses and that's how you have to look at it.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, just a couple.  Back on R&amp;D, Eyal, so just make sure I heard correctly, did you say going forward that a 7% of revenue ratio was the correct number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you heard me correctly. Approximately, again, it will be 6.8 or 7.2, but because it's not <mark type="inaudible" />, but this is what we believe our average will be for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then you mentioned certain areas of Europe, Spain and Italy, there have been some challenges.  Can you elaborate and provide a little bit more of an outlook for those countries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gerard, would you take this one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm happy to do so. Across Europe you're seeing that governments have been trying to counter the impacts of some of the economic crisis, the settlements, by pushing on the healthcare budget.  You also see consumers holding back on their spend in particular markets where co-payment is a relevant issue. And on top of that we've seen quite aggressive and active competition from our competitors.</p>
          <p>So if you be specific on Spain, and you see there that the growth of the generics market has been less because of some competitive elements in there and some pressure on price.</p>
          <p>Some governments, both those governments have competition. If you look at Italy, the government has implemented on the 30th of April, a whole new way of discount schemes and controlling the dynamics of the Italian market, which has made everybody very unsecure in the market.</p>
          <p>In France, there's fierce competition between the top five companies, in the UK it's going all relatively well, but as far as competition is in there, Germany, you're aware of the tendered business that is kicking in now. So just to give you a flavor of that.  Central Europe, there's a lot of impact from the crisis as well. Within all of that we've done very well. We've grown our share.  Despite all the pressure on prices and from competition, we've grown our share, we held our share in many of these places. We are growing our top line, but of course it's in an environment that is slightly less buoyant than it was previous to be about 12 months ago.</p>
          <p>In terms of recovery, we believe that in Italy it will take a few months before it's all cleared out and then I'll be in a better position to comment on that on what will really happen. As a matter of fact, given the situation in Italy, it can only improve.  The penetration of generics is so low that there must a way out forward in getting more generics in the market. Same story applies toward Spain, so these two markets we're very optimistic that it will recover and in France, outside of the competition in which I of course cannot comment, these things happen, the underlying demand for the generics in that market is still very healthy, so we should expected it to pick up as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So when you're talking about competition in France, are you referring to some price competition that could continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well the question is about whether it will continue or not.  That would be speculative, but there are a few companies that are &#x2013; there are some launch molecules that have come off patent and it's about the sharing.  I think there are four or five companies currently competing for the share. We're number three, we're clearly number three. We overtook number three about six months ago and we stayed there and we're increasing the gap and <mark type="inaudible" /> which is a local player and Mylan, we'll be clear number three. So it's difficult to predict whether this technique of gaining share will stay in place, I don't expect that, but it's a bit unpredictable to speculate on the strategies and tactics of my competitors, of course.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one last one on women's health, it seems like quarter-to-quarter there was a decline.  Is that a function of buying patterns which we had previously seen when Barr was a standalone company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rich, it's Bill Marth.  With respect to it being a decline, no, we don't really see it that way. There was a little bit of a destocking with respect to some of the non-promoted brands, a small amount and we did slowdown Plan B a bit and because of the launch of the anticipated launch of Plan B One-Step, but other than that there was a gain year-over-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rich, if I may add on Europe, because I think it's important, as Europe is the greatest potential for growth for the future both for &#x2013; because of the size of this region and for the lower level of the generic penetration. It's important to look at it from a moral broad perspective. If you look on our position in Europe, we are right now the number one player out of the seven, eight key countries of Europe, we are the number one in UK, Italy and Netherlands. We are number three, as Gerard just said, in France, Spain, Poland and lately also in Hungary.</p>
          <p>So we are strengthening and enhancing our position market share-wise in this important region of the world and at the end of the day the economy is going to recover and generics would prevail there because of the same patterns that we see in every developed country and Europe is not excluded. So we believe that we are strengthening, regaining market share and definitely the future for growth there is there and we are going to grab it.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. I just had a question on the Adderall XR Citizen's Petition, if there's been any new communications between yourself and the FDA, any thoughts you can give us and whether you've included or not included it in the 2010 guidance? And Shire has publicly talked about maybe divesting the product, maybe any thoughts you can add to that or maybe any of your interest?  And then also if you could comment on your Fentanyl share seems to be remaining relatively low and some thoughts on when we might see some further penetration in that market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ken, just a quick one. With respect to Adderall, of course, we are really happy with the share. I think the last weeklies I saw, which are now two weeks old are about 58.6% share on our way to the 70% share, so I think that's exactly where we want it to be. With respect to the Citizen's Petition, we really don't want to comment on the Citizen's Petition.  I don't really have any more knowledge on the Citizen's Petition than you do or anyone else does at this point in time. And then with &#x2013; the other question was?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The Fentanyl, the Fentanyl, as we've been telling you, we're going to move up that share. We have so far business at McKesson and Rite Aid. We also are pursuing some other business.  Currently we don't &#x2013; I don't have it secured yet, I wish I had in the numbers, but I don't have it secured yet.  But we believe we will be there at the share as we said we would be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then for Gerard, as you talk about all the different various countries, there's different competitors in each country and it still seems like a pretty fragmented market. It sounds a bit like the US in the mid-90s and eventually the marketplace got consolidated.  Should we just be continuing to assume you're going to be selective in how you put together your European strategy, we might be see quite a bit more consolidation and smaller players fall out or how should we look five years forward in this European market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it will be unavoidable to see some of the smaller players either disappear or being eaten by a &#x2013; by the bigger players. What you will end up seeing, I guess in five years in Europe, is three or four main players. You'll see a handful of more regional players that are specialized in a few markets or that are specialized in a few sort of specific technologies and so that we will have a lot in common in what you see in the US. I think the main element of time influence here is the fact that the unification and the harmonization of markets, across Europe has just taken its time.</p>
          <p>So we're still dealing with products that were, let's say, before the change of the century and therefore there's a lot of diverse way of filings and stuff going on.  Since the late 90s to early this century you see that there is much more stratification and comparability and discipline on how the legislation has been implemented in terms of regulatory procedures, so we'll see much more of that coming together in the next few years. And people will therefore either stop selling or they will sell their business to someone else or you will see people specializing and surviving -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, maybe just following up on the acquisition theme here and specifically for Bill, you talked in the past about basically expanding your women's healthcare business to roughly a $1 billion sales market. I'm just wondering maybe if you could just give us a little bit of color in terms of how you plan to get there.  Is this more of an organic or inorganic target, are you talking about expanding your therapeutic footprint across women's health and does this include sort of a combination of brand and generic initiatives?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it doesn't include generic initiatives.  It's really branded, Elliot.   I think the issue really is about developing really a broad basket across the market.  And in that market</p>
          <p>segment, when you're thinking about women's healthcare and you have a Gyn's office, there are many areas for us to look into just besides just contraception.  Hormone replacement therapy and you can go farther afield into fertility, you can also think about urinary incontinence and a variety of other areas that are in this particular basket.  Woman in general will use their Ob/Gyn as their, per se, General Practitioner, so that I think we can get broader reach with our reps in that particular division.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then a follow-up question probably for you as well, Bill, I guess recently we've seen more and more occurrences of systemic GNP issues across the generic industry and obviously in certain product situations you're kind of a direct beneficiary there.  But I guess in thinking about the customer base, I mean do you think that there is, has been a shift or is there potentially going to be a shift in terms of the supply chain focusing more on quality and reliability vis-&#xE0;-vis price and we might actually see sort of a reflation of the quality premium?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the only thing you can say there is, quality is an issue.  Price has been a predominant factor for quite some time, but we've always talked about the fact that you need to have price combined with the ability to supply and quality. And I think that all of our purchasers today are really thinking about all those aspects when they're making their purchases.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, could you please give us a sense of US new product launches that we should expect in the second half or give us a sense of what to look for?  And then secondly, just respiratory pipeline, can you give us a sense of how many products are in the pipeline?  You mentioned one, which is really first time you kind of mentioned something which actually started my interest in the respiratory. So is there a pipeline of 10 products across the board that we should expect launching in the next five years or? Just give us a sense of the magnitude of what's going on in the respiratory pipeline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well let's start off first, course, with the generic launches.  Of course I can't and won't list for you all the products.  When you think about the total launches that remain that we can potentially launch in 2009, we still have about 25 that we can do, worth about $23 billion of innovator value, about 10 of which are active Paragraph IVs.  So you never know exactly when they're going to come.  Some of the names you absolutely know, the enoxaparin.  The enoxaparin, of course, is not a Paragraph IV, but that is a situation that everyone is waiting for, for the FDA to act.  But there's products in litigation like Genfidibine, other products like Glenzoprizol that are not in litigation, that we know we have the date certain of November 10. We also know the ODT of course is in litigation and that we expect or we hope to get a ruling before that.</p>
          <p>We also hope to get through oxaliplatin before then. Montelukast still remains out there, Potiapine, there's a whole bunch of others, raloxifene chloramine out there and we still believe there's a number of launches that are still very likely within 2009. The second question with respiratory, I don't think we're going to go out and disclose coming Phase IIIs yet and I mean we disclosed one.  We told you they're there.  We're going to do this one at a time.</p>

          <p>Thanks for taking the question.  I guess along the lines of the M&amp;A theme and the balanced business model that you're looking to create, Shlomo, going forward. I guess a question for I guess maybe more directed towards Bill in North America.  As far as your percent of branded sales, can you just comment on what percent of your products comes from branded sales and then is there a certain percent of your business going forward that you would like to see coming from branded products going forward?  Also on the North American revenue, can you provide any color as far as the percent of generic sales that was sold in the quarter and the growth on generics in North America?  And then on the international side of the business, can you draw or can you speak at all to the break out of the international sales and the growth in some of those markets in constant currency? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John, I think they're going to limit you to 12 questions.  We'll start, I think Shlomo wants to start here and then we'll move along.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Before I turn to Bill I think it's important get back to our fundamentals which I call the Teva balanced business model. When it come to segments of business, it's about 75 generics, including the API business that we have and 25 branded business where we have, of course, now the growing brand of Copaxone.  But we also developed some other brands regarding our respiratory and women's health businesses and we look at this ratio on the business because we believe the business is a good balance between two different business models that actually have synergies and more than that in between.</p>
          <p>When it comes to geography, as you know, 60% of our business is roughly speaking coming from North America, and we have about 15 from Europe and we developing in a more rapid pace the international business as we see this as our growth or one of the most successful growth drivers for the future. So you may expect that our international business should take &#x2013; or should grow and take more part of the pie in the coming years and with that I would turn to Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John, I mean we're not going to necessarily break out the numbers here on the branded business for North America. I think that Shlomo had said it well in the sense that our branded business is about 25% -- we're about a 75:25% business today. The larger portion of the sales today in the US are definitely generic, that's for sure. But I don't think as Shlomo has said, we want to look at it as a North American thing. As we move forward whether the ratio for Teva is 70:30, 65:35, it is really doesn't matter.  We need to expand this not to just here in North America &#x2013; it's not just a more North American business, it's a global business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  First on Copaxone, what I'm seeing for the quarter was 15% volume growth and if revenue grew &#x2013; this is just US, if revenue grew 21% that would leave 6% on price.  A, is that close and B, is that similar in Europe and, C, is the, ties into the last question, is the contribution from Copaxone to net income in this quarter above or below the revenue contribution at about 20%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You want to take it?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Corey, you were saying that you were looking at the growth on Copaxone at being about 15% on a &#x2013; are you looking at a unit basis, dollar basis,  what were you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I'm trying to build up the components of the revenue growth in the US of 21% and from volume growth it looks like it's around 15%, which would leave 6% on price, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, the units were &#x2013; units shipped were about 10.8% up.  If you look at TRxs, that's about 11% up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the rest is on price?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The rest is price, the balance would be price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is it similar in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in Europe actually, this is  Moshe, in Europe most of the goal is unit driven goals, so we don't see any effect on the prices other than the FX, of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah there's a 20% headwind on FX and then a lot of &#x2013; most of the increase was on quantity and not on price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>In Europe we grow by unit by 28%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The gist of the question is how much longer is the price growth sustainable as all the MS therapies come closer to &#x2013; in price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Corey, I think the answer to the question is that we can't answer that. I &#x2013; at this point in time we have always been a price follower and not a price leader and so we continue to do that.  We have the number one therapy both globally and of course in North America, so we don't think it is appropriate that we be the lowest price product, so we'll continue to follow where the market goes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the last part of that question is contribution to net income versus revenues, was it higher or lower?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Corey,  You know that we do not provide separate product lines by their profitability or contribution.  This is for commercial reasons, but you could assume obviously that our branded business and that includes Copaxone and Azilect, is more profitable than the generic business. So its contribution to profit is higher than its contribution to sales and we said before it's about 25, 75 in sales.  The proportion in profit or in operating profit leans a little more towards the branded and day-to-day, but we're not breaking the numbers precisely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Presumably that will go up as the Sanofi royalty goes down over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>The profitability presumably will go up as payments to Sanofi go down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well from next year, as you know, there's the pay back from Sanofi-Aventis and we start paying royalties in the US market.  Of course that will improve profitability of Copaxone. 2011 and 2012, our agreement with them in the extra territories comes to an end and that will again improve the profitability, no doubt about that.  But this is something that you can calculate.  We're paying them in the US today 25% royalties on sales.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. What are your thoughts on the future of settlements &#xE0; la Soladine this past quarter, are we going to see more creative solutions in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Scott, this is Bill Marth.  With respect to settlements, again, we're just reacting to the market. There are many settlement bills that exist today within both the Senate and the House, considering settlements, which have had a chilling effect in settlements today. All the settlements that we have just recently done being Udathinyde, SOLODYN and now Ortho Tri-Lo, have all been date of entry settlements, which have would be legal within the toughest of the provision that are offered out there today. So I guess the answer, it's kind of a long answer to simply say that whatever the rules that are put in place by the government or the FTC, the market will adapt to that and that's what we're doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just secondly, is there any update on the COZAAR HYZAAR for the file status and if not, what are your thoughts on brands just going forward delisting patents?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think you know that we argued that rather recently and we feel pretty good about the argument. We think the judge understood the issues very, very well. I think the judge understands the brand's tactics here. So we feel pretty good about that argument and we hope to get a response fairly quickly.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then just one follow-up, I mean I wanted to get your thoughts on this whole exclusivity with biologics. I mean looking back at the exclusivity periods for just pharmaceuticals, it took a long time to sort of work out all the details. I mean what inning do you guys think we're in with this whole exclusivity debate for biologics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I would say to that that I think we're still in the &#x2013; we're still very much in the early innings. This was the first bill that came out and so there are several other bills and junctures for us to pass. The White House even over the weekend again advocated seven years, Waxman's out there with five years, FTC says zero and the bill of course we got out of the Senate Health Committee is 12. So I think there's a lot of the balancing act yet to occur, but I think it's early in the game.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. Just a quick question following upon that patent settlement discussion earlier. I guess does the prospect from an industry perspective, does the prospect of patent settlement legislation slowdown near-term settlement activity, accelerate near-term activity or just really have no impact and I just have a quick follow-up from there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Chris, I think the answer to that is kind of what I said in the sense that the industry will &#x2013; the industry will adapt whatever standard is set. If the rules stay with a bright line with date of entry settlement, it almost seems like Teva will be about the only company that can settle because we can launch at-risk. We do launch at-risk and then we &#x2013; then we get to a point of a date of entry settlement. So that almost doesn't seem like a pretty good place to go and again, we're looking for a settlement bill that really is right for the American consumer and we don't think a bright line bill is right for the American consumer.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry about that, thanks very much. Could you just discuss your gross margin trends in the United States?  You mentioned 58% of the gross margin this quarter for the total Company, but could you talk about US trends and then for the total Company, I don't know if you provide this, but if you could provide some perspective in your generics business, so excluding the branded side of the Company, what the medium-term outlook is for the gross margin? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I can refer to our consolidated overall gross margin. We don't break it on a geographical basis or we don't even break it as we said before on a product line basis, but I can give you some information regarding the gross margin.  The combined gross margin was 58.5%, which was the highest that we have reported in the past few years at least, resulting from mostly from a very good product mix. We had more branded, innovative and new launches as part of our product mix which created higher gross margins.  There was some impact of foreign exchange where we produced, many of our products are being produced in a non-dollar environment, but on the gross margin that impact was relatively small.</p>
          <p>But it's mostly driven by the right product mix and by efficiency measures that we've been taking from the middle of last year. Many of them are Teva in general and of course the Barr division, which all the actions that we've taken is helping us also reduce our cost of sales. But again, specifically for geography this is &#x2013; we're not breaking that out and therefore Bill might &#x2013; could refer to how we see the generic business in the US, but not in terms of the gross margin, pricing and other -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, David, it's really tough for us to comment on that and we don't want to be coy here because the issue really becomes we have a good solid base business, but we also have a very active Paragraph IV business, which carries with it disproportionate margin.  And it's really dependent on how successful we are in a particular year, in a particular quarter on our Paragraph IV business. So there is, as Eyal rightly said, there are mix issue, there are mix issues within generic and it's not always just Paragraph IV.</p>
          <p>It may be those that are difficult or complex products. Recently we came to market with Ursodiol Tablets, we happened to get there first ahead of other people and so that helped us, that helps us on the margin side. If we were to get a more difficult product like enoxaparin that we hope at some point in time is approved, we think the margins there are more favorable. So it is a balancing act and it is definitely a mix.</p>
