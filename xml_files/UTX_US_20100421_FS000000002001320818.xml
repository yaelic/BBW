      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, [Tricia] , and good morning everyone. As you saw in the press release this morning, a great start to the year with strong performance across the business in a tough but improving end market environment. Some key takeaways from this quarter: first, cost traction continues, resulting in margin expansion at each of the businesses. Second, we are seeing improvement in order trends and continued strength in our short-cycle businesses. And finally, we saw strong cash generation in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Recall on our March Investor meeting, we expressed confidence in our original EPS guidance provided back in December as pressure from the euro's weakness was partially offset by benefits from pension, the early closing of the GE Security deal, and strength in our short-cycle businesses. Since that time, the euro has weakened a little bit more, but the continuing strength of cost traction and a broader improvement in order trends has increased our confidence in the outlook. As a result, we're going to raise the low end of our EPS guidance range to 4.50 from $4.40. So we now expect EPS to be in the range of 4.50 to 4.65. That's up 9 to 13% from 2009 on revenues still expected to be around 54 to 55 billion, up 2 to 4%.</p>
          <p>Getting back to first quarter results, performance was solid across the businesses with segment operating margin expansion of 180 basis points to 14.2% adjusted for restructuring. On that same basis, total segment operating profit grew 13% on a revenue decline of 1%. All six business units improved margins with Carrier, Otis, and Sikorsky leading the way. Carrier's margin expansion of 390 basis points reflects strong progress from its restructuring actions and cost reduction initiatives in addition to the benefits of a relative easy compare given the very tough Q1 in 2009.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share in the first quarter were $0.93. That's up 19% and includes a charge of a little bit more than a penny from the recently enacted healthcare legislation which eliminated the Medicare Part D tax subsidy. Restructuring costs were 67 million. That's slightly below the net 75 million that we had expected. Excluding restructuring costs in both quarters and the one-time gain in last year's first quarter, earnings per share increased 13% on 1% lower revenue.</p>
          <p>Foreign currency was a benefit of $0.06. That's from translation and the positive impact of currency hedges at Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada. Foreign currency translation also favorably impacted revenues by 3%.</p>
          <p>Organic revenues declined by 4% in the quarter. That's a slight improvement from the 6% decline we saw in the fourth quarter. We expected organic revenues this quarter to be down as last year's first quarter benefited from a strong backlog. The best example is probably Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada, which shipped nearly 1,000 engines in the first quarter of 2009 compared to 633 this quarter. That's down 35%. That's the lowest quarterly rate we expect this year at Pratt Canada. And for the full year, we still expect Pratt Canada to ship about 2,800 engines.</p>
          <p>Now on slide two on orders, while first quarter organic revenues were down, first quarter order rates showed marked improvement with continued strength in most of our short cycle businesses. Carrier's US residential shipments and Transicold orders were up year over year with strong improvement in truck trailer and containers. In China, total orders across our commercial business units grew by 40% and other emerging markets such as India and Brazil also saw strong improvements.</p>
          <p>Additionally at Hamilton, we saw growth in the commercial aero aftermarket and at their industrial businesses. Not surprisingly, commercial construction related orders, particularly in North America, remained weak. Akhil will take you through the detail of orders by business unit in just a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Now on slide three, in the quarter free cash flow was 116% of net income. Our focus on working capital and control over CapEx continues to pay off and we drove solid cash flow performance. Working capital turns improved to 8.3, even in the face of lower revenues. And capital expenditures to depreciation were slightly below 70% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Share repurchase in the quarter was 500 million, a strong start to this year's program as we continue to believe that our shares are attractively priced. Acquisition spend in the quarter was 2.1 billion. That's primarily from the GE Security and Clipper Windpower transactions.</p>
          <p>So no surprises; just like we told you since December, a strong quarter where we saw continued margin expansion and excellent cash flow in difficult but improving end markets.</p>
          <p>I'll come back and talk a little bit more about 2010. But for now, let me turn it over to Akhil to take you through the business unit details.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Greg. Turn to page four. Let me remind you that I will talk to the segment results adjusted for restructuring and non-recurring items, as we usually do.</p>
          <p>Otis delivered an exceptionally strong first quarter with profit growth of 15% on 3% higher revenues. Operating margin expanded 240 basis points to 22.2% as the benefits of aggressive cost reduction actions over the past year and continued strength in contractual maintenance more than offset the impact of lower new equipment volume.</p>
          <p>At constant currency, revenues were down 3% while operating profit was up 8%. New equipment sales were down 7% as a strong rebound in China was more than offset by a continued decline in North America and Europe. Service revenues were down slightly, with growth in the contractual maintenance business offset by lower modernization and repair volumes.</p>
          <p>New equipment orders resumed growth for the first time since second quarter of 2008, and were up 9% versus prior year or up 3% at constant currency. This increase was driven by China, where orders were up close to 50% from a weak first quarter of 2009, partially offset by a 30% decline in North America. Orders in Europe remained flat for the second quarter in a row.</p>
          <p>While the foreign exchange benefit in the first quarter is expected to be more than offset by headwinds in the latter part of the year, based on the solid cost traction and strong orders in China, we now expect Otis full-year profit growth to be at or above the higher end of our prior guidance range of 75 to $100 million on flattish revenue.</p>
          <p>On slide five, Carrier continued its transformation to a high-returns business and posted another quarter of record margin expansion. Profit grew 149% on 2% lower revenues, resulting in 390 basis points of margin expansion. This was largely driven by carryover benefits of the aggressive cost reduction and organizational restructuring, strong volume and earnings conversion in parts of the business, and lower commodity costs. One-time impact of new divestiture related transactions reduced profit by about $20 million.</p>
          <p>Consistent with expectations, organic revenues were up 2% in the quarter following 18 months of contraction. First quarter shipments of US residential systems were up high single digits year over year, the second consecutive quarter of growth. Although order rates in the longer cycle commercial HVAC business in the Americas and Europe were down in the low teens at constant currency, order rates in China were up mid-teens. Transicold orders were up for the first time since third quarter of 2008, up over 35% at constant currency. And container and truck trailer orders nearly doubled, albeit from a low base. I am sure you remember these segments had significant drops in orders last year.</p>
          <p>While the cooling season is still in front of us, based on the solid start, we now expect Carrier's operating profit growth for the year to be at or above the higher end of our prior guidance range of 150 to $175 million.</p>
          <p>UTC Fire &amp; Security delivered operating margin expansion of 110 basis points on 10% higher revenues. Organically, revenues contracted 8% with double-digit decline in Fire Safety and a mid-single digit decline in Electronic Security. Net acquisitions, primarily from the acquisition of GE Security on March 1, contributed 10 points of revenue growth. Foreign currency translation increased revenues 8% year over year. While first quarter orders declined organically at a low single digit rate overall, the rate of decline continued to improve sequentially. Orders in Asia and the fire products business increased year over year in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Operating profit grew 24%, including 11 points from favorable FX and 20 points from the GE Security acquisition. The large negative impact from lower organic revenues was partially offset by the benefits of integration of field operations, restructuring, and cost controls. For the full year, we continue to expect revenue to be up 20% plus and operating profit up 225 to $250 million.</p>
          <p>Turning to the aerospace businesses on slide seven, at Pratt &amp; Whitney revenues declined 9% in the quarter, driven by lower overall aftermarket volumes and significantly lower OEM shipments at both Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada and Power Systems. Military revenues were flat while favorable currency conversion at Pratt Canada contributed three points to revenues. Large commercial engines spares revenues were down mid-teens while book to bill was slightly above one. As Greg said, Pratt Canada engine shipments were down 35% from a strong first quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Operating margin at 16% was 30 basis points higher than prior year. The impact from lower revenues, particularly of higher margin spares, was more than offset by restructuring benefits, favorable foreign currency at Pratt Canada, and lower E&amp;D. Recent improvements in air traffic trends are consistent with our expectation of higher commercial aftermarket revenues in the back half of 2010. And for the full year, we remain confident in Pratt's operating profit increase of 75 to $100 million on low single digit growth in revenues.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, Hamilton Sundstrand operating profit grew 6% on 3% lower revenues. Aero OEM revenues were down high single digit, while aerospace aftermarket and commercial spares were both up low single digit. Industrial revenues were also up slightly. Commercial spares orders were up low double digit versus the weak first quarter 2009 levels. Book to bill was slightly above one. Industrial orders increased mid-teens on a constant currency basis. Orders improved across all industrial businesses with over 20% growth in the Sullair compressor business, a positive sign as this segment has been a leading indicator.</p>
          <p>Operating margin expanded 130 basis points, reflecting the benefits from restructuring, cost control, and lower E&amp;D, which more than offset the impact of lower revenues. For the full year, we continue to expect Hamilton Sundstrand's operating profit to be up 25 to $50 million, and revenue up slightly.</p>
          <p>On slide nine, turning to Sikorsky, operating profits grew 25% on 2% higher revenues. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 51 large helicopters, 44 based on military platforms and seven commercial, reflecting the continuing strength of the military business and the weakness in the commercial markets.</p>
          <p>Operating margin expanded 190 basis points in the quarter, with 10.6% from favorable mix of military and aftermarket shipments and the absence of approximately $20 million first quarter 2009 payment of a union contract ratification bonus. E&amp;D spend was slightly higher in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Final assembly of the first international BLACK HAWK was completed in March at Mielec in Poland. This new radiant uses a global supply chain and is the first BLACK HAWK helicopter assembled in Europe.</p>
          <p>We remain confident in Sikorsky's 2010 guidance with deliveries of 250 to 260 large helicopters, revenues up high single digits, and operating profit up 100 to $125 million.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to Greg for a wrap-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, Akhil; a very solid quarter, great cost performance, great margin expansion, and all that came with good cash conversion as well and signs of life in the end markets.</p>
          <p>Some other highlights from the quarter, I think most importantly we closed on the GE Security acquisition. The F&amp;S team is now focused on the hard work of integration of this really wonderful property into the F&amp;S family.</p>
          <p>Carrier continues to implement its portfolio transformation agenda as well. Since the beginning of the year, Carrier has announced new divestitures or joint ventures for about $200 million in annualized revenue, and that's in addition to the $1.7 billion previously completed.</p>
          <p>On the Aero side, Pratt &amp; Whitney's GTF engine continues to gain momentum in the market, with the Bombardier CSeries order for 40 firm and 40 option aircraft from Republic Airways. And Hamilton Sundstrand was recognized as Supplier of the Year by the Boeing Company for its performance on the 787 program.</p>
          <p>Okay, as for the outlook for all of 2010, while there is still some uncertainty regarding the pace of global economic recovery and foreign currency continues to be a forecasting challenge, we are very confident in our revised EPS guidance of 4.50 to 4.65 a share. As I said before, we continue to expect revenues of 54 to 55 billion. That's up 2% to 4% from last year.</p>
          <p>And as I stated earlier, order trends are improving. And that's all in line with our expectations for organic growth to resume in the second half of the year. Our full-year expectation for organic growth remains in the range of zero to 2%.</p>
          <p>No other changes to guidance for 2010. We still expect 350 million of gross restructuring, partially offset by one-time gains of about 100 million. Our restructuring in the first quarter was lower than we expected due to the timing of some of the projects. We continue to expect gross restructuring charges of 200 million and about 25 million of one-time gains in the first half of the year. So that's about $0.08 of net restructuring in the second quarter if I can do the math for you.</p>
          <p>E&amp;D was down slightly in the first quarter, but we still expect full year to be up about 150 million, due primarily to GTF development and the acquisition of GE Security. And of course, we continue to expect free cash flow to equal or be in excess of net income.</p>
          <p>Share repurchase, our guidance remains at 1.5 billion for the full year. And we're keeping our $3 billion placeholder for acquisitions for 2010, of which 2.1 billion was used in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>While the world feels much better than it did three months ago, keep in mind that it is still April and our guidance relies on organic growth in the back half of the year, particularly in the high margin commercial aero aftermarket. As always, we remain confident but cautious. We also remain focused on what we control, and we continue to position UTC to outperform.</p>
          <p>As of the end of this year, we will have invested over 1.5 billion since the beginning of 2008 in restructuring to rationalize our cost structure. At the same time, we continue to focus on moving to low-cost sources, and we're reshaping business unit portfolios to become simpler and more focused, to deliver consistently higher returns. And on the top line, we continue to invest in game changing technologies and to enhance our presence in growth markets to fuel sustainable top line growth in excess of global GDP growth.</p>
          <p>In closing, we're confident in delivering our 2010 commitments, and the leadership team is committed to generating double-digits earnings growth in 2011 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Let me stop there. Tricia, let's open it up for questions if we could.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll take our first question from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Joe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, just on organic growth, company-wide you had said 2 to 3% down for Q1 and you came in minus four. And my sense is that Q2 might be a little lower than you were thinking a couple months ago. Is it in Aerospace that you're seeing the weakness, and what's your confidence level on that full-year guidance, which you didn't change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think organic growth did come in a little bit lighter than what we expected. I think there are really three places that I would point to. F&amp;S was down organically about 8%. I think that was a little bit lower than what we had expected. Orders have started to pick up there sequentially but still a pretty tough environment on the F&amp;S side. Also, you saw we were down 9% organically at Pratt. That was a big number for us, but of course, that was really pretty much in line with expectations given the big backlog that burned down in last year's first quarter.</p>
          <p>The other place I would say is probably Sikorsky came in a little bit light. They delivered only two more helicopters this year than last year. Part of that is just the nature of the commercial business where we had a little problem with some of the customers and we didn't get some things delivered that we probably could have. I expect again second quarter will be a better story than first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada spares, you gave us the big Pratt, but how did that look in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe, it was down in the like mid to high teens level excluding FX.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how does that compare to what you saw late last year, and what do you think is going to happen in the next couple quarters there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think a little worse than what we saw last year, but we do believe fully because of the improvement in the traffic that we are seeing in the customers' use of the business jets, that number should improve as we go through the year. So we do believe this quarter was probably the lowest compares that Pratt would see all of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I just want to &#x2013; on the first question I asked on the organic growth, I want to get back to that just for one second. Fire &amp; Security at negative 8%, where was the weakness organically because that has been a pretty stable business historically? Was it Fire or Security and any details you can give?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, really we saw weakness really around the globe, particularly even in the US, Australasia. I think the one bright spot in the quarter was Asia itself. But for the rest of the markets, it was really pretty much down across the board.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the things, Joe, if I might add, it's not huge. While it was a little lower than we expected, the orders in the third quarter last year for F&amp;S were down 14%. They were down eight in third, and they are now down three in the first quarter, so we are seeing an improving trend. And again like Pratt, we do believe that the organic compares would start to get better for F&amp;S as well going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Ron.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When we think about volume coming back through the business, how much of the cost takeout do you expect to be sticky? How much of it is going to go away when volume comes back to the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the placeholder that we have been talking about for the last year or so is about two-thirds of the costs that we have been taking out are structural and should not come back when volume comes back. A third of the costs are just related to the volume reductions that we've seen. Headcount has been taken down sharply at Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada. Obviously it has come down sharply at Carrier with the volumes coming down. The BL piece will come back. But as far as the other cost savings, those things ought to stick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so we're thinking that's what, 5 &#x2013; 600 million of cost takeout, ballpark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's probably a good ballpark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then maybe one other question. On the geared fan, if we were to see a reengining announcement from Airbus or Boeing this year and it did involve a geared turbofan architecture engine, what kind of investment would you expect that would be in terms of R&amp;D for Pratt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I think every time you look at a large commercial engine, you're talking about an investment somewhere in the neighborhood of $1 billion. But you've got to keep in mind that's over probably a four to five-year period, and there's lots of partners involved.</p>
          <p>The clear preference, of course, is to offer GTF through the IAE [International Aero Engines] joint venture because that takes a big burden of the E&amp;D onto the partners. Even if we don't end up going through IAE, you can be assured that we will have lots of partners willing to sign up for that. So at least half of engine would probably be partnered out regardless; so again, all manageable within the context of UTX.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So we're thinking it would be 150 &#x2013; 200 million a year, something like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, $1 billion over five years is 200 million a year. Half of that would be on our nickel, so 100 million a year rough numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning.</p>

          <p>Hi, Jeff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, I was wondering if you can provide a little bit more color on where the cash flow upside is coming from, and specifically I'm wondering given the actions you've taken at Carrier, are you seeing &#x2013; although you are in your seasonal low ebb, are you seeing better cash performance there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Carrier I think was probably the most pleasant surprise in the quarter, not just from margin expansion, but also they had a positive free cash flow in the quarter, which considering it is their big inventory build quarter, it was remarkable performance. Carrier's inventory was up a couple hundred million in the quarter, but their turns were up over a point.</p>
          <p>So if you take a look at working capital, I think last year was an outflow of 700 million, this year only about 200 million, so that's really where the strength came in. If you parse that down and inventory was up in the quarter, but not up as much as it probably otherwise would have been, so turns have actually improved. Across UTC, working capital turns have improved.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I would bet that typically Carrier is negative cash flow in Q1 going back forever.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think that's a permanent structural change in the business that you're going to &#x2013; it's going to be seasonally weighted still to the middle of the year. But the working capital and other changes have inherently changed the cash flow of Carrier to the good?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it certainly changed it for the good. Obviously as we get out of distribution, we're not sitting there with all of that inventory that gets shipped from the factories into distribution. We still have the receivables, however. Carrier is always going to be light cash first half of the year because of the big impact of the summer cooling. But again, structurally having gotten rid of or divested of a big piece of the distribution businesses so far, that has taken a big piece of working capital and put it on somebody else's balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now you did indicate that raw mats were favorable in the quarter, and I'm sure that helped Carrier. I just wonder how the channel is acting relative to price with potentially hearing negative footsteps on cost as we progress through the back half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it was about a little less than or about a penny, I guess I would say, of headwind at Carrier in the quarter &#x2013; I'm sorry, tailwind associated with raw materials. Copper was lower this year than last year. Copper has gone up. We've seen it around $3.60. I think when Geraud gave guidance last month, we were talking about a $3 average price. It's probably going to be more like 3.15 now.</p>
          <p>Pricing is obviously very difficult in the market. Channel inventory is actually down we think year over year. And I think it's going to be tough to push price in the back half of the year even with raw materials going up because there's so much excess capacity. At the same time, everybody else has essentially the same cost structure as we do in terms of inputs. So given Carrier's scale, I think we're better positioned to take advantage of the market than many of the others.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if you have the data, do you know how GE Security performed organically in the quarter if you look at it on a pro forma basis?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Our next question comes from Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning, Greg. Good morning, Akhil. Hey, Greg, I wonder if we talk about some of the pieces in Otis, be it the China orders very, very strong, the profit forecast biased to the upside but revenues unchanged. First question is, is the way to put those pieces together just mix. And secondly, can you address the question a lot of people are wondering here about in terms of a China property bubble?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>China property, let's get to that one last...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...because I don't have an answer for you. I think the Otis story in the first quarter was really one on the cost performance side. New equipment was down 7%. Even service was down slightly. But overall, really it was a great quarter because they took out a lot of cost. They got 240 basis points of margin expansion. About 50 basis points of that came just from mix. I would also tell you that they got a big piece of benefit from currency obviously, and that's actually going to be a headwind for them as they go throughout the year.</p>
          <p>We don't expect this kind of performance to continue throughout the year. Obviously they've hit a big piece of their guidance here in the first quarter. But for the full year, we still expect new equipment to be down 5 to 10%. Service has to come back from the first quarter levels before we're going to be able to take their guidance up.</p>
          <p>Now as far as China, orders were up just about 50% there. But again, that's off of a very low compare. Last year's first quarter was down 40%, so you do the math and we're still not back to where we were in the 2008 levels even though the headline 50% sounds really, really good.</p>
          <p>Clearly the Chinese government is concerned about a property bubble. We've seen some of the actions that they've taken here in the last couple of weeks in terms of trying to limit property sales and increasing down payments and such. But quite frankly, we haven't been very much impacted by that. Most of the growth we've seen in the social housing and in some of the western provinces where the housing bubble isn't nearly as apparent as what we see on the east side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and very helpful there. And then on the confidence in the second half, Pratt commercial spares improvement, you mentioned &#x2013; referenced some of the macro factors out there that also all of us are seeing. I'm wondering if there's anything more on the micro level at this point. Are there customer indications or anything on those lines that you can point to that reinforce your confidence on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; I'd love to be able to point to inductions into the engine centers or customers telling us that they're going to be sending a bunch of engines in. But quite frankly, it really goes back to the macro view that as RPMs increase, and we saw them up double digits here in February, I think we're going to continue to see engines come back.</p>
          <p>Right now as we look at why are spares down so much at Pratt, it's really because the overhauls still continue to be these light overhauls instead of the regular heavy overhauls in the engine centers. So average spare parts are down maybe 30% on some of these repairs here of these engines going through the shop. So again, we expect as traffic picks up, the airlines become more profitable during the course of the year, we're going to see a return to more normal levels of repair activity and spares sales. Obviously, this problem with the volcano in Iceland isn't helping matters any. I think the industry probably lost a couple of billion dollars of revenue. But despite that, I still think we're pretty confident that we're just going to see a lot of engines come back and we're going to have to see parts come back relatively robustly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just lastly on M&amp;A, I'm wondering. There's still around $1 billion on the placeholder for this year. How are you thinking about the public versus private opportunities out there? I guess if you look at the valuations in the public market moving up, does that shift your focus to the private side more, or not necessarily?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not necessarily, I think we remain open to deals both public or private. Obviously as valuations pick up, it becomes more difficult to do a deal. We like to buy for value. I think GE Security is a great example of that. And as we sit here today, we don't see any big deals on the horizon. But as we sat here at the end of the first quarter last year, we didn't know about GE Security either. So deals happen when they happen, and we continue to evaluate a lot of different things. And we'll just have to see how they all develop.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, I just wanted to go back to one thing you just said. So the engine shop visits right now, as the works go unchanged, you're not seeing people moving back towards a normal work scope in terms of the shop visits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is exactly right. That's one of the things I think that as we think about what's going to change during the course of the year, I think the airlines again as they have more cash and can afford the bigger repair bills, we're going to see that just naturally pick up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then this would be the time, I guess, just on Carrier, especially on the residential side, when you would be building inventory for the cooling season. Can you talk at all about what your production schedules look like now as in April and May versus a year ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Orders are &#x2013; as we start to look at the beginning of April at least, orders are certainly trending up on the cooling side. We're running a full shift in Collierville. Right now, we're not working a second shift. We didn't work any overtime at all last year. I'll tell you that production is ramping up in Collierville though. We expect really good growth for the cooling season here coming up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on F&amp;S, at the Analyst Day, I guess the comment was that February was the first positive organic growth in I think it was 18 months, something of that sort. Did that continue into March and April? Or is the discussion about the organic growth being a little bit less a sign that perhaps it didn't continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the reference, Sam, was to the orders, organic orders were up in February, and we saw the improvement in orders for the quarter. As I said, it was down only 3% compared with down 8 and down 14 in the prior two quarters. So I think we still expect maybe some negative organic orders, one or two, just given the lead time of the conversion of those orders. But we do expect that to turn around and be positive in the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you.</p>

          <p>We'll take our next question from Howard Rubel with Jefferies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Greg, you pointed out about the volcano, so some of your EcoWash business I'm sure was up a little bit here. But more you talked about working capital improvement. Could you address a little bit why that has happened, especially at Carrier? I know you talked about distribution, but that's not really all of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Should we comment on EcoWash? Obviously it's probably the biggest growth opportunity we have right now is washing engines in Europe. But I don't think that's probably not going to drive Pratt's second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I know that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the working capital at Carrier, if you look at it, inventory as I said was up a couple of hundred million dollars, but that is much less than what we had seen in previous years. Again, I think there's not a lot of inventory out in the channel right now, but Carrier has taken out so much structural cost and they have such a tight focus on cash, CapEx, and the whole working capital area, I think that they've just really been able to turn the corner. Cash has been strong at Carrier really since the last half of last year going into the first quarter. So as you take the residential distribution business out, that takes a big piece of working capital out. We don't have to carry all that inventory that we previously did.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I mean you've done a nice job. It shows with the numbers at Carrier in the aggregate. Is there still some more trimming around the edges, or are there some things that you need to do to strengthen the franchise as you reposition it from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've announced, as I said, a couple hundred million dollars of dispositions in the first quarter. That's the distribution in California. That's going to go into a joint venture here shortly. We're still working on some of the other distribution here in the States. I think we've got the Northeast and Canada left. We're also probably looking at divesting or joint venturing some of our other European and South American residential HVAC. So again, that's all part of this ongoing we think we're going to get to $2.5 billion of net asset &#x2013; or net revenue divestitures. So we're probably 75% of the way there now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to follow up on one other thing is research and development obviously is a function of projects and timing and other things. But could you address where you are with the runoff on the 787 at Hamilton? I mean the numbers really were a nice improvement year on year in terms of profitability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hamilton did see a big improvement year over year in E&amp;D on the 787. They're down about $15 million, still a little higher than the run rate we expect for the year there. That's not unusual in this phase of the flight test program. For the full year, we still expect about 100 million or so of spend on the 787 program. The first quarter was probably 35% or so of that total.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I apologize if this had been asked. I joined late. Greg, were there any changes to your underlying assumptions at Carrier for the year by market, whether it be res, commercial, truck, trailer, container, any of the guidance points that you gave at the Investor Conference?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, the order rates are up wonderfully at Transicold and probably a little bit stronger even than we had anticipated. If you think about truck trailer, North America is up. Truck trailer Europe combined, those are up over 80% in orders in the quarter from a very low base. On the commercial side, commercial HVAC still down around the world ex-Asia. But again, trend line is improving there.</p>
          <p>I think overall, we just feel better about the year. For the year, still only expecting about 2% organic revenue growth there, so it's not &#x2013; we haven't really forecast a big increase. Orders are better. I think we feel a lot more confident in the guidance. But a lot of that guidance confidence is coming simply from the cost traction that we've seen in the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so nothing really changed in terms of the underlying assumptions by market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it probably would be a better conversation we have as the cooling season takes hold. And maybe we can have this again in a couple of months' time when we have better information.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, Greg, looking out to 2011 in terms of headwinds, how should we think about in terms of quantifying F-22 and C-17 and then Shuttle? Could you give us an idea of what each of those headwinds might look like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know that I can actually quantify the exact dollar amount. We know that production on the F-22 is going to end after the first quarter of next year. C-17, we think production will go down. We think there will probably be eight aircraft in the DoD budget versus 16 this year. And obviously the Space Shuttle going away is impacting Rocketdyne even this year. So those are known headwinds.</p>
          <p>I think on the upside, you're going to see a recovery at Pratt Canada next year. And I think spares are going to come back relatively strong in the back half of this year and into next year to offset a big piece of that headwind at Pratt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll take our next question from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much. Could you give us some color on the sequential monthly trends in the commercial aftermarket at both Pratt and Hamilton Sundstrand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Typically, Cai, we don't talk about monthly data as such. But I think the point to make probably would be that there is improvement in Hamilton that we have been seeing as evidenced in our overall quarterly numbers. And it's not surprising given the broader base that they have across the aircraft around the world. Hamilton is the first one to see the improvement. They also saw improvement in the provisioning side, which is also encouraging to see.</p>
          <p>On Pratt, I think that gets impacted more by the fleets that they're on and the parts aircraft phenomenon which you are well aware of. Also to remind you that Pratt spares for first quarter last year was the strongest quarter of the year for last year. So I think when we do talk about significant decline year over year, we still believe that it's due to tough compares, and that should get easier as the year goes around, in addition to the improving traffic and the phenomenon that Greg talked about of maybe higher, heavier build schedules as the engines come back later on this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I didn't really want specific, we were up 10% or whatever by month. But just any general color as you went through the quarter, was January the worst? Did things get a little bit better in general? Was it about level? Any color to that extent would be very helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Cai; we look at things on like a three-month rolling average here. Things are very lumpy day to day, week to week, and month to month. January was &#x2013; really the whole quarter was just about on forecast where we had expected it to be. There were no surprises either positively or negatively in the quarter on spare run rates at Pratt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then also could you walk us through &#x2013; I joined a little late. Transicold, clearly truck trailer was strong. The orders were strong. When do you expect that to translate into volume, and do you have any sequential color? Are things really starting to pick up or was it even throughout the quarter? Any color there would be greatly appreciated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Just bear in mind, Cai, that the order compares could be slightly different than revenues because orders in first quarter for last year at Transicold were down over 60%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Even though they're up a lot, while the revenues were not down as much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think because of the backlog, sometimes you have slightly different compares on orders versus the revenues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of translating the orders regarding Q1, I think we should expect to see that at Carrier in the next three to six months. We still believe, as Geraud said in March, that container and truck trailer should see somewhere in the neighborhood of 20% or so increase year over year. That's what we expect the market to do. One or two of the quarters might be different, but that's what the full-year outlook still remains.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll take our next question from Robert Stallard with Macquarie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Rob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of quick ones on the aftermarket. Greg, you did note that Hamilton Sundstrand saw the aero aftermarket up low single digit and the commercial spares orders up low double digit. Does this imply you're being a little bit conservative about how the aftermarket is going to track this year at HS, and are you confident that your supply chain is ready for this pickup in aftermarket demand through 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't believe you're accusing us of being conservative. It was a good quarter. In fact, I think it was a little bit of a positive surprise for us because for the year, we had expected aftermarket to be up high single digits at Hamilton. Obviously, when orders are up in excess of that, that's always good news.</p>
          <p>As far as the supply chain goes, we have not seen any real issue with supply chain. Keep in mind, the supply chain problems of two and three years ago were on some record volumes, and we've come off of those and pretty much adjusted to that. So right now, I think we could clearly handle 10 &#x2013; 15% increase in sales without any disruption to the supply chain or bumps from the supply chain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just quickly, did you get your normal price increases in the spare parts aftermarket at the start of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, both Pratt and Hamilton published catalogs back in the first of October. I think spare parts price increases averaged around 5%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks very much.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll take our next question from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Doug.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Going back to the geared turbofan, you referred to $1 billion of investment if Airbus or Boeing decided to reengine with it, and that's a typical cost for a new engine. What I'm trying to understand is if you're already developing a similar thrust class engine for the MS-21 (sic) [MC-21] , doesn't that imply that you would be spending that money anyway? And also, wouldn't that have implications for how you would structure investment in something like an IAE structure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Doug, you're exactly right. Obviously if you build an engine for the A320 family, which is going to be very similar to the MC-21 that's we're building for Irkut, there are obviously big synergies on the core side. You still have obviously &#x2013; there's specific testing that you have to do, certification testing and all that. But that $1 billion number comes down materially if you're able to use the same core from plane to plane.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so I mean I would expect you to be able to do that given what the aircraft looked like. And if you go that way, do you envision &#x2013; let's say you sold it through IAE. Wouldn't you envision having a much larger share in terms of revenues coming out of IAE given your investment and your intellectual property you would be contributing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Those are all things, Doug, that we're talking to the partners about today. Obviously we very much want to do the Airbus reengining through the IAE joint venture. Most of the partners are aligned with us. One of them is not, and that's part of the problem or one of the reasons why this is more difficult than it otherwise would be to forecast for you guys. But we're working on every possible scenario with Airbus, with IAE, and with our partners.</p>
          <p>I think if we can't come to a conclusion with Rolls-Royce on this on how IAE goes forward, clearly Pratt is going to go it alone. And when I say go it alone, it means that we'll still have partners. So to your point, we'll get a lot more than a third of the revenues in a geared turbofan engine program than we see on the V2500 today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Doug, I was only going to say, as you well know, it's still all a hypothetical discussion. There is still a lot to happen between now and before Airbus decides to reengine and put GTF on. Better guidance, better direction, as we always provide, we will give all this data to you once those decisions are made and we are further along.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then if I can quickly, a decline in service revenues at Otis. Typically Otis is something that service tends to improve year over year in good times and bad times. Why do you think service is down, and what's your thinking about that for the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Service was down in the first quarter, but just slightly. You're talking about 1% or so. And as you look at the three pieces of service, the biggest piece of the service revenue comes out of the contractual maintenance. That's about two-thirds of the revenue. That was actually up, as it normally is. That just keeps growing every single year as the number of units under service contract grow.</p>
          <p>What was down in the quarter was repair and modernization, and they're probably equal in terms of their weighting in the revenues. Modernization was down the most though. That's one of the things that we think will come back strongly in the back half of the year. There's still a requirement in Europe to modernize all the older elevators. So we expect, as we typically do, that repair and mod will pick up as the year goes on. That's just a natural tendency; our guys who are out there, they're selling this, and building owners have to get things done by the end of the year. That's just a &#x2013; it was a bad first quarter, but again it doesn't really cause us concern for the year yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll take our next question from Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Greg, a question on Otis as well. On the new equipment orders, can you break those out in terms of geography? Was largely all the strength in orders from China, or was there strength elsewhere?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you think about it, North America was down about 30% on new equipment. And Akhil said Europe was flat, which was the second quarter in a row that Europe has been flat. In China, we saw orders up nearly 50%. So again, keep in mind as we said before, that's off of a very easy compare when orders were down 40% last year. But the strength is really in Asia right now.</p>
          <p>Commercial construction continues to be a problem here in North America. I think the only good news we saw today, I think ABI finally came out and it's trending positively. Still not at the 50% level, but again we're going to have a tough year in new equipment in North America, and it's probably not going to be great in Europe either. But that trend will reverse. Again, one of the reasons we're confident next year is going to be so much better is we're going to see a rebound in Otis new equipment next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then another question on M&amp;A. You answered it from one angle but I wanted to take it from another, which is we haven't seen strategic M&amp;A in commercial aerospace from you guys since I think Hamilton Sundstrand in the late '90s. Can you talk a little bit about where you see opportunities in that arena? And how are you addressing gaining share with COMAC given you know their long-term ambitions in China? Are we going to see more joint ventures out in Asia as a consequence of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're exactly right, Heidi. I think what you're going to see &#x2013; COMAC is an important customer in an important market. Pratt and Hamilton have been working with the AVIC companies for a number of years. I think we view the COMAC opportunity as unique in that we will be able to at least from the Hamilton Sundstrand side develop a joint venture to supply the COMAC aircraft within China and also to use those joint ventures as low cost sources for the rest of the products that we deliver. So I think that's the good news.</p>
          <p>As well on the engine, although we did not win the initial competition on the engine, we're still talking to the COMAC folks about potential for the GTF on the next generation or the next version of that aircraft. So lots of opportunity in China on commercial aviation. And most of it is going to happen through joint venturing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But does this interest you in being larger in commercial aero from an M&amp;A standpoint? I mean are there more things that you think you ought to be buying to expand this new entrant? I mean we have a duopoly market that some day over the decade is going to be an oligopoly. How are you positioning for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we look at commercial aero opportunities, it's primarily in the aftermarket space. You've seen Pratt &amp; Whitney has been doing this a number of years. We just opened up the China Eastern joint venture to overhaul CFM engines. We opened up the Turkish engine overhaul center, again a CFM overhaul shop.</p>
          <p>And as we think about M&amp;A opportunities, it's really in the aftermarket area. I mean there are three engine manufacturers out there or three big engine manufacturers out there. It's hard to do consolidation there. Obviously there's opportunity on the Hamilton side from a systems perspective to go down the wires and to offer assistance. But some of the big aero subsystem suppliers are very expensive. And I think our money is better spent on the aftermarket where the margins are better and the opportunities are greater.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Terrific, thank you so much, Greg.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Heidi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll take our next question from George Shapiro with Access 342.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, if you go through Hamilton Sundstrand's aftermarket and break it out by the provisioning, the piece parts, and the maintenance, so is there much difference in any of those categories?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>George, this is Akhil. The provisioning orders came back a little stronger, as you would imagine, because they had fallen off a lot in first quarter last year, so easier compares there. Piece parts were up, so both were up in terms of orders, provisioning probably a little more than piece parts. And then in terms of revenue, I think it was about the same. Provisioning was still a little down, but piece parts were up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then if you look at Carrier, you got almost $100 million increase in profit in the quarter, so why wouldn't 175 for the year be conservative? And then if you can just comment on how much of that Carrier profit if at all significant came from the Watsco joint venture?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first quarter was very strong. You're absolutely right, George. But if you take a look, we did get a big benefit in the quarter. We had a very strong summer selling season down in South America, in Brazil, and in Argentina. We also had tailwind from commodities that's not going to repeat. It's actually going to be headwind in the back half of the year.</p>
          <p>But to your point, I think as we look at the guidance for Carrier, we're very confident that they're going to be at the top end and perhaps above that, not based again on revenues but just on the very strong cost traction that we've seen in the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, Greg, the Watsco, is there a significant number you get there from the way you accrue the joint venture profit in Carrier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not a big number, especially in the first quarter, George. We've got 40% of that joint venture, so we're picking up a pro rata share of the earnings, but it's just not significant in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me sneak in one more, Greg. 700 million, almost 700 million increase in inventories. You mention a couple hundred was probably Carrier. Can you break out where the rest is from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if you think about that, about 200 million of that came from the GE Security transaction, and another 230 or so I think was at Sikorsky. And again, that's just part of the issue that we talked about in terms of some of the commercial aircraft not getting shipped in the quarter that's going to go out here in the second quarter. Most of the other units had very, very small increases, if at all. It was mostly the big pieces.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

Real strong quarter, obviously we're confident in the improved full-year outlook. Thanks for listening. Akhil and the team will be around to answer your questions throughout the day. Thank you.</p>
