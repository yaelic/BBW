          <p>Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Good afternoon and welcome to our Q2 conference call. First, I would like to focus on the highlights of the second quarter 2008 and I'll give you an update on the integration of the National Starch business as well as the Global Integration Program and then Lothar Steinebach, our CFO, will provide you with the Q2 financials in greater detail, as well as the outlook. After that I will comment on the priorities for 2008 and finally, we'll take your questions.</p>
          <p>I'd like to begin by reminding everyone that the presentation, which contains the usual formal disclaimer to forward-looking statements within the meaning of the relevant US legislation, can be accessed via our website at Henkel.com\rr. The presentation discussions are conducted subject to the disclaimer. We will not read the disclaimer, but propose we take it as read into the records for the purpose of this conference call.</p>
          <p>Now let me start with the highlights of the second quarter of 2008. We had a strong organic growth of 6.1% compared to a 3.3% organic growth in the first quarter. We continue to see double-digit sales growth in our emerging markets, in this quarter 15.7% organic, which made the share of the emerging markets becoming 36% in the second quarter of our total business, up from 34% in the same quarter in previous years. We saw an EBIT, adjusted EBIT growth, of 7.8% and we saw an adjusted EPS of minus 5.5% the delta lies in the financial items which Lothar will discuss in a moment. We continue to make progress in our networking capital and percentage of sales with a decline of 160 basis points to 13.1%, down from 14.7 in 2007 same quarter. What is equally important throughout the quarter we increased through work on our Global Excellence, the National Starch integration program. We have increased our target savings for the remainder of 2008 from &#x20AC;20 million to &#x20AC;50 million.</p>
          <p>Now let me give you an update on the National Starch acquisition more in detail. We have the first 100 days completed mid July and I would say looking back it's been a successful 100, first 100 days. We've implemented the new organizational management structure. It has been announced and implemented the first three levels and, as I'm certain you have noticed we also made a management change in the mid of June with Thomas Geitner taking over 3.5 months earlier than planned from Alois Linder. We've gone through and reaffirmed the initial savings assumptions of &#x20AC;250 million from a bottom up standpoint and, as indicated before, we have increased our saving targets for 2008 to &#x20AC;20 million. The first integration measures of 23 million has been announced, there's also booking to our P&amp;L in the second quarter, which I'm certain you have seen.</p>
          <p>On the revenue synergy side, we do see what we originally planned a 70, $80 million opportunity-- excuse me, euro opportunity. We have gone through both from a segment standpoint, i.e. business group, and also from a regional standpoint with the new management team and the revenue synergies of 70 to &#x20AC;80 million have been confirmed also along with the new strategies, which has been decided and defined within our new structure. The cost synergies of 170 to 180 million are also now confirmed. We've had negotiations with almost all our major suppliers and we will finalize the remaining outstanding in the next quarter. We have gone through an extensive manufacturing footprint exercise, which shows significant potential and along these lines we've already announced the site closure of three sites in North America, respectively Canada and we expect around with the final analysis to be able to announce further consolidation within our manufacturing footprint by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>On our marketing, sales and R&amp;D we have consolidation programs going on and, as I am certain you have seen on our Adhesives business we have had strong growth and we've been able to maintain the focus in our marketing and sales group while at the same time looking upon and taking the first cut at our product roadmaps within our R&amp;D consolidation program. Which brings me to the savings from the integration, at this stage; we are maintaining our target of 250 million. We have increased our target for 2008 up from 10 to 20 million. We expect to realize the savings on 90% of the savings within the first two years or so. As of 2010 we expect savings of 225 million &#x2013; &#x20AC;225 million, which account for 90% of the entire savings.</p>
          <p>Basically what it means is that we believe that we are on track with the integration program. We are in the process of finalizing the final concepts and actions and owners to ensure that we capture the synergies at the appropriate times and at the right stages of our business. As I said before, we have announced our management levels one to three and we believe will be done by the remaining of the organization by yearend. We'll realize our first synergies of 20 million in the third and the fourth quarter and at the same time we're keeping the focus on the existing business. And I think it's important at this stage to make the following comment. During the integration phase it is extremely important to find the right balance between the internal focus to drive cost out and the external focus to continue to move the business forward. And I believe that the numbers have shown in the second quarter that we've been capable of finding the right balance between internal and external by identifying opportunities that double the amount of savings from 10 to 20 and at the same time establishing a sound business in the second quarter of our adhesives business.</p>
          <p>Now let me give you an update on where we are on our Global Excellence program. We announced our Global Excellence program by the end of February and the program is aimed at driving efficiency in the following three areas; first, adapt to changing market environments. What I mean by that is really twofold. It is ensuring that we have the right resources and capabilities at the right geographical markets i.e. invest in the markets that grow and apply the right cost structures to the market that stagnate. The second thing is also change our manufacturing footprints to ensure that we have the optimal set up, not only geographically in order to optimize our distribution and transportation costs but also to ensure that we are set up in a way to supply the market in the right condition, particularly when markets change as an example, in our detergent's business where the market is rapidly changing from a powder of doing business to a fluid business.</p>
          <p>And the third one is continue to expand the utilization of our shared services centers, which we initiated a couple of years ago. This was the framework of our Global Excellence program as we announced it in February. In May, we gave you the first update of where we were and at that stage we had defined projects in the area of 315 million approximately 40% -- no 60% of the total program of 500 million. Today we have defined programs and announced programs to the tune of 435 million, which is almost 90% done. We expect the remaining part of the programs, so the remaining 10% of the programs, the delta between 435 and 500 to be concluded and finally decided in the next 30 days.</p>
          <p>If you look at one, how we're applying the projects by business sector we are taking 17% of the 435 and using that for programs that are associated to our corporate set up. We're taking 21% of the 435 or approximately 100 million and applying that to our adhesives business and this is on top of what we're doing with the National Starch integration to be clear.</p>
          <p>We're taking 25% of our program and applying that to our cosmetics and toiletries business and we're taking a disproportionately high amount, 37%, and applying that to our laundry and homecare business and I'm certain when you read our results you will also be able to understand the logic why we're doing it the way we're doing it. If you then do the geographical cut, what you can see is that 95% of all the programs are applied to our EMEA and North American group, so what we're doing is we're taking and applying our programs to the slowest growing markets that we have globally while at the same time protecting the growth markets we have to ensure that we continue to invest in our growth regions that allow us to grow as we're doing at this stage. And I think it's appropriate just to give you an insight in a couple of the programs we've set up that will give you insight to what we're doing and the way we're doing it.</p>
          <p>Let me now start with our Home Care business. What we've done is over the last three months we have totally redesigned our manufacturing footprint and our supply chain strategy for our European setup of our Home Care Group. That has led to the shutdown of our production site of Malgrat in Spain and consolidated our entire Home Care manufacturing to Montorn&#xE9;s. We are shutting down production sites in Germany, i.e., Genthin and moving our entire manufacturing footprint to D&#xFC;sseldorf.</p>
          <p>We at the same time also reorganized our managing and sales organization within Western Europe. So what we're doing is we're strategically defining the new footprint of the new organization, both from a supply chain standpoint and from a sales organization and subsequent designing programs to be aligned with the new strategy that we have set up.</p>
          <p>In our Adhesives business, we have &#x2013; following our merger of our consumer and our industry business last year, we now streamlined our industrial adhesives organization to respond to the new market needs and to the product roadmap that we have. We have reduced our production capacity in order to increase our utilization rate. So we reduced our production capacity in Winsford, UK and that way getting a much higher utilization rate and better manufacturing footprint.</p>
          <p>In our corporate structure, we're expanding our Shared Services Centers in Bratislava and early on we announced the move of a lot of our admin functions in the US to Manila, so along the lines we announced previously consolidating transactional work in Shared Services Centers in Europe and in Asia. And here at corporate we announced in the month of June, the transfer of all R&amp;D &#x2013; central R&amp;D resources, into the business sectors with the objective of increasing speed and closeness to the market.</p>
          <p>The six projects or seven projects, I've just taken you through represent 30% of the currently defined restructuring volume, approximately 150 million. All of these projects have been announced and we are in the process of either directly executing or discussing with the local authorities and workers council the execution plans at this stage. But of the projects I just spoke about, the 435, these are all projects, which are known within the Henkel organization and within the local organizations and we are either in direct execution or in discussion with the local authorities, i.e., workers council's in the countries.</p>
          <p>Which brings me to the Global Excellence savings, we've increased the savings rate from 10 to 30 or put in different way, we've accelerated the savings speed from 10 to 30 in 2008. We expect to book the 500 million restructuring charge all in 2008 and we expect 80% of the savings from the entire program to be hitting our P&amp;L by the end of 2010.</p>
          <p>With this I would like to conclude on my part in saying we are well underway with our national starch integration. We are focusing on the savings while at the same time focusing &#x2013; at the same time focusing on the business and on Global Excellence. We've put enormous amount of effort in to ensure that we get the savings into our books as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p>With this, I will hand over to Lotha Steinebach.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I would like to first focus on sales and EBIT performance. And let me start with the sales growth by business sector. You've no doubt observed in our quarterly report that we have total growth in our Laundry &amp; Home Care business of minus 1.1% and adjusted for foreign exchange plus 3.6%, translating into organic growth of 3.9%. Of which 2.2 is from pricing and 1.7 is from volume. So that's a very significant increase in Q2 of the pricing impact that we have generated in our total growth in the Laundry &amp; Home Care division.</p>
          <p>Personal Care total growth of 1.2%, FX adjusted 5.8, translating into organic growth of 5.9, of which 1.4 is from pricing and 4.5 from strong volume growth, again in the second quarter 2008. Adhesives Technologies total growth 26.1, FX adjusted 34.6, again translating because of the National Starch acquisition into organic growth of 7.9%, of which 3.3 is from pricing, 4.6 from volume. That's again a big progress from the first quarter this year where we have had a negative volume impact.</p>
          <p>Now again, we've regained the momentum in terms of volume growth in our Adhesives Technologies division. Total Henkel growth 11.4%, adjusted for foreign exchange effect 17.7%. Now, the price volume mix, obviously is the mix of the all divisions, 2.6 pricing overall for Henkel and 3.5 from volume. So a good to very good volume growth and very active pricing in order to make up for the impact from the rising input costs.</p>
          <p>Let me first briefly concentrate on the impact of negative exchange rates, which have hit us in the second quarter. 6.3% on total growth, negative obviously the biggest impact from the US dollar, which has lost over the same period of last year $0.20 on average. So therefore the biggest impact is from the US dollar. Total negative exchange rate impact of more than EUR200 million in terms of our topline.</p>
          <p>Next brief comments on Laundry &amp; Home Care, strong organic growth regaining our momentum after a weaker first quarter, both Laundry &amp; Home Care have contributed to this strong organic growth with Home Care even stronger than Laundry. Particularly, worth of mentioning is the dynamic growth in emerging markets, which we have experienced in our Laundry &amp; Home Care division although in addition to that we've seen healthy growth rates in North America, even stronger growth rates than in our Adhesives division.</p>
          <p>Personal Care, almost 6% organic growth with strong growth in hair and body and dynamic growth again in emerging markets and in North America, so both Laundry Home Care and Personal Care have experienced good organic growth in North America contributing to the positive momentum that we have achieved for the total Henkel Group in North America in terms of organic growth.</p>
          <p>Finally, Adhesive Technologies, all segments have contributed to our strong growth of almost 8% in adhesives technologies, particularly strong obviously emerging markets growth but we've seen in all our industrial markets still some growth with varying degrees. So it's all been positive in all our customer markets, particularly strong and stronger in the first quarter, our Building Adhesives division and that particularly true in Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>Building Adhesives obviously been negative impacted in the first quarter because of weather conditions. That's the normal sequence of events during the year that we have a weaker first quarter in Building Adhesives and then a stronger two, three and four during the year. So that has contributed strongly to our strong organic growth in terms of volume in particular.</p>
          <p>Sales growth by region, very interesting picture, obviously looking at our organic growth in Europe, Africa, Middle East plus 6.2%, which looked particularly good compared to some of the news that we've seen about consumer sentiments prevailing in our markets but obviously, it needs to be noted that Europe includes Eastern Europe with very strong growth and Western Europe with slightly negative growth, so that's the composition of both resulting in 6.2 organic growth.</p>
          <p>North America 3.8 organic growth, we're particularly proud of this development very much because of Laundry Home Care and Personal Care have carried the major part of this growth. They've obviously exceeded the average of 3.8%.</p>
          <p>Latin America, 13.3% with all divisions contributing to good double-digit organic growth rates in Latin America obviously from a smaller base than in the other regions but very positive development in Latin America.</p>
          <p>Finally, Asia Pacific, the way we report Asia Pacific, obviously includes Japan, Australia and New Zealand and, therefore, net organic growth 6.6% is lower in those developed countries, Japan, Australia and New Zealand and higher in the emerging parts of Asia Pacific.</p>
          <p>Taking that all together, we have again reached double-digit organic growth in our emerging markets, thus resulting in a sales share of our total sales of 36% for the total Group, 15.7, almost 16% organic growth in Asia Pacific obviously strongly driven by our success in China, in the emerging countries, again very strong our performance in Eastern Europe, which is now taking share of our total sales approaching the size of our German business.</p>
          <p>EBIT growth by business sector, first of all one needs to note that in the negative development that we have reported for Laundry Home Care, Personal Care, which has over compensated the negative impact from foreign exchange effect and similarly adhesives technologies, which has profited from the National Starch acquisition in terms of absolute EBIT but which has also shown some growth in the underlying business.</p>
          <p>First of all, Laundry and Home Care with a negative impact on the margin of minus 150 basis points and adhesives of minus 40 basis points. I'll get to that in a moment, and a positive development in our personal care division.</p>
          <p>First of all, we need to take a look at the negative foreign exchange effect affecting our operating results, Laundry &amp; Home Care almost minus 5%, Personal Care minus 6% and Adhesives Technologies minus 8%, so that therefore results in the total businesses being negatively impacted by the negative development in foreign exchange rates of minus 6.7%.</p>
          <p>The next look needs to be taken at the margin dilution that we have experienced in the Laundry &amp; Home Care division and in the adhesives technologies division. First of all, we have experienced significant raw material cost increases, which we have not yet been able to pass on fully to our customers.</p>
          <p>Secondly, it needs to be taken into account when looking at our Laundry &amp; Home Care margin that we have had a one-off item last year of 8 million. Adjusting for the one-off of 8 million last year, which was the sale of our facility in Turkey, the dilution in our margin in the Laundry &amp; Home Care business would have been just 70 basis points.</p>
          <p>So it looks worse than it really is in terms of the underlying business but nevertheless we need to obviously observe that we have had negative impacts from the raw material price increases and the direct material price increases, which we need to obviously work on further in the second half of this year and we'll get to some of the plans that we have in order to compensate for the impact from those raw material price increases.</p>
          <p>Take a look at the adjusted earnings in order to provide the transparency and clarity that is needed in order to understand where we're coming from, reported EBIT in 2008 second quarter at 113. One-time gains and charges, that's the net of plus six and minus three, ends up at three; normal restructuring charges only 6 and the extraordinary restructuring charges of 250 composed of 227 from Global Excellence, 23 from National Starch integration resulting in adjusted EBIT of 372, obviously provided some more explanation and clarity in our quarter report. That's the basis for calculating our progress on adjusted EBIT of 7.8% as a change compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Now, let's take a look at the financials between obviously EBIT sales and EBIT and net results. First, look at the gross margin development, 46.9% in 2007 Q2 on sales of 3.3 billion, now almost 3.7 billion sales in 2008, resulting in a gross margin of 41.4%. It looks as if this was a particularly negative quarter, result though is much, much more positive when taking a look at the detail bridge between prior year quarter and the quarter that we have experienced 2008.</p>
          <p>First of all, we started with 46.9% in 2007. We have a positive impact from pricing and volume of 1.3 percentage points. We have a negative impact on cost of sales from obviously raw material prices and other direct materials of minus three percentage points. We have other positive items of one percentage point resulting in a normalized level of gross margin for this quarter of 46.2%. And then obviously, as we have communicated, we have the negative impact of 3.7 from restructuring, 3.7 percentage points from restructuring, and 1.1 percentage points from the National Starch integration.</p>
          <p>Maybe a quick word at National Starch because that looks as if this could be a lasting impact. We will obviously generate significant savings and synergies in the gross margin when integrating National Starch into our business we've communicated several times that a big chunk of the savings will be in the manufacturing footprint but also in purchasing and, therefore, what looks as a negative impact on our gross margin will go away as we work our way through realizing the synergies. That then results in reported gross margin of 41.4%.</p>
          <p>Price increases of more than 100 million for direct materials, that includes the National Starch business because we have obviously consolidated National Starch as of April 3 and, therefore, it is included in our numbers and there's some detail also available in our Q report on National Starch upon which I will comment in a moment.</p>
          <p>Here is the transparency on the restructuring charges by cost line. We have 129 in cost of sales. We have 61 in marketing, selling and distribution expenses. R&amp;D for the time being one, administrative expense is 65 resulting in a total of all restructuring charges that's the extraordinary of 250 and the normal of 6 of total 256 restructuring, which we have taken in the second quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Look at the income statement adjusted for restructuring in order to point out some of the important items there. Obviously we have talked about the sales line, gross profit line. We have seen an increase in administrative expenses by 27.7%, which is obviously worth to be commented upon. That in major part results from integrating the national starch business. There, again, we look at integrating National Starch or as I'd say consolidating National Starch in the structures, which National Starch businesses had at the time when we made the acquisition.</p>
          <p>The National Starch businesses have a higher ratio of administrative expenses to sales than the Henkel business so therefore, we've taken on additional higher expenses comparatively than what we used to have in the Henkel Group. And there, again, we're going to realize significant savings in terms of synergies in the administrative expense line, so that's an immediate impact of consolidating the National Starch business. That's not there to stay.</p>
          <p>Second look perhaps at the marketing, selling and distribution expenses, which has grown by 2.9%, two impacts on that; first of all, the National Starch business obviously does not come along with a lot of marketing. It does come along with some selling expenses but with very little marketing expenses so therefore, the additional charge in that line from National Starch business is below average of the Henkel Group.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we have had slight reduction in our marketing expenses, particularly in our Laundry &amp; Home Care division, which is due to the fact that we had a strong spending last year for the personal anniversary, which we are now reducing to the more normal level, so therefore we've had the slight decrease in our spending in terms of marketing expenses on a more normalized level that we had experienced in the years before.</p>
          <p>From EBIT to net earnings, first of all, financial result down by 47 million between Q2 '07 minus 13, Q2 2008 of minus 60. There again, we have two impacts. The one is in the net interest line, minus 37 to minus 84. That's increased financial debt level that we had taken on in order to pay the purchase price for the National Starch acquisition but it's also additionally somewhat higher interest rates that we have experienced compared to second quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Without the interest rate hike, I'm not talking about the additional debt that we have to take -- taken on without the interest rate hike EPS impact would have been pretty much zero. In other words, additional operating earnings from the National Starch acquisition would have evened out with the increased interest to be paid on the additional financial debt. Nevertheless short-term interest rates have increased over the same period of last year by about 80 basis points so that's again a shorter term impact, which has resulted in a negative impact on our net earnings, which we do not expect to continue for the long-term.</p>
          <p>Quick look at our tax rate, which is obviously heavily impacted by the specific actions that we have taken. In particular the restructuring charges and also some of the specific impacts which we have had from winning a tax case in the US. The way it is calculated is it's based on the expected tax rate for the full year of around 26%, so without the one-offs and special actions we would still expect a tax rate for the year, normalized tax rate of 26%. We have an impact now from the restructuring or expect to have a tax impact from the restructuring expenses that we're taking and we have had positive from tax case that we have won actually, which has been pending for several years in our Dial business, which we eventually won and which resulted in a one-time gain on tax basis of around 40 million.</p>
          <p>With respect to the tax shield that we're getting from the restructuring, we have so far taken into account only one-third. That's in line with international accounting standards. Obviously that's a calculation base. As we go work our way through the particular projects and the actions that we are undertaking with respect to restructuring we'll be able to give more specific guidance on what the tax impact from that restructuring is going to be. I remind you that we have expected cash out from restructuring in the order of two-thirds and depreciation of one-third so therefore, as we have taken so far only one-third into account, there is to be expected a higher positive impact from the tax situation and in respect of income taxes to be paid on the Group level.</p>
          <p>Cash flow statement, perhaps an explanation required in order to look at the income taxes paid in the second quarter, there again we have some special actions and, therefore, some higher cash out for income taxes paid. We have settled another tax audit in the US, which has resulted in some tax payments. We have had capital gains tax payments in Spain and Italy and some tax payment in respect of our National Starch business. These are smaller tax payments, as a matter of fact. As an acquirer normally you don't pay tax obviously but there's some excise taxes and that kind of thing, which have been due in the second quarter in result -- in connection with the transaction. So that's a one-time transaction tax cost, which we have incurred.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of numbers, the US audit was in the range of 20 million. The one-time capital tax, capital gains tax payments have been in the order of 30 million, in the National Starch 10 million. Development of our net working capital, cash network and capital, only inventories, trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable, taken into account very positive development over the quarters, prior years from 19.2 in '05 to 13.1 in '08, again 160 basis points over the same period of last year, which is due to the intense work that we've been undertaking in reducing our net working capital with all the divisions contributing to this positive result.</p>
          <p>Changes in our net debt, first of all the starting point yearend 2007, 1.7 billion of net debt, obviously additional free cash flow 273. We have invested in financial assets. That's the acquisition basically of National Starch. We've paid out dividends, 227, and we've had positive impact from foreign exchange effect and other financial transactions that's pretty much changes in derivatives and inter-group receivables and payables resulting in the level of net debt of &#x20AC;5.446 billion at the end of Q2 2008.</p>
          <p>This gets me to our updated outlook. First of all, what do we expect in terms of trading conditions around our business going forward? I think it is perhaps clear that we're not going to see technically a recession in North America. That's right now something which we would not expect but there will be a considerable slowdown in terms of industrial activities. So that's what we call mild recession because it technically may be not a recession but it's still pretty weak.</p>
          <p>In Western Europe we continue to expect growth at a slower pace than what we had experienced in the past several years. That's very much in line with the outlook that others have provided emerging markets. We do expect further dynamic expansion. We've seen the growth markets, emerging markets, growing in the first two quarters at the same pace that we have experienced in the years before.</p>
          <p>Cost of raw materials, packaging, trading goods, traded goods and contract manufacturing, all of which together we call direct materials, having that impact on our cost of goods line. We do that -- do expect that to be higher than what we expected when we were entering into the year. Our initial outlook was in the mid single-digits somewhere between 4 and 6%. As we were experiencing significant increase in the oil price and the resulting significant increase in the materials prices that are depending on oil. We have increased our outlook at the higher end of the range that we have originally provided and we have -- we're now above that outlook in the high single-digits taking into account in addition National Starch is to be in the high single-digits, high, high single-digits.</p>
          <p>So, therefore, all of this together results in an overall environment which remains very challenging as we walk into the second half of this year but we're very determined in order to maintain our strong momentum in organic sales growth and, therefore, we have raised our expectation for sales growth for the full year to 3 to 5%. Obviously with 4.8 for the first half year, that's something which we therefore translate or extrapolate into the second half of this year. We do see, therefore, an upside potential in the 3 to 5% range as we walk into the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Our restructuring charges we do expect at the same level that we have communicated earlier, 770 to 780 million. We have provided an adjusted EBIT based on the level of 1.370 billion EBIT that we had in 2007, lower end of the mid teens. The mid teens has been our range which we have provided going into the 2008 battle. We think that the lower end of the mid teens is now the more realistic view, given that we've seen strong increasing direct materials and we've seen strong slowdown in the US. So therefore, we do expect that we still maintain our range but we will be at the lower end of our range, resulting then in adjusted EPS for Henkel at the lower end of our mid single-digit range that we had provided earlier.</p>
          <p>Pretty much the other items that we have guided remain unchanged. EBIT corporate should be a little bit lower than what we initially thought. Initially we thought it was to be at a minus 130, we're now at minus 120 to 25. There is one caveat which needs to be taken into account. Obviously, central R&amp;D has been part of EBIT corporate, a significant part of EBIT corporate. As we have reorganized or are in the process or reorganizing our central R&amp;D into the division. The divisions eventually will show the expenses for their R&amp;D as part of their expenses. So therefore, while this has no difference for the Henkel Group except that we will be realizing some of the savings in the Group. We'll have &#x2013; we will have a change in the charge and therefore, we'll provide more specific items as we work our way through the accounting rules and obviously the impact on the divisions.</p>
          <p>So again, on total level that does make a difference, but we will restructure and therefore, shift some of the expenses that are currently in EBIT corporate into the divisions. Financial items, we have obviously seen higher interest rates in addition to the higher level of debt. That higher level of debt is not a surprise but somewhat surprising is the higher level of interest rate if we compare that to last year. Our financial items guidance will be in the range of 210, but there again, we need to provide caveat because if we looked at total interest expense that's more in the range of 300 million negative and positive from Ecolab. If we hold the Ecolab interest stake until the end of the year it would be plus 90, but that's obviously something which remains to be decided by the time that we know exactly when and how to dispose of our Ecolab stake.</p>
          <p>Tax rate not taking into account the changes that we will be undertaking during the rest of this year, that is to say, without the impact from the restructuring charges and without impact from a potential sale of Ecolab would be at the normal level of 26%.</p>
          <p>Minority interests will be slightly lower than what we initially guided at minus 20 rather than at minus 30. So no big changes but some changes in terms of the outlook, particularly taking into account that some actions may occur during the year, which will have an impact on tax rates and obviously one-time gains.</p>
          <p>With that, I hand over to Kasper to provide an outlook on the priorities 2008.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Lothar. Looking upon the business priorities for 2008, Lothar has mentioned the most important and that is delivering upon our guidance and I'll get to that in a second.</p>
          <p>But moving on, we will continue to maintain our growth path. We see this as being extremely important, particularly in a market that is having sluggish conditions in some of the more mature markets. And we do that by keep our customer focused, which is starting very top of the company. We will continue to offset raw material prices by increasing our prices as alluded to in the second quarter and also already communicate into the market moving forward. In the US, we've already taken substantial price increases that will come effective by the end of the third, beginning of the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>As I spoke about, the initial steps of the integration of National Starch and the execution of Global Excellence, has gone off to a good start but it's important that we maintain the focus on these two activities which form the foundation to ensure that Henkel will become more competitive and more profitable in the future. So finding the right balance between internal focus, getting the cost levels to the right and the appropriate level, and external focus to drive the top line and then in parallel disposing of not core assets. Lothar mentioned it, when we have news about Ecolab we will inform you accordingly and we will, as we always have done, continue to look upon our business portfolio and where appropriate dispose of non-core assets.</p>
          <p>So looking out, delivering upon our guidance, I think the important part here to state is that we have increased our organic sales growth target and that has been driven by emerging markets. 36% of our business coming from emerging markets is giving us a better balance in the business and is making it possible for us to offset when some of the more mature markets slowdown.</p>
          <p>If I were to characterize the business performance that we've just seen, I would say on a macro level we've had strong organic growth. We've had modest performance on our margin line. We've had very good progress on our integration of National Starch and Global Excellence and when it comes to the business groups we've had continued strong performance from our Cosmetics and Toiletries Group. We've had solid performance from our adhesives and technologies Group and in our most &#x2013; in my most subtle English we've had a charging quarter for our Laundry &amp; Home Care business. We also have adjusted our EBIT growth outlook by the second half and these are driven by two additional quarters of National Starch's business coming in, higher impact from own price increases and the savings of 50 instead of 20 million from Global Excellence and National Starch.</p>
          <p>This concludes the formal part of our call. Ladies and gentlemen, we are now happy to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, a couple of questions, if I may. The first is indeed, could you update us a bit more in detail on the price increases that you're expecting in the second half and maybe split it into three divisions, i.e., Adhesives, Laundry and also Cosmetics? Point one B, so to speak, on the Laundry side; do you still expect to come close to the EBIT level which you've guided for in this first quarter? Of course, there were some one-offs impacting the second quarter, but do you expect to come close to the 11% EBIT of last year? And then point two, second question on National Starch, could you update us a bit more on the underlying sales growth, and what happened in the quarter and also a bit more detail on the regions? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the pricing, I'll then hand over to Lothar. We are on all business groups taking pricing globally and depending on product area and region we are pricing differently. What we are seeing is that we are seeing pricing in the &#x2013; in our detergents business in the range of 3 to 5% but going up to above 10% in certain regions. We are in the UK in our Cosmetics group we are seeing price ranges from 1 to 2%. Some have taken &#x2013; and these are net I am speaking about, so net. And we are seeing in our Adhesives group further price increases of 3 to 4% and this is also net increases. So depending on product group in the area this is where we are seeing, so we are seeing an average on a gross level of between 5 and 10% increases on a gross level but it does depend on product area and it does depend on region. If I were to take the second part is and then I'll hand it over to Lothar, which is the underlying performance of the National Starch business. The underlying performance of the National Starch business is comparable to the same performance of the business last year if you adjust for two things, currency and we still have some businesses we have not taken over yet. When you back calculate them into the numbers we are seeing pretty much a comparable number compared to last year.</p>

          <p>And what you haven't integrated is that approximately &#x20AC;40 million or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's in terms of sales, yes, but in terms of EBIT it's around 6 to 8 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to the Laundry division, we have obviously guided in our Q report that we expect to reach last year's level adjusted for a foreign exchange effect so, therefore, that's below our expectation when going into 2008 and it's obvious from the numbers that we have reported that we have a very, very positive development in terms of sales, so we'll maintain our market share. We'll maintain our business. We'll maintain our significance in that business but we do have a delay between the ability to pass on price increases and the input costs that have been rising. If you look at the practice in that business you need to take into account that you can't raise prices any time you want to. If you look at the practice in Europe there's pretty much two windows per annum so, therefore, one needs to obviously announce price increases ahead of time and also wait for the windows to open. That's why we expect to increase our prices, particularly in the Laundry and Home Care divisions. In the second half of this year we have announced that already to our customers and therefore, we do expect to be able to implement the price increases but that is something which is trailing the raw material price increases, which we have experienced in the first half of this year, particularly affecting the Laundry division in relative terms even more than the Adhesives division. So in other words, we're going to have a delay in passing on price increases. We're going to implement strong pricing in Europe. We're also implementing, as Kasper noted already, strong price increases in the Laundry division in North America. It's actually in the range of 10% and more in some of the product categories. So that's an area where we're pretty confident that we're going to recoup some of the negative impact that we have experienced but not obviously not the full impact.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, Norbert Neuhaus from West LB, speaking also two questions, perhaps if you can a little bit go in more detail if you look in the Laundry business in Western Europe, which looks quite low, especially perhaps in some core countries. Can you elaborate a little bit how it was on the organic sales growth level in Germany, Italy, Spain and France? And secondly, also on the raw materials side can you say how much the increase in Europe calculation of material costs was in the second quarter also in the half year compared to last year in absolute terms and how sure you are that you can put through these announced price increases and I believe in your guidance for 2008 you think that you'll materialize these price increases. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me first address the sales development in Western Europe. We have communicated that we have slightly negative impact in Western Europe in our business that affects obviously the Laundry &amp; Home Care division. We have negative developments but also negative developments in markets in Germany, Italy and France. Those are the ones where we have most of the negative impact and we have positive impacts in most of the other countries in Western Europe more or less so that, therefore, results only in a slight negative organic sales growth in Western Europe. With respect to the raw materials impact I'm not sure I understood your question exactly, so if I don't answer it please ask the question again. What we have experienced and I mentioned that already is a higher impact from direct materials in the Laundry and Home Care division than the average of the Henkel Group anyway but even then in the Adhesives division. So in other words, surfactants have been strongly impacted by raw material price increases and that's large volume that we saw in terms of surfactants. That's something which....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you put that perhaps in absolute figures so that we have an increase in that raw material cost, not with the impact of the FX side of the negative FX side so that we have the pure increases in material costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't provide that level of detail. What we can say though is that for the full year the guidance has been that we will be in the high single-digits for the total company. It will be higher in the detergent division with Laundry and Home Care. Obviously in the quarter we've had an impact from materials cost increases on the total company of more than &#x20AC;100 million so that, therefore, provides an impression if you take that into account that the Adhesives, Laundry and Adhesives division is more than 30% of the company and over proportionately affected by that increase. You have at least an impression of what we're getting at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And your guidance for 2008 you have calculated that with these price increases materialize.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes you mean our price increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course. Yes and, as I mentioned, that's not just hope, it is -- it's been announced. It's in the process of implementation. We're not just hoping that we &#x2013; at some point in the future will be able to increase prices, that's something which has been prepared. You can't do it by just shouting across the telephone. So, therefore, that needs to be prepared with several advance &#x2013; several months advance notice, which we have given in many cases. That makes us confident that we are going to be able to implement the price increases and the additional thing is we're talking about a situation, which affects all our peers. We're not the only one who has to take that into account. If you look at the announcement of our peers that's very much in line with our own announcement in terms of impact from the direct materials, which therefore suggests that we're having an industry impact and not just the company impact.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have one question on your guidance please, you now obviously talking about organic growth of 3 to 5%. And I am trying to understand based on your trends of your own currencies. Do you think that this organic growth will be offsetting any negative currency effect you're still going to get &#x2013; to get your overall guidance? And on the same subject of margin improvement you've talked about you were taking a closer look at your factory base across the world? And I was just wondering, if you can maybe give us an idea how many factories overall there are and maybe even how many you have by division? And then my second question is on the consumer, if you can maybe talk a little bit about how you see the consumer developing, especially in markets like Germany and the US? Is the good growth you've seen in Laundry in the US driven by the consumer looking for better value for money or is it more driven by innovation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me first address the organic sales growth, that's obviously without currency so that's adjusted for currency. And therefore, currencies wouldn't have an impact on the organic sales growth that we're going to realize.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You know I am just trying to understand whether you expect currencies to be more negative than the 3 to 5 you're expecting on the organic number or whether the organic number will more or less offset the negative currency effect you're expecting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The negative currency in the second quarter was minus 6 and for the full year we expect it to be a little bit better so that potentially I think, I would hesitate to commit to that, but potentially we could offset the two. With respect to factories and the other thing, Kasper will answer, but let me just briefly address the consumers. Obviously, we have seen not a particular downturn in consumer response in North America and it's not that we have benefited particularly from trading down. That's one of the topics that people try to raise many times. Where the value for money segment in North America that's known we've not benefited from a particular trading down activity. So we've seen good organic growth in North America as a result of innovations that we've brought to the market, which have been successful.</p>
          <p>So, therefore, that's again a topic that obviously we've been stressing for many, many quarters and years even. Innovation is the solution to growth and it's a solution to margin. So therefore, that's been very successful quarter and we do expect to be bringing more innovations to the market in North America and therefore continue to be successful. With respect to consumers in Europe, I mentioned some of the countries that have been negative in terms of growth. Obviously, one needs to look at prior year comparison and we've had a very strong prior year in terms of the Persil anniversary. So therefore, it's not so surprising that we see some negative compared to last year in our Laundry &amp; Home Care business.</p>
          <p>We do expect that consumers in Western Europe will continue to be, I guess, reluctant but not &#x2013; we don't see a crisis or something which some of the indicators that have been published which sound more negative than what we actually are seeing. There is obviously a question and that has &#x2013; may have an impact on organic sales growth. As we do expect to increase our prices, there could also always be an impact on volume. So that's something, which we need to watch out for very closely and that's what we've been doing in running our business in the past. As we increase our prices we need to obviously make sure that we're not losing overly on terms of volumes. And that's therefore, an area where we have to watch our business as we implement the actions. But again, while the Western European market is not really providing us a lot of fun at these times, the consumer markets in particular we do have areas where we are successful, particularly in our Personal Care business, which has growth in Western Europe in many countries, again fueled by innovations. So even in the face of what we're seeing in terms of news we're somewhat optimistic for several countries. We do obviously see some of the problems and we need to cope with them.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Eva, on the manufacturing footprint giving you a number will not make a lot of meaning because we have three very different businesses. So let me just strategically address each of the businesses and say the following; in our Cosmetics business, we have a business, which is characterized by a product that has lower weights so i.e. the transportation costs us much less. We've over the last number of years consolidated the manufacturing footprint for our Cosmetics business to a very high degree and what you'll see in the future is rather fine-tuning of the setup that we have today than really a re-definition of our setup. In our Home Care business, as I spoke about in the beginning, we are fundamentally changing the structure of that for two reasons; one is, that we are seeing a move in the market from a powder to a fluid and we're seeing a move to high concentrate. Right now it's a market that is concentrated, also dominated by a very high transportation cost, which is now driving us to a much more consolidated manufacturing footprint not only in Western Europe, but overall, we earlier this year we closed a manufacturing plant in Russia. Right now, as I said, we're in the process of consolidating our European footprint and will continue to look upon that on a global basis.</p>
          <p>When it comes to our Adhesives business, you've got to really differentiate within our Adhesives business because, as an example our Electronics business is a global business where we really have two manufacturing footprints, which are Asia and the US. Our Building Adhesives, we need to have those manufacturing plants very close to the customer, but what you can expect to see is also as an issue alluded to in today's presentation a further consolidation of our manufacturing footprint, not only driven by Global Excellence but predominantly driven by the integration of National Starch. We'll be able to in the subsequent phone call in November to give you further details, where we are. We are right now in conversations with the people being affected and I think it's fair to those people to who have come through that phase at this stage but you are seeing a further manufacturing consolidation, particularly in our Home Care and in our Adhesives business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, gentlemen. Could you give me some more information on the underlying marketing reduction that you had in the second quarter and your expected volume reaction from the price increases you are in the process of implementing and secondly, recent comments from Ecolab management sounds like pretty much opposition to strategic buyers of the business? Well, what's your take on that? Do you expect -- well, a placement of the shares or any solution of that, some more flavor on that please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question, with respect to the marketing reduction, I mentioned that we've reduced our marketing expenses in our Laundry &amp; Home Care division. It's in the range of 100 to 120 basis points. With respect to our Cosmetics division, we're pretty much at the same level, slightly below, but that's not worth mentioning. So and the Adhesives division obviously has no -- not a significant spending in that area, which hasn't changed. With respect to-- let me answer the question on Ecolab, we will not comment on any specific comments, which were made by either management or quoted as if they were made by management. When the process of setting up the stage that we can dispose of our interests and therefore, we will obviously communicate by the time that we have finished our work and finished our discussions with Ecolab at which time it would be appropriate for us to comment on what -- what is going to happen. Right now, all avenues are open and we're looking at any avenue that eventually is capable of optimizing proceeds from the disposition of all or part of the Ecolab stake and in many of those avenues it would be either helpful or necessary for Ecolab management to support us in that effort so that's, therefore, the focus of our discussions in order to get support of Ecolab management and also obviously structure this transaction, which is in the benefit -- in the best interest of our shareholders as well as the Ecolab shareholders. With respect to price increases what was it?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, with respect to price increases and what impact that may have on volume, if you look at the price increases that we have communicated obviously then one could conclude that either we would have to have a much higher organic sales growth next half year or else we'll have a different composition of price volume and the latter is our expectation. We're going to have higher portion of organic sales growth coming from pricing, particularly Laundry &amp; Home Care and in the Adhesives division there would be anyway as customers has communicated lower price increases and, therefore, continuing lower impact from pricing and on total sales growth in the Cosmetics division. So, there again, if we look at the amount of price increases that we're targeting, we will see a bigger impact from that and if you'll take that into our organic sales growth expectation obviously then the volume would have to be reduced in order to make sense in terms of our expectation for organic sales growth. What I was trying to say though is as we implement price increases and as we see impact on volume, if we see impact on volume, we'll manage obviously the <mark type="inaudible" /> such that we get the best benefit from pricing and volume and that's something, which sometimes needs good management or very good management because there's an initial impact on volume. It is necessary to keep a strong position and continue to maintain the price increases, stick to the price increases and then volume comes back, so there's a possibility that we have an immediate impact, initial impact, on volume and then volume comes back. So that's been our experience in 2006 and, therefore, we would not be surprised if we have the same experience in the second half of this year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Now we've seen that partially also in our Adhesives division in the first quarter where we have raised prices. I mentioned that we had a negative impact from -- with the winter, which has impacted the building adhesives business and a second impact from price increases, which had a negative impact on volume but there again, volume has recovered, as you can see, in the second quarter in our Adhesives business. So, therefore, that's part of normal management.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>For restructuring?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>For the full amount eventually.</p>

          <p>You're expecting?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, as we have communicated for the full year, our expectation is 770 to 780 million EBIT charge of which two-thirds is expected to be cash out and one-third depreciation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And was that similar in the quarter or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No there was no-- pretty much no cash or very little cash out. Yes, it was in the range of 40 million. So from the total 256 it was just 40 million cash out already in the second quarter. But that's simply because it takes time for the actions to be announced and then you take the charge upon announcement but then implementing the actions that is to obviously implement the redundancies, which then result in the cash out. So, that's just a normal delay in cash out versus the charge that obviously is faster.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So that actually means your operating cash flow is even going to look worse for the remainder of the year, is that the implication?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that the operating cash flow will be affected by the cash out. We don't obviously know exactly when to take the cash out when implementing the activities but we would-- do expect to have some more cash out, significantly more cash out in the second half of this year.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, good afternoon. I may have missed this. I just wanted to clarify if you had given the incremental EBIT contribution in the second quarter from National Starch?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You didn't miss it because we didn't say it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you be the prepared to share that with us? And what I was really after also is really an estimate for the year or you know I guess another way of asking the question is that I think I was right in that you felt sales would be flat excluding FX. I mean, should we assume basically the same for EBIT?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. No just a little bit more detail, if you look at the Q report you will see that the impact on net earnings from National Starch was 26 plus, so if you calculate that upwards you will end up at an EBIT that you would expect of around 38 million and that's a realistic number. That's just from taking the information that we have in the Q report and do just a rough calculation. Now that is below last year very much because of the effect that cost dimension which is the FX impact plus we have not yet consolidated all the entities that are part of the National Starch Group, very much because of some practical reasons, some practical delays. They'll eventually come along and then we'll get the rest so to speak except for the FX impact. So, therefore, it's pretty much on last year's levels except for FX and the businesses that we have not yet been getting our hands on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the sales number I think there's one thing that's quite important to National Starch. We go back, as I said in my presentation, and see 70 to &#x20AC; 80 million of sales upside in the integration process and that's basically coming from the following. If you take our electronics business the top five customers from Henkel and the top five customers from National Starch are different. They are not the same. The sales cycle into for instance the electronics has say three to six to nine months sales cycle depending on the product life cycle of the electronics business so from the time that we've identified the opportunity until it materializes there is a significant gap in there, but we're still very confident that we do see upside in the sales side through the synergies between the two companies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.</p>

          <p>We will take our next question from Harold Thompson from Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I've got two questions if I may. The first one is on savings, the savings in the inventories. You've increased your savings contribution to the 2008 financial year. Does that mean that we could expect that the savings in year three are also accelerated into next year into 2009 so you do the whole process over two years rather than over three years? I was wondering if you could give me some ideas on that front? Secondly, you've announced another round of clearly of price increases. How are inventories at your customers behaving in light of continuous and quite significant price increases? Are they buying ahead or just keep buying regularly depending on the pricing and for how much longer would prices need to go up if input costs were to find a level today around the current old price? My second question really is on interest expenses. Could maybe Lothar reiterate what he said on what the extra expense could be for the whole of 2008? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I understand you correctly, it was really the timing of the savings from the restructuring programs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we are seeing is we're taking step by step at this stage and we are confident that the numbers we put into the market vis-&#xE0;-vis Global Excellence and National Starch and i.e. 150 and 250 are the numbers, which are appropriate at this stage. We have put enormous amount of focus and energy into driving those numbers in quicker than expected and should the number be different or should they be coming in earlier on than expected than what we outlined today we will inform you at that stage but at this stage we believe that the timing that we've outlined getting 90 we're expecting to be 80% of the savings within the 2010 timeframe and this is a realistic one. Also, because a lot of the savings that you will see are due to changes in the manufacturing footprint and you simply can't change them overnight.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A quick answer on the price increases and what happens at our customers inventories, that needs to be obviously looked at separately between the Adhesives division and the fast moving consumer goods.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the Adhesives division price increases has been an ongoing activity for the past two or three years so there is no particular inventory built up in anticipation of price increases because otherwise our customers obviously would have to build inventories, which they eventually would have difficulties in managing as they work their way through into the final products, so we've not seen any particular swings in inventory in our Adhesives division in the past two years and we don't expect that to happen during the course of this year. What happens at times is that we do obviously announce let's say changes in our systems environment. We have a new SAP introduction or something, then you see a buildup in inventories. Customers buy in advance and then it evens out over the rest of the year, so there's nothing particular that we have seen or would expect in the Adhesives division. And in fast moving consumer goods it tends to be different. Now again, differentiating between Personal Care where we don't have much of a price increase happening in Western Europe, we do obviously have price increases in the emerging countries. There again you have the same phenomenon. People obviously don't buy ahead of time because that's part of life. It's not changing over a period of time and therefore there again in Personal Care we would not expect any particular impact from that. Finally, getting to Laundry &amp; Home Care, at times we've seen that in the past if we announce let's say price increases for the beginning of the year our customers would tend to buy in advance and then you see very weak first quarter and you see a strong fourth quarter in its anticipation of implementing price increases. That's been something, which has been happening in the past. Whether that's going to be happening next half year that's an interesting question. Again, we've not seen a huge inventory built up and if you look at some of the experience that some of our customers have made, if you look at Wal-Mart, which has been reducing inventory because they've been building up inventory in the past years. So I think they're going to be much more careful moving ahead in building inventories, which they're not sure they are going to be able to sell easily. So again, in Laundry and Home Care particularly, laundry I think one could envisage or could think this might happen but I think our customers are going to be more careful than what we have seen in the past.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to interest expense, may be two things. The one thing that I mentioned was, we do expect total interest expense for 2008 of 300 million, net interest expense. Of which 170 is from the underlying business, 130 in addition from National Starch financing. And that's pretty kind of simple to calculate if you look at the amount of money that we've taken on instead for National Starch which is approaching 4 billion. You look at the interest rate, let's say, closer to 5% then it's in the range of 40 to 45 million per quarter and we have three quarters, so that kind of gets up to the 130 from National Starch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Actually I have two clarification questions and another one, if I may. And the first one is just very briefly on Laundry, Mr. Kasper Rorsted mentioned 3 to 5% price increases, I just want to clarify is that for the second half year or is it for the full year overall expectation, 3 to 5% in Laundry? Second clarification question is National Starch, you mentioned 38 million EBIT roughly and currency and consolidation effect. If I got it correctly, you said consolidation is missing 6 to 8 million on a yearly basis, I'd assume meaning 2 million and actually last year National Starch earned 53 million in EBIT. So obviously if you take the 2 million out we are around 50 than it would have been a significant currency hit and as National Starch is not UK factories, actually outside of UK mainly, I can't understand that fully, these currency effects actually, that's why it's more than I would have expected, so could you clarify that? And the last question to your guidance, in your outlook statement you actually mentioned that you expect the US dollar getting stronger over the course of the year. So just my question what currency assumption Dollar/Euro currency adjustment do you have in your outlook statement and why do you believe the currency will go stronger actually?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me first clarify very quickly on Laundry. It's 3 to 5% for the total range for the full year. We have in certain areas already implemented some price increases, in certain areas we haven't. And there are certain areas we have between 10 and 12%. So there is a high difference in range both from a product standpoint but also from a regional standpoint, but in macro 3 to 5 for the range and 3 to 5 for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question with respect to National Starch, our information about the EBIT that we are going to take over is not 50 million, it's 46 million. That's the first information. We're not &#x2013; obviously you know we're not buying National Starch. We're buying parts of the National Starch businesses and that's information that we have gathered from <mark type="inaudible" /> (81.39). Second information obviously the National Starch business is very much spread over the world. In other words, we're generating earnings and cash flow almost little bit more than 30% National Starches in the US, therefore US dollar. More than 30%, far more than 30% is in Asia, which again is currency related to the US dollar and less than 30 is Europe and the remainder is in Latin America. So it's a huge piece of it is related to the US dollar and therefore the impact of the US dollar is quite &#x2013; or related currencies, I should say is quite significant on the National Starch business. What I would say though is that, the &#x2013; you're obviously right with respect to the businesses that are missing, and we do see in the first quarter that we have consolidated National Starch a slight downturn in terms of earnings. We have seen good organic growth in the National Starch business, but negative impact from currencies. So volume is up, currencies are down and therefore, on the top line it's pretty much same level as last year. On the bottom line, we have some impact again, some one-offs from the integration efforts that we're undertaking but overall we're confident or we're quite optimistic in terms of business performance. It is slightly negatively impacted but not by much. So the US dollar is stronger...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So 6 to 8 million you just guided you have not taken over yet is a full year's figure, is this right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Finally, with respect to the US dollar our expectation is not a large strengthening of the US dollar during the rest of this year. It's right now somewhere in 55, 155 or so. We do hope; expect that it's going to be in the vicinity of 150. Expectations, consensus for next year has been stronger, in the 140s, that's not our expectation, that's consensus expectations. You never know whether consensus is right or wrong, but we're taking that as a basis for our own expectations. So expect that to kind of start already this year in the second half of this year.</p>
