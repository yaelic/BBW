          <p>Hello. Well, thank you all for coming here. And we would like to start our presentation for Financial End of the Year 2009 Results for LUKOIL. And we will have Mr. Fedun, Mr. Leonid Fedun, who is Vice President in-charge of Strategic and Investments for LUKOIL, start with a presentation of our financial results. And then the presentation will be followed by Mr. Kuzyaev, who is the President of LUKOIL Overseas Holding, which is our international expansion upstream company. And he'll be talking about our successes in Iraq and in some other places, and followed by their plans, which will be followed by Mr. Azat Shamsuarov, who is the President of LUKOIL Western Siberia, which is one of our largest &#x2013; actually the largest production unit and many of you have had questions about dynamics of production and reserves in that particular subsidiary and don't ask those questions to me anymore. He is &#x2013; Mr. Shamsuarov is probably the best &#x2013; well, the best person to answer those questions.</p>
          <p>And my name is Andrey Gaidamaka. I am Deputy Vice President in-charge of Strategic and Investments, and I'll be directing this meeting. A couple of sort of housekeeping questions. The English is on channel one. Russian is on channel two in your earphones. Also, I would like to tell you that we ask you to switch off your phones because we'll be taking questions from the telephone line and we'll get a buzz if you don't do that. And the last but not least, do not exit through the doors that you're coming in. Please use these doors to exit because we'll be conducting small group meetings in that room through which you're coming on the way in. And by the way, we have two group meetings after this presentation. I have quite significant number of people that booked for those meetings. I would appreciate if you <mark type="inaudible" /> please raise your hand. On those group meetings after, the kind of comparable notes, who has booked in into those after this presentation.</p>
          <p>With this, I'll yield the floor to Mr. Leonid Fedun for his all in the year 2009 presentation. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Every year, LUKOIL presents its financial results. Well, first of all, I would like to pass hello from Mr. Alekperov, the President of our company. He was very eager to take part in this meeting, but you may be aware that Sunday is the meeting of the &#x2013; a special meeting in Western Siberia guided by the President, Mr. Medvedev, then obviously, he had to take part in that meeting. That meeting is dedicated to the technical progress in oil industry.</p>
          <p>Well, the first statements are forward-looking statements and the main figures and facts. I think you are already familiar with our main performance financial indicators. Our financial performance has exceeded the market average. The market has fallen by more than 35%. We only lost the profit of around 23% and our financial performance indicators are the best among all the Russian oil majors; we even beat Rosneft and they have unprecedented allowances and state support. So we beat them by general indicators and in net product. Although the expectation was slightly higher, but it's difficult to understand what were they to do with. And there were some corrections in the profits, because we had to write off a couple of projects, Anaran in Iran which we can't develop despite the excellent reserves that have been discussed. It's purely for political reasons the sanctions from the USA, and since we have large investors from America, we had to comply with the sanctions.</p>
          <p>A few words about the situation that is taking shape with the oil industry and the situation that you have to take into account in your analysis, and in order to understand the movement on behalf of the oil companies, including our company. I am not afraid to say that currently we are observing a revolution in the development of the oil industry. This revolution has started several years ago. Virtually no one noticed that with the exception of a few very clever clogs, who were very quietly joined the revolution. There were no pompous statements or declarations. But nevertheless, I can say that the production of oil and gas in the two years has changed drastically and the reflection of this changes are the price expectations that are currently taking shape in the world.</p>
          <p>On the one hand, obviously, the forward curves and their changes they are to do with the crisis and some drop in demand, but the main issue is that today the perspective on the oil and gas production has drastically changed, and this drastic change is to do with the following. The technological innovations have been applied in the last several years allow us to look at the hydrocarbon reserves as not ending or enough for the next several generations and accessible even as we speak now. So it drastically changes the perspective on the development and growth of the oil and gas industry and drastically changes the valuations, estimates of the industry development. The main issue is to dissolve the technology and secondly, the cost of production. The first one is the most advertised, the most well known, non-traditional types of oil and gas, gigantic evaluations over 1.5 trillion barrels of new recoverable resources, reserves which are allocated virtually everywhere in the world. And this boom in the production of shale gas and shale oil, especially in the USA, well, it is being quite a distributor in Europe when acreages are being sold, say, near Paris or here in the U.K. or in Sweden in the most ecologically close country. In China, the process is becoming very excellent. The same can be said about Western, Eastern Europe and Russia. Russia enjoys gigantic reserves of the so called burgeon formation. The reserves up to 100 billion barrels, which are located in the well developed area of Siberia and Mr. Shamsuarov who will be talking about West Siberia, maybe will talk about the pilot projects and testing that we are carrying out in that respect.</p>
          <p>Another technological and important breakthrough is to do with the oil production on the shelf offshore. The development of the technological progress led to the fact that three quarters of the all global ocean is accessible for hydrocarbon production. It's the area or the territory which is two and a half times more than the actual land. And the reserves that we have, today these reserves they are virtually undepletable. And if you look at the slide, you can see that the technological breakthrough led to the production to the depth up to 4,000 meters. It has been tested. It has been running and economically viable. So this leads to the premises of the possibility to produce oil anywhere offshore.</p>
          <p>I must say that LUKOIL is the only Russian company that is engaged with the project management on the offshore and the development of the offshore project. In the Caspian, which we discovered as a new province for production of oil and gas. And starting from this year in April, we are starting the actual production and, for example, our latest discovery that we made on the shelf offshore of Western Africa in the Gulf of Guinea. You know about this field Svenska and Ghana National Petroleum Company, our partners we made the discovery offshore of Ghana and Mr. Kuzyaev will talk about some of these opportunities that have been presented by our offshore drilling. Another factor that has to be taken into account in your analysis is the situation with Iraq. The thing is that the auctions that have been completed of the last easily accessible, easy to access oil reserves on land have resulted some &#x2013; in that the expected production for the next eight to ten years will be up to 10 million barrels per day, including the participation of our company. This is a gigantic volume of oil that will go to the market. But according to our estimates and other estimates, this oil will not have demand. It will replace the drop in production, say, the Persian Gulf because of the undepletable Persian fields. They are being depleted from Kuwait to the United Arab Emirates. But this new big player that is coming to the market it has to be taken into the account.</p>
          <p>Starting from this year, LUKOIL has switched to unified methodology for evaluating our reserves that are used. It's under SEC rules. And as you can see, we are still one of the major players according to the reserves because the majority of our reserves are conventional oil and gas. And we also have gigantic reserves and potentials over 34 hydrocarbon, 34 billion boe reserves. And the issue of developing these reserves is only with one thing. It's favorable marketing conditions on the one hand, and the second thing is the presence or the demand for this hydrocarbon and also the financial resources and the relevant tax benefits. There is a lot of discussions going on in Russia; it's to do with the changes in the tax system because the current system for the majority of the fields turned out to be &#x2013; well, it seem to be efficient during the efficient and high growth period when the companies just use the resources that had been prepared in the times of the former Soviet Union, but some they develop on the new fields, the Caspian, the Western Siberia they require new approaches, new allowances, new tax breaks. And the road that was once taken by Rosneft, it was turned out to be a bad end and even the ministry has realized that. And now we expect that within one year the new concept of tax system will be developed and it will be based not on taxation of export, but taxation of profit.</p>
          <p>There is a working team that is dealing with these issues. They are discussing this. And, hopefully, next year we'll be able to tell you how this system will look and what benefits the oil companies, including our will enjoy from this new system, and it will allow to be more active in bringing into the development the new non-depletable reserves. The company's key projects that we have for the moment; first, production stabilization in Western Siberia, dynamic development of growth projects abroad, Caspian, Uzbekistan, and active development of new project in Iraq and Western Africa and the company is focusing on stabilizing production in Russia and increasing production outside of Russia. The explanation is just one and only in Western Africa, the tax level is three times lower than in Russia, the tax burden, therefore the projects or international project represent &#x2013; seem more profitable and then allow more return on capital employed the one compared to the project in Russia. But hopefully with the changes in the Russian tax system, we will get new opportunities to more positively develop our projects and fields in Russia.</p>
          <p>In April, we start commercial production in the Caspian region. We expect it to be the top leaders of the Russian country will be present there when we launch this production. This is a very remarkable development for us. We've spent more than 15 years to develop, to explore, to prepare this region, and we are undoubtedly the leaders in this area and we expect to see the first oil next month.</p>
          <p>Refining, we believe that the ballast that we have achieved when we can refine roughly two-thirds of our oil that we produce, we are happy with that despite the sort of deformations that took shape in the marketplace. In the refining markets, first of all, the cracking margins have fallen. It cleared the market from the companies. You may be aware that around tons of refineries in Europe are being closed, which does sanitize and improve the general situation. And we expect that next year we'll get decent profits from our refining assets. Although I would like to draw your attention to the fact that unfavorably in 2009, it produced our refining sector around $2 billion of net cash flow, which is quite a good positive indicator. But, nevertheless, we believe that the main investment that we have carried out or will carry out, it will go into the &#x2013; it will be upstream.</p>
          <p>How did the market look in 2009? As you can see, all the performance indicators or factors are negative; almost all of them, with the exception of some ruble depreciation, which slightly improved our reporting figures, our export duties tax on production of minerals has all affected, obviously, our financial results.</p>
          <p>The main operational results, with the commissioning in Yuzhnaya Khylchuya, we increased our production by 2.7%, the marketable gas production due to the market gas from price position, they restricted all their arrivals. We basically lost around some 12% of marketable gas production. But the severe winter that happened in Russia against the background of the global climate changes led to the fact that in the last months the marketable gas production has been renewed and we are following the schedule of 2008. We increased our export of oil and oil products and it allowed the company to derive more profit each barrel of oil.</p>
          <p>Financial results, the operating profits has decreased by 24.7%, but was growing quarter-on-quarter by 30%. We have reduced our operation costs and from the main operating activities, our profits have reduced by 27.8%, adjusted net profit because of the write-offs that we had to do because of the production project. For political reasons, I have already mentioned in Iraq, we had to write-off several projects and several wells in Kazakhstan, and we also had to write-off some of the reserves because of &#x2013; with the prices for oil. As of first of January 2009, we had a small reduction of reserves; nevertheless, the EBITDA indicated and net profit show that LUKOIL is one of the leaders in the Russian Federation. And as far as profit per barrel is concerned, we are beyond competition, which talks about the efficiency and effective work of our company.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses or OpEx, OpEx are controlled, are well under control by the company. We have reduced OpEx by 13%, hydrocarbon lifting costs have been reduced by 13%, own refining expenses by 17%. There were some expenses, refining expenses, the third-party refineries because the total volume of refinement has grown to $713 million, all to do with the volumes of refined oil.</p>
          <p>As I've already mentioned, what we do manage to do is keep under control operating costs or OpEx, something to do with the devaluation of the dollar or ruble-dollar depreciation, and we also managed to keep under control operating costs by the end of year. Linked to the operational activities of our company, we have reduced our costs working with our suppliers, with our contractors, and also froze some of the wages.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A costs and expenses have dropped significantly and as well as transportation expenses because in crisis conditions, the freight of oil has reduced in volumes, although Transnet had managed to lower the increase of tariffs, for transportation tariffs, but again, they were quite reasonable which served as a positive factor.</p>
          <p>The net income dynamics has been as follows. The reconciled figures show that there were two factors that influenced our indicators, our performance, the net reduction of income for quite understandable market reasons and the depreciation, which is linked to the fact that the assets we have are increasing and we understand the problem that depreciation presents and we are preparing a program of implementation of low profitable or non-profitable assets and we are going to present it for your attention in the next six months, again, to derive quite considerable income by selling off such assets.</p>
          <p>Cash flow structure, again, for conventional companies this is quite a traditional cash flow picture. We have preserved our cash flow, free cash flow at a high level, which allows us to implement all the projects we planned to for implementation without reserving, without resorting to high loans. Our liabilities are again kept well under control. We are one of the best companies as far as our debt is concerned, as far as Russian companies are concerned, and our net debt is quite manageable.</p>
          <p>Our CapEx breakdown is as follows. Our main volume of CapEx is directed towards the exploration and production. We have reduced by 40% our CapEx linked to the fact that our investment project, which was swallowing up most of our cash, the Timan-Pechora project has been completed. So we have a little break now. And the Filanovasky field is not going to be reflected in our balance until next year. We will complete Korchagin. After that we'll start investing in the main oil fields in Korchagin starting from 2011 and our Iraq project as well.</p>
          <p>We have completed main investments in the refinement or refining assets. So all the investment which is remaining are the investment to support the existing production and maintenance and compliance with a new environmental regulations, European regulations or Russian regulations. And in the future periods, our expenses are going to grow because of our investment in international or overseas projects and Kuzyaev is going to show in his presentation that such investment is totally justified and is going to yield good revenue for the shareholders of our company.</p>
          <p>As a whole, I would like to conclude that our company aims to preserve the right balance between the growth rate of the company business and high financial efficiency of the company. Because of the uncertainty in the future development of the company, we are stressing the implementation of highly profitable projects in exploration and production and trying to consolidate our financial position, our high cash flows and increase our shareholders' returns. And, of course, your main question is going to be because you have read the media, the publications and the media, we are going to hold a press conference &#x2013; sorry, our strategic partner, ConocoPhillips, is going to hold a press conference tonight. They are going to talk about the reduction of the share in the LUKOIL portfolio and they are going to explain why they are going to reduce their share in our portfolio. Any shareholder has the right to buy or to sell their shares. We cannot influence their position. In this respect, we respect every shareholder of our company irrespective of their share, of their holding in our company, whether they have one share or 150 million of such shares. Nevertheless, our company do not want to condemn or approve actions of any shareholders. So we're not going to influence or put pressure on our shareholders or try to contribute to their position. We should be ruled in our activities, not by the interest of one shareholder, but by the interest of all our shareholders, and work for their benefit. Thank you very much for your attention.</p>
          <p>I would like to give floor to Mr. Kuzyaev.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, dear colleagues. I would like to present or make a presentation on our overseas upstream companies.</p>
          <p>As customary, everything we say here has some caveats. So please bear this in mind. In 1994, we started our overseas expansion and Azeri-Chirag-Gyuneshli was our first overseas project, and in the next 15 years, we formed a portfolio of exploration and production outside Russia, in Asia, in Africa and South America. In order to manage this portfolio, in 1997, we created LUKOIL Overseas Holding, which became the operator of international projects of our company. And today, Overseas LUKOIL Holding works on 28 projects in 11 countries; 14 are exploration projects and 13 are production projects. It is clear that our international activities have covered a lot of ground and international assets constitute 8.6% of all our proved reserves, 5.3% is production of oil and 28.8% is production of gas outside the Russian Federation.</p>
          <p>And I would like to present to you some results of our activities in developing international projects overseas. In the last seven years, we have doubled the reserves of hydrocarbons overseas. Today, they constitute 1.713 billion boes. In Kazakhstan, we have about one-third of the entire volume. 60% of the remaining volume is in Uzbekistan, and there are other projects in Azerbaijan and Egypt.</p>
          <p>Production has been growing at a very high rate and in recent years has been growing at 19% annually. At 19% annually, net profit of our overseas projects has also grown together with the volume of production and in 2003, we had $24 million, which have grown to 900 million in 2008 and to $612 million in 2009.</p>
          <p>When we started our activities, there were lot of criticisms and remarks of investment analysts that LUKOIL was first and foremost a Russian oil and gas company and representing the Russian market, and therefore its investments in overseas assets are high risk investments and assets. I would like to reassure you that from 2001, we have invested $8.8 billion in our overseas assets and $8.3 billion we have already recovered from the investment overseas, which means that to date we can say that a considerable amount of our investment has been returned to us and has been profitable. Main investment has been into Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.</p>
          <p>In order to characterize the efficiency or effectiveness rather of our investment in overseas upstream projects, I would like to give you average indicators, the IRR of our current portfolio is 17%. The current development and production and the main development and production projects are still being developed. So the 17% that I've already mentioned, as assets mature are also going to appreciate considerably, would become more profitable as far as profitability is concerned and the profit margin was 1.3 times.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we also decided to develop anti-crisis program of measures in order to minimize our losses caused by the decrease in oil prices. We have tried to maximize our volume of production in the existing capacities without introducing new fields and this growth caused by using new technologies has constituted 5%, brought about $200 billion into our budget, and we have concentrated not just on the production indicators and our sales, but $70 million have been gained by this, but we also reduced our administrative costs and optimized our OpEx. Therefore our anti-crisis program has allowed us to show stability and sustainability of our segment in the company and we reduced &#x2013; with the oil prices dropping by 36.5%, we have managed to achieve the reduction at the level of 20% only. When we talk about oil companies, it's very important to compare yourself with the peer group with the companies working in similar market conditions. So we have a peer group, which we always compare ourselves with. It is a series of independent American companies with their own portfolios in the United States plus overseas portfolios.</p>
          <p>So in comparison with this &#x2013; with our competitors in this Group, we can demonstrate a positive dynamic. So we have in the past presented a lagging behind in economic indicators, but this lagging has been reduced, the gap has been reduced. Our main assets, production assets are mostly based in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. They are far from the market, where our products are being consumed, but our net EBITDA has approached the average indicators of average performance in this Group $20 per barrel &#x2013; $20 of EBITDA per barrel. So how have we managed to have smaller income and yet comparable EBITDA indicators? It's because we have managed to have lower administrative costs and operating costs. As far as operating costs are concerned, LUKOIL doesn't just have three times lower operating costs compared with the international group of companies. Our indicators in Kazakhstan are about $3.6 per barrel of operating costs, compared even with average regional indicators.</p>
          <p>I would like to, having showed you the results of our operational activities, in crisis conditions, I would like to say a few words about the prospects of our development overseas in the next five years. Our strategic plans suggest that we're going to be expanding aggressively our production of our upstream projects. In the next five years, we're planning to increase oil production and to double it, 260 million barrels of boe's that &#x2013; which means doubling our production. Our investment in international production is going to constitute 50% of all the investment in upstream projects by LUKOIL in the next three to four years.</p>
          <p>We're going to aim at Uzbekistan, which is going to be our main direction of our investment. We're going to increase production five-fold in the next five years and 16 billion barrels cubic meters of gas are going to be produced in Uzbekistan, whereas in Iraq we're going to produce 70 million barrels of oil per year. The size of our development in Iraq is going to be much greater. We're going to talk about the share of the oil that we're going to be producing in Iraq.</p>
          <p>Another potential growth indicator is going to be the contract with the National Oil Consortium. We are going to sign in Venezuela on developing or producing heavy oils in the Orinoco basin. And I am sure that looking at how tenders were developing and distribution of contracts or awarding of contracts in Iraq, the entire oil community have moved to Iraq now. For the last 10 years our company has been working on acquiring rights to West Qurna-2 because 13 billion barrels of boe's is what the estimated reserves of this oil fields, are. So, we have restored our rights in 2009 &#x2013; in December 2009 together with Statoil having won the tender.</p>
          <p>So with tender application we're basing our remuneration on $1.15 per barrel of oil. So, this was a very aggressive level of production planned by us, 1.8 million barrels per day by 2017. Our plans for West Qurna-2 show that the success of the project is going to be determine the next five years of our development and we're going to receive a positive cash flow and make this project profitable no less than 15%. The investment in 2010-2015 will be to the tune of around $12 billion and the preferential investment of LUKOIL Overseas will be just over 3.7 billion. The remainder will be reinvested from the free cash flow generated by the project itself in this field.</p>
          <p>We also currently, actively working on this project and in the next few days the &#x2013; obviously the Steering Committee will take place in Basra and they will approve the program for 2010, then the contracts and then tenders with the oil field service companies and we are also start engineering design for the field in question. More details on West Qurna will be given to you after the Iraqi partner approves the production program for the field in the second part of the year. There is also another Block &#x410; a very promising project in the Saudi Arabia. We discovered two gas condensate fields there. We are currently selecting the relevant technologies and completing the testing of the second well in the Tukhman field. Based on the results, we will enter into negotiations with the Ministry of Saudi Arabia and we hopefully will be in a position to develop and prepare the ways to make the commercial development of the field.</p>
          <p>Obviously, we've come across new issues in this work and therefore we've applied new technology solutions. LUKSAR, our joint operation with Saudi Aramco, introduced the deepest hydro fracturing of the formation at the depth of more than 5,500 meters. We also applied the most state-of-the-art technologies for drilling, all the new casing, new drilling bits, so, the implementation of the project was impossible without the introduction of new technological solutions.</p>
          <p>The key for our development going forward lies with the exploration assets in Western Africa after major discoveries that have taken place in 2007 in Ghana and Sierra Leone at the end of last year, beginning of this year made by Anadarko. This is part of from the Gulf of Ghana &#x2013; Guinea stretching up to Leone and one of the most promising regions for exploration of production in the world. We're cooperating with a national petroleum company, Svenska in C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire three blocks and one in C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire. Together with our partners we are the largest players in this region. In total, we have over 10,500 square kilometers of acreage for exploration and we will carry on to acquire and look for new opportunities in order to increase the scale of our exploration activities in the area.</p>
          <p>We have already made the statement that we completed drilling on the Ghana shelf, offshore of Ghana with our partners in December in the other structure. The depth of water was around 2.5 kilometers. At the depth of 4,500 meters we discovered hydrocarbon saturated casing with the capacity of 94 meters oil and gas deposits 25 meters in depth. We are currently evaluating the reserves and in order to complete the evaluation and to evaluate the scale of the field we envisage another three exploratory wells to be drilled. In total this block in Ghana, we discovered using seismic exploration of up to 15 billion of barrels potential boe and we're talking about the geological reserves.</p>
          <p>Also in C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire we drilled water drill and also discovered promising reservoirs but since it was the exploratory well we aim some to open up all the promising formations and as the result of this work we discovered reservoirs with low capacity oil sands. But we also had the inflow of oil during the testing runs from this oil sands and we also have &#x2013; we are quite confident and optimistic about some of our work in C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire. All in all we've discovered around nine structures with potential reserves up to 20 billion barrels of boe. I would like to emphasize we are talking about the geological reserves not recoverable reserves. By the end of 2012, we plan to press one with the intensive exploratory work in this area and offshore of Western Africa we hopefully will have drilled around 11 exploratory and testing wells. So the total scale of investment is between 7, $900 million, we will invest into exploration in this corner of the world.</p>
          <p>So, summing up, the potential of our activities in general over the last decade, LUKOIL has developed very highly efficient exploratory and production portfolio facets in Western Africa, Asia. We have reliable portfolio for production assets in Asia. We have projects in Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Iraq and these are not just potential, these are real projects and the work is being undergoing. And the total portfolio allows us to enjoy significant competitive advantage with the other companies and we're the leading company in this area in the world and in Russia. And our target for &#x2013; our plan by 2015, is not just to increase or double the production of crude oil, but with the $70 per barrel we plan to arrive &#x2013; derive at least $1.5 billion of net profit.</p>
          <p>And in order to achieve these performance indicators, we will rely on our strong competitive firm advantages, our strong resource base, our technologies, our experience that, allow us to intensify production. We have long term relationship with the leading state oil companies, oil and gas corporations. We are quite confident in our exploration capacities and our competitor advantage has always been our low operational and SGA expenses. All this allows us to be &#x2013; to confidently state that we have everything we need in place in order to deliver on our long-term targets and plans. The next five years, our upstream projects will become the major drivers for growth for the whole LUKOIL company. Thank you for your attention.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, dear colleagues, friends. I would like to draw attention to the first slide. This is a standard forward-looking statements and is standard procedure for this type of presentation. So at the beginning, I would like to give some bullet points that I will dwell on, further on in my presentation. LUKOIL enjoys significant resource base in Western Siberia with over 16 billion barrels in 3P. The decline of recent years has slowed dramatically. The development of technology allows us to increase the efficiency of development of the existing resources and upstream investments in Western Siberia are definitely with the positive NPV and we are undergoing a significant restructuring of activities of LUKOIL in Western Siberia.</p>
          <p>So, licensing areas in Western Siberia are located in two Autonomous, in Yamal-Nenets and Khanty Mansiisk Districts. We have 85 license permits. License areas, 55 of them are at various stages of development of their life cycle, 24 license permits are in the exploration stage. We are carrying out seismic exploration of drilling.</p>
          <p>Next side shows you the structure of the existing reserves under SEC methodology, 3P, 16.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent in Western Siberia. In addition, approximately 2.5 billion boe in reserves that are not currently recoverable under the current conditions, but it could be true towards and into different reserves category if a different tax regime is introduced. Reserve replacement is healthy and the resource base and continued successful reserves replacements will support stable cash flow in the future especially in Western Siberian. And the current existing portfolio of assets even under the conservative scenarios will be profitable with the rate of return at around 20% and the actual production factors for 2009, is 64%.</p>
          <p>In 2008, 2009 the company participated in several auctions carried out by the Ministry of Natural Resources for the licensing areas to produce hydrocarbons. The acquisition that we did under 3P category was around 200 million barrels with a cost of around $50 million. So therefore we're quite confident the participation in the auctions of the through licenses for exploration and production will allow us to improve the structure and the quality of our assets in Western Siberia.</p>
          <p>During the previous presentations, we analyzed and gave you the reasons why in 2006, 2007 there was the significant production decline. In 2007, we came up with an unexpected limit on access to electricity, the lack of power and the electricity prevented us to implement the system to support the pressure in the formations and therefore the well flow rate declined by virtually 26% between 2005 and 2008. And that was why we introduced a program, to introduce our own power generation capacity. This program will allow us to solve two issues. The first one, to provide power to our own production facilities and to solve the issue of using the associated natural gas, by 2010 and 2011, to bring it to 75%, the use of associated natural gas.</p>
          <p>Today 8% of our own &#x2013; of electricity consumed in Western Siberia is produced by our own facilities and the cost of this power generated by ourselves is 15, 20% less than when we purchase it from the grids that supply power in that area, in the Khanty Mansiisk and Yamal-Nenets Autonomous regions. In 2009 we built around 200 megawatts of power using the associated natural gas to produce power. The consumption from 2004 according to our different entities of the LUKOIL, we consumed more and more power generated from different sources. The heat power remains roughly the same. The total consumption of overall resources is growing up very, very fast and therefore this is of utmost priority to develop this program and Mr. Fedun had said that the meeting will take place in the next couple of days, headed by the President of the Russian Federation and our President will also take part in that meeting.</p>
          <p>On this slide you can see the changes and the increase in our own proprietary generation of power in Western Siberia, medium term to 2012 program. We will invest around $47 million and the savings will be 110 in kilowatt hours. The economic effect will be around $40 million.</p>
          <p>On this slide, you can see the structure of residual reserves, 51% in Western Siberia is in low permeability reservoirs. In recent years, the company increased the use of horizontal drilling, side tracks, hydro-fracturing on such formations. To use one of our largest fields as an example, Tevlinsko-Russkinskoye, 94% of wells drilled in 2009-2011 will be fractured and this will significantly increase the quality and the rate of produce in these fields.</p>
          <p>Additional production in 2009 by using new technology was 30% of the total volume of good produced in Western Siberia by LUKOIL. We use various hydro-fracturing technologies hydrodynamic using side tracks, hydro-fracturing. The most important and significant as I've mentioned before is hydro-fracturing technology. From 2008, we used &#x2013; we introduced new hydro-fracturing and we used over 20 of new hydro-fracturing technology with different oil field servicing companies such as Schlumberger, <mark type="inaudible" />, Trican Well Services, Weatherford. And we are also actively consulting with the experts from our strategic partners ConocoPhillips and NSI Technologies and Schlumberger experts.</p>
          <p>Using one of the oil fields Kechimovskoye, as an example, as a case study, I would like to talk to you about the following approaches. You can see the information on new wells because there were some questions previously about this asset. The efficiency of the development of this, using deviated and horizontal wells, as you can see from the slide, reflects the operation of the company to keep the OpEx and CapEx in check. The using of the horizontal drilling will allow us to efficiently control the decline rates from the fields. This will increase the fault filtration area, the coverage, the pressure belt and drop between water and crude areas.</p>
          <p>We also used another case study &#x2013; we used this oil field for the case study and NPV is around 530 with a negative sign and our joint work with our design entities has resulted with the fact that we will remain &#x2013; maintain the production levels. We will increase &#x2013; decrease by two times the OpEx and 15.7% IRR will be achieved with a positive NPV.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows the forecast for hydrocarbon production in Western Siberia, the investment costs into the development, exploration and production for 2010 to 2019 taken into account of probability assumptions, the majority in this structure from the exploitation drilling. The cost of construction represents a significant part and this falls into &#x2013; in the few several years of the development of any project. And the significant part is the cost of the development and the preparation in <mark type="inaudible" /> and this is why the unproportional changes in investment expenses and the increase in the exploitation drilling, 59 new projects include exploratory wells as well. The old Brown Fields, which have been developed as of, on the 1st of January, 2010, the new wells, Green Fields and new wells &#x2013; and new &#x2013; after the 1st of January, 2010. So, the average IRR for the existing portfolios is around 26% &#x2013; 27.6% for this 59 projects that I've mentioned.</p>
          <p>The next slide that I've mentioned, I would like to give you the typical calculations, typical well economics in Western Siberia for our new Green Field exploitation well, IRR is at the level of around 21.8%.</p>
          <p>I would like to note that average flow rate of a new well about 170 barrels per day and at the cost of $1.5 billion it works for about 160 days and the decline of 15% in the first year and then reduction in decline. And you can see that all the main indicators at use in this table.</p>
          <p>The following slide shows very briefly, the dynamics of our restructuring. At the beginning of 2008 we had repair and maintenance, unit, transportation units, exploration units and we have decided within LUKOIL on the 1st of January &#x2013; by the 1st of January 2011, to just retain 11,500 people. We would like to note that inside our Group there will be five territorial production units, two refineries, one gas refinery &#x2013; two oil refineries, one gas refinery and also a heating generator. The rest of the companies are going to be taken out of the Group &#x2013; outside the Group, which will indicate progress as far as efficiency is concerned and keeping in check OpEx and CapEx.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention and I am ready to answer any questions that you might have.</p>

          <p>Well, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our three presentations and I would like to open the floor to Q&amp;A. And I would like you to use this opportunity to the maximum to ask most of your questions and because not all of this senior management will be present in follow-up meetings that we're appointing for today. So with this I open the floor to the questions, please raise your hand. Yes please. Hello.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. It's <mark type="inaudible" />, just two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you can talk <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes two questions. One you did mention Saudi Arabia in your presentation, so obviously something you're moving forward. With the reserve evaluation, the stuff you're taking out, is the intention still as you said previously to be in commercial production by 2012 with those Saudi fields? And secondly on a separate issue, is the Conoco kind of divestment again. I mean, I am presuming you'll saying no, but just for the record, is it going to have any impact on the Timan-Pechora joint venture let's say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as Saudi Arabia is concerned, we would not aim at production starting before 2015 because after we have evaluated the reserves, we would like to choose the right technology and then to implement the project. So we're not expecting any potential production to start before 2015 and this is exactly what we said in our presentation. As for the reserves are concerned, I don't think I would like to make any statements at present. We are finishing the drilling of the fine exploratory well. We would like to coordinate it with the Ministry of Oil, but I think there is a high probability that they would have a commercial utilization.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We shall continue to work together with ConocoPhillips in Timan-Pechora project, as you know the project is already at the ROCE level. It is extremely efficient. We have 170,000 barrels per day of oil produced. We have our own export terminal. It generates a positive cash flow. So, all the participants want to remain within the project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would really appreciate if &#x2013; when you ask your question you state your company name and your name, but let's move on and if you have any further questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you for instance give us some investment program for 2010-2011 and a breakdown into different projects? Could you also comment on any news in expansion into debt markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. On the first question, I would like to say the following, our investment in the following years are going to be $8.5 billion each year. Most of it will go towards the development of upstream projects. As for if you want a more detailed information &#x2013; more detailed information, our representatives of our head office would provide you with more detailed information, as far as Mr. Matytsyn, who is our Treasurer, will talk about our debt capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The issue we need to refinance $2.8 billion, yes, and somewhat same probably will be done as in all available instruments and mostly probably Eurobond issues. But the company doesn't want to increase the loan portfolio and everything would be just to &#x2013; done just to refinance the current debt. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Rachel Layne, Bloomberg News. I was just wondering if you could comment on your dividend policy and whether you might be planning to return cash to investors this year or more cash. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. You know that our dividend policy is built on increasing dividends to our shareholders. This year we're expecting the payouts to be approved in April at our Board of Directors meeting. So, will &#x2013; they will either remain at the same level or they will increase, slightly increase in comparison with last year despite the results. So, our policy is that, to increase dividend payments linked to maturity of our projects and return on the capital invested, of course. Our main cash cow at the moment our Western Siberian projects and with time our overseas projects are going to become more and more profitable, yield greater income and of course this income is going to be used in order to payout dividends to our shareholders.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Nadezhda Kazakova, company J.P. Morgan. We are talking about the shares of ConocoPhillips, why don't you want to buy the ConocoPhillips shares yourself? And could you please explain about your preemptive price? Have you foregone your right to preemptive price or have you going to take an official decision on this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Nadezhda. Let us wait and see what the official statement of ConocoPhillips is going to be tonight at their press conference. After their official statement we'll understand what position they have taken and after that we can formulate our end position. Of course we don't say that we have no interest in buying out our own shares but we have to base our plans on our financial resources and our liabilities and our obligations that we have our financial liabilities. Our financial obligations as far as our investment agreements are concerned, we also have to remember that a new discussion which has been completed in Russia involving new taxation regime is coming to an end which is going to target the investment into exploration and drilling. There is going to be a new system aimed at radically increasing cash flows for oil companies from developing new production projects. So in such a situation, perhaps we should not buy out our own shares because the political leadership of the country might see it very negatively. So we have to be quite cautious and let's wait and see. So, our priority is investments, which are going to be profitable and again to yield good returns for our shareholders.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Niko, Frederick Capital. Could you tell us what C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire drilling costs you on average and what is the volume of your investment until 2012 and in Yuzhnoye Khylchuyu when the depletion or decrease in production is going through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not actually expecting any decrease in production in the next two years in Yuzhnoye Khylchuyu. In fact there is a positive dynamics, when the wells are showing better results or better returns than we had expected and the depletion rates are in fact lower than we had expected. So, we are quite optimistic, cautiously optimistic on Yuzhnoye Khylchuyu. And we might in fact utilize them for much longer than we had expected. On C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire, could you just please repeat your question on C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire? What was your question on C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How much does it cost you to do exploratory drilling in C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire and what is the total volume of investment by 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The cost of drilling together with exploration, have cost us $100 million, the drilling and exploration. Future drilling, future wells, this was the first in the history of Russia deep sea drilling on the ocean shelf, where a Russian company was the operator and in future of course we are going to cut our OpEx and our exploratory drilling costs to $70 million. In the following five years and as far as I'm concerned, I would like to emphasize that we have a forecast for the following three years. So on average we are expecting about $3 billion investment per year, a $3 billion investment in our overseas projects. Such investments are not going to be equal however. In 2011 we are planning to invest $3.54 billion and then it will reduce to $3.3 billion and in 2012 even lower. And of course everything will depend on how intensively these projects are going to develop. So the intensity of their development. So that constitutes 40 to 50% of all our investment in upstream projects.</p>

          <p>Paul Phillips <mark type="inaudible" /> Emerging Markets. I was just looking at your slides from your overseas end of the assets. You are suggesting that net profit is going to decrease in 2010 from the 2009 level of 612 million to 380 million. I was wondering whether you could just elaborate a bit on why that would be the case given oil price expectations, production not declining, et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to note, this is the specifics of our planning, the specificity of our planning. We have finished 2009 at the price of $80 per barrel but we have planned 2010 at $70 per barrel. It's a conservative estimate, $67 per barrel in fact for 2010. So this accounts for this sharp reduction. We have also been very conservative in our estimates of our Central Asian gas and Azerbaijani gas. We have reduced production to the levels which was declared by Gazprom and the Turkish company BOTA&#x15E;. We have completed our activities for the first quarter. We have exceeded our expectations and our income is similar to the previous years &#x2013; to that of the previous years.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, this is Katya Shiro from Morgan Stanley. I have two questions if I may/ First of all you've said that you're pleased with now with the balance of your refining and upstream and does it mean that you are not looking at acquisition in Europe anymore in terms of refining? And secondly about the new tax system in Russia, are you expecting that it's not going be advantageous anymore for refining in Russia or is this is not going to change? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Firstly, I have already mentioned that we have completed our development program in Western and Eastern Europe as far as refining is concerned or refineries are concerned. So we just want to make a better tracking margin. Slowly but surely it will achieve the acceptable level and our refineries will be working in quite profitable and beneficial conditions because we have acquired the refineries <mark type="inaudible" /> and as you know it is at the spot where pricing is determined both in the Northern and Southern Europe which allows us to have effective tracking operation. So, we are not planning any additional investment into East and West European downstream. We will just maintain the technical requirements coming from the European Union at the level of the technical requirements of the European Union level of requirements. As far as Russia is concerned, we are upgrading our plant in North Sea, our refinery in North Sea. It would generate additional 500 to $700 million of net profits just because of changing the technology and their operating methods. So, again we are quite conservative as far as our investment into refineries is concerned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now we will take one more question over the phone line and then we'll come back to the questions from the room. Do we have any more questions over the phone line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do have a question from Maria Radina from Nomura. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, I have three questions. My first question refers to cash flow in 2010. What will &#x2013; how will you use them? In 2009, you bought assets to the tune of $3 billion but only paid dividends $1.4 billion. And two clarifying questions, on Western Siberia. First of all could you give the most simple assumptions that you use for IRR for new wells in Western Siberia, CapEx, oil crude prices and well flow &#x2013; initial well flow? And secondly there was a slide on the production in Western Siberia but unfortunately oil production targets were given in boe. Can you give us the figure for production in Western Siberia in 2010, 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question, the use of the profit that we will generate, I've told already that around $8.5 billion will be used in the form of investment and roughly over $1.5 billion will be used to pay dividend. There will be no significant acquisitions or new significant acquisitions in 2010 or 2011; there are no plans for that.  As far as your second question is concerned, there is so much special information regarding that question and our Investor Relations personnel &#x2013; it's slide 14, all these issues are being considered there if you open our presentation on Western Siberia.  And the third question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Question Inaudible] .</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the production in Western Siberia the question was. We forecast to start stabilize production levels in 2010 and 2011, and the decline in the previous year as compared to the previous year will not be more than 2 or 3%. There will be some replacement of crude with gas, so the internal balance of hydrocarbon production will change in Western Siberia.</p>
          <p>So, again, we're going to have position production there.  We're going to have some continuous decline in Western Siberia, but it will slow down to about 1.5, 2 percentage points. And &#x2013; but there will be &#x2013; but that's on hydrocarbons, not on oil, which means that a portion of oil production is going to be substituted by natural gas production, which will be growing. That's it.  So I would like to come back to the questions in the room.</p>

          <p>John Gawthrop, Argus Media.  Last month we heard some reports about talks with the Ugandan government on possible activity there.  Could you clarify whether there is a concrete project involved here and if there have been anymore negotiations on this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">

          <p>Indeed, we had negotiations, talks in Uganda.  As of today we believe that the exploration search for new opportunities in Africa is one of the most promising directions to go, Uganda and the trend Kenya and other countries.  They're quite interesting acreages for exploration. Crude is between one kilometer and 1.5 kilometers depth, so it's relatively cheap to bring it into production.  But then there is an issue of transportation, storage and refining.  So today we are just looking to this.  We're doing a viability sort of research.  But it's too early days &#x2013; too early yet to talk about any specific projects yet.</p>

          <p>Charles Gould with Attribute System Management . Just a question on Iraq. Just trying to understand the contract structure there a little bit more.  On the remuneration fee that you're having is much lower than the other fees, and that obviously has to do with the status of the current greenfield developments.  But can you talk about just how confident you're with the cost recovery?  How much of the production is actually available for cost recovery and why you think that that fee is appropriate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to thank you for this question because the thing is we're dealing here in Iraq, we all are dealing with totally new types of contracts.  It's not a PSA <mark type="inaudible" /> paid back as in Iran.  Therefore, it is very important for the international investment community to get to grips with the evaluation of this project. And I would like to draw your attention to the way we approach the formation of our competitive evaluation of the project. It's obvious that the first tender showed the level of remuneration, the fee at around $2 for this type of fields.  So when we were preparing for the second bid for Qurna-2, we realized that the companies will be very aggressive. And first of all, we were looking at the competitors from the Asian companies, Chinese, Malaysian company and we turned out to be right.  Those companies where prepared to give much lower prices and fees than other investors.</p>
          <p>So our competitive advantage was that Western Qurna-2, our company has been exploring it for more than 10 years.  We know the reservoir quite well.  We have the project prepared for the development of the field already and we use the knowledge that Statoil had as a partner.  So we achieved a very aggressive level of production of crude in state, Western Qurna-2, which was one of the major factors.  But the production conditions, especially in the second bid, it was not the single factor that the fee and its importance was one of the priorities. And the decline by $0.07, the decrease changes the rate of return by 0.1% for the whole project.  Therefore, we thought it would be appropriate to make this request and bid, and it was &#x2013; obviously, we would like to have two or even more remuneration fee, but under those conditions that price would not have been competitive. And it became &#x2013; it becomes obvious that when we compete, we always think about how to get the money back from our projects.  It's our main objective. And looking at the specific conditions for that contract, we realize that the major risks are to do within the five years, five, six years of the implementation of that project.</p>
          <p>And our analysis showed that the main thing was, first of all, we have to clear &#x2013; to have a clear investment discipline and the key factor for the success for that project would be timing.  If we are in a position to perform on our obligations within next seven years to achieve the 1.7 million barrels per day as a project production level, it would be important for us to successfully implement the early oil project to achieve the production level of around 0.4 million barrels per day.  If we hit the targets within the two or three years, the flow of crude and the cash flow that we would generate would allow us to self finance the project. And our initial investment will be significantly lower than if &#x2013; as if we would have been providing the development for the seven years and start the production after seven years.  So as a result of investing of relatively small money, we only invest about 25, 30% of the total initial investment requirement and because of that we produce this effect of 15%. We are quite confident in that and we'll do everything that is necessary to generate real cash flow and to prove to our parent company and to our shareholders the success of the project. And this is obvious that we saw a lot of risk and we try to mitigate them in the most efficient way.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to say one thing. Yeah, we are going to have another sort of &#x2013; we are going to have about 10 minutes to finish off this Q&amp;A, and after that we're going to have some dessert for those that didn't have enough. But after that the management will take about 15 minute break and we will reconvene for the group meeting for those that have signed up in the room just behind you, the one that you were coming through when you were coming in.  So with this let me &#x2013; yeah, one more question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom Bergin from Reuters.  I have a question about the Iranian project you mentioned that you took some write-downs on. Could you tell me have you now exited in Iran? Are there any talks or are there talks that are ongoing? Also there was a mention of the asset disposal program that could lead to some quite considerable cash flow.  I was wondering if you can get some more detail on that, what assets &#x2013; what non-core assets might be for sale and how much you think might be raised.</p>
          <p>And then finally this was with respect to the Conoco situation, perhaps if you could tell me do you think there is any likelihood that Conoco's stake may be purchased by another strategic investor. Is that something perhaps that LUKOIL is interested in pursuing? And &#x2013; or whether simply the state may take part or all of the ConocoPhillips stake that's being sold and whether this is something LUKOIL would welcome?  Thank you.</p>

          <p>Reuters, okay. But I can begin talking about Iran.  I would like to say that life can go through different ups and downs, and then different spheres and we are not saying goodbye to our project in Iran.  We are negotiating.  We are in talks with the Iranian national company.  Everything that you've seen here, it was just the principal position of our auditors, which insisted to make provisions and to write-off this expense from the profit, but it doesn't mean that we lose the rights to that project.  And I would like to emphasize that our rights have been preserved by us.  We are looking into different options for developing our Iranian projects.  However, we are not giving up our rights to the projects, even though we sort of wrote them off in our project.  So if the political and economic conditions are favorable, we will be ready to come back to that project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second question, we should wait the result of press conference <mark type="inaudible" /> and after this we'll think about new opportunity of our strategic development segment.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> Interfax Agency.  I have three questions to the three presenters.  The first question is to Mr. Fedun. Are you planning to buy the share from Mittal in the Caspian resources in Kazakhstan and for how much?  And the second to the second presenter, when will you voice the figures for the results in Ghana and what are you planning to sign on the 2nd of April in Venezuela?  And the last question is clarification to Mr. Samuel. You were talking about restructuring, reducing the personnel.  Are we talking only about Western Siberia LUKOIL, yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question, we can't comment the situation, so no comment for the first question.  With regards to Mittal, we have preemptive rights.  I just wanted to say that we do &#x2013; we still have the preemptive rights.  When we have enough of them, we'll talk about it.  With regards to Ghana, the thing is that today we &#x2013; the reserves the &#x2013; can only improve, confirm after we drill three exploration wells.  So we won't &#x2013; we would not want to mislead or to create some speculative grounds around our exploratory projects.  Let's on this &#x2013; on the other hand we are full of optimism, I would like to add.  So if we are planning to invest that amount of money in those two countries for exploratory purposes so we do have some specific reason.</p>
          <p>With regard to Venezuela, to be honest with you, I will also state not to make any preliminary announcements.  Therefore, the national consortium plans for the nearest future, the plans are to sign the final contract Junin-6.  That's the main plan, the main target, because the Venezuelan parliament has ratified the project.  We initialed it and then according to their legislation, the parliament had to ratify the &#x2013; already did so.  So we think that very soon we will go through official procedure for the contract signing and to start implementing. When it takes place, on the 2nd of April, 10th of April, I don't think that matters that much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had one question in the back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I've answered this, it's only for Western Siberia the restructuring program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We got more questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's Mark Henderson from Credit Suisse.  A few questions, the first is on reserves. In your yearend reserve statement you revised down oil reserves by about 700 million barrels. In addition instant results we got, you took an impairment charge, part of which related to write-down at Timan-Pechora. Could you just explain what was behind the downward reserve revision and what the write-down at Timan-Pechora was about? That's the first one. The second just on Western Siberia, you talk about slowing down the decline rates in Western Siberia and that's due to increasing gas production. Could you just give us some color on whether the margins on gas are likely to be at the same levels as oil and whether you actually have confidence that you're going to be able to sell that gas into the system? And that's it, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I am sorry, I would like to clarify. I mean, the first question was on the differential between our previous and current reserve estimates, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in the FAS 69 disclosure at the end of your financial statements there is a downward reserve provision of about 700 million barrels, which is not separate from the reserves that you've added and the reserves that you've purchased.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as I understand we're talking &#x2013; we switched to a different evaluation system.  Before that we used a system by petroleum as site engineer SPV evaluation system &#x2013; SPE and now we are under the SEC rules.  There are several restrictions and I believe they're quite good.  It's the term overall for the development of project marketing of gas and more tough requirements for non-loss system for the project.  Oil majors currently represent their results under SEC provisions. And when we compare SPE and SEC it's how to measure the temperature in different figures, which is not the right thing to do.  Therefore, we've taken upon us the more tougher SEC rules and from this year we evaluate our own reserves in accordance with the systems that is used by our major competitors, which is the right thing to do.</p>
          <p>The same thing is done by Rosneft, therefore their reserves on this SEC are lower than our company.  And the latest development that I forgot to mention is Mr. <mark type="inaudible" /> stated yesterday that the licenses that we have some restrictions 25, 30 or 30 years, it's likely that they will have no time limit, which will also increase the total reserves for the whole company. And the second question, there were two questions on investment attractiveness of oil and gas wells.  Gas evaluation and the rate of return, we all understand that we have fixed sale price for our Bashaheski project using south transport's Gazprom system.  So we don't have any anxiety at the moment because there are no issues for long term there. For oil crude wells we have estimate sort of guidance prices and based on that we price our asset portfolio, and that's how we show the rate of return for the wells that were presented during this session.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of detailed calculations of this comparative &#x2013; compare analysis I would really like you to send a question to IR, because I don't want to be discussing that in detail in this group right now.  Well, I'd like to take maybe one more question and to kind of wrap up this portion of our presentation.</p>

          <p>Rachel Layne again Bloomberg News.  Move on to the question about the refinery expansion you're very specific about saying you've no plan to expand further in Western or Eastern Europe and would you consider expansion elsewhere.  I think there was a talk at one time of building a refinery on the East Coast of the U.S. with ConocoPhillips and was there anything to that talk and is that &#x2013; and then would you consider expansion elsewhere basically?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have any idea and any plans to expansion in North American market or European market. We have enough facilities for refining our oil.</p>

          <p>Well, I would like to thank you all for this very sort of good and active presentation.  I think we have maximum out of people that we had in quite some time in our presentations. And you don't have all to leave because they'll still serve the dessert and those that want to stay, you can stay. But the senior management will take a breather now and then we will reconvene in about 15 minutes.  We will reconvene for those that have registered for the small group meeting in the back room.
