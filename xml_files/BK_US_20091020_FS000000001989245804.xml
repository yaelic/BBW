          <p>Thank you, Wendy, and welcome everyone to the review of the third quarter 2009 financial results for BNY Mellon. This conference call webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record, reproduce, retransmit or rebroadcast these materials or any portion thereof without BNY Mellon's expressed written consent.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, let me remind you that our remarks may include statements about future expectations, plans and prospects, which are considered forward-looking statements. The actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement on page 15 of our press release and those identified in our 2008 10-K, our first quarter 2009 10-Q, and other documents filed with the SEC that are available on our website, bnymellon.com.</p>
          <p>Forward-looking statements in this call will include, among other things, the impact from restructuring the company's investment securities portfolio, the outlook for loan loss provision and the potential impact to our businesses due to the economic environment. Forward-looking statements in this call speak only as of today, October 20, 2009. We will not update forward-looking statements to reflect facts, assumptions, circumstances or events, which have changed after they were made.</p>
          <p>This morning's press release provides the highlights of our results. We also have the Quarterly Earnings Review document available on our website, which provides a quarterly view of the total company and business segments. We will be using the Quarterly Earnings Review to discuss our results.</p>
          <p>This morning's call will include comments from Bob Kelly, our Chairman and CEO, and Todd Gibbons, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, several of our executive management team members are available to address questions about the performance of our businesses.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Andy. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The headline this quarter is we're putting our investment securities issues behind us. We witnessed a huge improvement in securities prices during the third quarter, and I know you all saw it as well, and frankly we took advantage of the opportunities to materially de-risk our balance sheet. Essentially, we sold or are restructuring $12.1 billion worth of the securities in our investment portfolio, which is a pretty major portion of our holdings overall. More specifically, we sold 3.6 billion of our lower quality securities shortly after quarter-end and the remainder of the restructuring is ongoing and by moving the securities to a low-qual classification, we recognize a loss that has already been reflected in our tangible capital.</p>
          <p>These combined actions resulted in a portfolio restructuring charge of $3 billion after-tax. This accomplishes a number of things for our company. Firstly, it won't materially impact our capital because 90% of the charge was previously reflected in tangible capital. Our TCE ratio of 5.2% at quarter-end actually increased 40 basis points linked quarter. The other capital ratios remain strong versus peers.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the timing of our actions may give us a bit of an early mover advantage should others decide to sell or restructure their portfolios in the fourth quarter or beyond. Thirdly, it should positively impact net interest income in 2010 by 125 million to $175 million. And fourthly, it significantly reduces the potential for future losses. So basically we de-risked the portfolio, provided further upside to NIR, and did so without capital constraints. This resulted overall in an EPS loss of $2.04 or $2.4 billion. On an operating basis before that &#x2013; those items, we had a $0.54 earnings overall or $642 million.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of other news on the risk front, as previously signaled, our provision peaked during Q3 and should decline significantly in the fourth quarter. Overall, we're very comfortable with the quality of our loan portfolio.</p>
          <p>On other fronts, we're beginning to see some revenue growth, the benefit of improving markets and new business wins. Revenue was actually up 4% despite Q3 typically being a seasonally weak quarter. Fees and NII were actually up a bit. We posted growth in asset and wealth management. In fact, asset management had their best quarter in over a year. We saw nice growth in core fees and asset servicing, and we also benefited from some asset gains during the quarter. Where there is little or no growth, it's due to the low interest rate environment, which of course impacts NII, and low capital markets related revenue, which is FX with low volatility and in the sec lending business.</p>
          <p>We did show continued expense discipline. Operating expenses were actually down 9% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially due to cost reduction programs and merger-related synergies. Staff expense was actually down 7% year-over-year. The result of these things meant we posted 500 basis points of positive operating leverage on a linked quarter basis.</p>
          <p>Now, we also continue to win new business. In Asset Servicing, we won $1.6 trillion in new assets under custody over the last 12 months. In Wealth Management, we had our 15th consecutive quarter of net positive client asset flows. In Asset Management, we've moved into 11th place from 12th place a year ago in Pensions &amp; Investments' rankings of top money managers for 2009, and we're continuing to build share in Corporate Trust and Hedge Fund Servicing.</p>
          <p>Frankly, this is a transition year for trust banks. From our perspective, the two most important things we need to do to create shareholder value over time is firstly, continue to de-risk our portfolio, which we've taken a major step in addressing this quarter. And secondly, of course, grow revenue. We've been gaining share, but our progress has not been as visible yet. But as the markets continue to improve, it will become visible.</p>
          <p>Our businesses are very well positioned for improving equity in debt markets, global flows, and new issuance. So, in the meantime, we're going to remain focused on some fundamentals of this: organic growth, delivering great client service, and reducing operating expenses.</p>
          <p>So, at this point now, I'm going to hand it off to Todd for a more detailed review, and then we look forward to your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Bob. To take you through the overview of the quarter, please note that for comparative purposes, I will exclude from our operating results, restructuring charges associated with fair investment securities portfolio.</p>
          <p>You may recall that last quarter we told you that we thought we'd turned the corner in terms of the revenue environment. We're starting to see that gradual improvement we expected, though much of that improvement was masked by traditional third quarter seasonality associated with lower levels of capital markets related revenues. As we get into the numbers, my comments will follow the Quarterly Earnings Review report, beginning on page three.</p>
          <p>Our continuing EPS was a loss of $2.04 and was reduced by a total $2.57, which included the $2.54 related to the portfolio restructuring, which I will review in detail later, and $0.03 of M&amp;I which gets us to the operating EPS of $0.54.</p>
          <p>Total revenue was up 4% sequentially. Fee revenue was up 4%. Net interest revenue up 2%, and the provision for credit losses increased $86 million to 174 &#x2013; excuse me, $147 million and that was primarily related to downgrades in the Insurance and Media portfolios. As Bob indicated, we believe the provision has peaked and is expected to decline in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses declined 9% year-over-year and were down 1% sequentially. That led to sequential positive operating leverage of 500 basis points excluding the securities losses. Our operating margin for the quarter was 32%, up from 31% the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>If you turn to page five of the Earnings Review, you can see that assets under management, assets under custody and sec lending assets have increased from the second quarter. We had net AUM outflows of 16 billion in third quarter '09, primarily reflecting money market outflows, which is consistent with the industry trends.</p>
          <p>Turning to page six of the Earnings Review, which details fee growth. Security servicing fees were down 4% over the second quarter and 20% over the year ago quarter. In asset servicing, activity levels continue to strengthen and pipelines are up. Core fees were up 5% sequentially, reflecting the benefit of new business over the past year and higher market values.</p>
          <p>Securities lending fees were off $53 million sequentially at $111 million compared with the third quarter of 2008. The sequential decline was due to an expected narrowing of spreads, which are returning to more historic levels. The year-over-year results reflect lower volumes, lower spreads and lower nominal rates.</p>
          <p>Over the past 12 months, we won an incremental $1.6 trillion in new business in Asset Servicing, with over 300 billion coming in the third quarter. And the pipeline remains strong.</p>
          <p>Issuer Services fees were down 3% sequentially, reflecting lower money-market related distribution fees and a lower level of fixed income and structured finance issuances globally. The year-over-year decline of 25% primarily reflects the significantly lower level of corporate actions and trading activities associated with depositary receipts and shareowner services.</p>
          <p>Clearing fees declined 6% over the prior quarter and 9% over the prior year, resulting from lower money-market related distribution fees and lower trading volumes. The sequential decrease also reflects normal third-quarter seasonality. Driven by the market recovery, Asset Management had its best quarter in over a year. Asset and Wealth Management fees excluding performance fees were up 6% sequentially. We are encouraged by the results. While revenue was up less than 15%, the 15% growth in the equity markets, largely due to our asset mix, we did enjoy strong flows in Global Equity and Fixed Income. This was offset by outflows and alternatives, which are slowing.</p>
          <p>The sequential growth in Asset and Wealth Management was partially offset by lower money-market related fees due to the low interest rates. Company-wide, the impact of absolute low interest rates on money-market related fees has reduced our quarterly EPS by approximately $0.03 per share. This loss of revenue is fully reflected in the current run rate. As soon as the central banks begin to raise rates, we expect to recover some of this lost revenue.</p>
          <p>FX and other trading revenue increased 4% sequentially, reflecting strength in fixed income derivatives trading and a smaller loss in credit default swap hedges, partially offset by lower foreign exchange revenue driven by lower volatility and seasonality. The year-over-year decrease of 36% reflects lower foreign exchange revenue, driven by lower volumes and volatility as well as a lower valuation of the credit derivatives portfolio used to hedge the loan portfolio.</p>
          <p>Investment and other income was up $77 million sequentially, primarily related to gains from the sales of leases versus losses on leases we incurred last quarter. Other fee revenue increased 47 million year-over-year and 75 million sequentially, primarily due to a gain on the sale of Visa shares.</p>
          <p>If you turn now to net interest revenue, which is detailed on page seven of the Earnings Review, you can see that NIR and the related margin continued to be influenced by historically low interest rates. Our strategy to reinvest in high quality relatively short duration assets has helped to stabilize the net interest margin.</p>
          <p>Net interest revenue was up 2% sequentially, reflecting hedging gains partially offset by a decline in average interest earning assets and a decrease in the value of interest free funds. NIR, excluding the third quarter 2008 SILO charge, decreased 10%, principally reflecting an increase in interest earning assets offset by a narrower margin due to a decline in the value of interest free balances.</p>
          <p>The net interest margin was 1.85% compared with 1.80 in the prior quarter. The margin remained stable despite these very low interest rates, reflecting the impact of hedging gains and our ongoing strategy to reduce cash held at central banks and investment securities issued by government sponsored and guaranteed entities with a duration of approximately two to four years.</p>
          <p>Turning to non-interest expense on page eight, you can see that we're continuing to benefit from our cost reduction programs and merger-related synergies. Operating expenses were down 1% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower other expense related to reserves reported in the second quarter for the remediation of withholding tax documentation. We've reduced operating expenses by 9% year-over-year, driven by a 7% reduction in total staff expense and lower other expense related to operational errors reported in the third quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>On page nine of the Earnings Review, we provide more detail about our investment portfolio and the steps we've taken to reduce securities exposures. Since the trough in Q1, we've seen a significant improvement in the value of the securities. Clearly the securities have more upside, but the market is now reflecting a much more reasonable discount rate than it had just several months ago. Not only have market prices improved, but the market has also become more orderly. And this is providing us with a window to expedite our risk reduction strategy.</p>
          <p>Between the actions we took and the market price recovery, the unrealized loss in our securities portfolio was reduced by $6.3 billion or over 80%. The improvement reflects 4.8 billion related to the restructuring charge, that's $3 billion after tax, and 1.5 billion related to improvement in fixed-income prices.</p>
          <p>To give you a better sense of the mechanics of the restructuring, essentially what we did was to move the riskiest of our securities portfolio, which has an amortized cost exceeding $12 billion, from held-to-maturity or the available-for-sale account, into a lower-cost or a market account. Now, this gives us the flexibility to do a number of things.</p>
          <p>First of all, it enabled us to sell a portion of the portfolio, which we have substantially completed, subsequent to 9/30. We can now retain the remaining securities and benefit from the upside. We also have the financial flexibility to sell additional securities if we feel it appropriate, and it provides us an opportunity for a re-securitization to improve the liquidity of those securities.</p>
          <p>You can see the pro forma composition of our restructured securities portfolio, which shows the amortized cost prior to restructuring and net of restructuring, and it shows the security sales that we did after the quarter-end. Approximately half of the total charge was related to securities we expect to retain, and therefore have a potential to recover of some of the loss. However the restructured securities remain exposed to additional price deterioration during this restructuring process.</p>
          <p>Subsequent to September 30 we sold the lowest quality securities. With pre-restructuring we had an amortized cost of about $3.6 billion. We're very pleased with the execution here and we were able to sell those securities very close to our marks. The charge had a minimal impact on the tangible capital ratio, as approximately 90% had previously been reflected in tangible capital. Going forward, our Tier 1 and Tier 1 common are expected to benefit from that subsequent sale due to the lower level of risk-weighted assets.</p>
          <p>We expect the restructuring to have a minimal impact to NIR in the fourth quarter. Once completed, it should positively impact net interest revenue by about 125 to $175 million in 2010.</p>
          <p>The fair value of the investment securities portfolio at quarter-end was 54.1 billion. On a pro forma basis reflecting the subsequent sale of investment securities, the fair value was $52 billion. The pro forma unrealized loss on the portfolio remains at 1.4 billion. Our regulatory capital ratios remain strong, TCU strength in to 5.2% from 4.8%. Tier 1 and Tier 1 common continue to be strong at 11.3 and 9.8 respectively.</p>
          <p>In terms of our loan portfolio on page 11, note that we expect the provision for credit losses of 147 million in the third quarter to decline in the fourth quarter to the levels we experienced in the first half of the year. During the quarter the total allowance for credit losses increased 70 million and net charge-offs totaled 77 million. The effective tax rate in the third quarter was 31.8% slightly below our expected level of approximately 32%, which is what we expect for the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>On the integration front, on page 20, year-to-date, we've achieved $229 million in annualized revenue synergies, already within our full-year target, and we've also realized 190 to $196 million on expense synergies during the quarter, and that's an incremental of 10 million from the second quarter. We are now 92% of the way through our M&amp;I charges.</p>
          <p>So let's take a look at the run rate of our earnings. If you take out the one-time benefit of the Visa sale and the leasing gains, which were partially offset by the higher provision, that equates roughly $0.03 bringing the core earnings into the 51 to $0.52 range.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we're pleased with the progress we've made to de-risk our securities portfolio. The restructuring has enabled us to eliminate most of the risk associated with lower quality securities at a time when the prices of income &#x2013; fixed income securities are much improved. Our core revenue in Asset Management and Asset Servicing is growing, but our overall revenue growth continues to be impacted by the lower level of corporate actions and interest rates. Significant revenue growth will return once these drivers of our business normalize. In the meantime, we're going to stay focused on driving organic growth and increasing efficiencies.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it back to Bob.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well thanks, Todd. Why don't we directly open it up for questions? What I would say just before we move on is &#x2013; we went through, and I'm sure you may have questions about it, an enormously detailed process of looking at every one of our securities and using external help for this. And we did enormous due diligence as we made the decisions that we did. Clearly we got the message that OTTI was an issue for our stock, and we think that this will largely put this issue behind us and return OTTI to an immaterial number.</p>
          <p>Why don't we open it up for questions?</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question is from Betsy Graseck. You may ask your question and please state your company name.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morgan Stanley. Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Betsy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple of questions on the portfolio. I just wondered if you could give us a little bit more detail as to what didn't make the cut and why those securities didn't make the cut? And I understand that you took the lowest quality and restructured or sold but &#x2013; help us understand why certain assets didn't make the cut to get restructured?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Betsy, it's Todd. When we looked at the most troubled part of the portfolio, which frankly is the non-agency RMBS portfolio. What we did is we looked at every single security that we own, and we looked at the every underlying loan within each of those securities, and we categorized them as either red, yellow or green. If they were red, we thought that the discount rate was relatively low, meaning the market price was relatively high given the potential under a stress case for further deterioration in those particular loans. So those we classified as let's consider those for sale.</p>
          <p>If they were yellow, the potential for loss was lower, and the discount rate was relatively higher given the quality of the securities, so we said, let's retain those, but we'll mark them to market, and put them in this low com, which gives us the opportunity to restructure them going forward and recover what we think is a significant component of that loss. If we thought there was a very low probability even under the most stressed case of potential losses on the securities, we marked them on green and we just left them where they were.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would say too, Betsy, is we used Amherst Securities to really decompose this portfolio security-by-security. They spent weeks on it, and I think most people would view them as being pretty conservative in their outlook for the value of these securities. So they are a very good firm and they're pretty tough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I am looking at your page nine where you indicated that you've got about 53 billion in the portfolio, right, with roughly 20 billion on the "watch list." Are you saying all those &#x2013; that 20 billion in the watch list is all green?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Some of those, Betsy, there is about 5.5 billion of those that meet the &#x2013; that yellow criteria that I explained, that I just mentioned. But prior to the mark, those were at 8.5 billion, so we marked them down to 5.5 billion, so we are carrying them at market value.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so those would then shift into other next quarter supposedly, you know, ostensibly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Potentially.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the improvement in the NIR for next year is coming from --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me walk you through that. There is a couple of things going on. We sold a lot of securities; the face value of the securities that we sold were probably close to 3.7 billion. So we were earning interest on those and we've taken the proceeds of those sales, which is, at market value, is significantly below that, and we will reinvest that in &#x2013; consistent with what our strategy has been, which is basically to take government risk. So there will be lost NIR as a result of that. The securities that we've restructured, once the restructuring is complete, we will be able to accrete the difference between the market value and the expected loss back into net interest income. Now, we are going to be very conservative on what we estimate that to be, but the net of that puts us in the 125 to 175 range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And is that something that you would expect is going to be front-end loaded? And can you give us a sense of the duration on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would expect it would be in the three to four years, similar to the duration of the portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. With an accelerating or a decelerating benefit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now, I wouldn't say that's the case. It should be a little bit of it upfront, but not a whole lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then finally on the marks in the OTTI, you're anticipating that that would be materially lower as we are going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the earnings volatility will end up coming down on the back of this restructuring?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Betsy, the other way to say this from a big picture standpoint is after the rally we saw in the securities at the end of the quarter, we sold everything that we thought had, that was either over-valued or had further downside. And &#x2013; but we kept the things that needed to be marked down but we thought we had upside on.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You just had something that partly answered, but I wanted to just repeat it for a sec. So you sold everything that you thought was over-valued or had downside, but basically you're happy with the rest of the portfolio. In other words, the first thing I thought of when I saw the restructuring was, why not just restructure the whole watch list, and I guess the answer to this is things like in the cards or subprime, sorry, the home equity lines, you are just comfortable that they are fine where they're at and you'll -- they'll mature off at par?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just before you jump in, Todd, Glenn, just to be clear, we don't want to give away a lot of shareholder value. We want to give away; we want to sell the securities where we think there is just no value there longer-term for shareholders. This stuff we really think we have upside, we didn't want to say good-bye to it. Because, based upon all our analysis, we see that there is opportunities in subsequent years there. But Todd, what would you add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, just as a quick comment on cards, we actually did make a couple of little sales here and there actually during the quarter, so you don't know, it wasn't a subsequent sale. So we did sell a couple a week, right &#x2013; and if anything we're actually seeing some upgrades there. They're good trusts and the trusts are being supported by their sponsors, so we're actually impressed with the performance of that portfolio.</p>
          <p>In terms of the home equity lines, we just wrote those down. We basically said there's really no value to the insurance wrap even though the insurers are &#x2013; continue to pay under those wraps and wrote them down to expected values. So I think what we've got there is pretty safe and potential for a modest recovery. So I &#x2013; when we said we had a $26 billion watch list, we touched over half of those securities on that watch list.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I apologize for being cynical, we're just a little fatigued from six or seven quarters of lots of companies not actually selling much. And I appreciate the markets got better, it's just &#x2013; I think like the best way to clean up, there are hopefully no more future OTTIs, to sell a lot of stuff. These &#x2013; the chart on the &#x2013; on slide nine that has the portfolio, last quarter you had the quality ratings and we don't have that this quarter. I guess I'm specifically interested in how the Alt-A portfolio looks because last quarter it was like 74% BB plus and lower?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Glenn, we will obviously &#x2013; this, as you can see, these schedules were getting a little crowded. We had considered providing that. We'll definitely have them in the Q. There was very modest transition in the portfolio during the quarter. There was a little bit in the Alt As and a little bit in the prime. We &#x2013; what we did here is dealt with 93% of the Alt A securities. So we really think that we got that behind us.</p>
          <p>And we did, Glenn, we did sell $3.7 billion of face value in securities. So we really did move a lot of securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I appreciate that, I appreciate that. I saw in the text there was about $0.08 worth of lease gains and Visa share sales. Were there other gains that I didn't pick up on? There was just a lot of stuff that <mark type="inaudible" /> and I just want to make sure...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. No, I think those were the key. In the second quarter we took some losses on leases. In the third quarter, we took some gains; the combination of the two of those, $0.08 sounds about right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in clearing, I think there were some &#x2013; from what I understand, some loss clearing accounts on specific, Life transitioning over to LPL, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was a &#x2013; Rich, you want to take that one?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I will, yeah, thanks Glenn, this is Rich Brueckner. Yes, we did lose a couple of the relationships that we had at the LPL. They internalized them and then they left about the same amount on our platform. So that transition has already taken place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And that's <mark type="inaudible" /> quarter, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Say again, Glenn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That took place during the quarter. I'm just seeing if, on a go-forward basis, if there is a financial impact we should be thinking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It did take place during the quarter, but it's not material overall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Glenn, to get back to your previous question, I'd say the leases and the gain on the Visa sales was about &#x2013; more like was six or $0.07.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's cool, and last one. In net interest income conversation in your prepared remarks, you'd basically said, hopefully I'm paraphrasing correctly, is if I look at the net interest income component slide, it shows that basically everything stayed the same, the securities yield went up a little bit. I'm sure you can't take much cost out on the interest expense side, so you mentioned that there were hedging gains that helped support the NIM, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was. That was probably worth about two basis points in the margin, and I would look at that as a one-time event.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so basically your thought process is a little stable going-forward because on the interest cost side, I guess, rates can't go much lower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. They actually did go a little lower in the quarter, it was pretty remarkable. That's really why we saw our distribution fees for money market fees actually go down a little bit more than we thought. Now $0.03, we're running probably at 2 to 2.5, as you saw the funds rate even slip down to 15 basis points or so. But yeah, I think looking forward, we think we've stabilized the net interest margin around the lower level &#x2013; lower part of our range, just given the overall low interest rate of 180.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Cool. Thanks. I appreciate all the answers.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Credit Suisse. Good morning, Bob. Good morning, Todd.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Howard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Howard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, just taking a step back, in your prepared remarks, you spoke to just one of the emphasis being focus on growing revenues. Now we've seen a lot of improvement in the markets. You spoke to market share gains for the franchise. I guess I'm just curious, what exactly do you think is holding back an improving revenue trajectory from here? And how do you think about businesses like Securities Lending essentially being just lower growth, going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the way I kind of looked at it is, we have a lot of, as you know, we had a lot of amazing capital markets revenues last year. And flight to quality revenues that resulted in great revenue growth last year. We had 9% revenue growth. We more or less reset in the first quarter. And clearly, the equity markets improving materially and debt spreads coming in is encouraging. Again, that's why I said we're in a transition year.</p>
          <p>What we need to do is we need to see activity start to pick up in the markets again. At some point we need to see cross border flows start to pick up as the global economy starts to strengthen. We should see, with GDP growth around the world in the third and fourth quarter and heading into next year, there should be, with the economies around the world improving, you should see more financial flows improving as well.</p>
          <p>Hopefully we will see more stock and bond issuance; that should be helpful to us. With some continued improvement in the equity and fixed income markets, that should have a very positive influence on fees in Asset Servicing and Issuer Services, and also of course in Asset Management and Wealth Management. This is a business model that is completely levered to increased activity in the securities markets and global flows. And that's really core to our model.</p>
          <p>And at this point, we are re-rallying the economy. We have the &#x2013; we have the liquidity crisis behind us. The market has started to stabilize and come back with the improvement in the equity markets and the debt markets improving. And now we need to see real live activity start to come back, including at some point, hopefully over the next six months, you'll start to see the securitization markets start to show some signs of life again. Once those things happen, every one of those things are fantastic for the business, and maybe I'll let Jim talk about sec lending for a minute.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. Yeah, Howard, it's Jim. If you take a look at securities lending today, you see that our balances are actually down to around kind of 2004 levels and our spreads are down to 2006 levels. So we really think we are at or near the bottom of the securities lending environment. We're seeing a slight uptick in balances. The spreads have declined slightly from the end of the third quarter; we do believe that they are really at or near the bottom.</p>
          <p>So we're seeing a few clients come back into the Securities Lending program. We're seeing a few clients reexamine their investment guideline structures. So we do expect a more muted environment around securities lending unlike what we saw clearly in the '07 and '08 period. But we still do think it's an important part of our business model.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, when I said it's a transition year, it's like, it's sort of &#x2013; for our industry, it's sort of like hitting the reset button. We had some extraordinary activity last year. Revenues clearly got hit in the first half of this year, and we're going to start to rebuild from here. That would be our expectation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Bob and Jim. That was all very helpful. And then switching gears, Todd, I wanted to clarify something you mentioned on the impact of money market fee waivers. You said it reduced this quarter's earnings by $0.03. Given the duration of those portfolios and assuming no change in yields from here, are we now at full run rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I would say we are, Howard, and if you think about our businesses, it touches us in a number of places. It hits our Asset Management business, obviously, on the manufacturing side; both our Issuer Services and our Clearing business generate a fair amount of distribution fees. And unfortunately, at these very low yields, they are being waived.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then when we think about that reversing, how should we think about the margin of that $0.03, and the margin of that returning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is very high margin business. I mean we're talking about $0.12 that goes right to the bottom line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then Todd, one follow-up on credit quality. You and Bob spoke to your outlook for a peak in provision expense this quarter. Can you just touch on the NPA increase during the third quarter and how to think about that vis-&#xE0;-vis your provision outlook going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'll have &#x2013; our Chief Risk Officer, Brian Rogan is here. Brian?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Our increase was about 48%; it's primarily around, almost 75% of it around one insurance company name, which we're actually hoping to recover. So really as Todd mentioned, it was our insurance portfolio. The increase in provisioning in our legacy media portfolio, which we have actually had as an exit portfolio since our merger in '07.</p>

          <p>Hi, Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When you think about all your different comments about the impact of low rates on sec lending spreads, on margin, on money market mutual funds, is it possible to tie that together? I mean if we think about the core EPS run rate in the $2-plus range right now, what's the overall impact of low interest rates on that run rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's hard for me to really forecast that because behavior will change with interest rates as well. So what's going to happen to money market funds? Are they going to grow or are they going to contract? Will depositors in that kind of an environment be more likely the leave more free deposits with us, or less? But if you &#x2013; if you just make the assumption that we recover the full 12% that is being waived today, if you make the assumption that our margin moves from a 180 to 200 basis points, and that the spreads that we would enjoy in sec lending rather than being &#x2013; might increase by 20% or so, I think you can kind of add it up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then in terms of recouping that fed funds, is it just fed funds at zero and the short end of the curve is flat? So as long as fed fund is anything but zero, it starts to come back or is there some level where it kicks in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It will kick in immediately as the funds rate moves up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And one thing I might add to that, Brian, it's just not the U.S. rates; it's euro, it's yen, it's sterling, it's global rates. In the major currencies.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just want to understand the securities. So basically you took unrealized securities losses and made them realized; is that because of any view on the markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's certainly the view that the market gave us the opportunity to do it. If you think about it over the past 18 months, an orderly sale of 3.8 billion of primarily RMBS &#x2013; pretty &#x2013; securities, I'm not sure that the market would have given you much of shot at that other than a very distressed level. We've seen, on those securities, we've probably seen a 15% recovery on many of them. So there was a window, we thought that the bid, although significant &#x2013; continued to be significant discount rates on the expected cash flows, it's a lot more reasonable. And so because of that opportunity, that window, we went ahead and went through it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you sold 3.6 billion in the fourth quarter, so are there losses in the fourth quarter related to this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there are not. We sold those at the marks that we had them at 9/30.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then you said you are &#x2013; I didn't quite get it, you're going to have a 125 to 175 million pickup next year because you're buying government securities; could you explain that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, it's really two parts. A, we dealt with over $12 billion of securities, Mike. So there is about 3.6 or so that we sold. We took the cash which was obviously quite a bit less than that from those sales, so probably in the two -- little over $2 billion, $2.1 billion range. And that will be reinvested as we would with any excess cash typically. So that &#x2013; what we've been investing in is government paper, treasuries, gilts, depending on the underlying currency or government-guaranteed paper and some agencies. So that will go into a mix of that.</p>
          <p>Obviously the rates will be lower than what we were earning on a larger amount. So we had 3.7 with a slightly higher yield, and we will be able to reinvest this 2.1 billion. So we will lose net interest revenue on that part of the transaction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then lastly on the topic of risk, the problem --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Wait, one sec, Mike, let me finish.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is two components to it. So that was the &#x2013; that's going to be a negative. That negative is going to be more than offset by restructuring the other 8.5 billion. So we took that down to its market value, but we expect to be able to accrete next year, some of that back into net interest income over the following years. And our estimate in aggregate of those actions is the 125 to 175 that we talked about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, so do you consider that non-core, the accretion of that back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, last on the topic of risk, the problem assets were up a lot from the second to the third quarter; what was behind that? Inflows, was it the Shared National Credit Exam, and given that increase, why would you be so confident about the provision?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I actually think you hit it on the head; it primarily was downgrades of the Media Insurance portfolios and the Shared National Credit. When we look at them, we look at the run rate, we do our analysis. We are confident of the downtick in the fourth quarter into 2010. And at the time of the Shared National Credit till now, I think the insurance industry, particularly as Todd mentioned, as the portfolio increases, is actually improved. So we're pretty confident that, subject to no double downturn in the economy or surprise, that we should have significantly lower levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we should get a good portion of this back over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Tom McCrohan of Janney Montgomery Scott; your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Hey, Todd, what are the assumptions surrounding the accretion coming back next year? Is it interest rates, home prices? I mean what needs to happen for you to get that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're going to be pretty conservative. So if you look at the difference between the market value and the expected cash flows, we'll probably only recruit &#x2013; accrete a small &#x2013; maybe 50, 60% of that back in. And you look at those accretion assumptions each quarter, so we'll review them quarterly. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Tom, the point there is if you did, if you accreted it all back in and then you actually did have any losses, it would trigger another impairment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's easy to say Tom, and I know you know this, but it's not intuitively obvious. It wasn't to me initially, as we started talking about this some time ago, but in writing down these securities, as they improve in value over time or particularly when looking at the cash flows, it doesn't come back as gains, it comes back as NII.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and I'm not just very intuitive, but --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's the way it works.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The way it works. So how will an increase in short-term rates impact your ability to claw back either a portion of the restructuring charge or impact your accretion assumptions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah it's a, that's a good question. Frankly we think these securities are probably going to trade inversely to interest rates a little bit, meaning that you're likely to get more cash flows in an environment where rates are rising, because it's typically indicative of a little bit of a stronger economy. So it's &#x2013; they're not necessarily intuitive from that perspective. But we think it's &#x2013; we think it's probably another positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And who are the natural buyers of the securities that that you're selling? And is there any residual interest that the Bank of New York Mellon maintains in these securities either on the upside or downside?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The 3.7 billion that we sold was an outright sale, where we have no retention of anything, no financing, nothing. And why don't I spend a minute describing how we did that? We identified one very large bulk component of our RMBS, our non-agency RMBS portfolio, and we actually bid it in bulk. We didn't think we would sell it in bulk, we thought ultimately we would sell it in lots. But we got a bid that was very close to where we had it marked and what we thought was fair value. So we went ahead and hit that bid rather than work it through time. We then sold lots of other securities, most of which we got slightly above where we had them marked at 9/30. But they are gone for good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And who were the typical buyers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We ended up selling that through the dealers. We did talk directly to some end-accounts, but mostly we went through the dealers themselves. The 8.5 billion that we marked down to 5.5 billion, we do expect to retain a significant portion of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so you're going through the dealers, is it hedge funds at the end of the day buying this stuff or is it insurance companies; do you have any insight into that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, these securities would be eligible for the PPIP. So it wouldn't surprise me if we saw people inventorying them for the PPIP. I think the asset managers around the PPIP have actually been wondering whether they're going to be able to find product. So this was &#x2013; it's an opportunity for many of the dealers to position it, but I think much of it is going to the hedge funds and other investors that feel like there is some value there. And we believe there is some value there. I don't think there is any question that the investors in these securities are going to get these yields.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just one last question, any update on the Russian lawsuit settlement that we keep reading about in the press?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not much I can say. There is another hearing on the 22nd, Tom, and obviously everything we are hearing is encouraging. So there is not much more we can say.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Bedell of ISI Group. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, folks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick question on the credit quality and just the confidence around the 50 million provision level, I guess really related to commercial real estate, if you could just talk about that portfolio and your reserve levels against that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Our portfolio is about $3.6 billion in the commercial real estate side. We put about 1.8 billion of that in what we call stabilized and about another 1 billion investment grade REITs, so primarily investment grade REITs. Which leaves us about 750 million kind of exposed to construction, primarily in residential. Almost all of it is in New York City with a few pieces in D.C. and Boston. Only about 300 million of that is even classified. So we feel pretty good that even on that bet that we might have some restructuring, some extensions, but we really don't see significant losses in that portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And your reserve is that still 11 million on that portfolio, if I recall from the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We don't disclose reserves to any particular portfolio.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. You know, you break it out in the second quarter Q, it's 2% of your reserve is allocated to the commercial real estate, 11 million or so? We can follow-up on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll get back to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll get back to you on that number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No worries. And then just on, just on &#x2013; a couple of comments on the Asset Management business, maybe if Ron is there and could speak about the alternatives side of it and when do you think the outflows will slow down there, so you can see better growth in your core to long-term asset management business? And then just a few comments on where you are with your high water marks in general, sort of an expectation of what we might see in performance fees in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Brian. This is Ron. Overall, we're quite pleased with investment performance. If you think about it kind of boutique-by-boutique, our investment performance in most of the boutiques has been quite strong. We have had some challenges in the alternatives area, some of the global macro areas as well as some of our fund-of-funds. And the global macro stuff, which makes up a very big portion of our alternatives is, the performance has improved dramatically.</p>
          <p>Third quarter showed some strengthening performance, continuing the trend in the second quarter. So the high water marks, we're approaching them. I think that we are much more optimistic about getting past them late this year or early next year than we would have been a quarter ago. We still in the fund-of-funds area, it's starting to stabilize, but it's not where we want it to be. But in terms of outflows, most of that is behind us now. So we're actually feeling very good about where we are investment performance wise and consequently what it means for our &#x2013; not just of our business retention but our new business. The pipeline is very strong and transacting is happening, as I'm sure you're aware. Overall institutional volumes have been down dramatically this year. In the first half of the year the industry was down almost two-thirds from the same time in 2008 and we're starting to see that turn around.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There is some upside in &#x2013; I guess there is a chance we'll see a normal seasonality and performance fees in the fourth quarter if we were able to reach high water marks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't &#x2013; I'm not optimistic about seeing any kind of normal performance fees this fourth quarter, but we'll start to reach and exceed those performance fee high water marks in the fourth and the first quarter. So 2010 is what we're looking to.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

          <p>Hi, well, we've been through this before with depositary receipts, and we know that the market will come back and has begun to come back. September was the strongest month we've had for issuance for six months. And we're, of course, very well positioned for, as everybody has been saying, the pickup of the equity markets. So we already have the largest market share there at 64% and an extremely strong pipeline has been building. So we felt pretty good about the future for DRCs.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Bob a question for you. You've been quite tight with expense control as we saw this quarter. Looking forward and with a slightly better scenario or somewhat better scenario in 2010, could you just talk about your reinvestment plans, your reinvestment into the franchise particularly Wealth Management looking forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure. I'd be happy to Nancy. We have basically the entire Executive Committee around the table with us right here and except for Jonathan who is over in Europe right now on some client issues, but he is on the call, and we started spending a lot of time three or four months ago and just thinking about the future of our businesses and how we're going to grow revenue again and do a better job of cross selling across our businesses and also figuring out what are our highest priorities in terms of geographic growth locations.</p>
          <p>And once we split those up into teams, we're building some interesting additional growth ideas for our company over the next two or three years and we're beginning to put together detailed plans to execute on those. But in addition to those, we're also continuing to look at areas where we can get further expense savings going forward, and there's lots of places we can do that through moving folks to our growth centers, which tend to be a little bit lower cost and even higher service quality. But we also have opportunities to re-engineer some of our businesses.</p>
          <p>Having said that though, as I mentioned on the revenue part of it, we are reinvesting in our businesses and in the higher growth geographies like in the Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Europe, and in Brazil. On wealth, we've been &#x2013; we continue to want to invest in sales as well as new offices, maybe I'll let Dave talk about that for a minute.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, hi Nancy. As you watched over the last couple of years, we've been pretty tight on expenses, but we haven't cut back on our sales force, in fact it's actually up a little bit. I think you can see that reflected in the sales growth. As Bob said, as we look towards the next 12 months or so, now that we have, substantially have pretty much completely completed the integration of our two companies here, we are looking to expand location-wise. There's certain cities that we've talked about in past here in the United States that we're very interested in. So I think '10, you can probably look for further expansion on the sales side as well as the addition of a couple of new locations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave has delivered very well, and his team has delivered very well in this business. And think about 15 quarters of net asset inflows and it's something that we want to continue to invest in. We wish it was a larger business than it is, and we'll keep doing that. And we're very cognizant of the fact that over time where the value is created is players who can grow revenue a little faster than others, and we're very focused on it. So, thanks for asking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And also, given what you did with the securities portfolio this quarter, which as you'd said was to put an issue behind you, are there any thoughts that you might do something similar or something radical with the sort of legacy credit portfolios that you've got? Do you see any opportunities there to do some kind of radical restructuring?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You can rest assured that we thought about that a lot. And in the end, we kept coming back to the essential conclusion that we feel very comfortable with the quality of our loan portfolio. We've been talking about the fact that we've been de-risking this portfolio for years and we continue to do that. We still do have what we would call some tall trees, and that is some single name exposures, but to very high quality names. The only scenario frankly, Nancy, that I would worry about is if you had a complete outlier situation occur along the lines of an Enron type situation or something, where there is no way you can predict it. But when you go through name-by-name, portfolio-by-portfolio, and look at our overall credit plans, we simply don't need to do anything else in this portfolio. Brian, what would you add to that?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Bob, just actually to put some numbers around it, at the time of the merger, we had funded loan commitments of 112 billion; as of end of June it was 85 billion, it's probably down another 2 or 3 billion. So we've really been shrinking and de-risking the portfolio, switching it to the investment grades who use our products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We still have some work to do. Where would you expect us to be a year from now? You know, if you had to put a bid offer spread on that, down another five or ten?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, probably another three or 4 billion. But I think it's also the composition, as we mentioned, we have some legacy portfolios particularly in media that, where we'll take some losses on. But on a relative basis, it's small in our company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very interesting. A little bit, Nancy, the way I think about this is I'm hoping that when we look back on this in 12 or 24 months, people look and say, okay, this is &#x2013; BNY Mellon was one of those players who were perhaps an early mover in putting their major balance sheet issues behind them. And of course what's different about us versus a number of our major financial institution peers is that our issues were predominantly in the securities portfolio, and that's been hit the most and the fastest and it isn't really in the accrual books.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of questions, I apologize if you guys have already answered this, but I came on late. But I was just wondering, the de-risking of the investment portfolio, how does that change, if at all, how you look at the investment strategy and capital management?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I would say, not at all, Ken.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, Casey. We have not changed what we've been doing in the investment portfolio since we've merged. So we've only been buying either agencies, government guaranteed or direct sovereign risk in the portfolio, and that hasn't changed. In terms of capital, clearly we've got less of our capital at risk to the fluctuations of securities prices as a result of these actions. So I think it definitely protects our capital, and as we look forward, we are a pretty strong generator of tangible capital pretty quickly. So I think it's going to give us some flexibility to do some things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then moving on to expenses. And so it looks like legal was up; I know there was a little offset with the other expenses down. How sustainable is that? Is that something we should expect going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at our legal and other expenses, we did have some, a little pop in our legal expenses. I think it's a little high this quarter, but I think it's going to probably continue to run reasonably high. So we might see some recovery there in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The rest of the expenses, I think this is a pretty good reflection of what we would &#x2013; what we would be basing our run rate off of.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the legal, is that entirely, is that increase entirely due to Russia?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, Bob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Gerard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, when you &#x2013; when the deal was put together with Mellon and Bank of New York, you wrestled with capital allocation, what was the best use of it and lending is one of the more capital-intense businesses that you guys are involved in. In view of the Shared National Credit Exam, does this accelerate or change your view of what the long-term future is for corporate lending for Bank of New York?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it really doesn't change it for BNY Mellon overall. At some level we're always going to be lending money. But I think we increasingly recognize, as an institution, we probably don't need to do as much as perhaps we did in the past in order to generate our core business revenues of Asset Management and Asset Servicing. So our business model is simple. Maybe we relied a little bit too much upon lending in the past to get the servicing and asset management type business, mainly on the servicing side. And I think we've had great learnings on that over the past couple of years, and that has ultimately meant that people now recognize that we can run with a smaller credit book than we have in the past. We still will continue to have a credit book but it will only exist if it clearly helps our fee-based businesses.</p>
          <p>So it's interesting, we had an offsite a couple of weeks ago with our top 100 people around the world, and one of our good learnings here was just about the incredible strength, the need for an incredibly strong balance sheet in good times and in bad. You insist upon it, and I know we'll get premium valuations as a result of it. And if you took an example of, let's say you add another 10 billion of loans on your balance sheet, an extra 150 basis point spread, that might be worth a buck in our stock price, but a one PE turn in the &#x2013; in our PE is worth three bucks. So we know you pay us for &#x2013; shareholders pay us for our fee revenue growth and not for taking credit risk. And that has been a core learning, and our efforts will continue to de-risk the portfolio at the margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the number of running assets, how large was that insurance credit that you referenced that came up in the Shared National Credit exam?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure &#x2013; are we even allowed to talk about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we don't typically relate &#x2013; refer to the Shared National Credit exam. It is a confidential exam, Gerard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Gerard. Sorry, we're not allowed, I think. I think that's the basic rule because I asked.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's fine. Then in the Florida bank that you're selling, that I think is expected to close first part of 2010. In that sale are there non-performing assets, there are I understand non-performing assets with that bank. Are they going with the sale or do they stay with Bank of New York?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will retain some of the loans in that portfolio, and obviously it's the weaker of those loans. So we have built up a pretty significant reserve against that. That's not reflected in this reserve, the discontinued operations are not shown on that balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now are the non-performing assets from discontinued operations included in today's non-performing asset number, or they still excluded similar to what you did in the last quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're excluded.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how much are those, about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have them off the top of my head. Brian, do you have them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, at the end of the third quarter, in the discontinued, approximately 240 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very good. And then finally, I think you guys mentioned obviously the net interest margin was going to be stable. If the Federal Reserve or what kind of rate increases do you need to see from the Federal Reserve next year to see your net interest margin exceed 2%, at some point in the latter part of next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I can't say that I modeled it that scientifically, but before we get kind of the full run rate back in, I would imagine you'd have to go over 100 basis points in the base rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Gerard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from John Stilmar with SunTrust. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. A quick question on Issuer Services. Can you please help me understand sort of what the slope or trajectory is, at least near term over the next three quarters, of revenues and issuer services given at least there seem to be some positive as well as cyclical dynamics underneath that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean we probably can't comment exactly because of course we're waiting for kind of the enormity of the improvement in the equity and debt markets. But I've already commented about DRs, maybe I could just give you some color about Corporate Trust. Of course, the debt markets there has been quite mixed, but the largest markets are still down. But again, we feel quite confident not only about our increasing market share, which we've had quarter-on-quarter in every debt type. We also are quite positive about the TALF program starting to get the momentum here in the U.S.</p>
          <p>And of course, we have the best global footprint of any of our peer groups, so we can absolutely take advantage of debt issuance and growth around the world with a building pipeline. So with all those kind of guarded but positive remarks about both the debt and the equity markets, we expect Issuer Services to come back, but it will probably come back slowly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So should we use 3Q as kind of a little bit of a baseline to start our estimates front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Should we use 3Q as a relative baseline to then start a re-growth of that business, which has sort of come down in earnings over the past several quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's probably fair, John. I mean, one of the key drivers in Issuer Services, there are a couple of drivers, but depositary receipts is a very high margin business, and it tends to be very cyclical. And as we come out of the cycle, a lot of the revenues are driven by the emerging markets and corporate actions out of the emerging markets, and they're kind of slow to follow up. So we definitely have seen that business reset, and in the Corporate Trust, your -- it's an annuity style business, but you're not adding a lot to the annuity because there is not a lot of new issuance, especially there is no structured issuance, which was a fairly large component of it. We are seeing some more traditional issuance and capturing market share there. But it still a little bit soft.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And John, if I could, it's Bob again. It's kind of a related topic, but I would encourage everyone on the call to start thinking about the fact that next year the Federal government is going to start thinking about the mortgage market and what we're going to do about it. The fact is the U.S. mortgage market is completely broken. We need national underwriting standards, state-by-state-by-state in terms of registering of people and minimum down payments etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. We probably need a slightly different product in this country in terms of there should always be recourse.</p>
          <p>And I have severe concerns about the free refinance options, because people aren't putting mortgages on their balance sheet. It is just not worth it; there is just not enough spread. Ultimately, that means the government has really got to re-evaluate their role and why are they in this business going forward. And all you've got to do is look to other countries and see how much better they've done than us. And I think this is a gigantic opportunity for consumers as well as for the financial markets over the next few years if we can fundamentally rethink how we deliver this product to the benefit of consumers as well as to the markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And then as I kind of shift topics, just to make sure that I put a finer point on the restructuring of your securities portfolio: Is it fair for me to, the actions that you've taken are now being reinvested in lower margin securities and then the redeployment of that should occur over a period of time and therefore the earnings accretion that you have given is the accretion that you expect once those securities become fully &#x2013; once those securities become fully invested, or how should I think about the reinvestment period. Is there a lag in margin that we should expect sort of a dip and then to a rebuilding level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would expect, John, that it will be probably net neutral for this quarter because the restructuring won't be completed till later in the quarter. And you're right, there will be a lag on the reinvestment &#x2013; the reinvestment process. So as we model this, we think it's about neutral for the quarter and the way to look at it is in the first quarter of next year we start to see the accretion come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, perfect. And then the last question, just because the volatility especially in the securities lending business, you certainly surprised me by growing your total balance of securities up, but as you talked about the spread being down, which is natural given the environment. Without any changes to binary interest rates, is there an offset anywhere else to that securities lending business, which I would imagine also is tied to other such businesses like Pesto deals, platforms or something like that where there is a &#x2013; there may be higher revenues garnered in other parts of your business that may not be as readily transparent given the lower margins that we might be expecting for securities lending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, John, it's Jim Palermo. It's a good question, and I think you're really getting to the pricing model in our business and in our industry. And historically securities lending was an important component of our revenue streams, and that was priced into the overall offering for us as well as for our competitors. I think you are going to see going forward a repricing so our hard dollar fees likely to be a higher percentage of our overall revenue streams going forward.</p>
          <p>Now you got to further take into account that that repricing mechanism takes place over the course of several years, and that bundling that goes on in our business, you will see that reflected whether it's our core custody, our fund accounting administration, our foreign exchange, cash management all those revenue streams, we take into account and we price it on an overall relationship standpoint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, John. We have time for one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our final question is from Robert Lee of KBW. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, and thank you for sticking around for all these questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of my questions were asked. But just one, this actually relates to, I guess the pending implementation of I guess it's FAS 166 or 167 and specifically I know a lot of asset managers are concerned that as written it would require them to start consolidating products that have a performance fee on them. So could you maybe talk a little bit about how you see that impacting  you, as you head into New Year, do you think that will be an issue that you're going to have to start consolidating some asset management products as it is currently written or do you feel pretty confident that it's not going to be the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Robert, this is Todd Gibbons again. We've obviously taken a very hard look at 167. Unfortunately, there is no good guidance even up to this point coming out on exactly what's the &#x2013; how to interpreted it. And we do think there is some likelihood that we will have to consolidate some modest portion of our asset management business. We don't think it's intended to consolidate significant portions of it. But from a risk perspective, from a capital perspective, it really shouldn't &#x2013; it shouldn't be meaningful because it's not simply risks that belong on our balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that was it. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is one of those, Robert, this is one of those unintended consequences of pushing through FAS 166 way too fast. And this got caught up in it and hopefully this gets clarified over the next few months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>So I wanted to thank everyone. This is probably one of our longer calls and I'm glad we had it as a longer call. In summary, we've significantly reduced our balance sheet risk so that going forward OTTI should not be material, NII should be higher, capital ratios are strong. I think we have plenty of upside for our key businesses. And just as a reminder, Andy Clark is always available for any questions. Thank you very much and have a good day.</p>
