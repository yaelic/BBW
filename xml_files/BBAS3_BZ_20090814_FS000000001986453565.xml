        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is Monteiro speaking. Good morning to you all. Welcome to the second quarter 2009 results conference call. Before Geovanne start with the discussion of our performance in the period, I would like to share with you some thoughts about our performance.</p>
          <p>The first half of the year affected by the probably worst crisis in the international financial industry, we are confident adding R$4 billion, which corresponds to our annualized ROE of 27.5% and earnings per share of R$1.56. After achieving a one-time cost gain, the recurring net income amounted R$3.3 billion year-to-date, 7.5% higher than the same period of 2008, and recurring annualized ROE of 22%.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, net income reached R$2.3 billion, and the recurring net income R$1.7 billion, 13.5% vis-&#xE0;-vis the previous quarter represent an annualized ROE of 23.7% against 21.6% in the previous quarter. Thus, in the first half of 2009, the amount of R$1.6 billion was distributed to our shareholders corresponding to 40% payout ratio.</p>
          <p>We are very positive because even being through our seasonally weak period, and the understandable cost savings related to the macroenvironment, previously during the presentation, we delivered good results in line with our expectations. The following months tends to be seasonally better &#x2013; stronger than expected, despite the macroeconomic indicators anticipate that we might have &#x2013; bring the economics to an upturn size, it also leads us to be confident in reinforcing our goals and commitments regards to business expansion and maintaining our profitability level, always focus on sustainability.</p>
          <p>Well, talking about our results, I am glad to say that we recovered the leadership in assets in the Brazilian banking industry, with R$598.8 billion. The growth of our total assets was <mark type="inaudible" /> by the expansion of loan portfolio supported by an increasing funding base, and by the consolidation of Banco Nossa Caixa financials.</p>
          <p>The loan portfolio reached R$252.5 billion at the end of June 2009, a rise of 32.8% in the past 12 months, surpassing the 19.7% growth of the banking industry, and increasing its share in the total assets.</p>
          <p>The most expressive growth in loan portfolio had been in the consumer finance business, which grew 6.9% in one year, totaling R$68.5 billion, and for the first time ever, leaving behind the agribusiness portfolio. The performance was driven by the Banco's payroll and auto-loans, which increased 110.7% and 74% in one year respectively.</p>
          <p>Loans to business reached 103.4 billion, increasing 32.1% in 12 months, which highlights the working capital line, which grew 54.5%, representing 47% of the total growth. The agri portfolio ended up the period with 67.6 billion, a 9.7 growth compared to June 2008.</p>
          <p>The net interest income in the first half of 2009 showed an increase of 35.7% compared to the same period of 2008, amounting R$15.5 billion.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter, the net interest income reached R$8.5 billion, an increase of 21.5% over the previous quarter, and 45.5% compared to the same period of 2008.</p>
          <p>I would like to emphasize that this performance in the quarter confirmed our guidance, and showed what the strength of our company, which was able to deliver consistent results amounting to profitability to its shareholders. That is why we won't give the 2009 guidance, especially for tax rates that was reviewed due to the rise in the social contribution. Anyway, despite all the challenges ahead, we will work harder to transform the industry, and the opportunities to Banco do Brasil.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll pass to Geovanne, we'll talk in a few minutes in the Q&amp;A session. Geovanne, please proceed.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ivan. Hello to everybody. Let's continue with our discussions on slide number six. Before talking about Banco do Brasil's performance, I would like to draw some thoughts about the economic environment that we faced in Brazil during the first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>The slide number three shows how the macroeconomic environment is reflecting the confidence that the Brazilian economy has already started to recover from the crisis impact. On the top left graph, you can see that despite the fact that the Brazilian payroll index has been slightly reduced when compared to December 2008. It seems that the drop was not significant. This relative stability is important to ensure that the purchase power from Brazilian families was not deeply impacted by the crisis. Therefore, economic activity tends to bounce back faster.</p>
          <p>Another index that factors this understanding is the unemployment rate, which hasn't increased drastically. This can be seen on the bottom left graph. Moreover, we have already started to see an increase on consumer confidence levels in Brazil. The same trend can be seen from the industrial segment.</p>
          <p>Besides all that, we can repeat from the bottom right graph that although the volume of foreign investments were significantly reduced because of the crisis, it seems that 2009 will definitely post higher volumes of investments than 2005 and 2006.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide four, we can see that the turmoil of the global market wasn't strong enough to spoil all the improvements seen in the Brazilian economy. That ended up allowing the monetary authority to maintain inflation under control and will resume cutting down rates. The price index measured by the 12-month IPCA, achieved 4.8% below the registered in 2008 and close to the inflation target of 4.5% in 2009.</p>
          <p>The benchmark rate was reduced by 450 basis points in six months, <mark type="inaudible" /> In June 2009, the Selic rate reached its lowest level ever registered, 9.25% per annum. The gradual recovery of employment, income and confidence ratios along with a stable price index and decreasing interest rates, we definitely put behind all the pessimistic views about the growth of the Brazilian economy in 2009 and 2010.</p>
          <p>On slide five, it can be seen that with this tougher economic environment, the banking industry ended up being affected with a higher banking concentration and asset deterioration. Government owned banks played an important role in unlocking credit and thus increasing their market share. Credit grew on the back of a decreasing GDP and credit growth through public spends. However, it is important to mention that all banks increased their provisions in order to face this challenging scenario. Therefore, the coverage ratio of provisions over higher risk loans ranked from E to H risk categories fixed at 131.8% at the end of June.</p>
          <p>Banco do Brasil by its turn figured out that the crisis brought about a tremendous opportunity in the banking industry. On the next slide, it is clear to see that the way Banco do Brasil positioned itself in the market was the right thing to be done. For a bank that had its deposit base increase by almost 15% on the first half as a result of the flight to quality movement, it was vital to re-invest this excess liquidly in credit. With that decision, Banco do Brasil was able, in June 2009, to recover its leadership in the banking industry.</p>
          <p>The volume of assets achieved almost R$600 billion, a growth of 14.9%, led by the extension of 12.2% in loans, especially consumer finance, which increased 40% in the period. Banco do Brasil took a step forward anticipating the recovery of economic activity, opened new business opportunities, and gained market share, in spite of many concerns from investors about this countercyclical movement.</p>
          <p>Well, on slide seven, we can reaffirm the success of the strategies adopted by Banco do Brasil. Here, we can observe the evolution of the net income, which amounted R$4 billion in the first six months of 2009, and corresponded to an annualized return on equity of 27.4%, and earnings per share of R$1.56. If we strip off the one-off, the recurring net income was R$3.2 billion, an amount 7.5% higher than we observed in the same period of 2008. The annualized recurring return on equity was 22%, at the higher range of our 2009 guidance.</p>
          <p>In the quarterly figures, the net income reached R$2.348 billion, and the recurrent net income R$1.727 billion, increases of 41 and 13.4% when compared to the first quarter '09 respectively.</p>
          <p>The recurring net income in the quarter corresponded to an annualized return on equity of 23.7% against 21.6% in the previous quarter and 24.6% in Q2 '08. On July 8, we had the breakdown of the one-off items that increased the net profit in the period. The non-recurring effects added R$455 million to the second quarter 2009 net income, and R$764 million to the first half of 2009. Among those one-offs in the second quarter, we accounted credit assignments of R$271 million, and R$1.4 billion from the sale of shares on the Visanet IPO.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we accounted R$676 million as additional provisions as informed in the material facts published on June 30, 2009. Besides that, there were accounted some legal claims expenses for economic plans of around R$190 million, bringing R$100 million from not-cash operations.</p>
          <p>In the first semester, expenses of R$1.4 billion regarding provisions to legal claims were added, as informed in the material facts published on April 29, 2009, plus expenses of R$95 million for economic plans and revenues of R$1.2 billion related to the recognition of tax credits from the rise in the social contribution tax rate, as informed in the material facts published on April 29, 2009 as well.</p>
          <p>Back to the recurring results on slide nine. We can see the behavior of the net interest income, which grew 36% in comparison with the first half of '08, led by the expansion of the loan portfolio and by the acquisition of Nossa Caixa. It is important to notice that the net interest income reached the new level in the second quarter of '09. In the quarter, the net interest income amounted R$8.5 billion, a 21.5% growth over the previous quarter, and 45.5% growth over the same period last year.</p>
          <p>It is important to highlight here that loan growth and Selic reduction were crucial to boost our net interest income based on the organic growth of credit and also on portfolio acquisition in Nossa Caixa consolidation. The spread improvement due to Nossa Caixa and to mix changes and reduction in deposit costs due to both expect rates higher versus prefixed rate operations previously contracted.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 10, we can observe the behavior of Banco do Brasil's global spread versus the Selic rate. While the interest rate decreased 450 bps in the first half of the year, Banco do Brasil's global spread, which is calculated dividing the net interest income over earning assets, dropped only 60 basis points in the first quarter and rose from 6.6% to 7.3%, surpassing the spread from December '08, which was 7.2%.</p>
          <p>The increase in Banco do Brasil's spread is due mainly to the growth of consumer finance, which gained relative share in the total portfolio and through a higher participation of working capital operations in the business portfolio, besides Nossa Caixa effect.</p>
          <p>Here, it is worth to highlight the effects of the consolidation of Nossa Caixa in this spread. The stand-alone Banco Nossa Caixa had a spread of 9% in the first half of '09. The spread seen in Nossa Caixa is from a very good mix of its liabilities against the strategy of increasing own assets, especially payroll loans. If it wasn't for Nossa Caixa consolidation, Banco do Brasil would have been a &#x2013; spread would have been around 6.9%.</p>
          <p>Regarding the spread of each portfolio, after some periods of reduction, the spread in the individual portfolios increased coming from 20.5% in the first part of '09 to 21.2% in 2Q '09. The spread in the business portfolio also grew in the quarter, coming from 7.2% to 7.5%, due to the growth of working capital operations, which had higher spreads.</p>
          <p>The Agribusiness portfolio, due to seasonal reasons, came from a spread of 5.9% in Q1 '09 to 5.5% in Q2.</p>
          <p>On slide 11, we can observe different lines of Banco do Brasil's funding and its cost in relation to Selic. While we see a slight increase in the total funding balance from Q1 '09 to Q2, we can observe the total funding cost being increased from 69.8% in the first quarter to 71.1% in the second quarter. This behavior was affected by the 450 bps Selic rate reduction.</p>
          <p>Besides, it reflects Nossa Caixa consolidation, which added a significant balance of judicial deposits to the funding base. This special funding, despite being considered as time deposits, has a 6% annual fixed rate cost. Thus, with the Selic drop, the average funding cost over Selic ends up increasing.</p>
          <p>Anyway, even with the changes in the scenario, Banco do Brasil still have a very competitive funding cost base, due to its ability to grow those liabilities at a higher pace than the banking industry or to its franchise, which sustains the business growth.</p>
          <p>Now, moving on to slide 12. We see that, regarding all operations, we have outperformed banking industry, achieving a market share of 18.7% in all. We had an increase of 32.8% for the past 12 months and 4.4% in the quarter in our loan book that will highlight here the expansion in the individual portfolio, which increased 69% over 2Q '08 and 12% in the quarter. I would like to mention that for the first time in Banco do Brasil's history, individual loan book surpassed Agribusiness stock.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 13, which we will see the details on our loan growth strategy. If we exclude in the quarter the portfolio acquisitions that we made and also the acquisition of Nossa Caixa, we had an organic growth of 3.4% in the period, also above the industry, which grew 2.8%. The industry growth of 19.7% in 12 months was below the 22% organic growth posted by Banco do Brasil in the same period.</p>
          <p>Regarding the portfolio acquisitions, it is worth to mention that the possibility to buy through reserved requirements gives us an important advantage. Given the cost and the risk profile acquired, this is an alternative way to grow other than the direct acquisition of financial execution, which makes sense only in certain circumstances.</p>
          <p>On the slide 14, we have a breakdown of consumer finance operations. It becomes clear when we analyze these numbers that the main growth driver in the individual portfolio continues to be payroll loans. I would like to remind you again that the individual portfolio is getting a higher share in the total portfolio every quarter.</p>
          <p>In the graph, you can observe that we also kept a strong growth base in auto loans, which is another key growth driver for us. We grew the payroll portfolio by 110.7% in 12 months and in the quarter the performance was also good, around 19% increase. With Nossa Caixa, Banco do Brasil reinforces its leadership in the payroll segment with more than 30% market share. In auto loans, we recovered our growth driven increasing the portfolio by 16.8% in the second quarter and 74% increase in one year.</p>
          <p>On the slide 15, we illustrate the business portfolio. The highlight here is to SME's operation, which increased 35% in one year and 5.6% in the quarter. The operations with medium and large size companies also had an important increase in the past 12 months, besides the drop of 0.8% in the quarter due to exchange rate appreciation in the period.</p>
          <p>We must say that we took advantage of a more restricted environment to credit to strengthen our relationship with business clients in order to meet their credit needs. This strategy is ramping besides growth in volume, improvements in the profitability with those clients as we saw on slide 10.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 16, we can see the balance of foreign trade operations, which reached a new level after the international crisis. The 13% exchange rate appreciation seen in the second quarter of '09 directly impacted the balance of those operations in reais-denominated, which amounted R$23.5 billion in June '09, a 44.6% increase in 12 months, but a decrease of 10.5% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>I want to highlight that Banco do Brasil is the leader in the foreign trade market with a market share of 31.4% in exports and 24.5% in imports, with the disbursement of R$23.2 billion in exports, and 14.3 billion &#x2013; sorry, $23.2 billion in exports and $14.3 billion in imports. With regard to advance on foreign exchange contract, and then advance on export contracts, Banco do Brasil achieved a market share of 44% in June '09.</p>
          <p>On the slide 17, we can see that Banco do Brasil is still the largest lender to the Brazilian agro business, with a balance of R$67.6 billion in the portfolio, a 9.7% growth in 12 months, which corresponds to 62.7% of the total rural credit in the country.</p>
          <p>Due to the seasonality, the marketing operations, which have lower rates, had an increase of 12.7% in the quarter, followed by the investment operations, which rose 4.4% in Q2 '09. In one year, we must highlight the increase of 36.9% EBITDA for working capital operations. At the end of June, agri loans had reduced its share in Banco do Brasil's portfolio to 26.8%. To the 2009, 2010 crop, Banco do Brasil is expecting to disburse R$39.5 billion to the segment.</p>
          <p>On the slide 18, we bring some information that allows us to be very confident about the soundness of the agro business to loan book. On the left hand side of the slide, we have the working capital operations contracted with insurance in 2008, 2009 crop. From R$15.5 billion contracted, R$9.5 billion was covered by some kind of insurance, representing 61.6% of the total amount of insurance. Out of that, 90% was reinsured with the insurance companies mentioned in the box below.</p>
          <p>On the right hand side of the slide, we have a geographic distribution of the rural insurance. Southern and mid-west regions have the higher percentile of insured loans with 74.4% and 70.7% insurance coverage respectively. The southeastern region has the lower insurance share due to the crops for which insurance is not admitted, such as sugarcane.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 19, we see in the left graph that the expansion of our loan portfolio explains an important part of the provisions increase, despite the tougher scenario. Allowance for loan losses over average portfolio for the past 12 months reached 4.2% as indicated in our 2009 guidance. However, if we look to the net interest income after provision, we observe that this hike did not affect it. We accounted a net interest income after provisions of R$5.3 billion, 17.8% higher than the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Past due loans over 90 days in the yellow line in the right graph represented 3.3% of the portfolio at the end of June. This percentile is higher than the 2.7% observed in the &#x2013; previously, but much lower than the 4.4% reported by the Brazilian banking industry. We raised the required provisions over total book from 5.7% in the first quarter of '09 to 5.9% in the second quarter below the average risk registered by the banking industry, which stepped up from 6.7 to 7.2%.</p>
          <p>On the slide 20, we have a breakdown of provision expenses over book in the second quarter of '09. If you go from the left part of the graph to the right one, achieving the level of those expenses in the first quarter of '09, we can see each one of the effect that contributed to the increase in provision expenses.</p>
          <p>It is important to bear in mind that the growth of 27.3% in expense provisions is due mainly by &#x2013; to the consolidation of Banco Nossa Caixa, whose provisioning needs was responsible for 69% of the increase from the period. Other effects were, the higher volume of contracts and delinquencies seen in the quarter. All of those items were taken into account in our estimates and supported our 2009 guidance.</p>
          <p>Now, on the slide 21, we can observe that over the past years, Banco do Brasil's delinquency has been below the Brazilian banking industry delinquency. In the business portfolio, we see an increase in the past due loans for both Banco do Brasil and the industry. First, we have lower better delinquency liable. Regarding individual loans, we see that Banco do Brasil has an opposite trend to the industry and comparatively past due loans levels are substantially lower.</p>
          <p>Considering past due loans over 90 days in the individual portfolio, the Brazilian banking industry had an increase of 30 bps coming from 8.3 in March '09 to 8.6% in June '09, while Banco do Brasil had a decrease of 20 bps dropping from 5.9 to 5.7% in June '09.</p>
          <p>On the slide 22, we show the individual portfolio delinquency by vintage, considering consumer finance, except withdraw account, credit cards and auto loans. We can see by this graph that the improvement in loan granting methodology as well as the change in the mix are allowing the reduction of past due loans along the vintages.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 23, we can observe that the service revenues amounted R$6.4 billion in the first half of 2009, a growth of 9.6% when compared to the same period last year. In the quarter, the increase was even better, 16.7% over the previous quarter and 18% over the second quarter of '08. Observing Banco do Brasil on a stand-alone basis, the increase of service revenues when compared to the first quarter of '09 was flat 4.5% below the range -- was 4.5%, that was below the range indicated in the guidance.</p>
          <p>First, as we believe that the businesses had built-in strength of the results, we'll have a good performance in the second half of 2009. We believe we will be able to reach the estimates we set in our guidance. Also in the same slide, you can see on the bottom left graph, the revenues were declining. That compared with the first semester of 2008 through the first semester of 2009 increased 25.7%. Here we are not including Nossa Caixa numbers, okay.</p>
          <p>From the bottom right hand side of the graph, we have the insurance added value, which grew 11.7% in the comparison through the first half of '08. This performance shows our efforts to boost this kind of business.</p>
          <p>On slide 24, we see that the administrative expenses are in line with the business growth and acquisition. Total administrative expenses, which include personnel expenses and other admin expenses, totaled R$4.9 billion in the second quarter of '09, a growth of 24.5% over the previous quarter, and 33.6% over 2Q08. In the first half of '09, the increase was 22%.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, expenses were affected by the consolidation of Nossa Caixa, which added R$315 million in personnel expenses and R$301 million in other admin expenses. If we do not consider these impacts, the expenses would have grown 50.6% in the comparison between the second quarter of '09 to the second quarter of '08, and 13.4% in the comparison between the first semesters of '09 and '08.</p>
          <p>To better understand the causes that led to the growth in our expenses, and also our decision to keep the guidance between 9 and 12% in 2009, I would like to give you a break-down on slide 25, the main fact that affected the volume of admin expenses in Banco do Brasil. The consolidation of Nossa Caixa as I previously mentioned added R$659 million to the total amount of admin expenses, the Visanet IPO brought R$64 million increase, and improvement in the consolidation of non-financial companies brought about something around R$47 million. Those amounts totaled R$770 million in the period. If we exclude this amount from the total amount of expenses, we would have seen in Banco do Brasil an increase in admin expenses of 11.9%. That is completely in line with our 2009 guidance.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 26, we are glad to see that our efficiency and coverage ratios is already &#x2013; including Nossa Caixa posted a positive trend. Cost income ratio, which indicates how much of the operational revenues are being consumed by admin expenses, ended the quarter at 42.1%, almost the same as the previous quarter and 330 basis points better than the same period last year.</p>
          <p>The improvement in our cost income ratio is due to the performance of the operational expenses in the quarter. That were higher than the increase <mark type="inaudible" /> operational revenues &#x2013; sorry, the performance of our operational revenues that were higher than the increase observed in our admin expense. Coverage ratio of personnel expenses reached 134.7% in the first quarter of '09 &#x2013; in the second quarter of '09, against 131.9% in the first quarter and 143% in the second quarter last year. The decrease in 12 months comes from the increase in the number of employees due to the acquisition of <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 27 again, we would like to discuss our BIS ratio. That is still allowing Banco do Brasil to grow its business. Our BIS ratio ended the quarter at 15.3% compared to the 15% in the previous quarter and 12.5% at the end of Q2 '08. Our BIS ratio allows us to grow our credit book by roughly something close to R$120 billion. Our estimate is that with the acquisition of Banco Votorantim and the consolidation of its numbers in our balance sheet, our BIS ratio would probably drop by 1.2 &#x2013; 120 bps, sorry, being 90 bps in the Tier I and 30 bps in Tier II. Thus, the calculus indicates that BIS ratio close to 14%, after the consolidation of the partnership with Votorantim.</p>
          <p>Now moving to slide 28, I would like to highlight some information about Votorantim bank. Although these <mark type="inaudible" /> prices over the credit quality are very well known, it's worth to highlight that the credit quality of Banco Votorantim is, without any doubt, much better than the quality seen in the industry. Votorantim's expertise in the auto loan segment is clear when we see the delinquency ratio of 3.1%. Even if we consider that, Votorantim's portfolio includes 83% of its financed cost of second-hand cars. We hope to have the benefits from this partnership with Votorantim also in best quality improvements in our auto loan business, which delinquency in Banco do Brasil is around 5%.</p>
          <p>Now, on the slide 29, we have a comparison between our guidance and the performance posted by Banco do Brasil in the first half of '09. We understand that our performance in the period comes from almost all of our estimates released with our 2008 results, except for the effective tax rate, which was adjusted upwards coming from 26 to 29% range, to a range of 30 to 33%. All the other estimates are capped.</p>
          <p>To end this presentation, we have a comparison of the multiples of the major Brazilian banks with Banco do Brasil. Although Banco do Brasil has been posting a consistent performance, it is still being negotiated with a discount when compared to our peers. In the first half of 2009, we had the best performance among the large banks in Brazil, but we believe that there is still a value that is not being priced in Banco do Brasil's multiple.</p>
          <p>Well, those were the main points that I would like to highlight in this presentation. We could now go to the Q&amp;A session. Thank you very much.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Jason Molin with Goldman Sachs would now like to ask a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, everyone. I have few questions. First on the loan book, we saw Banco do Brasil's outstanding loans to individuals increased about R$7.4 billion, a 12% quarter-on-quarter without &#x2013; can you hear me? Can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we can go.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We saw Banco do Brasil's outstanding loans to individuals increase about 7.4 billion in the quarter alone, with about 4.7 billion coming from payroll and 1.2 in the auto segment &#x2013; in the car auto segment, can you talk about the clients that drove this growth? In your MD&amp;A statement, you say that about 83% of the total payroll loans are to public or government officials, was the growth in the quarter to public officials as well probably? And if there is the strategy to increase this payroll lending to non-government workers is my first question. And my second question if you can give us some more information about the significant reversal of the labor lawsuit provision that we saw in the quarter, you had a very large &#x2013; well, relative to the charge over R$100 million in the last quarter &#x2013; in the first we saw a positive impact of over R$100 million in this quarter. So the quarter-on-quarter difference is quite significant, if you can tell us what's going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We believe that in the second semester, we continue to focus on auto loans and payroll, especially in the payroll, the leaders and the majority is the public sector. And we believe that this behavior is continuous on the second semester. I don't know if <mark type="inaudible" /> wants to add some information, <mark type="inaudible" />? Okay. For the second part of your question, I'd like Geovanne to explain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jason, this is Geovanne. There was nothing going on there, this is basically a result of the decisions taken on the course. And that's why we have been saying to investors that these line is specifically difficult to try to predict, because we never know when the court will decide against or in favor of Banco do Brasil.</p>
          <p>Just for you to understand, in accordance with the accounting standards, if a litigation is considered possible, you've got to provision 100%. If it's remote, you've got to provision 0%. So that's why you have this huge volatility. Sometimes you have a higher volume of provision expenses to labor or to civil litigations, because the decision was again from a lower court to a higher court and this remains 100% provision on that litigation.</p>
          <p>So we consider that as recurrent, because we have had in the past other moments where the provisions picked up significantly and we didn't segregate that as one-offs, because this is a result of the decisions taken in the court. And it's definitely difficult, even for us, to try to set an estimate for those lines. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I understand. I'm just looking at the last eight quarters that you showed us in table 159 of the MD&amp;A and there's never been a quarter where we've actually had a positive impact. It's always been a negative impact. And if I were to assess that, that means that in the second quarter, they were the results of lawsuits were determined in favor of the bank. This wasn't a change in how you want to assess whether lawsuits are probable or your win or loss ratio is more probable or not. This was actually related to events in the courtroom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, because if it was a change in methodology, then it would be different, okay? We would account it differently. A change in methodology necessarily should be addressed as a one-off, okay. This was a result of improvements that Banco do Brasil winning lawsuits or even setting agreements with employees, or a number of other measures that ended up in, how can I say it, starting a bit reversal during the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. And just as a follow-up on the payroll segment, so clearly the second half of the year, you're going to continue to focus on the government workers and are the majority of these current employees or are they retirees, or is there any information on the mix, what kind of clients these are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We disclosed in our MD&amp;A, Jason, the volume of employees and retirees. Close to 90% is probably government officials, okay, around 8% is retirees and the rest is private sector employees, okay. So retirees is just 8% of the total amount of payroll loans that we have in the book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Back in the total book, was that more in the &#x2013; was that the same similar trend in the quarter, do you know?</p>

          <p>Mr. Saul Martinez with JP Morgan would like to ask a question. Mr. Martinez, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thank you. A couple of questions. First on your capital position. Obviously if you normalize <mark type="inaudible" /> closer to about 14% and about 10% Tier 1. You are growing very, very quickly here, so your risk-weighted assets are growing quickly. But at the same time, you have benefited from a number of regulatory changes in terms of the calculation of the BIS ratio. And then if you just look at in terms of assets to equity, your leverage ratios are very high. Do you feel that if you can &#x2013; do you feel like capital will eventually be a constraint to growth and if you keep maintaining a very rapid pace of growth, do you feel like you have to make any capital management move, maybe later this year or into 2010? And after that I'll have a follow-up as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the question. We are very comfortable, but we believe that if we continue to expand and economy in Brazil will continue growth, and with the <mark type="inaudible" /> forecast, I believe that we're going to face this &#x2013; very soon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Very soon meaning within the span of a few months, or does that mean it's something in 2010 that you would have to address?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It means in the next two years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In the next two years, okay. Second question is on market share, obviously, historically Banco do Brasil has taken market share when loan growth has slowed in the system and perhaps lost market share as loan growth accelerates and the private banks become more aggressive. As credit conditions started to normalize and the private banks perhaps start to grow again, do you feel like if you look forward, you will, perhaps your market share gains will moderate maybe when you can move some market share in terms of credit next year. Or do you plan on continuing to grow very rapidly and maintaining the share, even if the economy starts to recover?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We believe, we are very confident with our excellent position, our excellent market share position. We believe that the competition will increase in the second half, but we are very confident that we will keep and maybe increase our market share in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then just finally on Votorantim, when do you &#x2013; can you remind us when you expect that to close?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Generally we are <mark type="inaudible" /> Central Bank of Brazil, but it's impossible to predict the exact date.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But you are getting close, you think. Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Marcelo Teles with Credit Suisse would like to ask a question. Please, Mr. Mercelo, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually I would like to make two questions. The first one on the labor contingency reserve, <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marcelo, this is Geovanne. If I understood your question correctly, the first one is about the labor contingencies. In terms of reversal, I have to check the number and I get back later to you, okay? And with regards to delinquency trends, we believe that, according to our models, delinquency has already picked up in Banco do Brasil. So we're very confident that for the second semester with the guaranteed funds from the government to back SME loans, delinquency ,especially in the business portfolio, will start to be a little bit, okay? And in the case of the individuals portfolio, it's quite under control. It's even improving. So we are not so concerned. We started the year, given the guidance for the market that our delinquency could grow up to 200 bps. So far we have seen a 100 bps increase. And it seems that it will remain around that. So we are not expecting a huge pick-up anymore, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And just a small correction, it's Victor speaking on behalf of Marcelo Telles. Well, it would be extremely helpful to have the amount of provision reversals <mark type="inaudible" /> kind of layer would be extremely helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It is in our explanatory note, I believe I'm just looking at that. As soon as I find it, I will get back to you.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have two questions also. Last time, during the first quarter conference call, you guys mentioned that you were still in negotiations about the equalization of revenues for your agricultural portfolio. I think the negotiations are starting in May. Can you tell us if that has been completed and what target ROEs are you aiming for them on your agriculture portfolio? And then second question is also related to some standing issues -- during the first quarter conference call, you also mentioned that you are revising the potential signatures from the Nossa Caixa transaction. Just wanted to know, now that we have incorporated Nossa Caixa for the third quarter, if you have a new guidance to give to us? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you, <mark type="inaudible" /> the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We negotiated another R$1.5 billion, the same amount that we negotiated last crop for the 2009, 2010 crop, okay? So it's R$1.5 billion, the expected volume while we <mark type="inaudible" /> for the next 12. And with regards to Nossa Caixa, I don't have news on that, Mario. To be honest with you, we were very excited about the performance of Nossa Caixa in second quarter as growth in the loan growth was extremely sound and extremely, what can I say, strong. But so far I haven't heard any news on the revision of Nossa Caixa's estimated report, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It's a follow-up, and you mentioned when you're renegotiating, or you're expecting equalization revenues over R$1.5 billion. What kind of ROE are you targeting then, for this sector &#x2013; for this type of business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the ROE is to maintain something around 16%. I don't remember the exact figure. But definitely, considering the level of Selic rate for the upcoming crops, you could potentially expect some adjustments on that ROE, downwards.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everyone. Basically I would like to hear from you a little bit more about how the process of incorporating Nossa Caixa is going. The efforts that you are doing in order to promote the origination of product, Nossa Caixa especially on payroll loan side. And also if you already have a timing from, when do you expect to have that completed? And also I'd like to hear a little bit about the securitization operation you did this quarter. You have just given your non-recurring numbers, the gains from this operation. I would like to know what kind of credits are you securitizing there, if our credits that are still booked or credits you have a kind of benefit, that <mark type="inaudible" /> questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, with regard to the Nossa Caixa tax, right? <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are still working with the same timeframe that we have said at the beginning, all those synergies that we assess, we're considering a 24 months integration period of date. And I believe that the timeframe is that probably two months delayed. We are expecting to fully integrate &#x2013; not integrate, but cooperate, merge Nossa Caixa to Banco do Brasil by November, December. So probably we still have another balance sheet to be disclosed by Nossa Caixa in the third quarter, but from Q4 on, if everything runs as hopefully, Nossa Caixa, it will no longer exist, it will be already included in Banco do Brasil, full included in Banco do Brasil's balance sheet. Okay. With regard &#x2013; and that we haven't changed this timeline, okay.</p>
          <p>With regards to your second question, securitization, we, it's part of our business and usually we do that only with loans that were already, recent past, so we're talking about credit that is off balance, not our outstanding credit, our outstanding credit we do not securitize, securitize only those loans that we wrote off in the past, but we are still trying to recover them and they are completely passed out.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Can you give us more color on the level of provisions that we expect for the second half of '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you for your question. We have a guidance that we have, which is close to the market, that you should expect provisions for NCLs accounting something around four to 4.2% of the average book. So as long as provisions, as long as the book continues to grow, sorry, provisions will follow this growth. The volume in relative terms is higher due to the high delinquency levels. So you should expect something close to 4.1, 4.2, in-between, I think it's a good thing for the second semester as well. This plus the fact that economic environment is improving, but we are maintaining this guidance for the full 2009.</p>
