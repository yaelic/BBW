          <p>Good morning, my name is Ryan.  I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Occidental Petroleum Corp Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Thank you.  It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chris Stavros. Sir, you may begin your conference.</p>

          <p>Thank you and good morning everyone. I'd like to welcome you to Occidental's fourth quarter 2007 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call from Los Angeles are Dr. Ray Irani, Oxy's Chairman and CEO; Steve Chazen, our President and CFO; Casey Olson, President of Occidental's Oil and Gas business in the Eastern Hemisphere; and John Morgan, President of Oxy Oil and Gas in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
          <p>In a moment, I will turn the call over to Steve Chazen who will review the details of our fourth quarter and full year 2007 financial results to be followed by a question-and-answer session. Conference call presentation slides, which refer to Steve's remarks, can be downloaded off of our website at www.oxy.com.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Steve. Steve, please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Chris. Net income for the quarter was $1.452 billion, or $1.74 per diluted share, compared to $930 million, or $1.09 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of last year. 2007 fourth quarter net income includes 16 million after-tax severance charges and 4 million of after-tax income from discontinued ops.</p>
          <p>Core results were a record 1.464 billion, or $1.76 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared to 784 million, or $0.92 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2006.  Here's the segment breakdown for the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Oil and gas fourth quarter 2000 (sic) [2007] segment earnings were $2.6 billion, compared to 1.4 billion for the fourth quarter of last year. The following accounted for the increase in oil and gas earnings between these quarters:</p>
          <p>Higher worldwide oil and gas price realizations resulted in an increase of 1.3 billion of earnings over the comparable period last year. Occidental's average realized crude price in the 2007 fourth quarter was $27.75 higher than in the comparable period last year. Oxy's domestic average realized gas prices for the quarter was $6.77, compared to $5.63 in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Worldwide oil and gas production from continuing operations for the quarter averaged 590,000 barrels of equivalent per day, an increase of 5.2%, compared to the 561,000 BOE in production the fourth quarter last year. The bulk of the production improvement was a result of Dolphin project start-up which contributed 36,000 BOE per day.</p>
          <p>Our guidance for the fourth quarter production was in the range of 600 to 615,000 BOE per day. We were under this range due to the impact of product prices that reduced our volume from production sharing contracts by 8,000 BOE per day; a well blowout in Libya of 4,000 BOE per day and 5,000 BOE per day lower in Argentina due to election related strikes in October and November.</p>
          <p>Dolphin contributed 62 million to after-tax income during the fourth quarter which was slightly ahead of our guidance of 50 to $60 million. Sales volumes were 36,000 BOE per day, in line with our guidance. Dolphin 2007 production exit rate was 43,000 BOE per day.</p>
          <p>Exploration expense was $101 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Oil and gas production costs for the 12 months of 2007 were 12.87 per barrel compared with last year's cost of 11.70 a barrel. The increases were a result of the higher field operating and maintenance costs.</p>
          <p>Chemical segment earnings for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $94 million, which is lower than our third quarter guidance of 100 to $140 million. Decline in earnings from our guidance was due to lower PVC margins due to higher feedstock cost and weaker industry demand. Chemicals earned 157 million in last year's fourth quarter. The primary factor that accounted for quarter-to-quarter differences was lower PVC margins.</p>
          <p>The worldwide effective tax rate, excluding the impact of asset sales and other items was 42% in the fourth quarter of 2007, 4 points lower than our guidance of 46% due primarily to significant higher oil and gas prices. The increased oil prices resulted in a higher portion of U.S. income, which has a lower apparent tax rate than our international operations.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to our performance for the twelve months. Net income was a record $5.4 billion or $6.44 per diluted shares for the twelve months of 2007, compared to 4.2 billion or $4.87 per diluted share for the same period last year. Core results were also a record at 4.4 billion or $5.25 per diluted share for the twelve months of 2007, compared to 4.1 billion or $4.78 per diluted share in the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Worldwide oil and gas production for the twelve months averaged 570,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, an increase of 4.6%, compared to 545,000 BOE production in the twelve months of last year.</p>
          <p>Capital spending was $987 million for the quarter and about $3.5 billion for the twelve months. We expect total capital spending for this year 2008 to be between 3.8 and $3.9 billion. We expect increased 2008 capital spending for Colombia LCI project, Argentina and Vintage California.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations for the 12 months was approximately $6.8 billion. We received 1.6 billion in proceeds from the sale of assets. We used 3.5 billion of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures, 1.4 billion for acquisitions, 1.2 billion to retire debt and $765 million to pay dividends. We spent $1.13 billion to repurchase 20.6 million common shares at an average price of $54.75 per share. These net cash flows increased our 1.6 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $400 million to $2 billion at December 31st. Debt was 1.8 billion at the end of December, a reduction of 1.1 billion from a debt balance of 2.9 billion at the end of last year.</p>
          <p>The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the 12 months were 834.9 million and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 839.1 million. At December 31st, there were 827.2 million basic shares outstanding and the diluted share amount was approximately 831.3 million.</p>
          <p>Our debt to capitalization ratio was 7%, down from 13% last year. Our return on equity was 26% with a return on capital employed of 24%. As we look ahead to the current quarter, we expect the oil and gas production to be in the range of 600 to 615,000 BOE per day during the first quarter at last quarter's $90 oil price.</p>
          <p>Dolphin is expected to become fully operational in February and run at 78% of capacity this quarter, with a production of 53,000 BOE per day. Dolphin's after-tax earnings are expected to be between 90 and $100 million in the first quarter, based on a $90 oil price.</p>
          <p>At about $80 oil, we expect production for the full-year to increase to 620 to 630,000 BOE per day. This is slightly above the outlook we gave you two years ago for 2008 when you adjust for a $30 increase in oil prices from that time.</p>
          <p>The increase from last year's number is due to full year operations of Dolphin, increased production from Mukhaizna in Oman, increased production in Argentina where the exit rate was around 40,000 a day and Colombia, and the impact of acquisitions. These were slightly offset by the new contract in Libya and of course higher oil prices.</p>
          <p>Occidental receives its share of production from production sharing contracts to recover its cost and an additional share for profit. Occidental's share of production from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise, it increases when oil prices decline. Overall, Oxy's net economic benefit from these contracts is much higher at higher oil prices. A $5 change in oil prices affects Oxy's production by about 4,000 barrels a day.</p>
          <p>Including this change in production, a change in oil price of a $1 per barrel impacts quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $38 million. A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices has a $24 million impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes.</p>
          <p>We expect exploration expenses to be about 70 to 90 million for seismic and drilling this quarter. We expect chemical earnings to be in the range of 100 and $125 million, probably closer to the higher-end of that range compared with $94 million in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Improved volumes and prices in vinyls and higher caustic soda prices are the primary drivers of the improvement. This is less than last year's first quarter earnings of 137 million, due to weakness in construction which impacts industry demand.</p>
          <p>We expect DD&amp;A expense to be $2.4 billion for oil and gas and $300 million for the rest of the company this year. We expect our combined worldwide tax rate for the first quarter to be 43%.</p>
          <p>The company has embarked on a cost reduction program which will affect operating G&amp;A and capital costs. In 2007, we took restructuring charges totaling $25 million. We expect a similar amount this year. We've also made improvements in our procurement operations functions taking advantage of the shift in power between producers and vendors. Combined savings from this program are expected to be at least $200 million this year with an annualized run-rate of over $300 million. The primary focus of this program is on the more mature areas of the company, as opposed to our areas of growth.</p>
          <p>Copies of the press release announcing our third quarter earnings and the Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules are available on our website or through the SEC's EDGAR system.</p>
          <p>We are now ready to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Robert Kessler of Simmons &amp; Company.  Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As you look at the bidding grounds for projects in the Middle Eastern Gulf States, it seems as though recent entrants have shown a willingness to bid away much of the value on these deals.  And then you look at share prices for equities, public equities, so far this year, they have languished relative to the commodity.  How does that change your view of the pecking order of uses of cash? Are you inclined to increase the buybacks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We expect -- we ended the year with about 6 million -- 6.3 million shares of authority from the Board.  We've used the majority of that so far this year.  And we expect the Board to increase the authority by at least 20 million shares at the next meeting.  We have no debt maturities currently for this year, and very little for next year.  And for level of debt and current stock prices, we would expect that we would be aggressive buyers of shares.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How do you think about the competitive landscape for these Middle Eastern projects now with people like ConocoPhillips in the mix willing to bid up the economics, or bid away the economics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as we have said repeatedly, we do have a large number of projects in our pipeline, and we still follow religiously the discipline for our returns on investments.  So to the extent other people want to chase projects for whatever reason, we are willing to give up on projects unless they meet our discipline.  We still feel we have a number of projects that can meet our financial discipline.  So that's the way the world goes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that makes sense Ray.  Is a 20% internal rate of return a reasonable international bogey at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think when you get into these returns, you know, bear in mind, we may be assuming different prices for oil than other folks are, so that enters the picture.  And so we have to look at a wide range of prices, because you're making investments that go over a 30-year period.  And so you can't just sit and say, all right the price of oil today is $90, so that's what you can assume.  It would be foolish also to assume $40.  So you have to look at a whole range of prices looking into the future and look at cost of capital and alternatives you may have.  We do have alternatives, not only in share buyback, but other programs we're working on.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Our next question comes from Michael LaMotte of JPMorgan.  Please go ahead.  Mr. LaMotte, your line is live.</p>
          <p>Our next question comes from Doug Leggate of Citigroup.  Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, Ray and Steve.  A couple of questions I guess, I'd like to kick off with the project outlook if I may because obviously following the Shah situation, there are a couple of others that have been talked about namely in Bahrain and perhaps additional -- even more additional projects I guess in Libya, the UAE, and Oman.  Could you maybe just give us an update as to where we stand and what the likely news flow is, positive or otherwise, that we should expect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I remain optimistic. And -- but again I can't give you a date on when something will happen.  I think these other projects are very solid, and they can achieve the returns that we like to have.  But, you know, in the end, if somebody wants to assume the price of oil is going to be $100 for the next 20 years, I'm not going to compete with that.  So, I'm very optimistic for a number of reasons, part of which is that we do have a number of these projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we've proven that we are not real good at estimating the timing, so I don't think we want to go there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Second one, maybe it's a little easier then, you gave us some reserve numbers on the -- in the press release.  Steve, could you give us an idea what the impact of PSC entitlement effects was?  How much did you actually -- how much was this number depressed by PSCs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't remember how much the PSC impact was. I think it was -- in and of itself it was probably in the 50 million barrel area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.  And do you have an F&amp;D cost number, Steve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pardon me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>An F&amp;D cost number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All you do is divide.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I get you -- acquisitions are included in there I guess?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah.  So you just -- you know, the SEC doesn't like to do the division for you.  So we put the numbers together so it's relatively straightforward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And a second one very quickly.  Libya, the new contract, did that kick in on December 1st?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So when does it become effective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it becomes effective when the People's parliament approves it.  And we have no concern on this.  I met with Gaddafi himself and a number of other leaderships in late November &#x2013; it's just when they meet, this is not scheduled like Congress.  So, whenever that approval takes place, it kicks in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But just to clarify it, it's effective December 1st.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And whenever they approve it, it will go into effect, and then there will be a financial settlement for the difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just like any other acquisition, you would make a settlement for effective date.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  That's it from me. Thanks, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Our next question comes from Nikki Decker of Bear Stearns.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, thank you.  I was just following up on the reserve reports, so did the Libya contracts affect reserve bookings for 2007?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All that's there in the Libyan contracts is the remainder of the contract which is -- at that point, which is two years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you would normally expect that, with a 30 year extension that the two -- that we'd have a lot more reserves when we book that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see.  The report showed a pretty good bump up in reserves from improved recovery; you essentially replaced production with improved recovery.  My question is, is this sustainable with the current asset base, or might we see a shift towards additional acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly for this year improved recovery will be very large again, for 2008.  Mukhaizna is an improved recovery project and we are just really starting the booking there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're going to build a very sizable improved recovery number out of Mukhaizna alone.  Historically, we ran about 140 million barrels in improved recovery.  In the rest of the operations we don't see how that's going to fall off, so I am not going to predict this year's number.  But we've just begun to book in Mukhaizna so there is a lot more improved recovery.  So you will see that improved recovery number to be sizable for several more years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It sounds like there is a possibility that that number even ramps up?</p>

          <p>Thank you <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  Our next question comes from Bernie Picchi of Wall Street Access.  Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Just wanted to ask a question about the Plains acquisition and kind of got my attention with your involvement in the Piceance. And I wonder if this does in fact represent kind of a strategic shift in your attitude toward resource plays in gas in the Unites States. Certainly the Permian didn't surprise me, but the Piceance did.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have been in the Piceance for a while.  As you may know, we had some legacy assets in land and fee.  So we're producing about 40 million a day in the Piceance currently from our production.  And we expect to boost that over the next few years to about 100 million a day just from our own stuff.  The Piceance stuff was we thought a reasonably priced acquisition, but considering the size of the enterprise, I wouldn't view it as particularly strategic, maybe a tweaking, but we were there and we saw an opportunity to build more gas at reasonable prices.  Gas acquisitions, as you know, have not been in our view reasonably priced, and this was fairly priced we thought.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, just a follow-up question.  It looked as if in the fourth quarter that you had quite a lot of capture, as the term has it, in your realization for U.S. natural gas prices versus the Henry Hub price versus the prior quarters.  Looked like there was quite a nice jump in other words in your realized price in the fourth quarter.  Is that something that is kind of a one-off, or something you would expect to see going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think that's probably -- the fourth quarter is -- that is probably right.  In other words, it will continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the reason why the sudden catch-up or the increase in the capture versus prior quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You've got some in the Piceance you picked up as the differentials narrowed.  In California, there was a nice pickup in realized price, and in Yucatan and Permian. So, we've made some structural changes, so I think that probably is why &#x2013; in our ability to deliver the gas.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>Steve, any movement on the Bab project in Abu Dhabi?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Can you provide an update on Mukhaizna? There has been in some of the trade journals lately, some comments about leaking wellheads and other problems.  Can you give an update on what the target is for year-end and ultimate objectives there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The target for year-end on Mukhaizna is still a gross 50,000 barrels a day, which is what we estimated all along.  We anticipated that through the first couple of years as the project ramped up, the exact timing month to month would be a bit fluid.  But we're right on track, we believe, to hit the 50,000 this year and are feeling confident that we can still move the project to the 150 level as we've anticipated all along.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then lastly, there has been a lot of talk in the industry about Iraq finally moving on concessions.  What's your thoughts on potentially being involved in Iraq?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you know, the situation in Iraq is very fluid.  The oil -- <mark type="inaudible" /> oil law is not yet approved in Iraq.  The Kurds are beating up on doors, including ours, to obtain concessions, et cetera, et cetera.  We are not talking to them.  U.S. policy is against talking to regional players in Iraq, and we follow U.S. policy to the word.  So, I think it's premature, but whenever that opens up, we are sitting ready for looking at opportunities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any thoughts, preferences, for North versus South?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there'd be -- we think there is a number of opportunities we've identified.  It's just premature.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's bring some of the troops home first, let's see some security.  The President was in the Middle East and didn't bother to go to Iraq.  So that's a message about security there.  Secretary Condoleezza Rice went over to Iraq briefly, and we think it's a fluid situation.  Some improvement in some areas of the country as you see, security in others especially where production could be, leaves a lot to be desired. Because the focus as you have seen of our military is to secure the areas with high population, and that's not always where oil and gas is present.  So we care about our employees, we care about following U.S. policy and we're not going to be mavericks in this particular area.</p>
