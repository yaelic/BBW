      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Philippe. Welcome and thank you for joining our call. Clearly, this has been a busy few weeks for the company due to our joint efforts with BAE to pursue a merger. This transaction was an opportunity which the management of both companies' felt provided the potential for long-term value-creation. We are readying our strategy in light of the lessons learned from this attempt and we will get back to you, but you should not expect any major M&amp;A activity in the meantime with a large acquisition or major divestment. Be assured that EADS is continuing its ongoing journey to increasing growth and profitability improvement, and the EADS management remains focused on delivering the strong EADS equity story.</p>
          <p>Q3 is an illustration that momentum is ongoing. Let me remind you of the continuing progress we are making. Our overall portfolio of businesses continues to deliver revenue and earnings growth, despite a macroeconomic climate which has been adverse, especially in Europe. Margins, of course, are at the top of our list of priorities and you will continue to see year-over-year improvement.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at our financial highlights on slide 4. Demand for our products remained healthy. Our order-intake performance is on track. Airbus Commercial is on route to achieve a book-to-bill above 1, after last year's record year. Significant orders were booked this quarter and the commercial momentum is still good, as demonstrated by the recent Singapore announcement. In addition, our backlog activity remains at a normal level.</p>
          <p>In Airbus Military, strong order activity with 30 medium and light aircraft that booked, including 90 to 95 for Indonesia in Q3. In Eurocopter, bookings confirm a market recovery with the commercial and oil and gas segments showing strong growth, including 27 Super Puma and &#x20AC;400 million of bookings in Vector. In Astrium, good level of order intake in services, including Vizada. In Cassidian, book-to-bill is close to 1 despite a challenging market environment.</p>
          <p>Our order book of around &#x20AC;547 billion provides a solid platform for growth. Revenue growth is confirmed and will be adjusted in the guidance to reflect the more favorable average spot U.S. dollar rate. The newly acquired companies in 2011 contributed by around &#x20AC;1 billion to this growth. This top line growth combined with solid operational performance in the divisions, particularly in Airbus, resulted in an EBIT before one-off progression of 82% to around &#x20AC;1.9 billion and an EPS before one-off of &#x20AC;1.40.</p>
          <p>We are also making progress on the A350 XWB development within the amended schedule communicated in H1 as demonstrated by the <mark type="ph" /> file integration (4:51) in Toulouse. However, the program remains challenging.</p>
          <p>Our free cash flow reflects our delivery pattern which is back loaded, especially on A380 and the significant industrial ramp-up efforts especially in Airbus and Eurocopter. In addition, government payment profiles are back loaded, particularly in Cassidian. The challenge to reverse the free cash flow has increased compared to H1.</p>
          <p>On slide 5, we can look at the underlying performance of the business. The EBIT before one-off margin is at 5.2% at the group level, which confirms our profitability trend. EBIT before one-off benefited from operational improvement at Airbus Commercial, including favorable volume and better pricing. Astrium's growth is driven by productivity improvements and integration of Vizada.</p>
          <p>In Eurocopter, despite unfavorable product mix in Q3 and higher R&amp;D, EBIT before one-off is stable. As expected, Cassidian 2012 profitability is impacted by the business transformation and globalization. The A350 charge of &#x20AC;124 million is unchanged compared with H1. We progressed as planned on the A380 wing rib technical fix development. The total charges recorded so far in 2012 amount to &#x20AC;0.2 billion. We still target 30 A380 deliveries for 2012, which means the total charge for the A380 wing rib feet is still expected to reach around &#x20AC;260 million for the full year.</p>
          <p>Following the Hawker Beechcraft decision to shut down all their jet lines and despite our efforts to actively seek an acquirer for HBC as a whole, the program closure has resulted in an exceptional charge of &#x20AC;76 million this quarter.</p>
          <p>At nine months, the dollar mismatch and the balance sheet revaluation had a positive impact on our EBIT result of around &#x20AC;70 million. We have provided you with a complete EBIT before one-off view by division in the appendix on slide 22.</p>
          <p>Up to slide 6. Despite the exceptional charges booked year-to-date, EBIT almost doubled compared to 2011. The R&amp;D level is roughly in line with nine months 2011. In 2012, the interest result deteriorated mainly due to lower interest income reflecting the evolution of interest rates. In addition, the 2011 interest result benefited from a positive one-time release of &#x20AC;120 million due to the termination of the A340 program.</p>
          <p>The other financial result includes an improvement impact from the foreign exchange revaluation, compared to last year. This line also includes the unwinding of discounted provisions. The tax rate for the year 2012 is expected to be slightly below 30%. The net income stands at &#x20AC;903 million, significantly above last year. The net income before one-off reflects a strong underlying performance, resulting in an EPS before one-off of &#x20AC;1.40.</p>
          <p>On to the hedging portfolio, slide 7. The slide shows the evolution of the hedge book between December 31, 2011, and end September 2012. You can see how we have used the current U.S. dollar rate environment to improve the average rate in the book to support our future profitability increase. During the first nine months of 2012, we accelerated our hedging activity and implemented $27 billion of new hedge contract at an average rate of $1.29.</p>
          <p>2013 exposure is now basically fully covered and open exposure has been significantly reduced in 2014 and 2015 at more attractive rates, enhancing resilience against FX fluctuation in the near and medium-term. In the same period, $16 billion of forward contracts matured at an average hedge rate of $1.37.</p>
          <p>The hedge book increased from $75 billion at the end of the year to $86 billion at the end of September. Also we maintained our stringent requirement in terms of counterparty quality, our capability to hedge remains.</p>
          <p>At the end of September, the mark-to-market of our hedge portfolio was negative at around minus &#x20AC;1.9 billion before tax compared to a negative of minus &#x20AC;2.4 billion at the end of December. This movement is mainly driven by the favorable evolution of the rate secured in our hedge portfolio.</p>
          <p>On to page 8. Gross cash flow from operation reflects a strong underlying performance. Free cash flow is weighted down by a significant temporary deterioration of the working capital. What are the main drivers? In Airbus, inventory increased as we ramp up in Q4 and in 2013, A380 inventory, seasonality of deliveries in particular in August, and buffer against supply chain issues, and A400M, unfunded inventory. In Eurocopter, inventory increased as we continue ramp up for Q4 and 2013, as well as supply chain buffer. In Cassidian, government payments and milestone achievements are back-loaded.</p>
          <p>In the first nine months of 2012, low customer financing support of minus &#x20AC;97 million has been provided, demonstrating continuing appetite for asset-based financing and continued ECA support for deliveries.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure at &#x20AC;1.9 billion continued to increase, mainly at Airbus driven by A350, including IAS 38 and Single Aisle and Long Range rate increases. The net cash also reflects a cash contribution to pension assets of around &#x20AC;330 million, as well as a dividend payment of around &#x20AC;370 million. The line Others includes FX impact on revaluation of security. The Q4 cash flow should reflect the reversal of working capital requirements driven by deliveries and payments from institutional customers.</p>
          <p>Now let's go to the Airbus performance in more detail. Up to &#x2013; Airbus, slide 10. Airbus Commercial booked 382 net aircraft orders in the first nine months. Key orders in Q3 include Cathay Pacific of 10 A350-1000; Philippines, who wants 44 A320s and 20 A330s; and ICBC, a Chinese lessor, for 50 A320 family.</p>
          <p>Finally, the recent Singapore announcement further endorses the A380 and the A350. The nine months 2011 figure includes the bookings made at Le Bourget last year, where Airbus achieved an industry record driven by the A320neo, still unmatched by competition. The Airbus Commercial backlog now stands at 4,400 aircrafts, representing around seven years of full production.</p>
          <p>As I already mentioned, we are making progress on the challenging A350 program, both the static test aircraft and MSN1. The first flying aircraft are in assembly and power-on of the front fuselage section has been successfully achieved. Wing drilling is now on track. We target first flight for mid-2013 and entry into service in H2 2014. Supply chain performance is still challenging.</p>
          <p>In its military segment, Airbus booked 30 aircraft orders and delivered 11 aircraft. The Airbus Military book-to-bill was above 1 for the first nine months, driven by growth in export markets. The Airbus Military backlog now stands at 236 aircraft for medium and light to A400M. The A400M program continues its test flight program, which has accumulated more than 3,800 flight hours as of end of September. The root cause of the recent engine technical issues has been identified. A400M IOC is targeted in Q1 2013 on a configuration to be agreed with OCCAR, allowing the first delivery to France in Q2 2013. Three further deliveries are planned later that year.</p>
          <p>Up to slide 11 and a closer look at the segment numbers. Compared to nine months 2011, Airbus Commercial revenues benefited from a favorable volume mix and pricing effects. 403 deliveries were booked with revenue recognition and a further two aircrafts were placed on operating lease.</p>
          <p>Airbus Commercial EBIT before one-off at around &#x20AC;1.15 billion improved significantly compared to last year. It benefited from better operational performance, including favorable volume and pricing net of escalation. There was a small tailwind from the appreciation of the U.S. dollar rate of our maturing hedges to the end of September.</p>
          <p>Airbus Commercial reported EBIT also increased significantly compared to last year. It includes a charge booked for the A350, the update of the A380 wing rib feet provision, and the charge for the HBC program closure. It benefited from positive FX effect.</p>
          <p>At Airbus Military, revenues declined mainly due to lower revenue recognition on the A400M as well as lower Tanker revenues. The small improvement in Airbus Military EBIT and EBIT before one-off performance reflects lower R&amp;D expenses.</p>
          <p>Up to Eurocopter on page &#x2013; slide &#x2013; it was on slide 12. The nine months 2012 net order intake has improved compared to last year with 286 new net orders this year. The order value increased significantly compared to last year mainly due to a favorable mix of EC175 and Super Puma and the consolidation of Vector Aerospace.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, Eurocopter secured important orders in the emergency medical services segment for MedTrans Corporation and the civil security segment for Kazakhstan. In close collaboration with the investigation authorities, Eurocopter is devoting all its efforts to analyzing and mitigating the root causes for incidents on Super Puma and Ecureuil B3 helicopters. The division is continuing its high stake discussions with several NH90 and Tiger customers, we're seeking to reduce deliveries. The outcome of these discussions is still open.</p>
          <p>Revenues increased significantly compared to a year ago, mainly driven by more Super Puma deliveries, higher repair and overhaul support activities and the full inclusion of the Vector Aerospace business consolidation.</p>
          <p>The first batch of four Tiger helicopters in ASGARD configuration was delivered to the German government on time this quarter.</p>
          <p>The nine months 2011 EBIT included a net charge of &#x20AC;120 million. Therefore the EBIT before one-off was stable with the 2011 level as a favorable mix of commercial and services, including Vector, was weighted down by higher military sales and higher R&amp;D activity.</p>
          <p>Up to Astrium, slide 13. Astrium order intake reached &#x20AC;2.9 billion in the first nine months, an increase of 23% compared to the previous year driven by a solid level of services activity. We are satisfied with the order activity at Astrium ahead of the ESA Ministerial Council scheduled for November 20, 21 in Naples. That meeting is expected to provide clear prospective on the future direction of European space programs, such as Ariane 5 evolution.</p>
          <p>Revenues increased by 14% compared to last year mainly due to the inclusion of acquired Vizada group into the Astrium perimeter. EBIT increased by 16% despite lower R&amp;D compared to last year. The EBIT increase is due to margin improvement, thanks to efficiency and productivity gains, resulting from the AGILE transformation program as well as positive Vizada contribution.</p>
          <p>Astrium has demonstrated strong performance &#x2013; strong program execution this quarter with three successful Ariane launches resulting in the 51st consecutive success. The third ATV mission has been successfully completed and three Astrium-built satellites were launched this quarter, SPOT 6, Metop-B, and Astra 2F are now all in orbit.</p>
          <p>Cassidian, slide 14. The appointment of a new management team in September is a move to reduce complexity, to enhance margin performance, and to strengthen internationalization. A comprehensive review of cost structure and contract execution enhancement has been launched with a view to conclude before year-end.</p>
          <p>Cassidian order intake of &#x20AC;3.4 billion (sic) [&#x20AC;3.5 billion] (18:22) for the nine months 2012 was significantly above the 2011 level, despite the challenging market environment. The increase was driven mainly by profitable Eurofighter and MBDA business. Cassidian continues to explore export opportunities for Eurofighter in the Middle East and Asia. Revenues are in line with the 2011 level, but the EBIT is below the previous year as expected. The decrease in self-funded R&amp;D was offset by continuing investment in globalization and transformation.</p>
          <p>The closing of Cassidian's agreement with Rheinmetall and UAV on the purchase of the 75.1% stake in Carl Zeiss Optronics business has now taken place.</p>
          <p>Lastly, Other Businesses on slide 15. Revenues increased compared to last year, mainly due to volume increase at EADS North America and ATR. The nine-month 2011 EBIT included a &#x20AC;10 million gain from divestitures of defense security systems solutions in the EADS North America. Therefore, the EBIT before one-off improvement by &#x20AC;5 million, thanks to the profitability improvements in the cabin interior business of Sogerma and to improvements at EADS North America.</p>
          <p>ATR booked 15 net orders in the first nine months and delivered 37 aircraft. The backlog now stands at 202 units. At EADS North America, the flight demonstration has begun for the U.S. Army's Armed Aerial Scout helicopter program.</p>
          <p>I will now comment on our guidance, so slide 17. As a basis for EADS 2012 guidance, EADS expects the world economy and air traffic to grow in line with prevailing independent forecasts and assumes no major disruption due to the current euro crisis.</p>
          <p>As our nine months results confirm our growth and improvement trend, we reaffirm with increased confidence our 2012 earnings guidance.</p>
          <p>In 2012, Airbus should deliver around 580 commercial aircraft, including 30 targeted A380 deliveries. Gross orders should be above the number of deliveries in the range of 600 to 650 aircraft. Based on an assumption of $1.30, EADS 2012 revenues should grow in excess of 10%.</p>
          <p>Based on our solid underlying operating performance, EADS expects 2012 group EBIT before one-off to be around &#x20AC;2.7 billion. As a result, and with an expected tax rate for the full year of slightly below 30%, the EADS 2012 EPS before one-off should be around &#x20AC;1.95.</p>
          <p>Going forward, the reported EBIT and EPS performance of EADS will be dependent on the group's ability to execute on its complex programs such as military helicopter programs, A400M, A380, and A350 in line with the commitments made to customers. Based on the targeted 30 A380 deliveries and assuming no change in government payment behavior, EADS aims to be free cash flow breakeven after customer finance and before acquisitions.</p>
          <p>This now concludes our presentation, and I'm now looking forward to taking your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from Christian Laughlin from Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This is Christian Laughlin from Barclays. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two, please. One, terminating discussions with BAE for now raises some questions about Vision 2020 and the future of Cassidian. Can we expect an update on any strategic review you're undertaking by the end of this year?</p>
          <p>And then two, I've noticed that order momentum for the A320 and the A330 family has persisted strongly this year, even on the back of a record intake year last year. When do you expect the next decision point for production rates will be? And that is to say, when do you think you'll kind of make &#x2013; next take the decision on whether or not to address production rates in particular for these two programs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christian. Let me start with the second question briefly. So in terms of production rates, we feel comfortable with the rate 42. By the way, we're just going there now in &#x2013; or we went there in October. And we look with confidence into that rate 42. As you know, we prefer some overbooking, not too much for 2013 as we have to honor customer commitments, but for 2014. And then, frankly, we want to fill the remaining slots before we transition to the A320neo. And at that juncture, I'm not too keen to stretch it beyond the 42, rather make the 42 work. Again, we're confident in that and the transition to the neo thereafter.</p>
          <p>For the neo, the production rate will need to be decided, but first, before we go to the high end of rates, let me say, we need to manage the transition and that's where we emphasize right now. The order book certainly gives a very good visibility and predictability until 2018, 2019. So, we have some time, I would say, to decide on what is the rate to go for the A320neo.</p>
          <p>To your first question on BAE, Vision 2020 has been defined. Clearly, the BAE transaction would have delivered basically all of the elements of the Vision 2020 in one go. Yes, we review our strategic options. Is it still feasible to go without that transaction to a 50/50? I mean, the 50/50 is not &#x2013; let me say a dogma. I mean the 50/50 means a significant increase in the defense activities and here, clearly, we will analyze, I mean, our options.</p>
          <p>We do not feel pressed by time, as you can see the underlying performances in the business is good. Even if you see in Cassidian a slight headwind in terms of profitability in 2012 nine months, let me explain in a second that this is not a function of contracts in the traditional programs of Cassidian which are bad. Eurofighter margins, missile margins, radar margins are at industry standard. So we're addressing the cost base. And as a first priority of Cassidian, and as I've said before, we'll see what other strategic options we have. I don't want to comment or commit on any timing when we're coming back here, but, as I just mentioned before. In the meantime, you should not expect any major M&amp;A activity, divestment or acquisition.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Robert Stallard from the Royal Bank of Canada.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, it's Rob Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada. Two questions, please. First of all, you mentioned about the buffer that you've built up in inventory in case of supply chain problems. I was wondering if you could quantify how much this is and whether you expect this to be unwound over the next 12 months?</p>
          <p>And secondly, I was wondering if you could comment on your preliminary expectations for book-to-bill looking into next year and how deferral discussions are going with customers. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question, Robert. I apologize that probably I will be a bit short on that. On the buffer for supply chain issues, yes, we took buffer for that. I don't want to quantify that as this is very volatile. We did that consciously. As you can see, delivery performance is key to get to the profitability and in that respect, I think this is a rather wise decision to invest into working capital. The amount is pretty high by the end of Q3 for Airbus as well as for Eurocopter. So a part of that should reverse out in Q4 and further on, we will release buffers in 2013 as we see supply chain maturing. But I would appreciate not to quantify that right now.</p>
          <p>In terms of book-to-bill, let me say we'll come back certainly on that when we give our guidance for 2013. At this juncture, we are very focused to get the orders in for 2012 in line with the 600, 650 aircraft guidance statement.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone. I've got two questions, please. The first one is looking at the volume growth that is expected in Q4, you basically have everything else being equal, FX doesn't change in Q4 compared to Q3, basically have a &#x20AC;530 million tailwind, just based on the volume, so I just wanted to see why the guidance, basically, has remained unchanged, whereas you are still very confident on your delivery guidance? That's my first question. So is there anything to go against just this simple volume growth, anything that we are forgetting on costs?</p>
          <p>And my second question would be just to try and understand in terms of the cash flow movements. How much is this related to the A380 deliveries and how confident are you that customers are going to take an A380 even though they are in the middle of probably penalty charges in negotiations with you? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Celine. First question, volume growth and EBIT guidance, we had, I think, a very good run so far in the first nine months in terms of pricing performance, and I would be a bit more cautious for the same to continue in Q4. Second point, you know that the R&amp;D usually increases in Q4 compared to the run rate in the first nine months, as well as some other cost phasing. So that's why I think at this juncture it is appropriate to maintain the guidance at &#x20AC;2.7 billion. If you'll refer to Airbus and bear in mind as well that in terms of profitability level, the 13 A380s, which are yet to be delivered, come in unfortunately with a very poor margin. Hopefully this is going to change in the future, but that's what it is in 2012.</p>
          <p>And in the other businesses, I mean, we still need to deliver in the Q4 quite a substantial number of profits. I mean, if I look into Cassidian, but as well into Astrium, so we're confident that they will get there in line with the &#x20AC;2.7 billion guidance statement.</p>
          <p>To your second question, yes, A380 delivery profile is another element of the cash flow evolution in the nine months. With 17 being delivered by the end of September and 30 to go, basically they are all built. In terms of comfort for the customers to take them, we advanced a lot over the last weeks and months to agree the repair schedules and all of the implications coming from the wing rib issue in order to release the aircraft for delivery this year as well as next year. So we target those 30 A380 deliveries this year and from a commercial standpoint, I don't see that there is a setback on that and as we speak, we crossed the 20s, I can say, but I will not be much more specific than that.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Ben Fidler from Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Morning, Harald and everybody else. A couple of questions. Firstly just on the cash flow guidance for the full year where, as you yourself admitted, you have become a little bit more cautious on that. I wonder how much of that increased caution around cash flow is due to this inventory buffer at Airbus and how much of that increased caution is due to government advance payment flows? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second question is just around the strategy review. If I could just pick up on your answer to Christian's question at the start of the Q&amp;A session. Are you saying you're still holding on to the desire to get to a 50/50 balance in defense versus commercial? Or are you also, as part of this wider strategic review saying, are now going to question as a management team whether actually defense growth still carries the same appeal that it previously did or is it really &#x2013; just to understand the scope of the review that you're undertaking? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ben. So, on the cash flow guidance, clearly, I mean, the cautious tone, you can read in the breakeven is a function of inventory buffers, as well as government advances. I think we should not be surprised that means there's some risk given the budgetary context in Europe that payments might be deferred. And that's what we &#x2013; we're trying to address here. And I hope you all appreciate that we'd rather take a cautious tone on that one. And for sure given the cash flow evolution year-to-date, it was more than &#x20AC;3 billion of free cash flow out of the challenge to turn it around into a breakeven is higher than from an H1 standpoint. And that's what we're trying to address with the revised guidance statement here.</p>
          <p>However, we are pushing hard and, I mean, were doing revenue that day by day and week by week, I mean, to collect, I mean, all of the government payments in time and to reduce and to release, I mean, any inventory buffers when we feel comfortable that the supply chain can deliver.</p>
          <p>To your second question on the strategy review, I think I said before, 50 &#x2013; let's not take 50/50 as a dogma. The Q3 <mark type="audio gap" /> (35:26 &#x2013; 35:28) the commercial business is in good shape in all across in Airbus, in Eurocopter and we'll continue on that basis. We don't see, I mean, a weakness in the market, on the backlog and the like. I could carry on talking about that one, but that's not your question.</p>
          <p>So what is it about the defense side? Cassidian objective is to offset the risk of home country budget decline by globalization and by new business fields in order to keep, say, the top line flat over the next years to come.</p>
          <p>So this means, from an organic point of view, a significant increase in defense activities is challenging and it's difficult and again, that was a key motivation of the BAE transaction to give that a step change in terms of size and also profit contribution to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>Is there another option of that size, order of magnitude? I mean, let us do our homework and come back when we have something to say on that. But in the meantime, the key operational focus is to enhance the margin in Cassidian, and I'm very happy to say this is really taken up by Bernhard Gerwert, the new CEO in Cassidian together with Julian Whitehead, the new CFO and the whole management team to crystallize the good underlying margins in the Cassidian business. Again, in Eurofighter, in MBDA, in radars, slim and address the structure costs of the organization.</p>
          <p>And third, look at the contracts and contracts exposure for existing one and future one, so that we are getting Cassidian back to the benchmark profitable level where it should belong to. That's frankly, I mean, from my point of view, the top priority right now and for the strategic question, we're not in a hurry to decide on that with a backlog of &#x20AC;16 billion in Cassidian. I think you will agree with me that there is time to reflect cautiously about it, and then take the appropriate decision.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my two questions. So, the first one will be on the cost phasing at Airbus. You hinted briefly that it should be slightly negative in Q4? If I understand correctly, you had a tailwind from cost phasing at Airbus in H1. Instead was it &#x2013; whether it was a neutral or already negative in Q3, and whether you still are comfortable with the view that it should be a neutral over the full year.</p>
          <p>And the second question would be for a quick update on the A380 situation, and where do you stand on this application process of the permanent fix of the wing ribs issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tristan. So, for the cost phasing in Q3, that was neutral in Q3, so no tailwind from that one. And for the Q4, we expect some headwind. And as you go back, I think, to the &#x2013; to history, you will basically see over the years that, I mean, the R&amp;D level increases more towards the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Let me explain very briefly. You'll &#x2013; no, this is not a function of us ramping up our resources internally every last quarter in the Q4 and ramping them down in the first quarter of the year. That's very much a function of subcontracting work packages, very much sitting in the fourth quarter and then either being paid, or I mean, being accrued for. And that's basically what is behind that. But that's what we'll see and it's not limited to R&amp;D but also to some of the other non-series costs.</p>
          <p>With regard to the 380, in terms of the certification, certification for the forward fit, i.e., for the fresh build wings in 2013 which come to delivery in 2014, this is before the end of the year. This is a full metallic solution, so I think that's very straightforward.</p>
          <p>For the retrofit solution, we embody the solution as we speak into our flight test aircraft, and we'll have a heavy flight test in the weeks to come, which then will need to be shared with the other, and then we expect certification of that solution around the year-end. So don't nail me down whether it's in December or January, but it should be around the year end, which is key for sure to proceed with the retrofit contained with all of the customers as it had been agreed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. I've got two questions as well, please. The first one is on the Airbus side. You talk about challenges on the A350. I just wondered if you could highlight what these challenges are? And on the A380, just wanted to know how much progress you had made in eliminating the huge losses that ongoing there.</p>
          <p>And then the second question is on Eurocopter. Again, I know these two programs, which are under discussion, incur huge losses. And I just want to know what the impact would be of reducing deliveries? Would that on the bottom line be a positive impact? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Happy to take the questions, even though I counted three. But therefore, I cut it perhaps a bit short. On A350, let me highlight very briefly, that's also been some of the progress we had been doing. Point number one, the static aircraft has been completed, assembled, including wings. So we overcame the issue on the wing drilling we had been talking about very much in the H1. Real big effort of the teams have been achieved here during the summer time in August and in September. There were &#x2013; then on the MSN1, both wings, as we speak, have been delivered to the final assembly line. All of the sections for the first flying aircraft, the MSN1, are now in the FAL. Again, on the wing equipping, the team did an outstanding job here.</p>
          <p>The FAL operation is running very smoothly. I mean, the colleagues over there are very pleased with the geometry and the precision of the sections coming in. So the lead time to assemble is better than our expectations at this point. Systems maturity looks also good at this stage. So a lot of good news.</p>
          <p>However, it remains challenging and why do we say that? We look very closely at supplier performance in these days for all of the flight test aircraft. This is the key focus at this stage. So from &#x2013; for the MSN1 to 5 [MSN5], this is the population which we need to have coming together pretty quickly in 2013 in order to proceed with the full flight test program, which is mandatory for certification.</p>
          <p>And here we have challenges. So we're addressing them together with the suppliers, and you could see very recently, last week, one of them was also outspoken. So I will not make further quotes on that, about his own challenges to comply with the schedule. So we are sending teams, and not just a few people, but more to address it. But we also expect by then the performance comes across, otherwise, we are at risk and that leads us to say it is challenging.</p>
          <p>Sorry, it was finally a bit long answer, but I want to give you a bit of balanced view between the risk and the opportunities on the 350.</p>
          <p>On the 380 losses, it'd be partly the wing rib in 2012, where we had been making progress also in the Q3 in line with what we had been saying so far. I mean, there's some cost for the &#x2013; for this retrofit and the forward fit solution, but I mean, again, they should be temporary. So in terms of the overall industrial situation of the program, we are quite happy. The key emphasis certainly is on the commercial side and to get sufficient the orders in time for the outer years, as you know, for 2015 breakeven and the like.</p>
          <p>On Eurocopter, no, I cannot quantify any impact. However, I felt that given the discussions which are ongoing and I think this is, as such, not news. I mean, discussions on NH90 in Germany are ongoing &#x2013; on NH90 and Tiger are ongoing with Germany. So you could also see Portugal desire to terminate, I mean, NH90. And you can also see, I mean, in the press that there are discussions ongoing a bit further away in Australia on the NH90.</p>
          <p>That, I mean, there are discussions on that program and we have contractual commitments. Customers have contractual commitments, and we need to see where they're coming out. We cannot exclude that there could be an impact from that and that's &#x2013; which would we rather consider, you may say then, as a one-off item, and that's why we included that in the same section in the guidance statement as you can see for A350, A380 and A400M. That's what is behind this change in the wording.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Harald, thank you very much for that. Can I just ask clarification on the A380? You have a backlog, which at 40 per annum, is more than four and a half years. So why are you addressing that as an issue, i.e., for 2015? Do you not have coverage based on that backlog for the next three or four years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So for 2013, certainly we'll have a full backlog coverage. On 2014, 2015, we have open slots, I think I said that already in summer. And we're trying to address that by new orders. So it looks different, I mean year by year. And that's what we're working upon and then we'll need to take, I mean, the decisions will have to be taken in line with that. But I can assure you, I mean, we are very committed to the breakeven in 2015, and we'll do everything which is mandatory to get there.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, everybody. Morning, Harald. I've just got two questions, please. Just one firstly around pricing. Can you just give us an idea of how the pricing has developed between &#x2013; particularly on the 320 side between the neo and the ceo?</p>
          <p>And then second question just around shareholding structure. I mean, if we take a step back and look at the merits of the BAE deal, clearly one that you all allude very strongly was the benefits of simplifying the shareholding structure. Are you now also looking at other avenues by which you can try to simplify the structure and reduce the level of government involvement? Is that something that's also being done as part of the overall strategy review that's been taking place now? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the easy question, Rupi. So, let me pick the easy part of it, the 320 pricing. We could see throughout the year, I mean, some &#x2013; yes, significant pricing pressure, in particular on the current single aisles, let's say, so 320ceo <mark type="ph" /> and 73. (48:44) Frankly, I think I mentioned that several times, I fail to understand a bit the rationale of that. What we are pursuing on that side is to fill the remaining open slots for the A320ceos, where we have slots available in 2015 and then 2016 and then it comes down in 2017 as the neo ramps up. So we address that. We want to fill these slots at reasonable prices on average, which does not mean that on one or the other campaign, we can be more aggressive as well. But as a global trend, we'll not go mad just to fill that.</p>
          <p>In terms of the neo pricing, we see that &#x2013; I mean, the premium the neo delivers is still very well rewarded by the customer with the fuel evolution and it's not a surprise. And I don't see a change, I mean, globally in the neo pricing trend. I mean, however, again in sometimes we're talking about combined campaigns between neo and ceo. Does not mean that on one or the other campaign, one cannot be a bit challenging. But I don't see the rationale or to dump any price on the neo.</p>
          <p>And if I got the release right off our colleagues and friends on the other side, the pricing pressure is coming off a bit as well at their end. And let me as well, at this stage, I think if there's one statement I would join them, is that, I mean, the backlog movement is in normal shape, no extraordinary movement, cancelation, postponement request, that &#x2013; sorry to sneak that in at this juncture.</p>
          <p>Now the difficult one, shareholder structure. Yes, you're absolutely right. I mean that would have been one of the beauties of the BAE transaction, next to the strong strategic rationale. Well, let's look forward in terms of shareholder evolution. I mean, you can see in the press that, obviously, there are discussions ongoing between existing shareholders and potential new shareholders in the company.</p>
          <p>What I can say at this stage, point number one, I welcome, or we welcome, each and every new shareholder, as you and the investor community are doing every day as normal shareholder. Point number two, the parties discussing that, I need to assume that they are conscious to protect the company's interest in terms of its capability to grow, to execute, and to preserve shareholder interests, i.e., the free float interest. And point number three on individual discussions, I cannot comment as I'm not a party to.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Nick Cunningham from Agency Partners.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Yes. A couple of questions, one on the cash outflow. Just a bit of mental arithmetic, if we take the &#x20AC;600 million that apparently Germany was due to pay in launch eight, and maybe get &#x20AC;700 million for the A380 inventory build-up to be roughly 70% of five A380s carried over the end of the quarter. That's still only less than &#x20AC;1.5 billion out of your sort of &#x20AC;3.5 billion outflow. So it's just a very large working capital outflow underlying, which seems odd given your history has been that you've built a lot of cash on the back of increasing PDPs on ramp up. So why is the ramp up now leading to an outflow? And it implies that the stock build that you're talking about, the inventory builds, is very big indeed or there's something else going on there that I don't understand?</p>
          <p>And then further question on Airbus. You talked about the open slots on A320ceo and maybe hinted that you might have to take some lower priced contracts. Would that be Ryanair by any chance? Are there enough aircraft to actually be meaningful to Ryanair's requirement in that timeframe?</p>
          <p>And on A330, what's the open slot position? Are you still thinking about an 11 rate? Does A330 need the China issue to be resolved? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Nick. First on 320. I mean let me say or let me clarify. I mean, I didn't mean that, I mean, prices are going down. We see them at a normal flat level. I just said that on one or the other occasion, we could accept a lower price, but on average we see that the trend, rather flat, let me say. Yeah.</p>
          <p>In terms of Ryanair, I'm happy to offer slots to Ryanair if they are ready to honor what it adds to them in terms of benefit. That's all I can say on that.</p>
          <p>In terms of 330, we are looking at the rate 10 at this stage. There is good demand. However, the uncertainty is very much in 2014 on the ETS situation with China, which as we speak is still unresolved. And so we still have a bit of time to clarify that if that should lead to a favorable conclusion. We could come back to the rate 11, but for the time being, in order to avoid additional inventory exposure, as some might say, we stick to the rate 10.</p>
          <p>In terms of the cash out and you mentioned some of the elements, let me say on a year-on-year basis, you will not be surprised, I mean, that the 2011 cash flow performance was also very much helped by the strong order intake from Le Bourget, which translate into a significant PDP inflow. I mean this is sometimes very volatile, but good inflow at contract signature. And as you can see, we don't have that level of order intake this year. And hence, the PDP inflow is a bit different in the nine months this year compared to nine months last year. Not an area of concern. It has been linked to the exceptional, somehow, we had in 2011.</p>
          <p>In terms of other elements of cash, I mean, let me remind the A400M in it. A400M funding profile is also very much different year-on-year. And A400M inventory and working capital buildup is unfunded. I mean that was the concession of the deal which we did in 2010 with the nations when we reset the contract of A400M.</p>
          <p>In terms of inventory and supply chain buffers, let me answer that for Eurocopter and Airbus in one go. Yes, there is a significant investment into it. It is too high, I mean, I'm not making a secret out of that. And it should come down when &#x2013; I think I mentioned before, I don't want to commit on that right now. Is it coming down in Q4? Is it coming down rather in 2013? We'll work on that, but it's a function of the issues being addressed in the supply chain as a first and foremost priority, and I hope you all guys will agree with that statement, is to deliver the aircraft and the helicopter in time and to get the margin from it.</p>
          <p>In terms of a trade-off, I think it is a reasonable decision. Even so, I acknowledge that, I mean, the level of investment into inventory is too high at this juncture. So we need to go back to a more normal level.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I make a brief follow-up on that? Is there any significant build in A350 inventory yet or is that still to come? And how will that balance off against A350 then PDPs as we look forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A350 inventory, I mean, it's &#x2013; is more a 2013 and 2014 issue. So, you do not see that in the working capital. A350 investments you're seeing in the CapEx line is the early aircraft, the flight test aircraft part of the CapEx, such as the jigs and tools, such as the IAS 38 and the like. That's also one of the reason why the CapEx number goes up year-on-year basis, but it is a investment into the 350, but not into the working capital inventory, which will be traded later.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, everyone. Two quick questions, referring first to the government's payments in Q4. Do you see a risk on any specific country or it's across the board. So some of your suppliers stated France has been a risky country in terms of payments at the end of the year. Is it still the same for you? Or is it Germany? So interesting to have your answer on that.</p>
          <p>And second, a year ago with the former Cassidian management team, the EBIT margin target four years out was 8% plus, are you keeping or giving up this type of target for 2015 or 2016? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Antoine. So in terms of governments, let me &#x2013; I don't want to spot a particular government in this public call, so we watch all of the government overdues or receivables, and follow them tightly. In terms of &#x2013; by the way, in terms of, I mean, asset management, we avoid to have any exposure in brackets, so we look at all countries. If you would ask me for where is the biggest focus at this stage, probably, I would look a bit south of Pyrenees, if I may say, where we will try to chase for that, some countries south Pyrenees. Sorry for that.</p>
          <p>Point number two on the Cassidian 8% in the past and in the future, the ambition level in terms of profitability had been clearly set out by Louis [Gallois] and Hans Peter [Ring]. As we speak, we'll work on our operational plan, and I see no reason to deviate from the ambition level. And as I mentioned before, I'm happy to see that the new management clearly addresses this ambition and the need to improve the profitability.</p>
          <p>Again, it is really, to me, important to mention that even taking the risk to repeat myself. Point number one, underlying margins, I mean, are good in the traditional businesses. So the management addresses the cost structure of the organization and the overhead and the internationalization. And point number three, as you know, we took some contracts in the past, which constitute too much exposure for the company. So management is working on how to address that and to make sure that for future contracts, we limit our exposure.</p>
          <p>And if we take that together, I think there's no reason why Cassidian should not be able to come back, not in 2013 please, but over time to our benchmark profitability and margin level.</p>

          <p>Just to follow up on this one, is it fair to assume that you are loss-making in the Defence Electronics part of it?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do not comment on specific lines. But this I cannot confirm. Or, to be clear, no, we're not loss-making.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We'll take just two more questions, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Andy Chambers from Redburn.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm pleased to say most of my questions have already been asked. But I wonder if you could just clarify on the pricing issues in Q4 that you talked about. Were you purely saying that the A380 deliveries would have a negative impact on pricing progression? Or are we entering a period now where the serial production is going to face a flatter progression over the next 18 months or so as well in the A320 and A330?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So for the Q4, I mean it's the customer mix in the last quarter which is not equally spread over the year, but, I mean, it's delivery &#x2013; it's pricing and deliveries. So it's a function of the backlog of orders which we took in average, say, two to three years ago. And on the 380, I mean, there is basically no margin contribution coming from this aircraft in the last quarter. However, there is a significant revenue contribution, i.e., it is diluted in terms of return on sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. But no real change to the dynamics on the A320, A330 at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No change on delivery, on pricing performance in deliveries in Q4, and also moving forward.</p>

          <p>The last question...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The last question comes from Christophe Menard from Kepler.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Question was on again the inventory buffer. My understanding is that the on-time delivery is actually degrading or declining for &#x2013; with your suppliers. Are you also seeing a problem with financing? I guess, you have a watch tower system that helps you watch the status of all these suppliers. Are you seeing the situation getting worse at the moment?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on the customer financing. I mean, it's very limited in the nine month and I guess it will be the same for the full year. What about 2013? Do you see a positive effect from the fact that the <mark type="ph" /> Cofas (1:04:47) can back the guaranteed bonds in &#x2013; I think it's in 2013 that it starts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the last one right away. Absolutely right. So the customer finance, all in all, is in good shape. By the end of Q3, we had 26% of the deliveries being supported by ECA Financing, and our own support was very remote. The rest has been taken up by the market. The lessors are very important in that, in terms of, I mean, direct purchase, as well as sale and leaseback. And what makes our sales finance exposure to be still as low as about $1.4 billion. And I don't see a major change in that towards the year-end. That's a bit of an increase, but nothing fundamental.</p>
          <p>For 2013, you're absolutely right. I mean we're working hard with all of the stakeholders to find additional and new financing sources. ECA Financing will still be, I mean, a key thing. The bond market is a new avenue, and we're grateful for all of the support by the different parties to make that work. So for 2013, all-in-all, despite the tightening of the ECA rules, we do not see a major change in the customer finance structure.</p>
          <p>Regarding this financial health of the suppliers, let me say, it's very much different by commodities. I think systems and equipment, they are all in good shape. The focus is more on some particular aero structure suppliers, which took a lot of upfront commitment in terms of risk sharing and hence, funding, and if programs get delayed, they move themselves into operational execution difficulties and they also move into financial difficulties.</p>
          <p>So we watch that very carefully. You're absolutely right. We have a watch tower as we have it for the customer side where we address that looking forward and then step in first on the operational side to help to address any shortages. And I mean, on particular cases, we can also be of some support financially wise in 2011. We took over <mark type="ph" /> VUW (1:07:27) in Germany just to name an extreme example, if I may say. I would not extrude that. On an exceptional basis, it could happen again here or there but it remains the exception.</p>
          <p>Other than that, we help to improve the performance of our suppliers. We are recently changing &#x2013; changed the organizational setup in Airbus for that, with a full supply chain organization and we're sending our best people over there again to address that, to make and deliver the stuff in time.</p>
          <p>During that period of time, yes, we buffer it off with some additional inventory, which comes back to the free cash flow situation by the end of Q3.</p>
