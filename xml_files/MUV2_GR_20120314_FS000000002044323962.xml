          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Munich Re Annual Conference to all investors and analysts here in the room, as well as to all participants following this conference from their offices via Internet. Just a few things from my side before we get started. Today, we have five presentations, so the usual comprehensive schedule. There will be a 30-minute break after the third presentation. And after the last presentation, there is ample opportunity for Q&amp;A which is expected to start at around 2:30. The formal part of the conference should be finished by approximately 3:30. We then, as always, like to invite you to join us for some refreshments, and there will, of course, be time for further informal discussions with all the speakers.</p>
          <p>I'm sure many of you took the opportunity to take part in our conference call on the outcome of the January 1 renewals and on the preliminary figures for fiscal year 2011 just a few weeks ago. We, yesterday, in addition, disclosed the full set of financial results, as well as the MCEV report. And today, beyond discussing these numbers in more detail, we also aim to look ahead together with you on Munich Re's future prospect.</p>
          <p>So, let me introduce to you the panel today's speakers starting from my very right with Joe Oechslin, our Chief Risk Officer; then J&#xF6;rg Schneider, our CFO; next to him, Nikolaus von Bomhard, CEO of Munich Re Group; then Torsten Jeworrek, CEO of Munich Re's Reinsurance Business; and last but not least, Torsten Oletzky, CEO of ERGO, representing Munich Re's Primary Insurance business. My name is Christian Becker-Hussong. I am heading up the Investor Relations Department.</p>
          <p>I would also like to introduce to you a few colleagues who will join us and support us in the Q&amp;A session: Christoph Jurecka CFO of ERGO; Isabella Pfaller, Head of Group Reporting at Munich Re; <mark type="indiscernible" /> (02:25), Head of Reinsurance Financial Planning and Analysis; Rich Olsen, Head of Central Reserving; and Reinhard Denk, Head of Life Re Controlling. Also most members of the IR team are in the room including Alexander Becker from ERGO.</p>
          <p>My sincere thanks, as always, third year in a row now to Goldman Sachs for once more supporting this conference by providing these outstanding facilities. And just a last few housekeeping remarks, I would ask you to switch off mobile phones and BlackBerrys as they interfere with the technical equipment we have here in the room. And this conference is, as usual, being transmitted over the Web.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to hand it over to Nikolaus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, Christian and a good day to all of you. And I would like to start by saying, so far much better. Those who were here the year before will remember the very day when we met, we had a huge earthquake in Japan. In fact, we have another one today but further out, so that is the good news. And appropriately &#x2013; and we do not expect any serious losses from the earthquake what we had another one right today so it seems to be a bewitched date, not the room.</p>
          <p>Well, we are well over two months now into the current year, 2012. And so far, we have no reason to complain, at least overall. And I would dare to say that result swing is up, tremendous result swing for the first quarter of 2012 compared to 2011.</p>
          <p>I will try to warm you up for the further presentations of my colleagues. I'm not going into detail because they will. But I would like to give you an overview, and I do start, of course, with a short retrospective, and I may sum up 2011 as this was not our year.</p>
          <p>The capital markets, to start it off, of course, left its trace in the MCEV specifically of the life primary entity of ERGO. And all the asset liability management measures that we took were kind of marginalized by the interest rate development, by the drop that you see on the slide as well.</p>
          <p>On top of that we had a huge volatility in the markets that we have to deal with. By the way, Jo will later on talk about that. We do consider the implied volatility when we calculate our risk capital. We had increasing credit spreads for corporate, but even more so, certainly, for the weaker sovereign bonds. And the equity markets as you see were not strong either. So, that was already a package.</p>
          <p>But on top of that, we had the natural catastrophe development and you see on this slide, the major catastrophes, and three of those including of course the earthquake that hit almost exactly a year ago, we had by now already in our numbers. The series, in fact, was not so much a weather-related series in the first place, it was earthquakes, but nevertheless severe. And the overall macroeconomic loss to the world, to the countries that were affected was by far the largest we had ever seen. In terms of insured losses, this was, by a margin, the worst year. 2005 still is very close. And we do think that the aggregate of those losses to the insurance industry and certainly to us is somewhere in the range of a 2% probability.</p>
          <p>Well, with all that on our back, still, I think the group demonstrated that we are resilient to such major challenges. The net result slightly over &#x20AC;700 million, a stable dividend because the capital is what it should be, and the prospect for the current year is such that we should and could and must pay the dividend. And this is not the consequence of a more lenient either reserving or accounting. Nothing has changed there. We stick to the, what I would call, conservative or cautious approach that you can expect from us and that you are accustomed to see when we present the numbers to you. No backlogs going into the current year.</p>
          <p>Another slide that is rather retrospective than prospective. What we didn't try to do last year and to achieve for you as our shareholders is, of course, a resilient performance, so trying to successfully navigate to that changing environment.</p>
          <p>As I see the good news and that, of course, also helped us in doing our job is we try to avoid surprises, negative surprises in the first place that we weren't prepared for. So, we were, all through the year, never shocked ourselves. We never had been, as a management, in anything that I would call a crisis mode, even though the year was not benign. And the performance, if you now go back on the timeline as regards what started off as a subprime is somewhere now in the sovereign crisis mode, of course, we are fully aware that we felt better in the first half of the crisis, in the first two years, where it was subprime in credit crisis. And we did not so good in relative terms rather more or less like the crowd in the second half of that crisis.</p>
          <p>The low interest rate environment is a challenge to all of us in the industry, certainly to those who do life insurance, more so the handout guarantees and options. But at the same time, the overall returns are coming down with this incrementally slowing or lowering of the interest rate level, and the volatility, I mentioned it, of course keeps us on our toes as well. What helped us through all of that and what will continue to help us is a strict focus on the liability side of the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>We are here to do the underwriting &#x2013; get the underwriting right and to deliver on the return on our underwriting. That is for us the utmost target and key. What I think that helped too is the fact that we have an integrated business model up and running, insurance and reinsurance, under one roof. That the risk management function is such as deeply embedded in the entire organization. Wherever you go, you will find people deeply worried about doing the right thing when it comes to risk management.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, that we go for diversification. This is at the heart of our value proposition as we go for diversification both ways, be it the asset side of the balance sheet more so probably than before the crisis even. But the same, of course, holds true for the liability side of the balance sheet. We are realistic in our expectations. I come to that when I talk about the outlook for the current year, but this also was very important. All through the crisis, we never hoped for anything to improve or get better, just hoping for it. We had scenario planning in place all the time and we just took for granted what we could see.</p>
          <p>So, we were not taking bigger positions hoping that interest rates would rise or something else would happen to give us a way out. No. We took what we saw as it is and that also, that kind of a realistic approach helped us tremendously.</p>
          <p>On the right side of that slide, you see a diagram that you know, that we tend to show every now and then, certainly here always, and that is a diagram that shows on the one scale the total shareholder return, and on the other, the volatility with which we produced the total shareholder return. This is so important to us because we want to sustainably deliver a decent return.</p>
          <p>This now dates back to January 2005. So, it's a good seven-year picture. And you see in the little footnote who are the companies behind the numbers and these are what we consider our major peers in the markets, both capital markets and insurance markets. And here, you see, we get where we want to be and that is the upper left corner of that diagram. We are not least volatile nor are we the best performer. We are second more or less in both categories, but that's fine as I see that's where we want to be.</p>
          <p>Here, I can be shorter because this I think is almost obvious what we try to express. First of all, it's about the dividend. And the dividend, of course, is a reflection of, as I see it, capital strength which is the precondition. Before you pay a dividend you must be absolutely sure that you have the capital in place to do your business. And I think I should emphasize because there was an argument here or there. I don't know who brought it up, hopefully, not ourselves &#x2013; that all through the year, whatever opportunity we could see, we could handle it with the capital in place. We did not have a discussion whether we had the capital in place to do the business. We could do the business we want to do and therefore also now looking back to the old year, paying a dividend is no stretch for us at all.</p>
          <p>The second argument I think here that is important I think is the reliability. Of course, Munich Re takes some pride in not having had to lower the dividend over decades, in fact only once in the last several decades since 1969. We can go back to 1952 and then we have a problem with our information basis. We don't know exactly what happened there. At least we did not put much time into finding out what happened before 1952. We reassumed business in 1950, this we know because the Allied Forces only then allowed us to do business again, international business. So we have an unbroken record except the year 1969.</p>
          <p>This is important to us, but not so important that we would not touch the dividend if we were in serious trouble of course. There is an end to that policy. But I think the good news is if you compare that return that you get with the dividend of around 6%, compared with what you get with other investments, and then at the same time look at our CDS spread level, I think it's a pretty decent and reliable and safe return. Left side of that slide number 5 is about book value growth. I think if you take into account the risks we run, then this is an at least good value growth in book value per share both with or without dividend and share buyback over the last years.</p>
          <p>Talking about dividend, a short word. J&#xF6;rg will talk about that later on. We have no issues at least for the foreseeable future. I have to be careful here of course because I can't predict what will happen in the capital markets to pay the dividend on that level. So a topic that was a topic for a while, revenue reserve on the local German GAAP is not an issue for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>Talking about capital, and now we change over into the economic world, our world of the Munich Re capital model. And this is just a little of a warm-up for Jo Oechslin later on because he, of course, will go into the details. Here, also, you'll see the CDS spread development. What is important to me is not only the fact that it is relatively low, it's amongst the lowest in the entire financial industry, it's also not very well volatile.</p>
          <p>But the other message here, of course, is about the capital, left side of the slide, and the solvency position, and I said it in different words earlier on was solid all through the financial crisis and certainly including the last year. We take, when we model our risks, a very cautious and conservative approach not only as regards to calibration. We take the Solvency II calibration times 1.75, which pushes the solvency ratio up already from that 111% to 194%. I've, in parenthesis, may add here, unfortunately, not all do make or see that distinction. They put apples and pears next to each and oranges next to each other and compare the 111% to 140s and what-have-you, but then calibrate it to the Solvency II world and not the way we calibrate it. And moreover, the way we do our run, our model, there is at least a mid-double-digit percentage points could come on top if we did it as many others do it in terms of being not as cautious, maybe, as we are. But this is something that Jo will explain later on.</p>
          <p>Well, overall, resilient position all through 2011, the interest rate sensitivity you see here and we feel also well prepared for the not so likely anymore, but still further drop of interest rates, I may say that the increase of interest rates puts me at least into much more mental trouble than a further drop. That leverage has never been high. It is a little lower even today and the quality of the capital is of such a nature that we may not be number 1 in terms of capitalization compared to one or the other. There's a few who have more, but in terms of quality of capital, we are certainly in the top group. And this of course is reflected also in the rating agencies statements on our capital position overall.</p>
          <p>On investments, I mentioned earlier on this was a challenge last year and will stay a challenge this year. Our appetite for taking investment risk is and has been over the last years obviously quite limited. The reason being, very simple, our strategic and asset liability management framework disincentivizes taking risk because it limits everyone to the liability &#x2013; the nature of the liabilities and the cash flows we expect from the liabilities, there's no room to move away from that. And this also enforces a very high level of diversification of the assets which means unfortunately here or there that we have a share where we would rather not like to have a share with a benefit of hindsight. But if you diversify, you do not take strong positions in the sense that you say, "I know better than the market even already knows where to go."</p>
          <p>The good news and this is the upper right of the slide is I think that we are &#x2013; yes, we did have and do have some exposure in the peaks countries. In fact, the Munich Re AG, the reinsurer in fact is almost entirely free of peaks including Belgium. Wherever you find peaks exposure today in the group, it is with ERGO and it was less than &#x20AC;6 billion market value as of today. And it is in relative terms &#x2013; we shouldn't say maybe too oft, but appears to be smaller when you compare it to the exposure we have to the so-called safe havens.</p>
          <p>You can do the math either way you like here. We showed you one that is working against the equity. You see the factor is pretty much one to eight. If you do the same, as regards realized and unrealized gains, and I'm speaking about unrealized losses now, then the gross factor here would one to four. And assuming that all the policyholder funds hold, the factor would be one to eight for the shareholders. So, I think that the margin for us here is at least prudent in the sense that our peaks exposure never was &#x2013; has never outgrown the capacity of the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>The upper left of that slide, to me at least, is not so important because these reserves that you see here, the unrealized gains reserves, of course, nice to have. It's a gross number of north of &#x20AC;11 billion, but this is not money to stay. And if you ask me whether I would like to see them disappear, the answer is yes. Because with the slight or incremental increase of the interest rates, this would partly at least disappear. And I rather have a little higher interest rate than these reserves. But of course, having them is not a pain.</p>
          <p>The lower left of the slide is the last one I would like to briefly refer to and that is, I think, interesting because if you compare it to last year, which Jo will do later on, you will see that we are little bit more exposed to an increase of interest rates which may be more likely, I don't know. The reason being that the movements of the interest rates were so extreme in the last year that all our asset liability management measures, as I said earlier on, were not catching up anymore with what was going on in the markets.</p>
          <p>So, that's why the gap opened a little bit in a year before. This number is almost &#x20AC;12 million was a lot lower, closer to zero. The good news on that little thing also is that the diversification between primary and reinsurance here creates a tangible diversification benefit of close to &#x20AC;3 billion in terms of risk capital. But just having the two different profiles of the liabilities and the durations that we try to manage from the group level, they create alone a benefit of &#x20AC;3 billion. You will see that number later on also on one of Jo's slides.</p>
          <p>If I go back, the crisis as such, and look at what we did on the investment, on the asset management side, was in the beginning not much. Why did we perform better in the first half of the crisis? Because we were very low or short on credit risk, because we didn't like the spreads at the time, that was 2006 and 2007. It worked very well in the beginning of the crisis. We didn't have to do much. We sold on a little bit &#x2013; products that we still have but wasn't much.</p>
          <p>Then, the credit crisis took its course, spreads widened, that's when &#x2013; it was when we entered credit risk and built up specifically our corporate bond book. Then recession hit. You remember the slide where I showed the different phases. Then we started specifically lengthening durations. And then the latest phase, unfortunately, sovereign debt crisis, of course, we had some write-downs on specifically, of course, Greece. But we are in a unrealized loss situation with the other four. And if you add that all up, we're standing slightly north of &#x20AC;1 billion gross.</p>
          <p>Well, so far as to this slide, a view, a different view, if you like, on our business portfolio and this is a view in two dimensions. One is how sensitive is our business to macroeconomic changes. And two, how do we manage, what one might call, harvesting and investing or generating capital and developing the business.</p>
          <p>The one business segment that appears in all three columns is ERGO. They have a fair share of the three positions, if you like. But I think it is important to see that, overall as we see it, our portfolio is relatively well protected against major upheavals in the macroeconomic environment. And that, I think, is part of the value proposition to an investor, that the correlation to the macroeconomic development is not one.</p>
          <p>Well, the good &#x2013; whether this is a good balance or not, of course, can be argued. We think it is, of course, it's a matter of experience to what do you do, where do you invest, where you don't. The most exposed to the economic, macroeconomic cycle certainly is the primary life book. But also ERGO International is, to some extent, depending on the macro environment whereas other parts, take as an extreme the nat cat business is not at all, at least, not in the first place for sure.</p>
          <p>So, this is I think a balanced book. We try to create enough of a cash flow and capital generation and earnings for the shareholders that flow through to the shareholders, whereas on the other hand, we use part of it at the most tangible example for that policy is always the life rebook in itself where you can see what is being produced and what part of what we produce on a yearly basis is then used to be reinvested into creating the new business. But we do that also on the larger scale for the entire book of Munich Re. So, we are far from just administering what we have or even worse, running it off. It's a living, developing book. And even the reinsurers do not make them appear the slow mover and boring part here on the lower-right corner, of course, have that development parts as well. And so, Torsten Jeworrek is, of course, having his little blocks and segments of business where he invests. Take your corporate solutions business or take the enterprise risk segment where he, of course, is in a developing and investing mode as well. But in relative terms, smaller than the other blocks that you see to the right of that slide.</p>
          <p>Yes. Coming to the end, outlook for the current year, I would call it back to normal. It doesn't sound, I know, too appealing. And it's I think not overly bullish, but it is ambitious. And I think it's realistic. What can we expect? I think we can expect with the interest rate level that we have, that is challenging for us. And I said it. I'm not so sure whether I rather have it seeing going up because I'm not so sure whether if it goes up, it will go up at the right speed. Going down, I think we are relatively well protected. I would like to see going up, but it is of course a challenge. And the other biggest challenge as I see it for most of the insurers out there and certainly also for us is credit risk now. It's not about interest rate levels in the first place. It's credit risk.</p>
          <p>So, let's assume that, and this is a ceteris paribus consideration here, that things just move at least sideways. That is why I said it's a realistic but also ambitious outlook that we do expect a net income around, and that's what we work for, of &#x20AC;2.5 billion, which against the market cap of as of today more or less &#x20AC;20 billion I think is interesting to say the least.</p>
          <p>The return on the investments is set at 3.5% as we expected. This goes against a return on investment of 3.4% last year. We had quite some depreciations and write-downs there. So, I think this should be manageable. Of course we don't know exactly because the investment returns are coming down as long as the interest rate stays where it is.</p>
          <p>RORAC 15%, of course, is in fact there because we want to change that but we did not want to come up into immediate new target before Solvency II is up. The next target we will come up with will be a Solvency II base target. What do we expect on the RORAC side for the current year? Something in the low double digit, may I add, very low double digit. Combined ratios, we don't like them, as you know, because they don't measure risk. But the good news here is we do expect all the three business segments to deliver below 100%.</p>
          <p>Yes, and my last slide is number 10. Well, we go for sustainable value generation. That's what we go for. A quarter is of no real interest to us, even I would dare to say except for some obvious reasons like dividends in a year isn't so much. It should be for the mid and long term whatever we do.</p>
          <p>I think that the strategy worked. It is interesting if you dissect the result of the last year that some of the issues we have discussed in previous meetings here were the foundation of the result this year, of 2011. The North American reinsurance business, life and non-life, was a major contributor to the result, so was ERGO. And the P&amp;C side of course for obvious reasons in reinsurance had a hard time last year. We focus on insurance risk, I said it, and we try to manage the company in a way that we are not too much correlated to the economic cycles, the ups and downs of the capital market. There is still room to do better. This is clear, and we get there, but some things you can't change or can't change overnight, think alone of the primary life back book, and the other Torsten will show you a slide on that one.</p>
          <p>You will not see any changes from us as regards risk management. We are relatively happy with what we do there. We also there can improve and amend many things here or there, but this is what you get. What you have seen in the past you get in the future. And diversification will be very important for us. No changes here.</p>
          <p>And last remark as regards dividend, yes, continuity is important to us. I think we have the capital in place and we have the capital in place to also seize opportunities wherever they arise. I'm not so sure whether we will see many. We still see on the reinsurance side capital relief demand both life and non-life. M&amp;A we always thought this crisis is bad enough to see as the price is coming down. The fact was not much, not enough for us at least.</p>
          <p>And with that, and I would hand it over to the colleagues. They'll go into details. J&#xF6;rg will start with the financial highlight of what I would call not so bright a year. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I can confirm that &#x20AC;712 million is not a result we can be particularly be proud of, but let's call it rather satisfied in light of the circumstances.</p>
          <p>And the investment results with 3.4%, it was similar to what we can expect for 2012. Combined ratio in reinsurance impacted by nat cat, 113.6%. ERGO's consolidated result was on the level of the preceding year, but highly impacted by a couple of countervailing one-off effect like the huge write-down on the Greek bonds, the disposal gains from real estate in Singapore or from the foreign subsidiaries of DKV health insurer who sold its subsidiaries to the sister segment Munich Health, and also from the revaluation of derivatives which we had been buying over years to protect against low-interest rates environments. Munich Health's combined ratio, 99.4% and &#x20AC;45 million net result.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, you see an overview of the net results of the last eight quarters, and most importantly Q1 2011 with minus &#x20AC;948 million. This was the quarter of flood in Australia and the earthquakes in New Zealand and Japan. The fourth quarter ended with &#x20AC;632 million positive. And you can see a breakdown of it on the next slide here where we show on the left hand the results for the fourth quarter 2011. The flood in Thailand has been booked with &#x20AC;547 million. Earthquake in Christchurch, there we had to increase the reserves by &#x20AC;420 million. We could release reserves more than we did, I would like to add, but we did &#x20AC;400 million.</p>
          <p>For the investment result, there were several countervailing effects which are obvious. Then net profit affected by further one-offs negative FX effect due to the weaker euro with &#x20AC;84 million. But on the other hand, a strong tax benefit from the partial release of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of U.S. business, &#x20AC;300 million was that effect.</p>
          <p>Our capital position remains solid here, the IFRS equity. In the fourth quarter, we had an increase of &#x20AC;1.1 billion which was driven by an increase in unrealized gains and losses, and FX effect and by the consolidated result. On the lower part of that slide, you'll see a composition of our capital and our subordinated debt and a little bit of senior and other debt. And you can see that the debt leverage came down to a level of 18.3%, and this is, by the way, the reason why we can issue further hybrid debt and try to exchange the instrument view in 2013 in advance of the cancelation date.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, a short look on our local GAAP accounts, which are important, as you know, for our distribution capacity. Munich Re AG, the parent company, is the flagship of the reinsurance group with &#x20AC;23.3 billion in gross written premiums out of &#x20AC;26.5 billion total reinsurance premiums. That shows you that almost all premium income is channeled to the parent company. That means that we have a very strong underwriting income potential here at the parent level.</p>
          <p>In addition, and this underwriting income is smoothed by the existence of the equalization reserve, you are all aware of, which prove to be extremely important during the last couple of years and which served the purpose of compensating the huge losses of last year for our local GAAP account.</p>
          <p>We also have the dividends from subsidiaries. Last year, &#x20AC;520 million dividend from our U.S. subsidiaries who had a very good profitability. And since this profitability seems to be sustainable, we were able to set up the deferred tax asset there. And we also had, for the local GAAP calculation, a &#x20AC;325 million write-up on these U.S. subsidiaries.</p>
          <p>On the upper left, you see the comparison of the IFRS group result with the local GAAP result of the parent company. And in 2010, this is a typical outcome with IFRS results, &#x20AC;2.4 billion and local GAAP parent company, &#x20AC;1.4 billion. And in 2011, it's the reverse because there the huge losses from the nat cat were compensated by a reduction of the equalization reserve. That is how it should be and that is how the distributions or how our distribution capacity is shielded and is protected by the existence of the equalization reserve under German local GAAP.</p>
          <p>And by the way, one should not forget that this is tax deductible. That means it's a constant postponement of taxes, and therefore, we always emphasize that this equalization reserve adequately reflects the business model of the reinsurance therefore urgently necessary for tax purposes.</p>
          <p>Next slide on our investments, &#x20AC;207 billion investments of which 84% are invested in fixed interest securities and loans. The write-down of these &#x20AC;178 billion is shown on the right-hand side of that slide. And as you see, government and semi-government investments are the dominating factor with 48%. In the last year, we had a shift from weaker to high quality government bonds, as Nikolaus mentioned, especially those of Germany and Western European countries. As you can see also in page 108 of our booklet of today, almost 70% of our government securities are invested in U.S., German, Canadian, UK and French government bonds.</p>
          <p>We also had a significant reduction of bank bonds, and we increased our portfolio of corporate bonds. Investment results declined compared to 2010 by 22% to &#x20AC;6.75 billion. In the final quarter on the right-hand side, you see &#x20AC;1.9 billion, a very strong result plus 43% in comparison through the preceding year. In reinsurance, we even achieved a yield under reinsurance portfolio of 4.4%.</p>
          <p>The regular income was stable with 4% yield, but we had the write-downs, write-ups with a negative balance of &#x20AC;1.6 billion, of which &#x20AC;1.2 billion was due to the impairment of the Greek bonds as a result of the exchange of the bonds in these days, we do not expect a major impact on our P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>On the left-hand side, you'll see that the average reinvestment yield in the second half of 2011 was around 3%. And in the first couple of months of this year, it was even a little bit lower due to, again, the strong focus to the safe haven investments.</p>
          <p>Let's turn now to the subject of reserving. Every year, we perform an actuarial reevaluation of our entire reserving landscape. At the starting point, we compare the actual losses that have been reported to us with the actuarial expectation from one year ago. And this is shown in that graph here for the basic losses in reinsurance in 2011, underwriting year at the left and line of business at the right.</p>
          <p>If reported losses had been fully in line with expectations, then all these small points here would be on the solid line. As all data points are below the line, some significantly so, the actual losses reported to us in 2011 were consistently below the expectation. This indication gives us comfort that our reserve portfolio is in solid shape. We tend to respond to adverse indications immediately but allow favorable indications more time to manifest especially in the longer credit lines.</p>
          <p>Let me demonstrate this on the next slide. We have illustrated here the better emergence of prior year losses than anticipated across the line of business by using downward arrows. The second column shows how we have responded to this positive information. In property, we realized a favorable indication only partially and held back a significant portion. This is represented by the upward arrow. For the underwriting year 2010, we noted that the year was still too immature for releases in virtually all lines of the Reinsurance segment.</p>
          <p>We are particularly careful in longer-term engineering business that is linked to construction projects which lasts for a couple of years with a somewhat longer emergence pattern.</p>
          <p>Specialty lines comprise predominantly marine, aviation, credit and bond. Credit and bond has shown a particularly good indication in 2011. This was driven by the very favorable run-off of underwriting years 2007 and 2008. Based on the strength of these indications and given that our exposure to trade credit in these years has expired, we feel comfortable in releasing even more than the actual versus expected indication.</p>
          <p>While casualty did show very positive emergence indications, actual versus expected too, we did strengthen our overall reserve position. And that is because we tend to wait longer before we translate positive indications into reserve releases here. There were some areas like proportional U.S. motor, various continental European casualty segments and large motor quota shares where we also released reserves.</p>
          <p>But there were a number of offsetting elements here; offsetting of items, offsetting these favorable results. First, in the case of the large motor quota shares such as we have in China, we did reduce our loss estimates. However, the good news was offset by sliding scale commissions. Second, we reacted to market information that was not yet visible in our claims data, like in the U.K., that more losses have to be settled in annuities instead of lump sum payments. Third, the result was also impacted by discounting effects which overstate the impact compared to an economic view. And last and very simple, we opted to increase our provision for uncertainty, with an eye on the potential risk of an increasing inflation.</p>
          <p>The schedule on the next slide shows the run-off according to accident years. The overall run-off profit of &#x20AC;771 million, which you see on the right bottom of the slide, comes from Primary Insurance with &#x20AC;137 million, and with &#x20AC;634 million from Reinsurance of which roughly &#x20AC;400 million was booked in Q4. The run-off change shown for 2010 is driven by higher-than-anticipated business volume. On a loss-ratio basis, we do not see any worsening here.</p>
          <p>You'll find a lot of additional data in the next of &#x2013; in the backup here, on the pages 123 and following. And we have given that data because we feel that you can understand why our confidence has even increased in comparison to the last couple of years.</p>
          <p>Let me summarize, 2011 was, again, favorable in terms of prior-year loss development, with a healthy run-off profit and a further increased confidence at the same time. And we will follow our conservative approach going forward.</p>
          <p>How can that look like? Just to give you an idea, we will continue to set the reserves for a new underwriting and accident year with a more conservative stance relative to our &#x2013; compared to our pricing assumptions. As experience emerges, we would expect to realize a benefit to our earnings. So, that means reserve releases, which you can find on these types of schedules.</p>
          <p>But in a steady state, this conservatism in the reserve setting for new exposures would be offset by regular favorable emergence from prior years. So, this mechanism would then produce, in an ideal sense, a calendar year result which reflects the realistic performance. That means a little bit of an &#x2013; I wouldn't call it over reserving, but conservative reserving on one side, and like with the bow or wave or so, some reserve releases in the same calendar year. That means the two would compensate each other. As such, reserve releases would then be realized not as a temporary or unusual phenomenon, but rather as a normal event.</p>
          <p>So far with reserves, let me now move to the market-consistent embedded value. Just with a few general remarks before my colleagues, Torsten Jeworrek and Torsten Oletzky, will talk about their responsibilities here. Despite extreme market conditions and in line with our internal capital model, we have, again, adhered to a market-consistent framework.</p>
          <p>This also translates into a good track record regarding experience variances and assumption changes from the business in the recent years where we applied more or less the same methodology. We use year-end data, market data, without an early extrapolation of the yield curve, without any illiquidity premium or without allowances for the current sovereign and debt market conditions.</p>
          <p>That might look unrealistically radical, and we regard some of these smoothening elements as being also economically justifiable. So, we would not argue there. But on the other hand, as long as the Solvency II calibration has not been finalized, we think that it's better that we stick to our current calculation methodology even if it hurts, especially in Primary Insurance.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, you can see the impact. The embedded value of our Life Reinsurance business amounted to almost &#x20AC;10 billion, which is an increase of over 20% compared to 2010. This development was mainly driven by strong MCEV earnings of &#x20AC;1.5 billion, with an overall positive impact from decreasing interest rates and strong operating embedded value earnings of &#x20AC;1.1 billion with a record high new business value of &#x20AC;643 million.</p>
          <p>Our Primary Insurance also shows positive operating MCEV earnings, as you can see here in this gray area, the left part, of &#x20AC;1.3 billion. But the economic variances of minus &#x20AC;4.3 billion reflect our very conservative way of calculating the impact of the market circumstances.</p>
          <p>Not surprisingly, German Life business, with options and hard guarantees for the policyholders, was much more affected than International Life or German Health business, which was by the way rather stable. This is due to the combination of low interest rates, rise in interest rate volatilities and sovereign debt market crisis. The snapshot, as you see, is very negative because we value the liabilities and the options and guarantees as if they were fully liquid and due for total hedging at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>If we use reference rate as expected for Solvency II, we do not know them precisely enough to exactly quantify that effect. This would result in an MCEV which is up to a couple of billions higher than shown here for Primary Insurance. Please have an eye on the sensitivities in the backup to see what enormous impact there would be from application of illiquidity premium or perhaps also by a look at sensitivity of an interest rate increase of just 100 basis points.</p>
          <p>A bit more on the MCEV later from Torsten Jeworrek and Torsten Oletzky, but before, I have the pleasure to briefly talk about our youngest and smallest segment, Munich Health. Munich Health, this is all medical reinsurance business, which makes up for two-thirds of the segment, and one-third is our non-German Health Primary Insurance. Premiums went up by 19.3%, driven by reinsurance with plus, almost 30% which was due to large volume deals.</p>
          <p>Primary Insurance, we acquired in the U.S., Windsor Health Group. This is an HMO business model, which serves us as a very good platform for future growth in the United States, with a business model which better suits the requirements after the latest health reforms than our original operations. And here, we lost a lot of our business &#x2013; of our U.S. business in the form of private-fee-for-services insurance coverage. And this was also direct on the earnings.</p>
          <p>As you can see on the next slide where we show the results of Munich Health with a decline of the net results and of the technical result; a slight decline of technical results, stronger decline of net result. Net result was also impacted by negative foreign exchange effects.</p>
          <p>So far, with Munich Health, let me briefly summarize and come to the end of my part of the presentation. The earnings were somewhat resilient in 2011. And this was also due to our well-diversified investment portfolio. I always mention that we do not take very high bets. We will never be the best performer on the investment side, but I dare to say that we will never run in deep trouble there. And this is perhaps as important as the other part of the coin, or even more important if you have a well-performing insurance business.</p>
          <p>Our IFRS and local GAAP capital strength has been maintained, Jo Oechslin will now take over to lead you through the economic perspective. And our prudent reserving should protect our earnings during the next couple of years from negative surprises, to put it mildly.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. And I hand over to Jo.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, J&#xF6;rg, and hello from my side. I'll take you through the update of the economic balance sheet and the risk profile of the group in a similar way I did in the previous years. This chart is just to warm us up. I will not spend much time, because I will go in details after respective risk categories on the next slide. But this chart shows you that our risk profile has rather increased throughout the year 2011, which is not a surprise, and is driven in essence by three factors.</p>
          <p>One is business growth we have seen in the various business divisions; lower interest rates would make the exposures higher, partly on biometric risk but also on capital market risks; and lastly, sovereign debt crisis. Most &#x2013; those are the three drivers that you will hear again and again.</p>
          <p>Let me start with the insurance risks side on the P&amp;C side. We have shown this chart in the previous years, with our largest nat cat accumulation exposures. Atlantic hurricane exposures have increased year-on-year due to opportunistically taking advantage of positive pricing trends, but also due to model &#x2013; risk model updates we have performed in the year 2011, partly driven by certain updates of vendor models.</p>
          <p>In contrary to Atlantic hurricane, European storm exposures dropped because of our clear focus on profitability in a still competitive market. On the other hand, Japan earthquake exposures did rise as well because of opportunities, because increasing price trends we have seen after the earthquake a year ago.</p>
          <p>Obviously, in the year 2011, I have heard a number of comments, and I've also, myself, asked a number of questions on statistics. Is that still within the statistics that &#x2013; what we have seen in the year 2011? Some people told me, this 100-year events seem to occur every five years nowadays, and I would like to take this as an opportunity to just mention a couple of statistical facts and also then talk about how these risks have been reflected in our risk models.</p>
          <p>First of all, Munich Re manages about 35 accumulation scenarios. Those are the scenarios that I have shown you on the previous slides, those 35. And a very simple statistical fact is if you have 35 nat cat exposures &#x2013; accumulation exposures, you would very simply expect every three year a 100-year event on any on at least one of these accumulation scenarios. The chance is 15% per annum that you will see a 200-year event on one of 35 exposures. And even the likelihood of seeing two100-year events in 35 nat cat accumulation risks is still roughly 5%. So, that is just a number of all the statistical effects.</p>
          <p>So, all in all, what we have seen in terms of nat cat events equates to about a probability of 2% in one year measured in terms of our internal risk model. So, it is an unlikely event. It is about the 2% event. Or in other words, I don't like to make this reference, but I will do it because it's somewhat usual to do it, it's an about a one-in-50-year event. So, it's an event which occurs according to our models with a probability of about 2%.</p>
          <p>As you know, the year 2011 has been the most costly in terms of both economic and insured losses ever. And I'd like to point out how these events or the most costly ones have been reflected or not in our models.</p>
          <p>Clearly, the earthquake and tsunami in Japan has been well covered in our models, that's not been a surprise, similar with the storms and tornadoes in the United States. The floods in Thailand is what &#x2013; has not been referenced explicitly in our models, partly because we have not been writing these exposure in the domestic Thai market, but because these exposures partly came or mainly came through participations in non-domestic exposures. For example, in Japan treaties.</p>
          <p>And also, the earthquake in New Zealand was covered definitely in the model but not to the degree and with all the implications we have seen in this quake. And Torsten Jeworrek will go deeper into this nevertheless, and also Torsten will explore more on that. Munich Re's nat cat business has been profitable over the long term, including the catastrophic years 2005 and 2011.</p>
          <p>So much on a P&amp;C side, very briefly now on the life and health side. Our exposures have increased there due to a combination of business growth, mainly Solvency relief transactions we have, again, performed in 2011, as well as because of the lower interest rates and the ladder effect. Let me briefly explain that.</p>
          <p>Health &#x2013; life and health risks are dominated by trend risks; the trend of mortality or trend to longevity, both can be a risk depending on what we are writing. And also, long-term trend risks. And since we measure those risks in terms of the present value, in terms of what is the net worth of the risk in terms of present value, such a trend that is higher in times of lower interest rates than with higher interest rates. So, that has been leading to an increase of the respective risk capital.</p>
          <p>Briefly in terms of asset liability management, again, here, the dominating effect that we see is the even lower interest rates at year-end 2011 compared to year-end 2010. This has been leading to a lengthening of the duration, primarily in our German Primary Life business because of the guarantees. So, as interest rates fall, the duration increases. We do have an asset portfolio that mimics part of this duration increase with the receiver swaptions. So, the duration on the asset side has also been lengthened but not automatically to the same degree.</p>
          <p>We have readjusted the duration position in our Primary Insurance business. We have lengthened the duration position by about 1.2 years. In addition, we have also further lengthened the duration position on the assets side in our Reinsurance business division to compensate the certain short-duration position in our Primary Insurance business. So, we do actively steer the duration position of the entire group.</p>
          <p>On the liability side, we are making progress on redesigning products that we sell on the German Life Primary side and move towards guarantees and products that we can more easily hedge than the traditional life insurance businesses we have in Germany and are also going to be hedged in the Reinsurance business division of our group.</p>
          <p>And lastly, let me mention or come back to something I mentioned to you two or three years ago when I told you that we are entering the field of variable annuity reinsurance. And last year, Joachim Wenning, the head of our Life Re business, has been talking about this again. This business, we have been writing a certain amount of this business. The hedging of that business has been successful in the year 2011 despite extreme moves in capital markets.</p>
          <p>Another thing that we have consistently been investigating is our exposure to extreme scenarios in terms of the development of the European sovereign debt crisis. And we have particularly investigated two scenarios, which is the relief scenario that kind of translates into a transfer type union, and on the other hand, a further escalation of this crisis. And what we have seen again and again is that our positions, both assets net of liabilities, are always balanced due to different, let's say, positions that we have.</p>
          <p>For example, let us consider a relief situation. In a relief situation, safe haven yields we will expect to rise, and German and U.S. government bonds to lose value. On the other hand, we would expect some weaker sovereign bond spreads to narrow and fair value to increase. At the same time, corporate credit spread will probably come back. The euro would gain in terms of dollar, and equities will perform.</p>
          <p>And if you take all of these together and look at our position in terms of how would our AFR react, most of these effects would actually balance out, such that in such a scenario, you will not expect our available financial resources to significantly change.</p>
          <p>The same way in the other direction, we &#x2013; in a further escalation, we would expect further market value gains on our safe haven position which is, as Nikolaus showed before, about four times as much as the weaker sovereign bond spreads, which would then widen further and would create further losses. And again, everything would neutralize to a large degree.</p>
          <p>What would change, however, in these scenarios would be our risk exposure. And to a relief, we would expect the exposures to be lower and to &#x2013; into further escalation, we would expect exposures to increase further.</p>
          <p>So, we are, to a great degree, neutralized on our available financial resources, our risk capital moves. And I will come back to this point and you will see that this is precisely what happened over the past one to two years. That is exactly the moves we have already seen to a certain degree. So that's not just theory, that's actually what has happened in the past two years.</p>
          <p>Let me just say a word on investment strategy. The essence is that we will not change much. We will not &#x2013; have no intention to increase asset risks significantly. We will, however, shift cautiously away from the safe haven assets, slightly into more corporate bonds. In particular, we will look for the longer corporate bonds because we need to have duration on the asset side and we need to maintain duration on the asset side.</p>
          <p>We've also increased some positions in ABS and MBS, rather on the shorter end of the interest rate curve because the risk return profile is deemed to be more attractive there. We are also envisaging a careful further diversification into real assets such as renewable energy and infrastructure. Equity quota will likely remain low.</p>
          <p>That brings me to the standard disclosure of the risk capital. And I have said it already, our economic risk capital, our exposures have increased. It is &#x20AC;24.4 billion versus &#x20AC;20.7 billion a year ago. Property and casualty has increased. Life and health risk has increased, I've been talking about this. Market risk has increased, mainly by the lower interest rates and since we are further and closer to the guarantees in our Primary Life business. Credit risks have increased because of the downgrades of many sovereign debt positions and the higher spreads, so the risk perception has changed. Diversification is in the same relation to the simple sum of risks, so nothing has changed there. We're still about at the 30%, diversification, that is taken away from the simple sum.</p>
          <p>That's the main overview in terms of economic risk capital. That is the slide on market risks and how we &#x2013; how market risks are breaking down into the individual components. Equity risks, you would expect them to decrease because the equity-backing ratio has been further reduced from 4.4% to 2.0% at year-end 2011. Interest rate risk has increased because of the convexity of the liabilities. And the fact that we are nearer to the guarantees, there is still a very high diversification between interest rate risk on the Primary Insurance side and the Reinsurance side.</p>
          <p>That is what Nikolaus has been mentioning before. It's the &#x20AC;3 billion diversification. I've mentioned that many times in this Analyst Conference. This is more than diversification, this &#x20AC;3 billion. It appears on the diversification, but it is not a random diversification. It is, if interest rates go down, we will benefit on the Reinsurance side and we will have a disadvantage on the Primary Insurance side. So, it's not random. It's more than diversifications offsetting exposures, and we have maintained that.</p>
          <p>The DV01 has increased. It was almost neutral at year-end 2010. It is now &#x20AC;11.7 million per basis point positive. That means every basis point increase, parallel increase of all interest rate curves, in particular, euro, dollar, Canada dollar, British pound, will add an AFR of approximately &#x20AC;11.7 million.</p>
          <p>Well, that's basically it on the market risk. In terms of ERC development, this chart shows you the main drivers, which is life and health risks, about &#x20AC;1 billion increase; market risk, &#x20AC;2 billion increase; and credit risk. There is also model changes, again, we have been introducing at the year-end 2011, which is primarily around the valuation of the hedging instruments that we have improved, which was too conservative actually before. So, the hedging impact of these instruments are higher than what we previously have modeled.</p>
          <p>And this brings me to an assessment of how the AFR and our economic strength has changed in the course of the year 2011. We started the year with &#x20AC;31.2 billion AFR, we'll come back to that number briefly, and have capital management measures of &#x20AC;1.7 billion, which is in a sense &#x20AC;1.1 billion dividend paid in 2011 for 2010 and another &#x20AC;600 million of share buybacks.</p>
          <p>And then, we have an economic loss, you know what I mean with that, so a change of mark-to-market of all assets and all liabilities over the year, of &#x20AC;1.2 billion, which brings us to the available financial resources of &#x20AC;28.3 billion at the end of the year 2011. The economic loss of &#x20AC;1.2 billion this year compares to an economic gain of &#x20AC;3.6 billion in the year 2010.</p>
          <p>The right-hand side, as usual, shows you how this relates to the overall risk distribution of our group. As you can see from the chart, the economic loss of &#x20AC;1.2 billion represents roughly a one-in-seven-year event or has a probability, in other words, of about 14% to occur. It is still far away from our ERC event, right? Our ERC event will be &#x20AC;24.4 billion and would coincide with a return period of about 2,000 years. So, what has happened in a disastrous year 2011, is far away from our risk capital that we quantify, and is a &#x2013; yes, I think that's the point here.</p>
          <p>Let me briefly come back to the &#x20AC;31.2 billion, that includes the restatement of the available financial resources, the number we have shown you for year-end 2010. And it's also on a further page, you will see, it has been &#x20AC;29.6 billion. What we have done is we have previously assessed the P&amp;C reserves on the basis of management peak of a best estimate. We have now changed to an actuarial peak of the reserves.</p>
          <p>And why have we done that? That is primarily because our confidence into the reserves have further increase throughout the year 2011, as J&#xF6;rg pointed out previously. The reason is that, essentially, in terms of the IFRS equity, the management's best estimate includes a certain prudency &#x2013; the management's best estimate peak includes a certain prudency.</p>
          <p>In terms of AFR and the comparison to the economic risk capital, we do have the prudency in our economic risk capital, because the economic risk capital includes unfavorable development of reserves. And we want to avoid a double counting of prudency, and this is why we have done this change now with the increased confidence on our reserving level.</p>
          <p>This slide shows you a breakdown on how the economic loss of &#x20AC;1.2 billion is composed. The biggest driver of this, no surprise, is the interest rate development, which has contributed about minus &#x20AC;2 billion. And I'll, in the interest of time, not go further into this slide.</p>
          <p>This brings us to the summary that we use to illustrate the economic solvency ratio. We have &#x20AC;28.3 billion AFR and &#x20AC;24.4 billion of economic risk capital. After the payment of the dividend in 2012 for the year 2011, that leaves us with a buffer of &#x20AC;2.8 billion, which corresponds to a ratio of 111%. Not counting the dividend, just the pure year-end view, that will bring us to a ratio of 116%.</p>
          <p>On a Solvency II calibration level, so not including the 1.75 factor we add on the Solvency II capital, this will correspond to a ratio of 194%. Again, determined based on our internal model and not on the standard formula.</p>
          <p>The sensitivities have also in part been explained by Nikolaus. The sensitivity of a further decrease of interest rates is the most unfortunate in this list. However, if you look at a further decline of interest rates by 100 basis points, this would essentially bring you to zero, at least, on the short end in euro. In fact, in the dollar, it would actually bring you below zero in the first couple of years.</p>
          <p>So, that is &#x2013; I would say, the 100 basis point interest rate stress to the downside is at the &#x2013; on the edge of what is still a reasonable stress assumption. We have still taken that to provide an easy sensitivity.</p>
          <p>And let me remind you about how these economic solvency ratios should be assessed. Internally, we have &#x2013; as you know, we have a calibration of 1.75, and our ERC represents 1.75, the Solvency II calibration. And internally, we have a number of intervention levels, and that is at 100%, where we say between 100% and 120%, we view that as a comfortable level of capitalization; between 80% and 100%, we would still view that as adequate capitalization. Our intervention level internally is at 80%. 80% still corresponds to a Solvency II ratio of 140%.</p>
          <p>So, the SCR breach would then be another 40 percentage points lower at 100%. And the MCR is in the order of magnitude between 35%, 40%, 45%. So, our management intervention ladder is much higher consistently than the regulatory intervention level because we actually multiply our capital requirement by 1.75.</p>
          <p>And let me, in the light of this, just briefly reflect on what has changed in the industry and in the capital markets since the last QIS exercise we had, and that was QIS5 which was based on year-end 2009. And this chart actually shows you that the risk shocks that have been determined in QIS5 have actually almost materialized over the two years since year-end 2009. And I know, the risk shocks in QIS5 are meant to be annual shocks and they have now materialized in two years, yet they have materialized. And you can see that on four individual risk factors; interest rate, equity, spread risks and interest rate volatility risk, which is actually not covered in the standard formula.</p>
          <p>Can I ask the question, what does that do to Munich Re and to the industry? We have done a back-of-the-envelope calculation, which is very simple for you to reproduce. We have taken QIS5 data and the own funds or the available financial resources after industry as disclosed in QIS5, and we have applied the shocks that have been factored in QIS5 and we have determined what the own funds will be. And our estimate is that they will be about 50% lower than at year-end 2009.</p>
          <p>Obviously, against this, there is a number of countercyclical elements that will be factored into the valuation of the liabilities, countercyclical premium or matching premium or extrapolation. And we actually view, as J&#xF6;rg said, parts of them to be reasonable in the economic circumstances we have. And that will bring the own funds or the AFR up a little bit, and that is meant by this red bar. And we don't know how much that will actually do.</p>
          <p>If you look at Munich Re on the right-hand side of this chart, without any of the countercyclical measures, our AFR has only dropped by 6% over the two years, rather than a further drop that you could expect from this QIS5. And that is despite a total capital repatriation of &#x20AC;3.8 billion in the two years, only 6% decline.</p>
          <p>And that, in my view, is an illustration of the sensitivity to the extreme scenarios I have been outlining before. I've told you that none of the extreme scenarios would move the AFR significantly because of our positions of safe haven and weaker sovereign of our currency position, et cetera. And I think that proves the resilience of the available financial resources.</p>
          <p>Let me also, on this chart, remind you where our risk model distinguishes itself from other capital models used in the industry. And there are essentially four points that are relevant. First of all is the discounting of the liabilities. We have used the swap rate. J&#xF6;rg has illustrated why we have done that.</p>
          <p>We do have a comprehensive coverage of risk. We have risk capital charges for government bonds, which is not going to be the case in the standard formula. We have risk charges for implied volatility risks in our model.</p>
          <p>We do model tail events. We do assume that if one thing goes sour, the chances of another thing going sour at the same time is higher. And we do consider fungibility restrictions. That means if we have a shortfall in one legal entity or in one part of the group, it may not be easy to move the capital to another part of the group. All of these things are considered.</p>
          <p>And that brings us, and that is this bar on the right side, to the situation where we use this 1.7 factor &#x2013; 1.75 factor between the value-at-risk 99.5% and our capital aspiration, which is supposed to mimic a AA capital aspiration.</p>
          <p>So, that factor is 175%. That factor is much lower if you would apply a normal distribution instead of the heavy tail probability distributions that we use. The factor for a normal distribution will be 1.3. And in essence, a number of our peers are considerably lower than our factor of 1.75. So, I think that is important factors to consider when you assess our capital requirement and our economic solvency.</p>
          <p>A number of changes &#x2013; we may undergo a number of changes in anticipation of Solvency II. For example, we may adopt the interest rate curve as determined by EIOPA. Once it is out, we may actually, in our internal model, model the mitigating effect taxes have on the risk capital. We may actually change the fungibility modeling based on what Solvency II is requiring. In all of these three cases, our economic risk capital would fall and our economic solvency ratio would rise. These changes have not yet been decided. We will still see what we do with our internal model. But potentially, if we did it, this would have positive implications.</p>
          <p>In the interest of time, I will not go into the Solvency II chart I have here because we can also do that offline and have a discussion on this offline. To summarize, we have lots of continuity in the risk profile, strong capital position maintained despite challenging market environments, essentially driven by a lot of offsetting positions we have on the asset and on the liability side where we have gains on one, losses on the other hand, the whole thing is stable. Economic solvency ratio is resilient to withstand further stresses. We have maintained a liability-driven investment approach. And we are I think well underway in preparation of Solvency II. It's the last year of our pre-application of model approval, and we expect the model approval process to take place in the year 2013. That's what I wanted to say.</p>
          <p>With that, I like to hand over to you, Christian.</p>

          <p>Well, thank you, gentlemen, for your presentations. We will now take a 30-minute break, and we'll start again at 1:30 sharp also in the interest of those people following the conference from their offices via Internet. Thank you.</p>
          <p>[Break]</p>
          <p>So let's start with the second part. I'll hand it over to Torsten Oletzky.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, a warm welcome from my side as well. The year 2011 was a rather difficult year for ERGO for the Primary Insurance division of Munich Re. We had to deal with the capital markets we have heard quite a bit about before, and obviously, the primary insurance market is even more vulnerable to the capital markets. We have the European sovereign debt crisis which took its toll on the numbers of ERGO. And we had in Germany a series of negative press articles, which had an impact on at least the sales and distribution side of the German business. Given that difficult environment, I believe that ERGO has mastered that situation overall relatively well and that we cannot be too euphoric about that the results are okay for that situation.</p>
          <p>When we look at the premium development, the top line for ERGO for 2011, we have a more or less a stable premium income. The growth &#x2013; or the gross written premium is just below 1%. And if we eliminate the foreign exchange effect, which is mainly coming from Turkey with about two-thirds of the FX effect and Poland, one-third of the FX effect, then the organic change is around 1.2%. The total premium including unit-linked and capitalization products grew from &#x20AC;19.15 billion to &#x20AC;19.25 billion, being a plus of 0.5%, so that plus would be a bit smaller. That is no surprise because in the capital environment &#x2013; capital markets environment, the unit-linked products as well as capitalization products were not that much in demand.</p>
          <p>The Life Insurance segment, and you can see that split on the right-hand side of the slide, had decline in premium of 3.4%. And on the German side, the decline was even more significant. We had a decline of premium of 5.2%, while on the international life side, we had a growth in premium of 2%. Health Insurance grew by 4% to &#x20AC;5.7 billion. And the P&amp;C business grew by 2.5%. We had almost identical growth on the German as well as on the international side in P&amp;C. In Germany, there was a plus of 2.4%, in the international, a plus of 2.7%. On the international side of the P&amp;C, you have once again to take into account the FX effect and deconsolidation effect from a sale of a unit in Portugal I will talk about later. So if you take these things out, it would have been a growth of 4% of the P&amp;C business internationally.</p>
          <p>On this slide, you'll see the different result components for 2011. I would &#x2013; I like to highlight the following aspects. The increase in total result from &#x20AC;656 million to &#x20AC;762 million is a bit misleading. The result is before consolidation within the primary insurance segments. Therefore, the view on the consolidated results of ERGO Insurance Group is a much better indicator for the real result. And that number was more or less exactly stable at a level of &#x20AC;349 million for 2011 after &#x20AC;355 million for 2010.</p>
          <p>A major influence on the 2011 results came from the investment results, obviously, which were significantly down. Reason, of course, the impairments of Greek government bonds, which is a gross effect of more than &#x20AC;1 billion and had a net effect on result of more &#x2013; just more than &#x20AC;200 million. And we also had a much lower unrealized result from the unit-linked insurance, a swing of around &#x20AC;500 million, but that has no effect on the bottom line.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we had positive effects from the sale of the international health companies to Munich Health. We heard that in the presentation before and the sale of a real estate in Singapore, both transactions we would have done in 2011, anyhow, so that these things compensate for the losses on the Greek sovereign debt is more by accident. The effect on result is not investment alone, of course. A bit later in the presentation, you will see that we had a somewhat higher combined ratio, especially in the German P&amp;C business, and that has had its effect on our results as well. I will give you some more information when we look at the results of the three primary insurance sub-segments later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>I would like to take you, before we look at the sub-segments, through the economic numbers and show you the economic picture for 2011. As expected, this does not look good at all. The change in the MCEVs should not surprise you, though, anybody who is familiar with the above market consistent methodology and it is pure market consistent knows that given the developments in interest rates and volatilities, that there had to be a significant negative effect. This is, of course, due to the economic variances that is on this slide, explanation number 3. Having in mind how the interest rates went down, especially in Germany and implied volatilities went up plus the bond impairment on Greece, which are reflected in the economic calculations as well, this development should have been expected.</p>
          <p>I would like to stress once more that we still apply the pure market consistent criteria. We have no liquidity premiums or possible reactions of supervisors modeled in our models so that we do believe that this is helpful in steering the business but that does not exactly reflect the economic reality. There are more &#x2013; two more effects, I would like to briefly touch on. The experience variances, you see on here a plus of &#x20AC;357 million. This is mainly coming with &#x20AC;327 million from our German Life business. And I would mention, first and foremost, our efforts regarding asset liability management here. You've seen an increase in duration and fine-tuning of asset allocation for Victoria Life. You know that we have closed this company for a new business and that gave us a chance to adjust the asset allocation there. Other aspects were lower than expected expenses as well as a favorable development in the lapse rate.</p>
          <p>For the international life business, there was a small negative effect in this area of close to &#x20AC;50 million, which was due to deviations on the left side, contract persistency side in Belgium. The German health business in this aspect contributed positively. The health business is also responsible for the bulk of the assumption changes. You see the assumption changes under remark number two with a total of &#x20AC;335 million. &#x20AC;310 million out of this &#x20AC;335 million are coming from the health business. This is a result of a review and adaptation of best estimate assumptions such as mortality, lapses, expenses and claims, so that helped the MCEV with around &#x20AC;300 million.</p>
          <p>Let me now come to the numbers of the individual segments, starting with the Life Insurance segment. In Life, the net result is down to &#x20AC;113 million. Main reason is the investment result. And here, the impairments on Greek government bonds, the bulk of these impairments occurred in the Life Insurance segment. And the effects which were on the group level against these impairments like the sale of the Singapore real estate and the sale of the health insurance companies obviously did not help the Life segment. Therefore, the negative effect on investment result in Life is especially significant. One thing that helped the Life Insurance segment is our hedging program with swaption notes that delivered a strong positive result with a plus of &#x20AC;288 million compared to the year before. And that once again cannot surprise because those effects, which depress the economics numbers help the hedging program, low interest rates and higher volatilities.</p>
          <p>Other effects worth mentioning here are an increase of debt impairments by about &#x20AC;100 million, reducing the technical result in Life. This effect is due to the influence of low interest rates on gross margins and a release from tax provisions amounting to &#x20AC;38 million in the other section, which drove the IFRS tax rate for the life insurance sub-segment close to zero.</p>
          <p>Let us then have a look on the development of new business in life insurance. The trends are more or less the same for the German as well as for the international business, a slight increase in regular premium business compared to 2010 and a decline in single premium business. When you add these two effects up in annual premium equivalent, the new business is more or less exactly on the level of the 2010 numbers.</p>
          <p>Both developments are in line &#x2013; or both developments at ERGO are in line with the developments in the relevant markets. In Germany, the change compared to 2010 is a bit more significant in both directions. The plus in regular premiums is a bit bigger than in international with plus 6%. And the decline in single premium is also a bit more significant than in international with a minus of 9.6%.</p>
          <p>The number in international, obviously, is an average across a number of different markets with different developments. And especially in Austria, we had a stronger decline with a minus of 23%, which has to do with tax regulation. And we had markets like Belgium and Poland where we had strong growth, but in total, the new business on international is on the 2010 level. We do see some of the more important international markets in Life Insurance for ERGO on this slide, Belgium with a very positive development in recent years, not just in 2011. We have also good new business margins for the Life Insurance business in Belgium. About 65% of that business is regular premium, only 35% coming from single premium. And we are selling this business in Belgium via multilevel distribution and to a smaller extent, the broker channel and some smaller cooperations.</p>
          <p>Austria was very difficult in Life Insurance for us in 2011 because the tax rules were changed. You now have to hold a life insurance for 15 years instead of before 10 years to get tax benefits. And obviously, this has a direct impact on new business volume in the market and also on us on our business in Austria. We did as you probably know, we have two major partners in Austria. The one is UniCredit Bank Austria, the other one are the Austrian ForEx bank mutual banks. And the mutual banks were our partner in the insurance business, but in 2011, we bought their share in the insurance business from them for Austria as well as for some Eastern European markets where we cooperate with them as well.</p>
          <p>In the other markets, we had some nice developments, mainly coming from our cooperations with UniCredit Bank in Poland as well as in other Eastern European markets. An important aspect for us is in Life Insurance the economic situation. As I've said before, we are all aware that the economic figures do not look good, but we do feel that the pure MCEV methodology over states things to a certain degree. One thing we have done in the past, which was in years like 2011, working to our favor is a hedging program. We have started that in 2005, and we have bought protection against very low interest rates. In the longer term, I have learned that this scenario is called lower for longer. And we are protected by the hedging program we have here for over 10 years. We are protecting ourselves with different financial instruments, and we are also trying to buy some protection against rising insurance rates against with CMS floaters.</p>
          <p>These are measures for the existing book of business. Of course, we are also thinking about the new business. One change in the German life business in 2012 is a new maximum guaranty level, so guarantees are now at 1.75% instead of 2.25%. Therefore, every new policy written contributes to lowering the average guarantee on the book of business, but you could still argue that even 1.75% on a very long-term basis with the volatility and the very low interest rates we have is too much. We are, therefore, discussing new guarantee concepts together with all our colleagues from Life Reinsurance and our colleagues from Munich. And we are planning to launch a new product, which goes away from the classical way of doing German life insurance mid-next year.</p>
          <p>The next segment I would like to look with you at is our Health segment, which compromises the German health business, international, as Jorg Schneider presented at Munich Re. We already as well as the travel business of Europ&#xE4;ische Reiseversicherung, ERV, and the results you see here combine classical health insurance as well as the travel insurance. The picture looks a bit better than it is here because these numbers include the positive effect from the sale of the international companies, mainly in Belgium and Spain to the colleagues at Munich Re. That sale includes the investment result by close to &#x20AC;200 million. And it compensated in the Health segment for the impairments we had on Greek bonds. Therefore, the investment result in Health looks significantly better than it did in life insurance. The net effect of that sale was &#x20AC;116 million, so the growth you see on the net result here does come from this special effect.</p>
          <p>In the Health segment, we had a new business development in comprehensive insurance, which was up by 18.4%, so that does look very good. We did have support like the entire health insurance industry from a change in legislation, meaning the abolition of a three-year waiting period for private comprehensive health insurance. And this is one case example for the effects of political decisions. And these political decisions frequently affect especially the Health Insurance segment. This case, the change was to our benefit, but, of course, there is also always a political risk of negative impacts on this business.</p>
          <p>The increase in comprehensive, which already is good at 18%, would have been even bigger if we not had given up certain low price tariffs in mid-2011. We did believe that these type of low price comprehensive insurance are not good in the longer term, not good for the supplier, for the health insurance company but also not good for the customer due to the limited coverage of health risks. And we decided to discontinue this line of products. And we feel that this was the best thing to do, and that Generali followed us just a few weeks later with the same decision, might also underline that this was the right decision, but obviously, it does make business for our sales force a bit more difficult. So the plus could have been even bigger with another strategy.</p>
          <p>Not so good, looks the number on supplementary health insurance, a new business. This is a minus of 30%, but it's affected by just one single contract with a size of more than &#x20AC;60 million, which is included in the 2010 numbers. If you would eliminate this one single contract from the numbers, they would have been a plus of 13% for the supplementary business. And that is the real result of what the sales force did, and we can been very happy with this number. So the new business on supplementary, even though it looks a bit awkward on this picture, was better than it looks.</p>
          <p>We did introduce a new product last year, which led to an intense discussion in the German market. We did introduce a product, which was after the event, which we had not seen in the German health insurance market so far. We did this in the area of dental insurance. And we are still experimenting with this product via our direct channel. We have not given this to the agencies so far because we want to learn about this product first before we really push that. We have only sold 17,000 policies so far. And the developments we see when it comes to the claims ratio are more or less in the range of the business case.</p>
          <p>Individual claims are a bit higher than calculated, but claims frequency is lower than calculated, so that has turned out well. And it's another sign that we, being one of the large, really large players in the health insurance segment are also among the most innovative players in health insurance.</p>
          <p>Let me now come to the property and casualty sub-segment of primary insurance in Munich Re. This segment keeps performing well but not as well as it did before even though you see an increase of net results here. This increase in net results comes from lower goodwill impairments we had compared to 2010. In 2010, we had a significant goodwill impairment on the Turkish business. Technical result is somewhat higher. There was an improvement on the international business but also a decline on the German business. And that we will see on the following slides a bit better.</p>
          <p>When we look at the combined ratios, you'll see that the combined ratio overall Germany plus international business has increased to 97.8%. You know that our ambition is to stay in the longer term average below 95%, so for the second year in a row, we are above that mark. Germany is still below the 95% mark, but it had seen an increase of 3 percentage points to 93.1%. This is mainly due to local or regional weather events compared to the events Torsten Jeworrek has to deal with. Our storms called Achim, Bert and Frank are quite small, but for a primary insurance business, you can still see them in the combined ratios.</p>
          <p>We also had a couple of larger claims in liability insurance. But that is the volatility you should expect in such a business. And when I look at the overall result, 93.1%, most of our larger German competitors would probably still take that combined ratio with a big smile. For us, it just means that it's worse than the year before. On the other hand, we are relatively confident that the fundamentals of our business have not changed so that once claims come back to the longer-term averages, we will see better combined ratios in Germany once again. The combined ratio in the international business came out at 105%, meaning a reduction of 2.8 percentage points. This goes in the right direction. But to be honest, the improvement is smaller than it was planned. So I could not say that we are really satisfied with this number. We should have seen a larger improvement in 2011.</p>
          <p>Let me now go real quick in the breakdown, first for the German and then for the international business. As those of you who follow Munich Re and ERGO a bit longer know, we do have a portfolio mix in the P&amp;C &#x2013; primary P&amp;C business, which is different from the market in Germany. We have less motor. We have more personal accident, but we have also within the different lines of the business, a combined ratio, which are better than market average with two exceptions.</p>
          <p>The exceptions are motor and homeowners. In these lines of business, we suffered together with the market, just that our market share is smaller than that of our competitors and smaller than our market share in other lines of business. It is a constant struggle with our sales partners to convince them that we should also improve our performance in these lines of business because they obviously argue that as long as we have combined ratios in the low 90s, we should not be too pushy on improvement numbers on individual lines of business, but we are not willing to tolerate a 112% in motor or a combined ratio in homeowners, which is also significant. It's included in fire, but it's also above 110%. So there's definitely something we have to do about these two lines of business, but overall, we are still very happy with our German P&amp;C business. And we're very confident that this business will continue to produce excellent results in the upcoming years.</p>
          <p>The international business does show some first signs of recovery. This slide gives you an overview about the most important market for us, Turkey and Poland. I will not talk about on this slide because we have extra slides for these two markets. Besides Turkey, South Korea is our second problem with a combined ratio of 118%. Like Turkey, it's a market with a high dependency on motor insurance and with significant regulatory environments trying to keep motor insurance cheap for the population of Korea, and that makes business so difficult.</p>
          <p>We are working on this problem, but the number for 2011 is still not favorable. On the other hand, a business like the business in the Netherlands performs very well. Netherlands is our largest legal expense insurance business under the brand of DAS. And a combined ratio of 90% for such a business is just excellent but also, the other legal expense businesses performed very well so that on this group of businesses, we have combined ratio significantly below 100%.</p>
          <p>One transaction I would like to mention briefly that's sale of our Portuguese P&amp;C business. This unit was border line over the last few years, and we were happy to sell this business at a reasonable price. The market did not look too attractive to us. And we were just too small to turn this business around in that market.</p>
          <p>Definitely, one issue which is bothering us significantly and has been bothering us over two, three years now is the situation in our Turkish company. We have done quite a bit here. The team has implemented a series of measures, tariff improvements, price increases, working on claims processes, but in the end, the result is still on the level of 2010. It looked for a while as if the combined ratios would be significantly better than 2010, but then we had a regulatory discussion in the fourth quarter. We had to transfer reserves at levels above what we had booked to a kind of a state pool so that we came out with a very bad combined ratio for quarter four, which is from a reserving net from business written at that time, and the overall combined is still above 130%. So basically, we are one year behind our plan in turning around that business. And it does mean that in 2012, we will have to see significant improvement if we want to continue this.</p>
          <p>The good news on international turnaround comes from Poland. This business has developed very well. We have managed the turnaround here. We are below the 100% combined ratio mark again, even if the margin is small with 99.6%, but besides turning profitability around, it's also a business which has grown very well. We have now more than &#x20AC;1 billion of premium in Poland in total, &#x20AC;820 million coming from the P&amp;C business and the remaining close to &#x20AC;200 million coming from the Life business.</p>
          <p>We have a very strong position, especially on the P&amp;C side, being the number two behind the former state-owned PZU. And we have decided when there was an option to buy a significant player in the market that we stay away from that because we feel that in Poland, we are strong enough to continue growing out of our own strength, and that this unit really is in a position to be one of the winners in the ERGO International portfolio.</p>
          <p>That leads me to my short personal summary. The IFRS result for 2011 was satisfactory under the given market conditions, but economic earnings development indicates significant further challenges. Obviously, larger challenges we have in life and health insurance, we have to safeguard our existing business here and adapt business models to a changing environment, especially to capital market environments on the health side, also to changing political environments. And on the P&amp;C side, we are happy with the German business even though 2011 looked worse than the years before, but we are absolutely certain that we are on right track here. On the international side, we really have to prove that we are able to continue the turnaround, and then I am absolutely positive that in total, the P&amp;C business should be able to get below the 95 percentage point mark on combined ratio again.</p>
          <p>And with that, I turn it over to Torsten Jeworrek. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Reinsurance, before I go into the details, to manage your expectation, I have a bit a more comprehensive presentation. So it will take me some while to lead you through.</p>
          <p>I start with reinsurance general overview &#x2013; sorry, overview premium first. What happened? In life and non-life together, we had a very significant volume increase from 23.6% to 26.5%, which is 12.3%. To be quite honest, we didn't expect it. One year before &#x2013; one year ago, we didn't plan for it. And we can, however, explain why that happened. The growth was achieved completely by organic growth, no acquisitions, nothing at all and without giving up any of our profit requirements, which is very important particularly for the non-life business.</p>
          <p>Life first, what happened here? Very extraordinary growth by 21.5%, &#x20AC;9.6 billion, premium now non-life reinsurance. I come to the reasons in detail. The story is very unchanged. We could benefit from the natural growth in the Asian market in the traditional life reinsurance business. And in addition to that, the demand for large transactions &#x2013; capital relief transactions was ongoing, and they predominantly produced this growth.</p>
          <p>On the P&amp;C side, and here I repeat that this growth was not planned. Why do I repeat it? Because we all know that 2011 was still a quite competitive market environment in non-life. If I leave for a minute the cat events and their consecutive price changes away, then most markets were under rate pressure. And therefore, it's, of course, a sort of surprise even for us that we could achieve this premium growth in P&amp;C. How was it achieved? First of all and you could read it from our presentation &#x2013; the new presentation last July, we took advantage of the catastrophes, of course, and also, following rate increases, particularly in the non-proportional business.</p>
          <p>Then we wrote quite some additional motor business, motor volume, particularly in the U.K. market and to very few other markets. Here we benefited from our proportional participations. And then third, there was additional demand for large solvency relief transactions and here particularly in China. And they contributed the triple-digit million amount for non-life. So the rest of the portfolio, if I leave all these developments, these sort of extraordinary developments aside, was unspectacular. There was a flat rate environment. And we managed well through the cycle. That means without these developments, we would probably have shown a flat or even reducing premium volume in non-life.</p>
          <p>I now come to the segments, P&amp;C first and now looking at the IFRS results. Here you can see both significant reduction in the net result and in the technical result. Both deteriorations are a direct consequence of the series of catastrophe events, which occurred in 2011. I come back to this nat cat topic a bit later. I would, however, remark already now that it's good news that the underlying performance, that means if we smoothen out the cat events, is still on a very decent, very profitable level. The investment results, which you see here in the bottom part have slightly deteriorated, but we are still pleased with that result considering the difficult and challenging market environment.</p>
          <p>Before I come to the combined ratio view, I would like to highlight one very positive development and that effects our U.S. P&amp;C operation, which is the traditional reinsurance business of Munich Re America, our Hartford Steam Boiler operation and our American Modern, our specialty insurance. Premium volume from these three entities together grew by 4.7 percentage point, which is not so spectacular, and particularly, for Munich Re America we have even some extraordinary impact here in this development, intra-group sessions fronting activities.</p>
          <p>Net profit is more remarkable. Here Munich Re America contributed &#x20AC;346 million. And that includes, of course, the negative impact from the tornado series and Hurricane Irene. We had positive development from the reserve, but these reserve developments &#x2013; and Jorg Schneider mentioned it correctly, which we tried to keep on a very prudent level, even these reserve developments did not lead to the positive picture. Why? Because they were not even sufficient to compensate fully for the impact of large losses from these events.</p>
          <p>We had then in the &#x20AC;1.1 billion, which you see here, a few one-off items. One is our investment result, which was &#x20AC;140 million better than 2010, driven by capital gains. And then, J&#xF6;rg Schneider mentioned it, the tax benefit of &#x20AC;360 million. Even if you take these extraordinary impacts out, I think and we think that the total net profit, which we show here, is on a very, very good level. Total combined ratio from these three operations was now at 91.6%.</p>
          <p>Now, the combined ratio for the Munich Re Group, Non-Life Group, here, you see of course 113.6% driven by the nat cat events, by the cat events, particularly the earthquakes, which contributed 28.8%. The combined ratio in Q4 was 101.8%. Here, you see particularly the figure from flood in Thailand and from the reserve increase for the New Zealand earthquake. On deposit, on the other side, positive reserve developments by &#x20AC;600 million, which improved the combined ratio by four percentage points.</p>
          <p>Again, there are no plans to change our reserving practice. We keep our methods, our approach to set prudent results in place. You see that also &#x2013; or you get that also as an indication when you look where we release our reserve, and particularly the short tail lines and the specialty lines, it means those segments which are already very certain in terms of the calculation. So, in other words, we release reserves on a very high certainty.</p>
          <p>Here's now a breakup, a split of the combined ratio into man-made losses, nat cat loss ratio and the underlying basic loss ratio. What can we see here? Man-made losses in the lower part of the picture, is pretty stable over time. These are losses which we begin to measure at the size of more than &#x20AC;10 million from Munich Re. So, single-risk losses, larger than &#x20AC;10 million from Munich Re. This development fluctuates a bit but is pretty stable, maybe even slightly reduced. Nat cat ratio cost volatility in 2011 and the underlying basic loss ratio was pretty stable even on a very good and profitable level, which is in our opinion, a very good reflection of Munich Re's ambition in the cycle management.</p>
          <p>When you look into the underlying basic loss ratio, it shows even in a cyclic &#x2013; in a competitive cycle some sort of improvement. Where do we stand now in terms of the nat cat losses, which occurred in 2011, first the Earthquake Japan, which occurred about one year ago, &#x20AC;1.5 billion for Munich Re. So, loss reserve is unchanged. What happened within this loss reserve of course still uncertainty. Good news is that the earlier concern we had in respect of the contribution of contingent business interruption losses, that means indirectly caused business interruption losses because of failing suppliers.</p>
          <p>So, this pocket &#x2013; this part of the loss estimation did not materialize or has not materialized so far. So, it's one year after the earthquake now when we &#x2013; I'm pretty confident that the CBI loss will not materialize for that event or if only then to a smaller extent. That means that is good news that it seems that we hear in respect of this loss reserve more in the conservative side. Is it already time to release the loss reserves? No, not yet. When you look back at other earthquake events for instance Northridge in the United States, 1994, it takes quite a while until we get the full picture, a reliable picture of the ultimate loss.</p>
          <p>Earthquake New Zealand, in the meantime all the &#x20AC;1.5 billion, and here we decided to increase the loss by more than &#x20AC;400 million in Q4 2011. Why? First of all, there were some extraordinary and surprising developments by global clients. So, by non-New Zealand and non-Australian clients where one client more than doubled, their ground up loss estimate.</p>
          <p>And then on the other hand, there are local developments after that earthquake and they come from the complexity of the event. The liquefaction part of the earthquake event caused more structural losses than originally anticipated or expected. And then we see an increasing influence of the local New Zealand policy here. Meaning there are discussions underway should you rebuild certain districts here or there that delays all the loss settlement. Then there are proposals and discussions underway whether into what extent the new buildings should be built on a higher &#x2013; on a better building code. The question is then who pays for that. The insurance industry says, "Okay, we have only an obligation to pay on the basis of the old assumed time where you are not repaying higher building codes. So here, discussion is underway which most likely, in our opinion, increased the loss for the market further.</p>
          <p>And the last loss contract in the fourth quarter, the Thailand flood. Our loss estimate stands at &#x20AC;540 million, J&#xF6;rg Schneider mentioned it. And we had already discussions during the lunch break, why is it not a higher figure? There are discussions in the market that as market loss does increase, why does it not affect the Munich Re? Or should it affect the Munich Re? Of course, we carefully looked into that. And I cannot tell that our &#x20AC;540 million is a conservative or a precise figure. There's a lot of uncertainty in that loss event, I admit it. So, it's a young event. There's development ongoing.</p>
          <p>But then we look into the details, where should our loss come from. And here, you have to see we are hardly represented in the local Thailand market. For price reasons, already in the years before, we have withdrawn from that market our market share in the local market, very, very small. So, there's hardly any contribution to that event.</p>
          <p>Then, we have the two pockets, one is Singapore and the other one is the local Japanese market who insured all these risks in Thailand as interests brought. I'll start with Singapore. In the Singapore market, we have a few proportional treaties and otherwise mainly for risk excess of loss treaties. And there's a non-proportional for risk treaties, you can of course make reasonable calculations how much could be affected and we fully reserve these treaties, including the reinstatements which could be affected.</p>
          <p>Then in the local Japanese markets with Munich Re, it's a proportional write-off cost. But here, we have high proportional participations in the earthquake treaties, in the proportional earthquake treaties. Japan splits the proportional sections between earthquake and fire. So, flood is reinsured under the fire treaties.</p>
          <p>Munich Re has only small participations in the local fire business. And we have hardly any participation in the interests abroad treaties. So, that means we can ring fence. We can, so to speak, make estimations for our loss to a reasonable extent without saying that this is a precise figure. What is our biggest question mark regarding Thailand? It's the biggest question mark like Japan one year ago is contingent business interruption. So, that means we cannot exclude now that suppliers which deliver their goods to Europe or to the United States that they failed and caused business interruption loss somewhere else in the world. So, that is our biggest question mark here. But we see no reason at this point in time to change our loss estimate.</p>
          <p>I would like to come to the series of earthquakes now which occurred last year. And of course after a year like 2011, with extreme cat activity, we have looked deeper into the question, is there an extraordinary development? Do we see a trend? Are the earthquakes really independent or what happened here?</p>
          <p>In general, our answer is unchanged. Over sort of mid-term horizon, we expect a permanent increase of cat losses for two reasons. One is the higher concentration of values, particularly in the mature markets. And the other trend is weather related. We see an ongoing increase of weather-related losses, floods, storms, hurricanes, cyclones, et cetera. Both these aspects &#x2013; both of these trends are built into our models or will be permanently built into our models.</p>
          <p>In 2010 and 2011, however, against these general assumptions, we saw an extraordinary cat loss series from earthquake events. And you know that after such a series of events, there are then the series in the room, is it a Ring of Fire series are they all independent? Do we make the right assumptions in the model or what happened here? We looked into that and of course into the worldwide community of scientists discussed this topic, this issue again which would have big indication of our underwriting approach of course. And the answer is no. This sort of accumulation of earthquake events did always occur in the past. So, that's not an unusual phenomenon and you cannot prove from the data that there's any sort of dependence between the various regions in the world.</p>
          <p>What happens of course is that within one region, in Japan or in New Zealand or in Chile or wherever, that one earthquake has an implication of the further earthquake probability in the same region. That is the case. It can even be the case that one earthquake increases further probability in the same region. But we are still of the opinion there's no controversial discussion that the earthquakes between the regions are still independent. So, that means the model in that respect at least in our capital allocation which was driven by these models remains unchanged.</p>
          <p>Why is that so important? Because cat business is one very significant and important pillar for the non-life business of Munich Re. I'll come to the profitability a bit later. And we aim, of course, to have the sort of best-in-class cat management and underwriting capabilities in place. What does it mean? Active capital and budget management for the peak exposures. J&#xF6;rg Schneider highlighted it. Strict limits for each cat scenario. We have certified a lot of scenarios than the few others. And we always aim to have the best model in place for our underwriting.</p>
          <p>The question is now, of course, looking at this ambition, do we see now a need for model adjustments as a sort of lessons learned after these cat events, and if so, where? And that goes through the various events now, Japan first, absolutely in line with our model expectations. No need for any model change because of that event.</p>
          <p>What we did, however, we decided to recalibrate our Japan earthquake model, not as a sort of lessons learned, but because we think we know that the earthquake which occurred caused further stresses &#x2013; news stresses in the ground further south, so near the Tokyo region. So, that means the energy is released in the region where the earthquake occurred, but new stresses were built as a consequence of the earthquake further south. So, that means there is a slightly higher chance of a new earthquake near Tokyo. That means we'll need higher prices because probabilities &#x2013; they change or will change.</p>
          <p>New Zealand, here, there is a need for model change. Why? Because particularly, the liquefaction issue and some translation of the released energy into the loss simulated &#x2013; loss amount was underestimated. Here we make model changes. And we do know that like in Japan, there's all the new stress here in the ground which increases the probability for other earthquakes in the same region. This interference of the earthquake waves which I mentioned already during the course of last year, that the earthquake waves were reflected by one of the big rocks and overlaid with the new waves. This is something which we observed but which we can hardly build into models, to be quite honest.</p>
          <p>Flood in Thailand. This is a big issue and this is for me the one event in 2011 which was the most dissatisfactory event. Why? Because it was a surprise event for the Munich Re and for our industry. What happened here, not that the model was not available, the model's available for flooding in Thailand, but the data were not available. That means there were undetected exposures around Bangkok so that the models at the end of the day did not produce any significant loss estimation, though the models don't have to be &#x2013; don't need to change. But what we do need to change is we need the exposure information and that is one of the hot issues for the April 1 renewal in Japan now.</p>
          <p>We know, of course, that a year like 2011 creates a need for action, and you can be assured we do our job here and require the right price increases and will improve the profitability of the business further. When we look, however, in the long term and ask ourselves, can such a business be underwritten or be entertained in a sort of profitable way? Then we come to the conclusion, a clear yes.</p>
          <p>What we did is we looked over our profitability over the last sort of 15 years in our Munich Re portfolio and here in these 15 years, we had two very extreme nat cat events. One was 2005 Katrina, Rita, Wilma and the second was 2011 with the series of earthquakes and Thailand. And even with these events we highlighted, we think the probability for such a series is in our opinion in the order of 50 years or so even with including such a series of events over a 15-year period in our portfolio, the nat cat portfolio, showed a very decent profitability even after deducting the cost of capital.</p>
          <p>We do think, however, that for the future, that means for 2012 and beyond, we want and we have to increase our annual cat margin, our annual cat loading, which was in the past, 6.5% if you remember. Why we think that? First of all, there are additional exposures in the Munich Re book because we took advantage of the price increases in Australia, in New Zealand, to some extent in Japan, in Chile after 2010, so we carry higher exposures in the meantime and they have to be reflected of course or built into our annual cat margin.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we looked carefully at the new models RMS11 in Europe and in the United States which were released during the last year. We came to the conclusion that particularly for the sort of inland exposures behind the coast in the United States, there is a need or there are good reasons in the model that although the Munich Re should increase, the probability for more losses for higher losses in the hinterland of the East Coast. And the same applies for European windstorm. Here, we think the model RMS11 made quite good adjustments particularly in the frequency range of the loss distribution which we adopted into our model. I have to admit, in the United States, some of these model changes are already reflected in better market prices, in European windstorm this has not happened yet.</p>
          <p>And then we have this unmodeled loss situation I mentioned at Thailand. So, these three &#x2013; these are three reasons why we think we need to change from 6.5% to 8.5%.</p>
          <p>At the same time, our overall margin for catastrophes and for man-made losses is pretty much unchanged, 12%. Why? Man-made came down a bit, and then these unmodeled parts in the past were implicitly contained or included in this man-made part because the 6.5% which we published in the last years, they were derived from the 35 large cat scenarios which we had &#x2013; which we have defined over the world and, therefore, which we explicitly made this calculation for the cat margin. So, some part of the increased margin is a reallocation from man-made now into the cat margin. So, 12% unchanged for cat and man-made together.</p>
          <p>Next part, the next slide looks a bit unspectacular. I know that, but it's probably the heart of non-life reinsurance in the Munich Re because it highlights in general our ambition to continuously improve our portfolio quality and that has to do with execution of strategy and it has to do with our permanent execution of cycle management. And I would like to underline that to give you a flavor or a few examples of what we did here in the past years which I think are very impressive. First, you remember, we defined our risk solutions strategy under which we entertain specialty primary business in the non-life reinsurance portfolio so our corporate insurance partner, our Hartford Steam Boiler, our Lloyds Watkins, our American Modern and so on. Due to organic growth and also due to acquisitions, as you know, we have reached in the meantime a premium volume in this specific segment and very profitable segment of &#x20AC;3.6 billion, which is an increase of more than 80% since 2008.</p>
          <p>Munich Re America where we had the reserve issues in the past that was a very casualty-driven company in the old years. They shifted their portfolio mix very much to short-tail in the meantime that has &#x2013; strategic reasons has also due &#x2013; has also to do with the cycle. We get a significant share of motor businesses in Europe particularly French motor access business. German motor access business, a large proportion of business in Germany at the same time we did increase our proportional business motor UK. And we executed our de-risking strategy in workers' comp business in the United States, which we think causes permanent problems because of ongoing inflation issues in that business. So, all together, we think that is a very good example of our active portfolio management, and we are committed to that irrespective of any cyclical development.</p>
          <p>Before I leave P&amp;C, I would like to come back or to highlight a few issues which have to do with the portfolio composition and the portfolio mix. And we know, of course, that you, the investors and analysts, and all the other parts of the outside world always make comparison in terms of combined ratio. And because of our business mix, we look always a bit worse in that respect. We know that. And we have asked ourselves, of course, is proportional business which mainly drives the combined ratio for the non-life portfolio, is it bad business or is it good business? So, should we react here in one or the other way, or should we continue with our strategy?</p>
          <p>And what I would like to underline here is proportional business adds value and is not per se better than non-proportional business even if non-proportional business might look better. Why is that the case? We think, first of all, proportional business could even have some advantages. Why? The result contribution from proportional business is less volatile and, in general, when you don't &#x2013; when I leave the earthquake quota shares in Japan site, that proportional business is less capital-intensive.</p>
          <p>We think that in Munich Re, looking at our setup and our local presence in the various markets, has a big competitive advantage to write, to entertain proportional business. We are very close to our clients. We have the technical capabilities in our local market, knowledge help is, of course, to make the right assessments, what to write and what better not to write here.</p>
          <p>And the third point is, when we look ahead and look at the demand side, we see already now, maybe even more in the future, a strategic relevance because proportion of business provide significant capital received which might become very important on our Solvency II. And then, you are better prepared to entertain the business than cancelling it. So, in general, we think it's good business, if you treat it the right way, if you approach it with the right technical capabilities. And we see an unchanged attractiveness in that business despite the slightly higher combined ratio, which is, however, economically justified.</p>
          <p>We discussed already a few weeks ago, our picture, our results of the January 1 renewal. I would like to skip it here at this point because everything was said in my opinion, question is now what will happen during the next renewal, that is April 1 where the renewal is already underway, and then July 1, which is then the final largest renewal date during 2012.</p>
          <p>What can we expect? April 1 and July 1 compared with January 1 are renewal dates where the cat business, the non-proportionate cat business, is of higher importance. So, the cat premium in the January renewal in the Munich Re book was about 11% or so. In the April and July book, it's about 30%, so three times higher. Therefore, if there are changes in market price in rates in the cat business, they affect our portfolio more in the coming renewals.</p>
          <p>What do we expect? First, the continuation of sharp price increases now in Japan for one very simple reason. A lot of the clients which were affected by the earthquake one year ago did not see any price increase because here, the earthquake occurred too late. The treaties were already renewed one year ago.</p>
          <p>It's also very important to note that we see a rate increase in the Japanese primary market in earthquake. Earthquake rates during the last 12 months after the earthquake increased already between 20% and 30% primary rates. And we think a further increase in the order of 15%, maybe 20% during the next 12 months is possible. Why do I mention that? That has nothing to do with the renewal date that is very important for the profitability change and improvement of our proportional earthquake treaties in Japan.</p>
          <p>United States, two renewal dates at April and July. Here, we do expect similar price increases compared with last year, so in the order of maybe 10% or so that has still to do with the tight capacity in that market and the RMS11 version. Although positive remark in the property primary business, rates begin to develop to increase, not in casualty. Here everything is still flat. But in property, primary rates begin to increase in the order by 15%, 20%. Is that already sustainable? We don't know. But we made the first observations here. And then we expect of course sharp price increases in the cat business in New Zealand and in Australia.</p>
          <p>So, I finish here, property and casualty, altogether, very satisfactory development. We see some light at the end of the tunnel. So, I'm carefully optimistic for 2012.</p>
          <p>I switch now to life, life reinsurance. And this light which you see should be known to you. It describes our strategy. In the first row, you see the demand side for life reinsurance. So, the need for support and underwriting and product development on the left side, then demand for cash and capital relief and then all the higher importance in the future maybe to tackle this asset-liability mismatch on the life reinsurance. In the second row, our value proposition and in the third row, the necessary expertise for the Munich Re as a market leader.</p>
          <p>What are our key growth initiatives to continue &#x2013; for our business? They are unchanged. We have two strong pillars, traditional pillars, which is market development, particularly in the emerging markets in Asia, and then we want to further develop our financially motivated reinsurance as an instrument to refinance the cedants or to improve solvency. So, these two main initiatives should also in 2011 be the most effective ones and should contribute the very large part of our value added.</p>
          <p>In respect of the other initiatives, longevity and asset protection, we continue carefully to develop them. They're still at a very early stage. And I do not expect any quick wins in that respect, that is more mid and long-term development for our portfolio.</p>
          <p>Now, the IFRS figures, you can see here a significant increase, both in terms of the net result, &#x20AC;403 million and the technical result, &#x20AC;367 million. You know that we set an ambition to achieve &#x20AC;400 million technical result. Of course, we are disappointed that we could not achieve that in 2011, only &#x20AC;367 million. However, I think it's remarkable that we came already somewhat close to that figure despite of the necessary reserve strengthening for the disability business in Australia. We reported that in Q3,s which deteriorated or had an impact of about &#x20AC;150 million.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, slide 82, a few key figures here. First, the premium volume, I mentioned already, solvency relief treaties &#x2013; large proportional treaties led to this significant volume increase. And you see, on the left side, that this volume increase is reflected of course although in an improved share of life reinsurance business in the overall reinsurance operation; so, increased by three percentage points to 36% in the meantime.</p>
          <p>More relevant is, of course, the value creation. And after 2009 year, where you see already a peak in the value added creation that was the post-Lehman time, we have seen another record of our value-added on new business, now &#x20AC;643 million. This figure, by the way, is roughly three times higher than five years back and 50% higher than the mid-term ambition, which we published five years back.</p>
          <p>Next slide, market overview, it shows that Munich Re and life reinsurance is the leader in the global life reinsurance market in terms of market share. It's remarkable &#x2013; that's the only remarkable movement that score has taken over Transamerica and therefore increased market share, otherwise, no major moves from last year.</p>
          <p>Our internal split in terms of premium contribution and value-added contribution: North America very important, more than 50% now; UK came down it's further decreasing; Asia Pacific growing value added contribution, here we see a roughly sort of volume proportional contribution except UK, Australia and the United States, which are below average.</p>
          <p>Here's the market's consistent embedded value now, which J&#xF6;rg Schneider already mentioned in his part. MCEVs significantly increased during 2011, stands now at almost &#x20AC;10 billion. What are the main drivers? First, of course, the value added on new business, &#x20AC;640 million, then experienced variance assumption changes, all positive. I think here, it's remarkable that the variances are still positive despite this hit from disability income in Australia. So, that means we have other positive counter developments in other markets, particularly in Canada. Economic variances, here they &#x2013; this increase primarily reflects, of course, our lower interest rates. So, overall, very positive changes.</p>
          <p>How do we see the profitability of our new business in terms of IRR spread and in terms of RORAC spread? First of all, again, very satisfactory new profitability. When you look at the RORAC increase here on the left side, since 2008, this is basically due to the large deals and the attractive business from Asia. You see that here. And when you look at the paybacks, so that means the time it takes until we get our investment, our capital out from the business, then I think here it's remarkable that, normally, our bread and butter business, life reinsurance business, has a sort of average payback period of 10 years or so. Due to the large deals, we bring the payback period down. You see that in 2009 post-Lehman. You see that in another time now in 2011. These deals are of shorter duration.</p>
          <p>This slide shows now capital strain of life regrowth and the free capital generation in 2011. Two separate process, of course, need to be taken into account. One is the runoff effect of the inflows business. The other one is a new business effect running off the business primarily means, of course, we're using margins. In total, &#x20AC;1.1 billion free capital was produced. You see that in the first row in the right. And then, writing new business requires capital, &#x20AC;760 million. First, cash flow in &#x20AC;50 million. Altogether, this sum means &#x20AC;820 million of capital which was bound. In total, these two effects lead a positive balance of &#x20AC;290 million and that is a good picture.</p>
          <p>So, question now, what have we achieved and what do we expect to achieve in the future? In terms of the value added on new business five years back, we aimed at doubling our VNB, in fact we tripled it, so that is good news. Of course, I mentioned it, it was driven by the large transactions, by the large quota share treaties. It cannot be expected that these extraordinary treaties can be written year by year. So, I would expect, we would expect a sort of sustainable level of the VNB in the order of &#x20AC;450 million in the future. In terms of IFRS result, we try to constantly improve it, &#x20AC;400 million on average should be achievable going forward.</p>
          <p>So, I'll come back now on that slide to my opening remark. We think our four key growth and innovation initiatives continue to be right and effective. Maybe two sentences regarding the innovation. Asset protection, Joachim Wenning mentioned it last year. It's our single and most significant innovation investment. Our technical infrastructure, our IT infrastructure is being built now. And we see opportunities but we &#x2013; carefully development. So, we learn from our activities and it will grow to material size, but not in the near future.</p>
          <p>Longevity, here we have a sort of cautious approach. We only concluded one transaction and worked probably on some 10 or so. And we learned from that. We are still in the process to define our risk appetite now. We do not consider this business as a strong and major growth in the initiatives considering the many risks which are involved here in terms of longevity.</p>
          <p>That's my final remark. And I hand back to &#x2013; who?</p>

          <p>Thank you for the presentation. We will now start with the Q&amp;A which are scheduled to take about an hour. Please raise your hand if you would like to ask a question and use, please, the microphone in front of you. And please give your name and company first. And please limit the number of questions to a maximum of two per person in order get &#x2013; to give everybody a fair chance to ask a question. First question, please, Michael Huttner.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Thanks a lot, great day. Two questions, can you give a precise number, if you use the same assumptions. I'm not sure it's J&#xF6;rg Schneider or Mr. Oechslin. What would the embedded value be if you had the same assumptions on some of your peers instead of the number you actually published? I'm quite confused. I heard a figure of &#x20AC;2 billion but maybe that's low. I just don't know.</p>
          <p>The other question, how to put it. Here it goes. I think your 96% is wrong and I'll explain. Listening to the presentation, the U.S. is producing a combined ratio of 91%. That seems sustainable. Overall, if I take the 2011 number, it was 94% if I strip out the nat cat of 20% in excess of your run rate, so 114% minus 20% is 94% which means the balance outside of the U.S. is running at 95% already before you raise your prices. So, I'm kind of guessing, really, it should be running maybe at 94% after you raise your prices, which kind of implies your run rate is more like 93%, 94%, not 96%. This is my two questions. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the first one maybe is one for Torsten and J&#xF6;rg and no, the second one is one for Torsten and J&#xF6;rg. And the first one is one for you only. Are you ready for the first one already?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, because I can't answer it. Since I do not know exactly the shape of the yield curve of our friendly competitors, it is not possible to model our book on the basis of something different than what we did here. We gave some sensitivities. They are not scalable. That means when you see the illiquidity premium, 10 basis points, you cannot multiply it by 10 and come to the right result. Also, these sensitivities do not include bucketing of the products. This is another very important complexity. The more people distinguish between various packages of products with regards to the risk of lapses and the liquidity of the liability, the more the results will differ from one to the other.</p>
          <p>We did some over-the-thumb calculations using yield curves which will be applied for the German quantitative impact study 6, which is something internal and not done on a European level, and the outcome was surprisingly high. That means a couple of billion more than we showed. But since we do not regard the yield curves applied there as being a good indicator for what will be the final outcome of Solvency II, we decided not to disclose that number, and I beg for your understanding.</p>
          <p>And for your second question, before I hand over to Torsten with the business feeling for what can be achieved, did you include the reserve releases in your number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You had a long presentation saying the reserve releases are sustainable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can we replay it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what I wanted to ensure here, yes. Somewhat right, yes, Torsten?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would only &#x2013; of course, it depends on reserve questions at the end of the day when you look at calendar year, no doubt about that. I'm not worried about whether we increase or decrease the combined ratio too much to be very honest, because to some extent it also depends on the opportunities during 2012. And there is a potential, I admit it, that if we more focus on cat business and see more activity in terms of rate there during the course of 2012, that this further improve reserves. Without considering our reserves, because this further improves the combined ratio.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, there are also possibilities, good possibilities, by the way, that the combined ratio could increase if further capital relief transactions like in China also would materialize. These are sort of motor quota share treaties with some other lines of business included and they usually run at a combined ratio of 98% or 98.5% or so, which is considering then the tail and the investment income and how they are structured and protected, very good deals. These are good deals. Nevertheless, you would see a sort of deterioration in the combined ratio, which doesn't mean an economical deterioration. So, both is possible, I would say. It depends what occurs more.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as regards to your first question, Michael, another way to approach it may be there are some peers who do publish their embedded values on a no-illiquidity premium basis, no-extrapolation basis, that may give you this sum of a ballpark to then judge the other way around.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question, Vinit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, Vinit from Goldman Sachs. I just want to touch on the solvency relief which you mentioned several times in the presentation. I can't help but notice that in the January renewals, you appeared a bit more reticent than at least one of your peers on the solvency relief transactions by a factor of maybe 10 times or even 15 times on the numbers that I could remember. Is there is something that is going on on how you're shaping the business because maybe that is linked to this 1% better combined ratio, which I acknowledge you don't focus on much, but is there something there on the business mix?</p>
          <p>And related to that is also a question on business mix. I notice that one of the very strong growth areas seems to be what you call other classes, which include agriculture and those kind of things. And I would have thought this would be a small portion, that's why it's called other, but it's almost 15% of your book now and it grew 17% in 2011. Is there something that you would like to elaborate there, which is moving? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Solvency II, not played a big role for the Munich Re, not yet. We did some business already last year. There was some further business during this year, during the 1/1 renewal, but it's all in the double-digit million range, so it's not more so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, not Solvency II, the surplus relief quota share deals in the Jan renewals, we did see a very, very big number, $1.5 billion from one of your peers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the Munich Re in the January renewal, I think I mentioned that we concluded or we renewed one of the larger treaties in Asia. But the other treaties was in renegotiation or the renewal was underway. They are not included in any of the figures yet. That is ongoing, so I cannot &#x2013; have no further news today. Also, the Munich Re strategy and report is unchanged. I mean if they can be concluded, okay, we will do so and we are well prepared and would write it. They are very, very welcome. But again, what was in the books last year is in the books next year but nothing else yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the bulk of those synergies are not Solvency II-related because they're non-European, most of them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it sometimes is that they are afraid that their own regulators might follow a pattern that is similar to &#x2013; and this is not farfetched. There are some regulators who start the discussion. But some of it is just straightforward capital market-related, and even without Solvency II we would have seen those treaties.</p>
          <p>And you made another remark as regards as agricultural business, that we would only like to take it up in a sense that is right. That is another kind of a business that tends to drive combined ratios up. A very good business, big volume, and therefore again, that may deteriorate if we grow that business faster than the rest, deteriorate the combined ratio optically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, next question from Spencer, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wonder if you'd just help me interpret a couple of economic numbers first, okay? The first is on the German Life Primary embedded value, obviously the value of options and guarantees has gone up significantly, no surprise. And as a consequence, you've got a negative value-in-force of &#x20AC;2.9 billion. I was kind of wondering about the gross present value of future profits, because even before the value of options and guarantees, the present value of future profits is still quite a negative number; minus &#x20AC;700 million. So, I wonder if you could help interpret that one.</p>
          <p>And then, the second point was on slide 45. I think, it was &#x2013; yes, slide 45. You talked about how the AA calibration of risk-based capital compares to the 99.5% VAR when we see 1.3 times for a normal distribution. Most of the peers seem to be in the range of 1.5 times, then Munich Re is at 1.75 times. Should I interpret that as meaning the peers' model their tails less conservatively than Munich Re models the tail? Or should I interpret that as meaning Munich Re's tail is genuinely sort of fatter than the others?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the first one, I'm not sure who takes up. You?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can try and perhaps Christoph would help out. The intrinsic value of the financial options and guarantees is part of the present value of the business. And that will be the reason, I assume. Can you confirm that, Christoph?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I can easily confirm that. It's the lower margins and the expected value at the time of the options and guarantees. It's on top of the downside you might have due to the optionalities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the tail model or tail distribution, Spencer, I would say, it is a combination of the two things you mentioned. Indeed, Munich Re's exposure to certain tail events, in particular on the P&amp;C side, is such that the tail &#x2013; we would expect the tail to be slightly fatter in these risk categories that have a stronger impact on Munich Re's risk profile than on other peers. But another element is that our assumption of modeling the same risks are more fat-tailed than in other models. So, I would say it's indeed a combination. In particular, these fungibility constraints add to the tail, in particular these tail dependencies add to the fatness of the tail. And there, we actually differ in our assumptions compared to other internal models and very much so compared to the standard model under Solvency II.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Next question, maybe from somebody over here. Michael Haid, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Michael Haid from MainFirst Bank. Two questions, first on your net profit target for 2012, &#x20AC;2.5 billion. You gave a breakdown of how much should come from the segments; Reinsurance, &#x20AC;1.9 billion to &#x20AC;2.1 billion; ERGO, &#x20AC;400 million; and Munich Health, &#x20AC;50 million to &#x20AC;100 million. This is all before consolidation, if I understand correctly. The consolidation effect used to be round about &#x20AC;500 million to &#x20AC;600 million, presumably from the dividend of ERGO. Is it right to assume that for 2012, the consolidation effect will be very low because the dividend of ERGO to Munich will be almost zero?</p>
          <p>And second question, Life Primary Insurance. ERGO, &#x20AC;400 million target for 2012. How much comes from Life Primary Insurance? Within that, how much is international and how much Germany? And also for Germany, can you say &#x2013; can you give us a figure about the technical result is in German Life business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To your first question, yes, I can confirm, ERGO will not pay dividend. We don't need it for our distribution, and therefore, we decided not to have a dividend from ERGO to Munich for 2011. And that makes a lot of the difference in the consolidation. On that occasion, I can perhaps address now that we intend to change the reporting from this way of showing it with the consolidation column to a fully consolidated way, but there are still some details to be checked with the auditor. Therefore, I beg for your understanding, that we will only present that in the course of our Q1 presentation.</p>
          <p>To your second question, I would rather like not to give more breakdown. Do you want to say something about profitability, what you expect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was actually looking to Christoph Jurecka in the first row, but I don't know whether we should give this number, was looking for it and we haven't prepared for today. We don't.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean we don't give exact figures if we can give an hint. I mean you know we are on our way back to profitability in international business, so we want to further increase profitability there. I wouldn't expect huge jumps there for this year. I think Primary Life would be rather stable to where we are this year. And as Torsten showed in his presentation, I think we had a rather bad year in P&amp;C in Germany this year. So, if claims development is improving, as we currently expect, there might be some upside there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It basically summarizes that we should see a small profit from the international business. So, if you take that out of the &#x20AC;400 million, you know that the German business will be more or less stable. When P&amp;C comes back to better levels again, that means that the Life and Health numbers, which are partly overstated like from the deal with Munich Health, will come back a bit.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Maciej from Morgan Stanley. I've got two questions. The first question will be on the equalization reserves. Specifically, I understand the equalization reserves works so that the volatility in your loss ratio determines what size of equalization reserves you need into the future. So, I guess, the first part of the question is how big do your equalization reserves now need to be after a very volatile year last year? And in the same question, if I can, how long will it take you to fill those reserves if you have a normal loss experience over time and will that all come out of underwriting?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on page 37 in your &#x2013; you've given the ERC calculation. You may have explained this in the presentation, and I apologize if I did miss it, but what exactly where the model changes that led to the negative &#x20AC;1.7 billion in the ERC? I might have missed that, sorry if I did?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>J&#xF6;rg, are you ready for the equalization reserve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Almost, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Almost. You got a good number to give?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because I would not like to give very precise numbers, but perhaps kind of a guidance. You're absolutely right. Volatility is driving the target size. We did some calculation. It's so difficult because it's influenced by the performance in the past and in the future. One was reliable, that if 2011 had not happened then the contribution to the equalization reserve would be between &#x20AC;200 million and &#x20AC;250 million less than after 2011. That means the enormous loss ratio for the line of business in fire has such a direct impact. And then, we did another very rough over-the-thumb calculation with how long will it take us to reach the maximum level if we are performing from now on as planned, which means always wonderful profits without any disturbance from natural catastrophes. That is some seven years or so, yes. But this is not a precise art. If you keep everything as constant, then you can do such kind of calculations. But in reality, it fluctuates all the time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the ERC model changes, those have been relatively large number of changes. And the background to this is that we are adopting changes in order to get our model Solvency II compliant. There are two changes that have been making up of most of this &#x20AC;1.7 billion. One I mentioned in the presentation briefly, which was an improvement of the valuation of the hedging instruments we have for low interest rates, the swaption notes. And in particular, that is not the valuation of the swaptions today, but the valuation of the swaptions in very stressed markets, which they are therefore to protect us against, and in particular, there the question of volatility smile effect. We have not considered that before, but if you go down the road into the money, the volatility needs to change, which increased the value of these hedging instruments in extreme scenarios. That has taken away about &#x20AC;1 billion of the risk. I'm sure the hedge is more effective than what we thought before.</p>
          <p>And another relevant change was on credit risk. It was an assumption on the correlations of the default of various issuers of bonds that we have revised in the light of the experience of the credit crisis over past three to four years. And that revision had a positive impact.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Yes, sort of just two possibly nerdy questions. The first one, the Life Reinsurance free capital generation from the in-force book, which I think is on slide 86, is &#x20AC;1.1 billion or so. That does include some variances, but it's still a big increase from the previous year. I'm just wondering, to the extent that you've done these sort of large transactions, has this figure rebased or is this figure sort of unusually high, as the positive impact to some of the business you've done in the past is kind of running off? And if it is unusually high, could you try and give us an indication of what a stable figure would be?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, when you showed your reserve development triangle on slide 21, I think it was, you dismissed the 2010 development figures, saying that I think it related to changes in volume. If I'm right, when I look at your triangle, your ultimate loss ratio peak has gone up by about a percentage point from the data you showed last year from about 70.7% to about 71.7%, so that would imply that there has been an actual deterioration, not just a change of volume. And if there's something else that's happened, is something going on at ERGO, is there a business mix issue or what, because I do see that the ratio has deteriorated?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the second, I will need the assistance of our Chief Actuary, Rich Olsen, because the tendency that it is something about volume, that is the dominating run, but it's perhaps also disturbed by other factors.</p>
          <p>For your first question, we did some optimization on the existing book and that led to a situation where we have a quicker run-off of the portfolio because we pushed it into another regulatory entity, which means that we have a better run-off profile of the required capital. And that is the reason for this change.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On the 10-K, it's important to remember that the presentation is on an accident year basis, and the increase that we see in losses in 2010 is largely being driven by more premium coming in than we expected and that ends up raising the loss amount up. For the most part on the 2010 accident year, we view that as being fairly immature and our basic loss ratios generally did not reduce them, at least in aggregate.</p>
          <p>On the triangles in the back, the triangles run, well they say accident year, they are actually a combination of accident year and underwriting year business. And so, some of the underwriting years for 2010 were impacted by the 2011 cat events that occurred, and so that causes the loss ratio to go up a little bit.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to just try and follow. You'd be happy that on a 2010 underwriting year basis, there's not been a deterioration in the ratio as well. Cool. Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Thomas Fossard, HSBC. Three questions, first one on your net income, &#x20AC;2.5 billion net profit target for the q-on-q. I mean, are you planning any U.S. DTA gain in 2012? Obviously, you had some tax gains coming from the U.S. Are you planning that in the &#x20AC;2.5 billion guidance, please?</p>
          <p>Two questions on the capital position of the group. Could you update us on the capital buffer on a AA S&amp;P basis? And the other one would be on the economic, macroeconomic capital. I understand that obviously your calculation is really compliant to Solvency II requirement above the risk margin. And it seems to be unlikely that you're going to get the diversification benefit between legal entities, and I will be interested to better understand how much is this a positive element when you're getting to your economic capital ratio? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your question about taxes, we have not planned for similar tax gains. On page 215 of our Annual Report, you'll find the breakdown of the tax losses carried forward in two boxes, one for which we have set up a tax asset, and the other for we didn't do that. We are still relatively conservative. If our U.S. operations continue performing so well as they do currently, then after, let's say, after a certain period has elapsed, we would have to set up another DTA there. But we have not planned for it at the moment, and it is up to our auditor more or less to force us doing it, because we don't like that so much to have this high deferred tax asset, because when everything goes wrong this also falls on your feet.</p>
          <p>Second, capital position, Standard &amp; Poor's, it's a bit difficult to give a precise number, but we are in very good territory. So, we still are talking about some refinements. There is no pressure at all. We would think that we would rather have a black number in comparison to a AA target level than a shortfall, so we can be quite relaxed about the Standard &amp; Poor's or other rating agency's capitalization numbers. Jo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the market value margin, which is part of the liability in the AFR calculation, you are absolutely right. Under the Solvency II regime, diversification between legal entities is not allowed. Currently, we do consider that diversification between legal entities in our AFR and we will not do that on a Solvency II compliant balance sheet.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, you need to view this approach in the light of other choices we do. For example, when we determined the market value margin in the AFR, we actually assumed the cost of capital on our economic risk capital, which is at 1.75 times the Solvency II capital. So we have a too high, if you want, so compare it to the current Solvency II regime, cost of capital charge, which makes us more conservative. We do value the liabilities with a swap rate at this point in time and not add a swap rate plus countercyclical premium.</p>
          <p>In the context of all of this, the potential decrease of AFR due to not considering diversification between legal line entities would be a fraction of the positive impacts we would have to comply with other elements of Solvency II. In particular also because our legal entity structure is not such diverse since we have a lot of our big risks, for example, on the reinsurance side, about 70% to 80% of our insurance risk, which is relevant for the MCR calculation, is located in one big legal entity which is Munich Re AG, such that not considering this would not have such a big effect.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thomas Noack from WestLB. Two questions please, first on P&amp;C reinsurance. In the past, you often mentioned the strong implementation of differential terms and conditions and that Munich Re would very much benefit from this. Could you please give us an update on this issue?</p>
          <p>Second question is on life primary. Well, you mentioned that you plan to implement a new product with a different guarantee features. At the same time, there is a discussion in some European markets to change more from the cliquet option to the at-maturity guarantee. Do you see this as, let's say, realistic for the German market and what is your opinion on that? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I start with the differential terms. The figure is slightly about 35% of our premium volume. So in other words, 35% of the premium volume the treaties behind, they are concluded or written on a private terms basis, so to speak. That is slightly higher than what we have published, I think, last year or two years ago, where we were in the order of 33% or so.</p>
          <p>Do we expect that this figure goes up or not? Let's put it this way, in the bread and butter business, in the very regular business which has been in the market for years, there's in specific client relationship some room to give better terms to keep Munich Re on both in a softening cycle or in a competitive market environment. For such business, the room or the gap between Munich Re pricing and further softening, market price, it becomes too big, then of course it is not possible any more. So therefore, that business, this number has not increased that much.</p>
          <p>The second development is when it comes to, let's say, sort of further large solvency relief transactions, so also big deals where only one or two partners, three partners, participate, then it's very likely that this figure goes up further because then you can really agree on private terms much easier than in the bread and butter business, so about &#x2013; a bit more than 35%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to guarantees in the German Life business and product concepts, there's basically two aspects which make the guarantees expensive. One is you have a lifetime guarantee over a very long period of time until maturity, and the second aspect is you have to give that guarantee not just at maturity but year after year after year. So, if you have a lapse in between, you basically locked in with that guarantee. And if that lapse comes at an unfavorable time, this gets really expensive.</p>
          <p>It is not a surprise that if you ask customers what they are willing to pay a premium for. Then, they are willing to pay the premium for the lifetime feature, in terms of getting a good guarantee at maturity. They're not willing to pay for a feature to have that on an annual basis, because the customer at the time of purchase expects to keep that product until maturity, which does not hold true for everybody, but when it comes to personal expectations, customers are not willing to pay an extra premium for the annual guarantee. But this is one of the most costly features of the product.</p>
          <p>So obviously, that is in times, when you cannot finance this type of guarantee anymore, that is an area everybody is looking at. And now, you have two different paths to get to a different product. You either step out of the framework of a classical German life insurance and you build something completely new, basically a unit-linked concept with guarantees you put on top at maturity, not on an annual basis. The other path to a new product would be stay within the framework of a German life insurance and try to convince legislator and regulator to soften guarantees. For example, to ask them to give a guarantee for the first 10 years, and then re-evaluate guarantees based on 10-year government bond levels. We believe that we will not get relief from legislation quick enough so that we can stay away from thinking out of the entire German life insurance framework. So, we to believe that it does need a new product outside the framework of a classical German life insurance. It might &#x2013; we might see changes to the German life insurance framework, which make German life insurance more attractive from an investors or insurance company's perspective. But my personal opinion is, that these changes will not come quick enough, but this is just a personal opinion.</p>

          <p>There was a question from Hadley Cohen before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you very much. Hadley Cohen, Macquarie. A couple of questions. On slide 56, I think it is, you're talking about the realized gains and &#x2013; or the unrealized gains rather in the Primary Life business, &#x20AC;3.2 billion. I'm just wondering what portion of that is actually realizable, i.e., coming from equities and real estate rather than fixed income which is presumably backing liabilities so not something that you would want to capitalize on?</p>
          <p>And my second question is on your MCEV disclosure. You mentioned that you've taken measures to reduce your interest rate sensitivity on the Primary Life side, yet 100 bp decline from interest rates at the end of 2011 would reduce your MCEV by &#x20AC;4 billion. So I was just wondering, if it's possible, what that number might have been if you hadn't taken those measures?</p>
          <p>And then just secondly, following on from that, interest rates continue to decline since the end of the year, so is it fair to assume that actually your MCEV at the moment is lower than that reported number? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that would be unrealized gains?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, the sharp increase of unrealized gains is driven by the very low interest rates we have now. We very much hope from the economic perspective, that we will see different interest rates pretty soon, so we cannot manage it. But these unrealized gains would be gone once the interest rates go up again. So from an economic perspective, these unrealized gains, you cannot use to finance anything else. If you would try to realize these gains, then you would lock an even lower interest rates for the future. So, I don't think that there is any perspective to use that to &#x2013; in any kind, lock in this book of business. Christoph, do you want to add anything to that? No, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regards to the asset liability management measures, what we described before as the experience variances, these are exactly measures which we're taking in the order of a bit more than &#x20AC;300 million. Christoph will describe it. So, it's a fight against the wind mills we say in German at the moment, because a lot which was done mitigated the effect but the effect of the sharp decline was so drastic. Christoph?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, exactly. It's extremely difficult because the interest rate dependency is very high, but as J&#xF6;rg just said, we managed to have in the experience variances roughly &#x20AC;300 million of a positive effect out of ALM measures, where we were able to do even more than what was our plan originally. Because other than that, we would not have been able to show it as experience variances, because the past experience which was already did in the in the past and what we are all very used to, because we keep on telling you that, so the swaption program we did already in the past is not in the experience variances but we did more given that the even more difficult situation with even lower interest rates.</p>
          <p>So, we were able to compensate the more difficult situation by another &#x20AC;300 million, but what I cannot tell you is how large the sensitivity would have been if we would not have this swaption program at all or something like that. But what we always, of course, say is that our swaption program is not manufactured to cover 100% of the business down into an interest rate level of zeros. So, we're clearly now already in a regime. The interest rates are so low that also the protection of the &#x2013; let's say, that the not protected part of the book, of course, also plays an important role there.</p>
          <p>Maybe, one addendum; what we saw in the development from the third quarter to the fourth quarter flow in the German market when we compared our development of the unrealized gains on assets compared to what competitors published, there we saw a relatively good benefit of the hedging measures we did. So, it's not only in the MCEV view, but also if you merely look at the asset and the unrealized gains, you can see the impact. So compared to the competitors, we are still better here and benefiting from the program we have. But of course, I mean, with average guarantees, which are market-wide, about 3%, it's difficult for everybody.</p>

A hint maybe that you look at this 1.2 years of duration increase ERGO has been pushed through, and in a context of the total balance sheet or investments of the Life business is one point here, on a interest rate shift of 100 basis point, would give you an idea on the further downside. If these measures were not taken, which would not even take into consideration the additional swaption programs which is a low digit &#x2013; single-digit billion euro notional amount, which would also have a considerable effect, so that downside would be substantially higher without these measures.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous. Two questions. First of all, just going back to the local GAAP discussion, what level of revenue reserves &#x2013; is there a minimum level of revenue reserves under which you wouldn't want to go?</p>
          <p>And related to that, I know you've been comforted by the equalization reserves in 2011. But looking at the split of the equalization reserves, obviously, the fire account is a lower &#x2013; historically, low level according to the slide &#x2013; on slide 95. Doesn't that significantly increase the likely volatility of your local GAAP results going forward or the vulnerability of that local GAAP results to nat cat experience? And is that how should we think about that?</p>
          <p>And the second question is just a question on risk appetite. I'm a bit confused as to what your risk appetite is now in terms of increasing either peak nat cat exposure or also pandemic exposure. You didn't give any pandemic scenarios. You've obviously grown mortality a lot. So, maybe just give us a flavor as to the operational risk appetite as things stand currently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, maybe, I should say something because you'll think I'm not in the business anymore. As regards to the local GAAP minimum level, of course, we would not like to  write the &#x2013; wait right on this edge here. But as regards to nat cat, I'm not so worried. As was said early on, what we have experienced last year was a relatively rare event.</p>
          <p>What we have, if you take the fire side of the equalization reserve, we still have &#x20AC;900 million sitting there. Then, we have the budget built into the numbers, that was discussed earlier on, and we have profit that we can work against. So, this overall leaves us with a margin that I think it should be good for even a bad year. It doesn't have to be catastrophic, but for a bad year.</p>
          <p>However, still we have possibilities to increase the revenue reserve, but we would be very cautious to do it. What you would not do is trying to influence the algorithm of the equalization reserve because I have seen that as a ringtone of my cell phones in the German market, if you stop that you're in big time trouble soon because the algorithm sooner or later will work against you. You cannot foresee that. So what one can do of course is work on the asset side of the balance to some extent that we would be very reluctant to do it.</p>
          <p>So yes, I said earlier on, I don't think that for the next two years we should be in trouble if the capital market on the inter-side moves against us and that means up rather than down in the first place. Then, of course, we would have to see what these special stipulations in German Accounting Law will allow us a leeway way, there is room. On the other hand, if you have the credit event, we would be in trouble right away for the impairment principles we have in local GAAP. So we would have to react quickly. So this is not an ice thick, meter thick. It's strong enough to carriers and I'm not afraid that we have an issue there. But of course, I can't say &#x2013; sit here and say this is &#x2013; nothing can happen. Of course, something can happen. And we will not do silly things to create a revenue reserve to able to pay a dividend, if that was the question. The other was on pandemic and that I think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was generally on risk appetite for nat cat and pandemic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can start and maybe Torsten can add. First of all, remind you of how risk appetite framework, we have a risk appetite framework that consists of a limit which we should never reach. It consists of a color scheme then which there is a red area, which is an area we can be at and which group takes control and measures the exposure. And there is a yellow area in which the divisions manage their exposures and then there is green area. And these areas are relatively broad.</p>
          <p>So, in line of these risks that you mentioned, neither in any nat cat event nor in the pandemic event we are in the red zone at this point in time. So we're still in the zone where the business division manage their exposures. Right then the red zone is relatively broad. So we have a lot of flexibilities. So, there is no scenario in which we couldn't grow if we can grow on attractive terms. That is very important and also risk appetite is not something that is carved in stone. We have regular discussions on risk appetite. Once we learn about the scenario, once we get more familiar with mitigating factors and so on, we can also change a risk appetite.</p>
          <p>Yes, having said all of this, the largest nat cat scenarios and you know that is Atlantic hurricane based on the chart as well as pandemic are amongst the higher of those exposures and amongst those that we discuss and assess whether should we grow further or not and how far should we grow. But there is still room in all of this to grow substantial growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I will add a remark from a very operational perspective now. So not cover your issue, have you reached the absolute limit? Yes or no? But the question where does it make sense in the market environment to increase and where not to increase the risk appetite?</p>
          <p>Let's put it this way. That is not a function of the Munich Re financial strengths or available financial resources that is in most cases, the function of the question how expensive becomes our product. Why? Because when we increase our risk appetite, let's say, we did it in Australia or in Chile in the last two years, so after losses, we took advantage of price increases and put more capacity into the market, so to speak. So what happens then? Then in the portfolio, the measured capacity which is at risk increases. We allocate then not only in a linear way but in a disproportionate way more capital to this Australian scenario, for instance. And that means, for per premium unit, we charge a higher profit loading into our product.</p>
          <p>So that means it's not a linear function. It's a disproportionate function and &#x2013; so then a point in time where we become non-competitive. And we have reached that level because of the peak size of the scenario in U.S. hurricane and other European windstorm. So I would almost exclude now, at least on the basis of the current price levels in the market that these two scenarios, European windstorm and U.S. hurricane can be increased, should be increased irrespective whether we have the room or not. That would not make sense. It would destroy our profitability and that is an important thing because no unit participating in this U.S. hurricane capacity in the Munich Re worldwide group. And remember, some of the capacity is written in our local office. Some of this capacity is in the global treaties from the Allianz, hurricane of the other companies and so on.</p>
          <p>So no one can then further increase the capacity without, so to speak, deteriorating or putting an impact on the profitability of the other unit participating in the same scenario. So, for that reason, these two scenarios under very critical observations so to speak, the risk appetite is here limited now. In all the other scenarios, which are below that level and these are particularly this Australian, Chile scenarios, Turkish scenarios, Southern America and so on, even California earthquake also which are more on the middle range, there's a good risk appetite in just a matter of market rate or so that we decide to increase it or not to increase it. But the two, that's almost a no, no now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just add one thought. One could do it differently as it was insinuated. We discuss it every now and then how do we allocate capital? But our experience with that system of covariance allocating is that it instills discipline in the company because the high you go up and the more we &#x2013; as top management could get nervous, the more people have to look into what they do and have to discuss amongst these. I said do we add that extra layer or not? And that helped tremendously in managing the budget.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe one additional remark why we have this covariance system in place what you mentioned which leads to the disproportionate capital allocation. It's a cumbersome system but it motivates to achieve an improvement in diversification. Yes, it automatically leads to a punishment of the extraordinary peak scenarios and it makes so to speak the non-peak scenarios, the bread-and-butter business which cannot lead to a lost peak. It makes us here more competitive. And therefore this system tries automatically to improve diversification as a company, which is a good system in my opinion.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Thomas Jacquet from Exane BNP Paribas. I have two questions. The first one is around China. You're right, &#x20AC;1.5 billion premiums there in non-life reinsurance. It's a market that is said to be very competitive, that is said to be non-modeled for natural catastrophes. So what can you tell us about the expected profitability and risk profile of this portfolio that represent now close to 10% of your book? And my second question is on the announcement you've done on the subordinated debt. What is the economic rationale of buying back an instrument at a premium now instead of calling it at par one year from now? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with China. Well, I understand your view and if you remember our various moves at the market, it went up and down over the last five to six years. We started I think six years from a very low level, &#x20AC;200 million or so or &#x20AC;250 million, then increased our book to &#x20AC;500 million and &#x20AC;600 million. It came back to &#x20AC;300 million. Now, we are over &#x20AC;1 billion. So what happened here? It's a developing market with a lot of growth potential, but then after we took advantage for a while in that emerging market, the cedants has sort of very smart and intelligent bias decided then only to &#x2013; that was three, four years ago, only decided to give that business into reinsurance which was the more problematic ones, so to speak. That was surplus fire treaties which were given to the market. Surplus fire treaties, that book had sort of &#x2013; are not below average performance to put it politely. And the better priced motor business in the market was not available.</p>
          <p>And this has changed now. We then as a reaction to that, as a response, we gave up the surplus fire business, almost down to zero. And only then when capital markets became difficult when the refinancing of the companies became an issue and they had to refinance their companies to support their growth to keep their solvency ratio at a decent level, only then reinsurance was considered as an alternative instrument. And to keep them, the reinsurance, the companies were very often to give proportion in motor business into the market.</p>
          <p>This business was not available. That is now available and what is now here in our portfolio is very, very few, but very large structured proportion of treaties where even the upside and downside in both direction is limited. They give better advantage of the client's full solvencies and give us a very, very predictable margin and I've mentioned already earlier, the combined ratio because it's motor, it's of course, not 93% or 94%. It's in the order of 98% or 98.5%. But looking at the tail ends, the investment income in the Chinese market for that business, that leads to economic profitability, which is very, very decent. So for that reason, as long as this business is available, we don't have a concern with the profitability here.</p>
          <p>Your second question, do we have an issue about cat business in the China market? The business I mentioned is not cat-exposed. So we have hardly any cat exposures in the market. I have to admit, however, we would like to have it. We do a lot of steps and have a lot of initiatives underway that we try either with local insurance companies or with a local &#x2013; how are they called by the way these regional heads of the province? The regional governors who have authority about insurance regulation in their region to implement insurance schemes against the earthquake or against other natural perils, so that it's one of our ambitions. We would like to achieve it. But so far, the problem is not that we have unmodeled exposures but there, the customers don't buy the product. Natural earthquake or catastrophe product as an insurance policy is not bought in the market. So, we have not enough insurance density and would like to improve it.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One word on China only. In fact, the company has got a little bit stuck in a triangle, on the one hand, tremendous growth. Two, the SERC, the regulatory body, was increasing pressure on companies to hold enough capital and this was an almost exponential increase of request for holding capital. And three, the capital market was not benign as they saw it to do IPOs whatever to take on capital to support the growth. And on the debt side, many of those companies were full. So, they didn't have much of a choice, either stopping their agents from selling or finding reinsurance as a relief. And of course, one big company is right now very close to an IPO and that may take away some of the pressure, but they of course have to see if the capital market is accommodating their wish. That was the problem and they were stuck there for the last 18 month more or less. And it did not stop growing and that's why we came in. Christian, for the second?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Of course, we could and we very much would to comment on your question on the ALM transactions, however, due to legal constraints I hope you understand that we are just not allowed to do so. So, we have to refrain from giving any further details. Sorry for that.  Brian, please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Okay, so it wasn't me. Brian Shea from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, two questions. If I could first of all go back to the very first question that was asked by Michael about combined ratio, the math on the 96% doesn't work for me either. I think the answer you gave was that business mix might shift in the future, and if so, that's &#x2013; that would be a reason why the math that Michael and &#x2013; which I agree with, I just wanted to confirm it. Is there a business mix shift that's already happened that makes the math not work here? You're just leaving your options open in case the mix shifts in the future?</p>
          <p>And then the second question, I guess it's right along the same vein really. It's on the target for the life re technical profit, the &#x20AC;400 million, I guess, I don't understand that target and it also seems to be quite unambitious. In 2011, you had this one-off in Australian disability. Except for that, the technical profit would have been over &#x20AC;500 million. Yet your slide shows you target &#x20AC;400 going forward with no growth or anything really going out to 2015. Can you explain the mechanics of how you come up with that outlook, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll start with the second. Can you take the first, J&#xF6;rg?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You split the work in two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll start with the second. I think what is important when you look at the life re technical result is that mortality improvements do not always come steadily. And last year, and I think J&#xF6;rg mentioned it, we had some sort of rain coming in warm rain from the mortality improvements specifically. But you have certainly also notice that in the U.S., that part of North America, some did not have very favorable mortality developments. So we are very cautious here in assuming that the improvements that we have seen can just roll forward. And therefore, even though the &#x20AC;400 million against that what J&#xF6;rg mentioned a deduct in the Australian disability, reserve increase looks not too ambitious. I think it is still ambitious and it's prudent unless you would like to add something.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So maybe one additional aspect part of the result of our life re portfolio is not shown in the technical result. It is that part that relates to deposit accounting treaties that is shown has part of the non-technical result which in the meantime has grown to a quite significant two-digit million number as well, so if you were to add this, the ambition could be a little higher. But other than that, I think we need to be somewhat careful as there is, of course, a certain volatility in this result.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe two remarks. You mentioned already we achieved the $360-something million technical reserve despite of the &#x20AC;150 million with Australia disability, correct. So that means in turn that the driver of cost extraordinary counter-effect so to speak in 2011 positively impacting the result. And we both &#x2013; I personally think both will not &#x2013; cannot be extrapolated and we should not expect the continuation of that. So for that reason, I think &#x20AC;400 million is probably good and also considering that the &#x20AC;400 million are basically fueled from the expiration of in-force business at the end of the day.</p>
          <p>And the second question, actually my first answer was &#x2013; probably I cannot comment more than we think 96% is the best answer we can give. We have not changed the business mix yet. So that is a possibility, but it's not taken into account if that was your question. At the end of the day and I admit that is the question to what extent do we &#x2013; and that is first to J&#xF6;rg Schneider, expect reserve for at least yes or no at the end. That has the impact or for the coming year most likely and here you can take more cautious or more optimistic view.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Frank Kopfinger from Cheuvreux. I'm also quite struggling with your guidance for 2012 and for me it starts already with gross written premium level. So for the reinsurance segment, you put yourself to &#x20AC;25 billion to &#x20AC;27 billion and this would imply that you even only slightly grow or that you even decline given the current environment and the PNC business but also on the life re business. I would have expected some growth here. Could you comment on the vast missing link?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we'd be careful with our top line. Why? Because we're not interested in all in top line. So we don't take too much time in defining these numbers and since we have more and more big treatise, release treatise in the book. If someone decides not to continue for whatever reason, &#x20AC;0.5 billion, &#x20AC;1 billion might drop out easily. Of course, that could happen the other way around as well. And as I think Torsten even said it, we were surprised by the development of our top line in 2011.</p>
          <p>Well I would not mind to be surprised in the current year to come up with a higher top line but please for the right reasons. But it will not help if the top line sort of outgrows expectation, it will, for the reasons we mentioned, not necessarily mean that the net income will be outgrowing. Why? Because then and will be treaties with peak volume and the relatively small return on that turnover. So that's why we focus way more on the net income than on the top line and we can produce the same net income with &#x20AC;3 billion less even. If you have the right contracts and cancel just weaker proportion of quarter share treaties or the vice versa.</p>
          <p>So top line for us is not &#x2013; it's way more predictable by the way in primary, of course, for obvious reasons. And I would even be extremely cautious when it comes to Munich Health because Munich Health also added &#x20AC;2 billion just by surplus relief deals in the last years two years. And they will expire one day, will they be able to refill, will they have new ones? I don't know, so in the relative terms for them, it could even be a 25% increase in Syria all of a sudden. We think they probably will move sideways. We do not factor in any of those deals in our assumptions. So that is everything equal assumption on the top line side, and that's why we stayed within the range that looks not too ambitious.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Next question from Andy Broadfield and then Fabrizio Croce please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Andy Broadfield from Barclays. Two questions. One around really what you've learned from the losses this year. You mentioned a little bit in one of your slides. But I'm a little surprised, not just from the EBIT, from the industry more broadly that there haven't been comments around &#x2013; concerns around non-peaks earnings or other risk concentrations that you started to explore because I think Thailand was a clear example of a risk concentration of losses or potential losses that you just haven't really seen coming. And I'm sure there must be in short-term they cannot be just a really quirky one-off loss or risk concentration you hadn't considered. I'm sure there must be many, many others globally as a result of a global expansion of trade et cetera.</p>
          <p>So, I was wondering if there's any other things you've thought of explicit example you've got there. And I guess a sort of part B on that one is we can look at New Zealand and Japan as well. New Zealand with a liquefaction and Japan with the tsunami, when you look at the Japan loss and think, okay, it can hit Tokyo &#x2013; Tokyo losses &#x20AC;2 billion. I think on your scenario and this was one and this is &#x20AC;1.5 billion. It's not a million miles away for the main city not to be flattened. So, all of those bits when I think about ironing them together, it feels like the models feel light. And &#x2013; so that's part one, what explicit things have you identified or other things you're doing to try to identify things that you fairly may have missed from the approach that you've taken historically? And it's something that is not as used industry-wide. I don't think I'm hearing much from that.</p>
          <p>Second thing is and I may have my numbers wrong here, but I think a couple years ago when you talked about your risk tolerance, Jo, as a group you considered a one in 10 year to lose your earnings. I think you said that was a sort of average thing. But in the one in 50 year event, which I would imagine to be less prevalent, you still made &#x20AC;700 million of earnings. And I'm trying to &#x2013; maybe I'm comparing apples with pears here but I was just trying to understand a little bit why one in 10 year then is somewhat more extreme than the one in 50.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Andy, your second point, indeed when we were talking about our earnings at risk criteria, we have been referring to economic earnings and that is really the difference between AF fund beginning of the year and AF fund at the end of the year considering the capital management actions this year. It was an economic loss of &#x20AC;1.2 billion and that I mentioned that briefly, corresponds to roughly 14% probability of occurring in one year.</p>
          <p>So, that is roughly where the event this year comes. And so our economic earnings at risk roughly and you can actually read that from the distribution on the page is about &#x20AC;4 billion. That's the 10-year earnings at risk of economic earnings. Obviously, the accounting earnings will be more stable than the economic earnings but &#x20AC;4 billion is the 10-year earnings at risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, maybe a few remarks. First of all, I share your view. I mean these new emerging scenarios which you mentioned, they play a very high role, a higher, higher role in our portfolio management and that is I think the challenge for our industry to identify early enough this macroeconomic changes that occur and so I fully support that, yes. We always ask the question, is it worth to further investing to model improvement of unknown scenarios or what should we do more in here? Identification of unknown scenarios, of unknown exposures is high on our agenda, actually we have an emerging risk put in place, which permanently tries to achieve that.</p>
          <p>I have to admit in Thailand, we were close to the identification of that and had already the cover, some insured from Japanese interest available, but not the split. That was the problem here, yes. So that was one sum insured for the whole country of Japanese interest invested or insured in Thailand. But when you don't know, is it some insured which splits over 10 locations over the whole country or is it all concentrated around Bangkok, which was the case when the &#x2013; then you don't have the necessary details and granularity available to get the right picture for your calculation, for your risk analysis. So that was a problem here. Fully agreed.</p>
          <p>Maybe one comment regarding the last year's earthquake in Japan and including the tsunami and then a possible maximum Tokyo earthquake which is our scenario here for the risk management, you are right. When you look from a sort of their perspective at these figures, they appear very narrow, very close. And they are not as close, I have to admit that. Why? Because the return periods for our maximum or for the published 200-year event in Japan is 2.X billion and the &#x20AC;1.5 billion Munich Re loss from this northeast earthquake event last year are completely different. We published the 200-year figure, the combination of the earthquake of 9.0 magnitude plus the tsunami in the Northeast is in the order of 800 years. And of course, if you take a longer return period, even for the Tokyo event, you can have a higher loss. And that answers the question why so to speak un-shown or not shown scenario here seems to be close to Tokyo. That has to do with different return periods.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that an issue of uncorrelation of risks though then? Because the tsunami and earthquake presumably are highly correlated and when you do your Tokyo, I presume you should correlate a high?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is a good question. First of all tsunami is normal. In general, it's included in our risk modeling. You can always argue to the right extent is it precise enough or so, okay that's fine. But now, it's normally included. We ask exactly that question, is there so to speak a surprise potential for Tokyo earthquake when Tokyo would occur and would cause a similar tsunami like last year's event. And the answer is that additional loss potential coming from a tsunami in addition to the structural loss from a Tokyo earthquake is much, much smaller. Why? Because the assumption for a worse case event in Tokyo is that the epicenter is right in front of the city, the very near the coast that means, you have very hard structural losses but you have not the distance and the time that the tsunami wave can emerge or can develop and move to the shore, to the coast line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as it goes across the other way to the west coast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. Yes, exactly. That's true. So you can &#x2013; you don't have both. When you assume the epicenter, it's very close to the coastline, then you have extreme shock losses then you don't have the potential for the tsunami anymore or vice versa but it can run to the other side, of course. That is possible but America is far away.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. It's Fabrizio from Kepler. I have actually a problem with page eight in which you show actually where the business development is heading. I know that it's illustrative. And so my question is how serious should I consider this page because we spoke about China, you spoke at press conference about your infrastructure and renewables business exploding, agricultural business is working well. And then I see here that reinsurance is actually not, in terms of business development, one of your key priorities. Why I see that you give your future in the hand of some political risk affected Munich Health and to ERGO International which actually it's not &#x2013; no, it's not maybe best in administration international in business. So my question is I think how serious should we take this? Is this really your future or is it illustrative as it says?</p>
          <p>The second point is in terms of investment. You cut pretty heavily the Italian bond and here no blame about the timing. It's not the goal. My goal is to understand if getting to the asset liability matching that you conventionally tend to follow, you will have to rebuild up disposition going forward and therefore have to reacquire some of this bond.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I think I can handle both. First of all, the slide that you refer to on eight is in fact rather about am I able as a business segment to finance my own growth or not? And reinsurance P&amp;C is generating so much capital or cash or both that they &#x2013; whatever they do can finance themselves because in relative terms whatever is out there as an opportunity is so small to the existing book that they in fact support the group with the remainder in terms of capital generation.</p>
          <p>Take the opposite example, Munich Health or international business of ERGO, they are relatively small and they still reinvest whatever they produce in the countries because these countries are growing. Take India where we have a minority shareholding. Of course they already are close to breakeven right now, but they grow so fast that nothing is leaving the country. It stays in the country mostly and is being reinvested there.</p>
          <p>That is rather the view we take here. It is not about saying this is the debt host here, reinsurance, non-life, we can't grow and we wouldn't invest. If Torsten Jeworrek comes up with the greatest idea, he would get what he needs to do it as long as he convinces his fellow colleagues and us that it's the right thing to do. That is actually what this is about. This is not about putting them down. The infrastructure here, right, you mentioned it, the infrastructure investment of course out of the book of market value &#x20AC;210 billion around about, if we invest &#x20AC;400 million into infrastructures, small, but it's a little changed and that's why we highlighted it.</p>
          <p>Now the second question, the fortunate/unfortunate timing of selling or buying Italian bonds. The point here was that reinsurers felt &#x2013; and I think it's not about whether this is right or wrong, it's about perception that in the reinsurance world, competitors and clients made it a huge topic whether or not a reinsurer is shielded from whatever happens in the peripheral European states. And then there was not so much of a choice and saying, well, we have that discussion going on and on and on and spending the time on the wrong topic or rather just get rid of it and go on. And this is not about right or wrong, it is about do we want to spend our time in that discussion.</p>
          <p>Going forward, you're right as regards the diversification of the assets. The reinsurer is a little &#x2013; has a little bit of a freehand sometimes because he has the entire world and if he wants to match its liabilities, he's not entirely dependent on the Italian bonds. But we like them also if we want to hedge inflation because it's one of the few where you can do it. So sooner or later, yes, even the reinsurer might have or buy back into Italian bonds. For the time being, it's the primary side of it and you see it was not about the Italian bonds in the first place because primary insurance is still holding on to its position even though relatively small. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We will take one very last question here from the left. Jason, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jason Kalamboussis from SocGen. Coming back to the question that was asked before on the combined ratio, if we look straight at the accident year attritional ratio, you have improved it from around 59% to around 56%, 56.5%, 56%. Should we be expecting any improvement on that towards the 55% or below the 55%? The second part within the 96% is about the man-made losses. It seems that you're taking from one pocket man-made, you're putting it in non cats. So, you are going from the 4.8% to 3.5%. But if we look at historically over the last five years and actually I looked at 10 years, you are &#x2013; and as you pointed out in your presentation, you're actually very stable except WTC. It's actually sitting close at 4.8%, I think.</p>
          <p>So is that the case where you actually take it from man-made, put it in nat cat [but actually take the 2% or whatever from reserve releases just in case and put it in man-made? And just &#x2013; and a little bit on the Japanese earthquake, I don't understand so much some of the no change in the model because at the end of the day, there was no &#x2013; if you look at whatever the seismologists were saying about Japan, everything that they were predicting was a thing around seven to eight and it came to force nine. So clearly, there must be at least a relatively strong change in the strength of the earthquake that you can forecast in front of Tokyo, so we would have presumed that that would automatically change your modeling.</p>
          <p>And also relating to the Japanese earthquake, well, I understand that there is no scientific way to talk about the clustering, is there maybe a statistical evidence that says that maybe Chile is not linked to Japan but in a certain period, statistically, you're more likely to see more earthquakes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll answer the last question, first. You're right. If you look precisely into the model 9.0 magnitude was not expected of forecast by the model. That will be put into the model. But will it have an impact on the output of the model and the price? Hardly. Therefore, I suggest no model change. Why? Because this 9.0 magnitude, and I was referring to that already, has a return period in the order of 800 years or so. And it means when you look at the price impact at this 9.0 magnitude divided by 800 years, it can't be ceded in the annual price we charge to the same risk.</p>
          <p>And therefore, I said, that is not a model change at the end. Yes, from a scientific perspective, we've put that in but this does not lead to a price change. Yes. The new stresses which were caused as a consequence following the earthquake in the Tokyo region is a different issue. They have put &#x2013; they are visible in prices here. They can be felt, so to speak, by the client.</p>
          <p>Basic loss ratio of 55% order is slightly below? Yes. I would support it already because we achieved price increases that should be reflected in improvement of basic loss ratio. It's also visible I think in the statistical data.</p>
          <p>3.5 man-made losses, is that enough or not enough? Again, when you just look at the statistical data backlog, it seems to be too less, not enough. But as mentioned, we changed the allocation of losses. It's not just the recalculation. It's a reallocation and in the past we always had these natural catastrophe losses for this very small and medium events or so outside our 35 top scenarios included implicitly in the man-made part. So you would have to retroactively adjust this manmade part if you want to see whether this figure is enough or it's sufficient or not sufficient. So, we think it's okay. Yes, because this part is taken out and put into the other box.</p>

          <p>One thing I may add here because this is a good question that we will certainly not do anything to massage this number.</p>
