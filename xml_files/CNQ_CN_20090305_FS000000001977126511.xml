          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Canadian Natural Resources Fourth Quarter 2008 Conference Call. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. John Langille, Vice Chairman of Canadian Natural Resources. Please go ahead, Mr. Langille.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for attending our conference call. We will discuss our 2008 fourth quarter and yearly results and our updated outlook for 2009. Participating with me today are Allan Markin, our Chairman; Steve Laut, our President and Chief Operating Officer; R&#xE9;al Doucet, our Senior Vice President of Oil Sands; Doug Proll, our Senior Vice President of Finance; and Lyle Stevens, our Senior Vice President of Exploitation.</p>
          <p>Before we start I would refer you to the comments regarding forward-looking information contained in our press release and also note that all dollar amounts are in Canadian dollars and production and reserves are both expressed as before royalties unless otherwise stated. I would like to make some initial comments before I turn the call over to the other participants.</p>
          <p>During 2008 our conventional operations performed at our anticipated production levels relative to the amount of CapEx allocated to both natural gas and our oil projects. This level of achievement resulted in us realizing cash flows of almost $7 billion for the year. These ongoing conventional operations will continue to produce cash flows throughout 2009, which together with our strong hedging program already in place and our disciplined approach with respect to CapEx, will ensure free cash flow to be directed toward debt repayment in 2009. And of course, we have now achieved production of synthetic oil from Horizon and as that production ramps up, this segment of our business will also start contributing to the generation of free cash flow.</p>
          <p>Our expectations dating back to the fall of 2008 were that we would have volatile commodity pricing trending down, we would have tighter more costly credit markets, and we needed to have a very flexible capital budget. And accordingly we set our plan to pay down debt, ramp up Phase I production at Horizon, emphasize cost reductions and finding new ways to develop our resources, and focus on value creation and growth, not just production growth. And as Steve and Doug comment on our operations and finances, you will see all of these expectations and plans unfolding.</p>
          <p>But before Steve starts reviewing our operations, I would now like to ask Allan to make some comments. Allan?</p>

          <p>Thanks John. Good morning, an excellent morning. Canadian Natural's defined growth plan has allowed us to continually create value for our shareholders. Our business strategies, which have helped us deliver consistent performance for the past 20 years, have not changed. They are effective, they are proven, and they serve as a testament to the strength and breadth of the company.</p>
          <p>We are very proud to announce that we achieved first synthetic crude oil production out of our Horizons Oil Sands Project just last week and we are now up and running at a steady rate. This is a major milestone for Canadian Natural. Horizon is a world class asset and we would like to thank everyone involved for their tireless efforts and ongoing tireless efforts. Congratulations on a job well done.</p>
          <p>In the midst of a challenging business environment, our conventional business has delivered strong quarterly and annual results for 2008. Finding and development costs for proved reserves came in at $20.68 per barrel of oil equivalent; and for proved and probable reserves, $14.66. For a year of decreased drilling activity, we still managed to replace 95% of our proved reserves and 134% of proved and probable reserves.</p>
          <p>When faced with instability and cost pressures more so now than ever, we are continually seeking new, more cost-effective ways to develop our portfolio of projects. Innovation and initiative are key in developing our assets, given the current cost environment. As such, we are devising new techniques in the field that have led to reduced drilling times and cost improvements. Even now at Horizon, innovation and initiative continue as we look for cost-effective alternatives for development of future phases. We have a tradition of value creation driven by discipline and cost control. Regardless of business cycles, we will continue to deliver.</p>
          <p>Thank you. Steve?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Al, and good morning, everyone. As both John and Al have stated, Q4 and 2008 were very strong for Canadian Natural. We have very strong assets, strong cash flow, and a strong plan for all commodity price environments. The cornerstone of Canadian Natural's very successful strategy is ensuring we are the low cost producer. In light of the dramatic correction seen in the commodity prices in 2008, being a low cost producer is now more important than ever and Canadian Natural is a low cost producer.</p>
          <p>One of our defining characteristics is our balanced and diverse asset portfolio. This allows Canadian Natural the ability to optimize capital allocation to maximize value. And just as importantly is the ability of our assets to free cash flow. In 2008 and in 2009, each component of our assets, oil, gas, light oil, heavy, thermal and Horizon will generate free cash flow.</p>
          <p>Our assets are strong and are low cost. The strength of our assets and their ability to free cash flow has largely financed the construction of our world class Horizon Oil Sands Project. With Horizon project now on and in a production ramp up phase, the free cash flow from our construction assets is now freed up for the alternative capital allocation choices.</p>
          <p>As we stated in our Q3 press release and conference call, the capital allocation priorities for 2009 were as follows: firstly, debt repayment; second, capital allocation to the highest return on capital projects between asset development, acquisitions, and share buybacks; and thirdly, dividends. We also outlined the CNQ's or Canadian Natural's ability to proactively adjust our capital spending to market conditions.</p>
          <p>If you recall, we had an executable inventory developed for 2009 of $7 billion.  We chose at that time to allocate 4 billion in 2009. Of the $4 billion allocated, approximately 2 billion is flexible capital that can be quickly deferred if we so choose. The remaining 2 billion is committed capital.</p>
          <p>In light of the current commodity price environment and in keeping with our priorities in 2009, we have chosen to defer $0.8 billion of capital out of our 2009 program and pay down our debt by $420 million. We've also increased our dividend to $0.105 per share.</p>
          <p>The 0.8 billion deferral of capital program is a proactive action taken as a result of weak commodity prices and for the potential for further weakness in commodity prices, particularly in the gas side of the business. At these prices, the current cost environment &#x2013; the economics for all but the very best projects are marginal. Although we have not seen anything appreciable to-date, as we move through the cycle we fully expect it will be much cheaper to buy, than develop reserves.</p>
          <p>In addition, we expect to see productivity and unit cost improvements on the development side of the business. Therefore, we're taking a prudent step to reduce our capital program now to ensure balance sheet strength and position ourselves for later in 2009 and in 2010.</p>
          <p>Of course we'll not make any property acquisitions if it adversely affects our balance sheet in 2009. And we cannot predict if and when any acquisitions would occur and therefore our production guidance has been revised to 1,272 to 1,328 million cubic feet a day and 331 to 399,000 barrels a day of oil, a 4% increase on a BOE basis year-over-year and a 12% increase entry to exit in 2009, and that's not including any potential acquisitions.</p>
          <p>At the current strip, this will generate a cash flow between 5.4 and $6 billion, allowing for significant debt repayment and putting Canadian Natural in a very strong position if a low commodity price scenario in 2010 were to unfold. In addition, we have layered on additional commodity price hedging that Doug will go over, to provide additional cash flow projection. Canadian Natural is taking a very proactive and a prudent approach to managing the company and positioning ourselves for the significant opportunity capture in the future, no different than we have in the past.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to our assets and briefly update you on each. Starting with gas in Canada, our gas production in 2008 behaved as expected in the upper end of our production guidance. Gas production in 2009 will again decline as we drilled significantly fewer gas wells than we would normally drill. Our reduced gas drilling program is driven by low and even lower expected gas prices in the short term.</p>
          <p>For your reference, we have an inventory of over 1,000 executable gas locations that could be drilled in 2009. And if we had chosen to drill these gas locations, our expectations would be for a 5% entry to exit gas production growth &#x2013; volume growth. However, with low gas prices and a significantly better economics for oil, we will drill only 142 gas wells in 2009. The majority of these gas wells are critical strategic, land expiry and drainage issue wells.</p>
          <p>One of the strengths of Canadian Natural is our balanced diverse asset base and as a result, we are not solely reliant on any one product to create optimum value growth. Our heavy and thermal oil assets in Canada outside of Horizon are very strong and will add tremendous value to Canadian Natural shareholders.</p>
          <p>As many of you have heard me say before, our heavy oil assets are the underappreciated, undervalued hidden gem in our portfolio. Our thermal assets alone have 33 billion barrels of oil in place, with 5.5 billion recoverable in our defined plans. Our plan is to add 300,000 barrels a day of heavy oil production in a very stepwise, disciplined cost control manner. Primrose East is our most recent incremental step, which started steaming in September of last year, ahead of schedule and on budget.</p>
          <p>The news at Primrose is overall good, however, we have experienced a recent setback. During steaming we experienced an event that released oil to surface on one of our super pads. This experience although the first for Canadian Natural, has been experienced three to four times before by major thermal cyclic heavy oil producers just as south of our properties. This event can be managed and operations can and will be returned to normal.</p>
          <p>However, to do so requires that we prudently manage the site with observation wells, passive seismic observation wells, and other mitigating measures as wells regulatory approval before we can start up normal operations.</p>
          <p>As a result of the time required to implement these measures, we have reduced our production expectations for Primrose East by roughly 12,000 barrels a day for the year. The good news in all this, and there is good news, because of this event we switched from the steaming cycle early to the production cycle. The production performance of these pads has exceeded our expectations by roughly 10% and we feel the overall performance of Primrose East is likely be better than budgeted in our plans, although delayed as we implement necessary measures to continue normal operations.</p>
          <p>Kirby is our next incremental 45,000 barrel a day production addition and we expect regulatory approval this year. Our original plan was to complete the detailed engineering design for Kirby in 2009 and begin construction in 2010. However, in light of the current commodity prices, we have taken a prudent step to put the detailed design work on hold until we can see greater certainty in the long-term outlook for oil pricing and more importantly, until we can see significant capital cost reductions that should, and will be achievable in this portion of the commodity price cycle.</p>
          <p>At Pelican Lake, our polymer flood continues to perform well as we continue to convert additional portions of the &#x2013; pool, to the polymer flood. As you know, Pelican is a world class pool with 4 billion barrels in place and &#x2013; between 350 and 475 million incremental oil recovery with a low cost -polymer flood.  However, we have reduced the capital spending at Pelican by dropping one rig and going down to the one remaining most efficient rig. As a result, we'll drill only 50 wells in 2009, verses the 107 planned. Our primary heavy oil program continues to effectively roll along and add strong value here. Here too, we have reduced our drilling program from a planned 485 wells to 316 wells in 2009.</p>
          <p>In the North Sea, our production has been holding steady as we prepare for significant platform maintenance work in 2009. We'll drill only one well from our platforms in North Sea in 2009 and we are currently completing this Ninian well, which on loss looks to be at our expectations and expect it to be on-stream by the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>We are also in the process of drilling the Deep Banff, high pressure, high temperature gas exploration wells. We expect to have results in Q2 '09, Canadian Natural operates and if successful will have a 36% working interest in the development. Our interest in the exploration well is 17%.</p>
          <p>Most of our activity internationally is in Offshore West Africa in 2009. And at Baobab, we are now completing the fourth well in the program with production expected sometime in April. On loss, this well looks very good. Our original expectation for the Baobab drilling program was to achieve somewhere between 10 and 15,000 barrels a day of incremental production. Although the fourth well is not on at this time, we expect to add 10 to 11,000 barrels a day of production towards the lower end of our range, as we ended up drilling some wells shorter than expected, due to the associated drilling problems.</p>
          <p>Overall, the Baobab program looks to be successful. Our rig contract will end after this well and the rig is scheduled to return to the original operator. Production at Espoir is slightly off expectations as we experienced some compressor issues in the quarter. These issues are now being repaired and we expect to return to full production by the end of March, with no real impact on production guidance.</p>
          <p>At Olowi, our shallow Olowi development in Gabon, we are drilling at pace on our first platform. The FPSO has now arrived at location and is moored up with the umbilical connections completed. We are currently completing the last stages of commissioning before we bring on the first Olowi well in April. We expect to bring in in the 2,000 barrel a day per well range and we'll bring on &#x2013; begin to add similar well types as we drill and complete the remaining wells on this platform and then move to the next platform.</p>
          <p>In addition, we will surely move up the platform to drill one gas injection well and then move back to the platform. The gas injection well is required to maintain reservoir pressure. Now before I turn it over to Lyle to update you on the reserves and finding costs, I would like to briefly update you on the cost side of the equation.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural is a low cost producer and in this environment, this is particularly important. It is  also important that we find ways to reduce our costs significantly, and return to cost levels more appropriate to the costs we incurred in lower commodity price environment.</p>
          <p>We are making some good steps in this direction through the better use of technology, innovative execution techniques, better productivity and some cost reductions on the service and supply side of the business. We do however have some distance to go as any cost savings particularly here in Canada that we have seen, have been eaten up by increases in steel prices.</p>
          <p>Significant cost reductions will have to be achieved before there will be any increase in activity at these commodity price levels. As you know, we're about to enter the spring break-up period in Canada, where activity is all but shut down. We will monitor commodity prices and costs very, very closely and do not preclude a further capital deferral at that time. We have the ability to defer up to $1 billion of additional capital.</p>
          <p>Our operating costs as well, will need to be reduced even though we are one of, if not the lowest cost operator for the various asset types in each of our areas. Here too we're making progress, but have, for example, costs such as municipal taxes increased 2.5 times since 2003 and now make up the third largest component of our operating costs on the gas side of the business. All these challenges can and will be overcome as our teams find more effective and innovative methods to develop and produce our projects &#x2013; products.</p>
          <p>Turning to reserves, Lyle will give you a quick update on our strong performance, particularly in Canada.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Steve. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Before I review the results, I'd like to mention that 100% of our reserves are externally evaluated, not just audited or reviewed. I'll be dividing my discussion into two segments, starting with conventional oil and natural gas reserves followed by our Horizon Oil Sands mining reserves. I'd like to point out that our Horizon Oil Sands reserves and capital are not included when we calculate our finding and development costs.</p>
          <p>Starting with our conventional crude oil and natural gas reserves, our 2008 net proved finding and on-stream costs were $20.68 per boe replacing 95% of our net production. The increase in our finding and on-stream costs from 2007 is primarily related to economic revisions in the North Sea due to low year end crude oil prices. In North America, we've replaced 118% of our net production at a very good finding and on-stream cost of $13.08 per boe. These results were driven by our continued success at Pelican Lake, our Primrose thermal projects, as well as good results from our high graded natural gas drilling and development program.</p>
          <p>Cost control remains a focus for the company and that's reflected in our excellent North American finding and on-stream costs. Low commodity prices at year end resulted in total proved economic revisions of negative 56 million boes. There was a 90 million negative from the North Sea, which was partially offset by positive revisions of 25 million boes in North America and 9 million boes in Offshore West Africa. The gains in North America are primarily related to deferring oil sands project payouts for our thermal projects. In the Cote d'Ivoire, low year end prices also defer project payout and under the terms of the PSA, the government share is reduced.</p>
          <p>On a net proved and probable basis, our corporate finding and on-stream costs were $14.66 per boe. This is anchored by our North American results, where net proved and probable finding and on-stream costs were only $11.30 per BOE. Our total net proved reserves remained essentially the same as last &#x2013; as year end 2007 at 1.96 billion barrels of oil equivalent made up of 1.35 billion barrels of crude oil and NGLs and 3.68 tcf of natural gas.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to the Horizon Oil Sands mining project, the net proved synthetic crude oil reserves were 1.95 billion barrels, which is an 11% increase over year end 2007. This increase is due to low year end crude oil prices, which defers project payout, thereby reducing royalties. Similarly proved and probable reserves increased to 2.94 billion barrels.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll pass it back to Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Lyle. Before I turn it over to R&#xE9;al to give you a more detailed update on Horizon, let me make a few general comments. As you've read in our press release, Horizon began production on February 28. This is a major milestone for Canadian Natural as Horizon will add steady, reliable production with no production declines for 40 years, with virtually no reserve replacement cost.</p>
          <p>Horizon is a world class asset and now that we are on-stream, will add tremendous value to shareholders for the next 40 years. We have spent considerable time, nine years, and just close to $9.5 billion bringing the first phase of Horizon on-stream during what, in hindsight, has been one of the most highly inflationary periods in memory. We have not taken any shortcuts, especially in the winter, to jeopardize the safety of our people or the integrity of the plant, rushing to get to first oil.</p>
          <p>Today we're in the production ramp up phase of the project. It has been extremely difficult to do the final commissioning and start-up in the winter, even more difficult than we had anticipated. The Horizon team has put in a tremendous effort in getting us to this stage in a safe and an effective manner. It will take patience and perseverance as we ramp up the production to full rates and increase plant reliability and lower operating costs on Phase I of Horizon. We are underway in Tranche 2 of our Phases 2 through 5, and Tranche 2 as we profile capital spending in 2009 of $120 million in 2009.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn it over to R&#xE9;al to give you a more detailed update on Horizon. R&#xE9;al?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Since the February 28 last Saturday and even a little before that, we have run steady at 55,000 barrel a day. We have produced so far over 350,000 barrels of naphtha, kero, diesel, and gas oil, a mix of sour and sweet blend. We're filling up the site inventory of our intermediate and final tankage right now. And we are working on blending the synthetic crude oil for the spec product for the pipeline.</p>
          <p>The diesel hydrotreater which is the last plant to be completed, is mechanically completed, and the commissioning is coming up to an end. We have started the plant on February 25 and we are still right now on the start up mode. In terms of turbines and the compressor, they have been run at design capacity. The next step for us is to heat up the furnace and sulfiting the reactor catalyst. And we expect to have this diesel plant in full reliable production by the end of April.</p>
          <p>So on this, I am turning back to you, Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks R&#xE9;al. In summary, Canadian Natural is in a very strong position. Our assets are performing well, our balance sheet is strong and getting stronger. Our balanced diverse portfolio allows Canadian Natural to effectively allocate our capital to the highest return on capital projects. In addition, Canadian Natural has tremendous capital flexibility and can pull back further on capital spending if we believe this is a prudent course of action to enhance the long-term value of Canadian Natural.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural is a low cost producer and this is a significant competitive manage in today's environment. We will continue to focus on lowering costs across-the-board, but particularly at Horizon, our new operation which will, in our view, present numerous debottlenecking, efficiency and effectiveness opportunities to lower operating costs going forward. Our assets, our balance sheet, our low risk development opportunities are all strong. Our management team is strong and together we have been through these times before. We are proactive in making a tough decision to not only survive, but prepare to capture the opportunities that will present themselves in this environment.</p>
          <p>And with that, I will turn it over to Doug to update you on our financial position and our prudent financial management. Doug?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve, and good morning. 2008 was a solid year financially and operationally for Canadian Natural where we were able to roughly balance cash flow and capital expenditures and exit the year with a very strong balance sheet. 2008 will be remembered for its economic highs; WTI at $147, NYMEX at $12 per MMBtu, the Canadian dollar at par with the US dollar and robust economics around the world. That was the first half.</p>
          <p>Today WTI and is at $43, NYMEX is at just over $4, the Canadian dollar is at $0.77 and the world economies are still trying to find the bottom as the liquidity balloon deflates like never before. Canadian Natural is very well placed in this new world due to its balance sheet strength, its diverse asset and production base, its strong cash flows and its liquidity position .</p>
          <p>The increase in our long-term debt year-over-year largely resulted from the translation of our US dollar long-term debt at period and exchange rates. This amount amounted to almost $1.5 billion of the increase. Our debt-to-book capitalization was 41% at the year end, compared to 45% and &#x2013; at the end of 2007 and near the midpoint of our targeted range of 35 to 45%.</p>
          <p>Debt to EBITDA is at 1.9 times, again within our targeted range of 1.8 to 2.2 times. We have initiated the retirement of the non-revolving credit facility which matures in October of 2009, with an initial payment of $420 million in February. It is our intention to retire this facility from an allocation of cash flow from operations which includes the proceeds from our commodity hedge program. This will be completed systematically over the period through October of this year.</p>
          <p>As we look beyond 2009, our revolving syndicated credit facilities are in place through June 2012. Our exit to the debt capital markets is good with strong and stable credit ratings and our debt maturities are very manageable at less than $500 million per year through 2012. Our asset base is very diverse and our production continues to diversify from conventional oil and natural gas to include new production of conventional streams in Canada and Offshore West Africa, as well as synthetic crude oil with a reserve life of 40 years.</p>
          <p>As Steve has discussed, our focus for 2009 is control of costs, control of costs and control of costs. This will further strengthen our cash flow. We have a strong liquidity position. At the end of 2008, we had $2.1 billion of available credit under our bank credit facilities. We are also actively managing our various counterparty exposures and believe this exposure to be relatively low.</p>
          <p>Finally, we remain active in the commodity hedge side. As you know, we have in place 92,000 barrels per day of crude oil puts with the floor of US $100 per barrel. In addition, we have crude oil collars on 25,000 barrels per day with a floor of US $70 per barrel and a ceiling of 111. These positions are in place for the remainder of 2009. We have 400,000 GJs per day of AECO natural gas physical sales contracts with an average price of $5.29 per GJ for the period April to December.</p>
          <p>And in addition, we have started looking at 2010, where we have in place 220,000 GJs per day of AECO natural gas collars with the floor of $6 and ceiling of $8, for all of 2010. We have also increased our ability to hedge up to 60% of the near-12 months of budgeted production and up to 40% of the following 13 to 24 months of estimated production.

          <p>In conclusion, we believe Canadian Natural will not only weather this period, but continue to grow and diversify. As such, we are very pleased to advise that the Board of Directors have authorized a 5% increase in our dividend to $0.40 (sic) [$0.42] per share per annum, from $0.40 per share per annum. This is our ninth consecutive year of dividend increases since the inception of the dividend distribution in 2001.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning. You highlighted in your comments and in your release strong interest in consolidation acquiring over drilling, and you've mentioned interest in doing that for some time now. But it seems like the language may be stronger than it has been in the past. And I wanted to see if you could comment a little further on thoughts regionally and size wise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks Brian. I think it's just purely coincidental that my language strength sounds stronger &#x2013; I'll try to be weak in the answer. So we think ultimately that there will be more opportunities. With this commodity price environment I think you'll see some assets be put up for sale in maybe distressed situations. And as we move further to 2009, we'll see probably more opportunities. I did say that we haven't seen that yet, but we expect to see it as we go forward. So we will leave ourselves that opportunity to adjust our capital program further if we see opportunities to &#x2013; rather to buy rather than to drill.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Could you give a little bit of detail as to maybe &#x2013; maybe you mentioned this. I apologize if I missed it, but what are the main drivers for the costs at Horizon dropping and should we still think of production on &#x2013; on a per barrel basis as sort of an mcf or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think the main drivers at Horizon are &#x2013; I think we'll be able to get production efficiencies. We see ways &#x2013; commodity prices coming down, chemical prices are down. We are seeing ways to do things more effectively with our labor. And obviously gas price is down so that's a big input cost. And overall I think we're just seeing better ways to run the plant.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Thank you. The next question will be from Brian Dutton of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Steve, could you give us a little bit of color first on the steam issue at Primrose? And second question is on the North Sea reserve write-down, the economic test there, what was the Brent price at year end and what would be the Brent price required to get all those reserves back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll talk about the steam issue and I'll let Lyle talk to you about the prices. As you know in North Sea, last year we had pretty high prices which added a bunch of reserves in the tail end of these platforms and this year we'll take that away. And Lyle will give you the numbers in the second.</p>
          <p>On the steam issue at Primrose, I guess the color is we have four super pads and they're fairly close together. The wells are drilled &#x2013; sort of go underneath some of the pads. What we've seen is oil has seeped to the surface, or it was seeping to the surface I guess in the past. We immediately shut down our steaming operations and started producing to relieve the pressure in the formation. That's why we've seen better results.</p>
          <p>It looks like we have seen this before in the operator to the south, in the same general area to the south of us. We may have a number of issues that could have created that. It looks like oil has come up maybe along outside of the well and worked its way to the surface. This is controllable and manageable. It has been shown proven by the operator to the south. And we are undertaking basically the same mitigating measures and expect to be up and running and steaming again sometime by the middle of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question will be from...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. We've got to &#x2013; Lyle's going to tell you the prices here at the year end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, for Brent pricing at year end &#x2013; December 31, 2008, Brent price was 41.76 US per barrel. That compares to $96.02 at year end 2007. So to get all of those reserves back, we would have to go back to the $96. But obviously it's going to be a gradual thing. As the price moves up, we will get incrementally more reserves back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So &#x2013; just so that I understand, is that there was no I guess cushion at the end of the last year in that $96 price or was there some cushion there in the reserves, that you need the full $96 to get it all back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Brian, what we do is &#x2013; the reserves are, as you know, are independently evaluated and we have really not much say. So at that price, it's really an operating cost issue how long you can run the platforms out. And at $96 price, constant price, obviously you're going to see the operating costs float a lot higher before you shut down the platforms and start up adding. And at $41, that comes a lot sooner. So if all things stay the same on the operating cost side, you would have to get back &#x2013; to get those reserves back.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. I had two quick questions. One was on the $2.35 billion credit revolver. Have you had any contact with the lenders to suggested that will be extended and what the terms of that will be at or whether it will still be as big?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that's the loan that we're intent on retiring by the end of October this year and which we made an initial payment in February of 420 million. And our plan is to retire that loan on a systematic basis between now and the end of October when it becomes due. So as a consequence, there have been no discussions with the lenders to extend that loan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And obviously you've made some comments around acquisitions. I had two questions around the Anadarko assets. Can you give us some indication of how close they were to an impairment on ceiling test and whether you've done a look back to look at the accretion or dilution from that transaction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll maybe answer in more general terms on Anadarko. Obviously when we bought Anadarko, we bought it at what we thought was a low price scenario and we expected the prices to increase over time. They didn't increase as quickly as we thought. We did get good increases in 2008. Overall the assets are as what we expected and in a lot of ways that helped to increase our position in the shale gas here in Canada and open up that for us in bigger way. So although the gas prices are not where we had anticipated when we bought Anadarko, overall the assets are very strong and we are very happy with those assets.</p>
          <p>As far as the ceiling test write-down, I don't know if you have any further comments on that, Doug? Or we can get back to you, Ben.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I don't have any comments on it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have it broke down in that detail.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to get back to the Primrose East question, you said you'll be steaming again in September &#x2013; or sorry, in the middle of the year. Does this change kind of how you go about putting these super pads together in the future for let's say Kirby or other projects of similar nature?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, it doesn't change &#x2013; these things, I guess happen and occasionally it looks like and they're random. At this point in time, we do not see anything that we have done that would have initiated this &#x2013; the way we will drilled the wells or placed the pads. I think we may &#x2013; I mean, we put more seismic &#x2013; paths of seismic wells around the pads so we can see if this happens sooner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But as far as new production at Kirby, that's the site which is a low pressure operation and we don't anticipate any of those issues at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the second question was Baobab, have you redesigned the wells so that you don't have the sand issues this time around? Have you seen any sand coming in initial production from the new wells?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, the last two wells that we've done have been very robust. We had one well where we had lost circulation issues. We were concerned about the effectiveness of the gravel pack. We are actually went back and assayed that well. Production is strong and we have seen a little bit of sand from that well, but nothing of significance. And it's all stuff that's designed to flow to the gravel pack anyway. So we believe that we have that sand issue dealt with. We'll see with time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning, guys. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the Horizon Phase 2 development strategy and maybe the spending tempo there? I mean obviously in the kind of emerging environment, it's a good time to build out projects, but how do you think about that expansion currently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, right now in Horizon Phase 2, we are going ahead with it, but as we said in November, we reprofiled the capital cost. So we're moving ahead with the third OPP and designing that crusher right now. Actually the equipment is ordered and will be delivered. And there will be more spending 2010 to install that. That'll give us a lot more production reliability and increase somewhat production capability. We're also looking at some CO2 techniques in the Tranche 2.</p>
          <p>As far as Tranche 3 goes, we are still doing some work internally on that. But we have not released any of the detailed engineering design which we wouldn't do anyway probably until 2010. So we'll wait and see here. I think there's opportunity. It seems that the Fort McMurray area is the last area in Western Canada to sort of recognize that cost reductions will be necessary. And we hope to be able to get more effectiveness, particularly on the productivity side.</p>
          <p>Going forward I think there's an opportunity to capture maybe 20 to 30% cost reductions in Horizon oil sands, just by better labor productivity. And in lower price environment we should be able to capture that. But at this point in time we're sticking to our plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's excellent. And do you have any individual pieces of work that you've seen cost reductions come in? Obviously there's a neighbor of yours with a yet to be developed project that is thinking perhaps a 25% reduction is in order versus their bid of last year. Do you have any kind of incremental data that would indicate that the bidding processes are loosening up a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have anecdotal data on small contracts that we've seen that reductions have been way more than 25 to 30%. I think I've told the story of the Tar River diversion where we've seen the first bids came in at 45 to $75 million, and we decided to do it ourselves and then had another bid come in at $14 million. So it tells you that there's tremendous productivity gains to be acquired if we can have normal activity.</p>
          <p>The problem with the oils sands is once things &#x2013; costs reduce and things get better, it seems that all the operators pile in at the same time and then we get ourselves right back into the same spot. So it's a difficult decision to decide on how to go forward and that's why we've decided to break the next phases into very small tranches. So we can control costs much better than trying to do make a mega project as we have done here in Phase 1.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Most of my questions have been answered. But could you please tell me what the impact is if any, also latest royalty incentives on the company's drilling program if at all? And considering all the incentives implemented by the government over the past few months trying to stimulate activity in the province, where do you see &#x2013; where do you need gas prices to be in order to start drilling more wells in Alberta?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jenny, I'll answer the first part of that question. And I'll let Lyle give you a lot more detail on the incentive program. Really we need to probably in that 650 to 750 gas range to really start ramping up our drilling program. And of course that will be dependent on what oil prices are and the other capital allocation choices for us at that time because we allocate to the biggest &#x2013; or highest return. The incentive program, I think, is a one-year program and is good in the fact that it helps us. It is only a one-year program and with the low prices, you will not see us change our activity based on that. Lyle, do you want to give us a little more update on what it is all about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I guess the program is very helpful to economics in Western &#x2013; or in Alberta &#x2013; for natural gas. We likely still need to get to at least $6 equal before we would really start to have an increase in the number of economic prospects we have. One of the negatives with the program is that it really doesn't address the long-term issues with the new royalty framework. So it is a short-term fix that is helpful and will help the economics of some of the strategic and expiry wells we are going to drill. As Steve mentioned, we're unlikely to change our program in 2009, and it doesn't fix the problems with NRF.</p>

But virtually all of the institutions that we deal with are also in our bank syndicate. We do have a couple of outside, but they are not affected by the situation that's out there right now. And we look at our banks, we see them as all being strong to very strong, and we believe that this is the group that we have our hedges with and this is the group that we will continue to do our hedges with and we're very happy with the counterparty risk exposure that we have today.</p>

          <p>Okay. Firstly on the South African well, our timeline is still 2010, 2011. I guess with the way the situation is now, our outlook for being able to acquire a rig to drill that well is suddenly looking better. But again that's in 2010, '11. So that's a quite ways out there. And we are actively in the market sort of feeling out what the rig availability is. I will say that we're in no hurry to commit to a rig. We see that there will be further softness in rig rates going forward. So it makes no sense for us to commit early.</p>
          <p>As far as follow-up processes at Primrose East, I'm glad you brought that up, because there's a big upside there for us to capture that's not really booked. On reserves, SEG-D and the follow-up processes are a variation of that &#x2013; are low pressure processes and will not affect &#x2013; this event will not affect that process whatsoever.</p>

          <p>Hi Steve. A couple of questions. First of all can you give us an idea of what the capital spending associated with the fixes at Primrose East might be? And the second question on the capital reduction on the oil side, how much of it is related to deferral of Kirby and anything that's happening at Primrose and where the rest of the reduction might be? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Kam, I didn't quite catch the second part of your question about Kirby and that, the sound here is a little bad.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the conventional oil spending reduction, how much of it is thermal specifically related to Kirby? And where the rest of the production might have come from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Go ahead Lyle, you can answer the questions. But really Kirby doesn't give us any production and I think we're just doing detailed engineering this year. That cost was probably in the 10 to $15 million range. So it's not a big part of the cost reduction. You can see by whatever wells that we're drilling less on the heavy oil side and at Pelican, you can see the ratio where the costs are coming down as far as Primrose East, Lyle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. At Primrose East, we are doing a bunch of investigative work there, logging some of the existing wells, doing temperature surveys. We're also in the process of licensing three observation wells that we want to drill there. And today we're probably estimating incremental costs of 5 to $6 million that we'll spend there this year.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question will be from Barbara Patanski (49.57) from UBS Global Asset Management. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. The question on Horizon, now you said you've had first production and you're proceeding to blending products. And I'm wondering when do you expects to see your first sales and I know it's going to be a bumpy start, but what are you sort of budgeting in terms of daily sales volumes until you get the final hydrotreater started in April?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess that probably the best way for us to tell you that is, we have between the tankage on site and the pipeline we fill &#x2013; that we have to fill about a million barrels of capacity that we have to fill. So we've got 350 done now, about 55,000 barrels a day, you can work out how many days it will be before we need to sell product. So we've got to fill our tanks and start the planning and then start shipping the pipeline and fill it up.</p>
          <p>Canada wants us to start very slowly, increasing the production rate as a push and take through the pipeline. But that's one of the reasons why we are at least filling the tanks. So I think of the million barrels divided by 55,000. That's probably 27 some days. And then we will be able to ramp production up as we go forward. But as you know, production will be up and it will be down. We're not going to be steady at 55,000 here for the next month or so.</p>
