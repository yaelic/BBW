        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our 2011 fourth quarter results and year-end results. With me today are our Chief Executive Officer, Asim Ghosh; our Chief Financial Officer, Alister Cowan; our Chief Operating Officer, Rob Peabody; Vice President of Midstream, Terrance Kutryk; and Vice President of Downstream, Bob Baird.</p>
          <p>In today's call, we will provide an update on Husky's business strategy and an overview of results, followed by a Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>Please note that today's comments contain forward-looking information. Actual results may differ materially from expected results because of various risk factors and assumptions that are described in our quarterly release and in our annual filings, which are available on SEDAR, EDGAR and our website.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Asim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you, Sharon. Today's conference call brings to a close what I'd characterize as a solid year of performance for Husky. Some of you may recall, a year ago, we were in a period of transition. We just laid out a five-year business plan, and that plan included clear financial and operational metrics.</p>
          <p>It called for production growth &#x2013; I'll just remind you of the specific figures &#x2013; 3% to 5% annual compound growth over a five-year timeframe. It outlined our investment plans for our three growth pillars in, respectively, the Asia Pac region, the Oil Sands in the Atlantic region, and the continuation of what I characterize as a balanced growth strategy.</p>
          <p>In summary, over the past year, our team rolled up their sleeves, and we focused on executing against that strategy.</p>
          <p>So let me summarize where we are. We've met or exceeded virtually all of our key performance targets. Production for the year averaged 312,500 barrels a day, which was at the higher end of our guidance of 290,000 to 315,000 barrels a day. And that's something like 9% up from a year ago, and that's our five &#x2013; versus our five-year compound growth target of 3% to 5%.</p>
          <p>And I do wish to stress, yet again, a point I've made before, the 3% to 5% is a compound annual growth target, and there will be some lumpiness in the trend, as we experience off-stations, such as for this year, and somewhat it's also influenced by certain major projects coming on stream starting end of 2013 and 2014. So this is not 3% to 5% year-to-year.</p>
          <p>I know it seems like I may be seem to becoming across, as repeating that point, ad nauseam. But I do wish to make the point for those people who have not been listening on our previous calls or not have not attended an Investor Day.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we are forecasting a reserve replacement ratio for the year in the range of 170%, which compares to our target of 140% annually for the period. Netbacks in the year were up 23% year-over-year, driven in part by stronger crude oil prices, the nature of our portfolio, which is &#x2013; and of course, most importantly, underpinned by strong and consistent execution, which allowed us to take advantage of this higher benchmark prices.</p>
          <p>We've now recorded four consecutive quarters of increased earnings, cash flow and production gains compared to the year ago comparable periods. And for the year, our earnings increased to 135% to CAD2.2 billion. Cash flow from operations rose 69% to CAD5.2 billion and we achieved a 5 percentage point increase in return on capital employed.</p>
          <p>Coming now to 2012, we are building on our momentum in a fundamental way. We announced the CAD4.7 billion capital expenditure program which allows us to build on the progress we have made in boosting near-term production. It supports the continued development of our growth pillars.</p>
          <p>Of the CAD4.7 billion, the cash outflow activity will be CAD4.1 billion recognizing that some of the projects are joint ventures and the early parts have a disproportionate carry from the joint venture partners.</p>
          <p>And just to give you &#x2013; I think, I believe I discussed this in the Investor Day, but just as a recap, about 85% of that budget is directed towards upstream and further off that, about 60% is being invested in our growth pillars.</p>
          <p>This program will enable us to achieve our 2012 production guidance of 290,000 to 315,000 barrels a day. And that guidance incidentally, includes the impact of planned off-stations for the SeaRose and Terra Nova FPSOs, which are one of the lumpy events I spoke about a moment ago.</p>
          <p>The results, I would say of the past year demonstrate that the company is on course and producing the desired results. And while we are pleased with the gains made, we do not by any stretch of the imagination believe it is time to declare victory. We recognize that the industry has had some help over the past year from strong oil prices, but there's a lot of work ahead and we remain on the task.</p>
          <p>And on that note, I'll hand you over to Alister.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Asim. As Asim said, it has been a good year for us, and the results in our fourth quarter continue to show the progress that we have achieved. Net earnings for the quarter were CAD408 million or CAD0.42 per share. That represented a 194% increase over the CAD139 million in net earnings or CAD0.16 per share reported in the fourth quarter of 2010. Cash flow from operations increased 75% to CAD1.2 billion or CAD1.24 per share compared to CAD685 million or CAD0.80 per share a year ago.</p>
          <p>When we're looking at the earnings, I want to point out two noteworthy items that were included in the quarter. We recorded a non-cash impairment charge related to natural gas properties in Western Canada, and we also had higher exploration and evaluation expense in the quarter, which by its nature tends to be lumpy. If we normalize for these two items, our underlying earnings for the quarter was CAD532 million comparable to the last quarter.</p>
          <p>Increased production was a key contributor to the fourth quarter results. Production rose 38,000 BOEs per day, or 14% to 318,900 BOE per day compared to 280,500 BOE per day in the fourth quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Now this was the result of increased production at North Amethyst and new production coming on stream at the West White Rose pilot, both in the Atlantic region, and acquisitions that we completed in Western Canada in the first quarter of this year and also increased production from the Tucker Oil Sands project.</p>
          <p>When we look at pricing in the quarter, the details are in the MD&amp;A, which is on our website, but I want to point out a few highlights. The average realized crude oil pricing was CAD88.97 per barrel compared to CAD68.87 a year ago.</p>
          <p>Natural gas, as you know, continued to drop with the average realized pricing at CAD3.24 per Mcf compared to CAD3.52 in Q4 2010. Now the upgrading &#x2013; the realized upgrading differential was CAD22.32 per barrel compared to CAD16.39 per barrel a year ago. While this is an increase on the year-over-year basis, we did see some tightening of the differential from the third quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>We also saw a similar trend in U.S. downstream. The realized refining margin averaged $14.80 per barrel compared to $10.97 per barrel a year ago, but the refining margin is down from $16.13 per barrel in the third quarter. When we look forward, we see continued strength in crude oil prices in the first quarter to-date of 2012, but that has been coupled with lower natural gas prices.</p>
          <p>We're also currently seeing high volatility in Western Canada crude oil pricing. Contributing factors to that are pipeline constraints, a strong Western Canada production overall in the industry and facilities issues.</p>
          <p>From our perspective, our focus and integration strategy allows us to mitigate the impact of this volatility. But we certainly acknowledge that there's going to be a timing lag potentially straddling quarters between upstream and downstream recognition of the impact.</p>
          <p>Some key points to keep in mind in respect to the fourth quarter and the remainder of the year, we remind you that the SeaRose FPSO will undergo an approximate 125-day maintenance off-station that commences in the second quarter of 2012. And as we have previously stated, the impact to our production averaged over the entire year is estimated to be about 12,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>The Terra Nova FPSO is also scheduled to undergo a 21-week off-station in the second half of 2012. And the impact to the annual production is estimated at about 4,000 barrels per day. You'll note that this outage is slightly longer than we &#x2013; than has been previously estimated by the operator and we have adjusted the impact to production accordingly.</p>
          <p>An outage will take place at the upgrader in the first half of the year to expedite hydrogen plant repairs and catalyst change out, and that I believe will last approximately three weeks. And the Toledo refinery is scheduled to have a minor turnaround mid-2012.</p>
          <p>Finally, our board of directors has approved a quarterly dividend of CAD0.30 per share.</p>
          <p>Now I will turn you over to Rob to talk about the upstream operations.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Alister. Earlier this week we held our Annual Safety Summit, some 150 frontline supervisors came together with our senior management and set a process and occupational safety agenda for the coming year. What we have consistently seen is that where we delivered a good performance in safety we also see high reliability in uptimes. A good example of this is the SeaRose. Since its commissioning six years ago, the safety record on board the vessel has been very good with no loss time injuries. Leading process integrity metrics are also tracked rigorously.</p>
          <p>And last year, the vessel achieved an uptime of 98% versus the norm of about 92% for FPSOs throughout the industry. The point here is that where we see &#x2013; where many see a tradeoff between production and safety, in practice, we see the exact opposite. Better safety leads to better business results.</p>
          <p>Turning to production. As Asim indicated earlier, a highlight for 2011 was rising production. Pipeline disruptions and flooding in the spring in Western Canada did impact our ability to bring on volumes, but by the fourth quarter production was almost 319,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>Looking at our activities in Western Canada, first in oil resource plays, we were active across the portfolio, drilling 35 gross, about 33 net wells in the fourth quarter. The Oungre Bakken project in south-central Saskatchewan continues to be a positive story for us with five wells drilled in the quarter. An additional 12 wells are planned for 2012.</p>
          <p>Operations accelerated at the Redwater Viking project in Alberta with eight horizontal wells drilled in the quarter bringing the total to 22 for the year. The majority of wells are waiting tie-in and are expected to be on production soon.</p>
          <p>In the southwestern Saskatchewan Viking play, 10 horizontal wells were drilled in the fourth quarter for a total of 16 in the year.</p>
          <p>On the basis of results to date, we're stepping up our drilling plans in the Redwater and Saskatchewan Viking in 2012 with approximately 50 wells planned. In the Northwest Territories, drilling commenced in January on the first of two vertical exploration wells in the Central McKenzie Valley.</p>
          <p>Turning to gas resource plays, I'll start with Ansell. Construction of additional offload capacity was completed in the fourth quarter, bringing total production capacity to over 50 million cubic feet per day and 2,000 barrels per day of liquids.</p>
          <p>At Kaybob in northwest Alberta, a drilling program was initiated to evaluate the Duvernay liquids-rich gas play. At Kakwa a three-well multi-zone drilling program was completed by year-end at the wells placed on production. Initial production is in line with our expectations. Meanwhile, we continue to keep activity levels in dry gas resource plays to a minimum.</p>
          <p>In our heavy oil business, we continue to progress our thermal developments and just to remind you, our goal is to achieve an increasingly higher proportion of heavy oil production from long-life thermal projects. Construction of the 8,000 barrel per day Pikes Peak South project was approximately 80% complete at the end of the quarter, and we expect first production from that project in the middle of the year. Construction of the 3,000 barrel per day Paradise Hill thermal project is also approximately 80% complete. Again, we expect first production from that project around the third quarter.</p>
          <p>A single well pair thermal pilot at Rush Lake achieved first oil in October and is performing in line with expectations. Our goal remains to increase our heavy oil thermal production from around 20,000 barrels per day today to approximately 35,000 barrels per day by 2016.</p>
          <p>Turning to our growth pillars the Liwan Gas Project in the South China Sea continues to moves forward. Fabrication continues on the sub-sea equipment, the platform jacket, the topsides and the gas plant. The platform jacket is expected to be installed this summer.</p>
          <p>As you may recall, the Liwan 3-1 and Liuhua 34-2 fields are being developed in tandem in the first phase of this project. Production from these fields is forecast to come on stream in the late 2013, early 2014 timeframe. In December, the government of China approved the original gas in place report for the Liuhua 29-1 field, and this is our third significant discovery on the block. Front end engineering and design will now begin, and this field is targeted to come on-line in the late 2014 and early 2015 timeframe. This is another significant milestone in the Liwan gas project's overall development.</p>
          <p>Offshore Indonesia, tendering of equipment and services from the Madura BD field development continued with first gas production targeted for 2014. In 2011 we drilled two successful wells in the Madura Straits block which confirmed additional commercial quantities of gas in the MDA and MBH fields. The MBH-1 exploration well drilled in the fourth quarter tested an equipment &#x2013; at an equipment restricted rate of 18.1 million cubic feet per day.</p>
          <p>The MBH field may be developed in tandem with the MDA field. A plan of development is expected to be filed in 2012. We plan to continue our exploration program in the Madura Straits Block this year with about six wells planned.</p>
          <p>In oil sands, phase 1 of the Sunrise Energy Project continues on schedule towards planned first production in 2014. Construction activities continue on site with the installation of the foundations in the central plant facility and delivery of the first major equipment. To date more than half of the 49 SAGD well pairs planned for phase 1 and have been completed.</p>
          <p>A contract for the Design Basis Memorandum and the front end engineering design for the next phase of the Sunrise Project was awarded in the fourth quarter. Front end engineering design is expected to be completed in 2013. In the fourth quarter, we also released the results of an independent evaluation of our emerging oil sands properties. Highlights included the addition of approximately 10 billion barrels of best estimate contingent resource to our bitumen holdings.</p>
          <p>Majority of the resource is attributable to our Saleski carbonate oil sands lease. In the Atlantic region, the North Amethyst satellite field continue to perform well with three production wells and three water ejection wells on stream at the end of December. An application was filed in the fourth quarter to amend the development plan for North Amethyst to include the deeper Hibernia reservoir.</p>
          <p>In 2012, development drilling will continue at North Amethyst in the Ben Nevis reservoir and an in-fill well will be drilled at the main White Rose field to facilitate incremental oil recovery. A water injector to support production from our West White Rose pilot will also be completed in the first half of 2012.</p>
          <p>So, in summary, this has been a year of progress for Husky on many fronts. Our 2012 capital program is designed to build on that momentum. We continue to transform our foundation businesses in Western Canada and our heavy oil business and well, we continue to advance the projects that underpin our major growth pillars.</p>
          <p>This time I'd like to turn you over to the moderator for your questions and after that we'll follow with some Q&amp;A and then Asim will offer some closing remarks.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instruction] The first question today comes from Mark Polak of Scotia Bank. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Two questions. First one, I was wondering if you could just comment on what reserve replacement is looking like for 2011. And the second on Sunrise, you mentioned the front end engineering and design for phase 2 would be done next year. Is the plan to move directly and to sanction them as construction activity on phase 1 is ramping down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob, do you want to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the reserve replacement comment, we gave &#x2013; at our Investor Day we set out that we expected about 170% reserve replacement this year. We're just finalizing all of the details, but I don't expect that's going to change a lot. But all the details of that will be in our AIF which will be filed in March.</p>
          <p>On the Sunrise point, I think the main thing is we are going to finish front end engineering on Sunrise in early 2013, and then both partners clearly ourselves and BP will establish the pace at which we move forward from there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Joe Citarrella of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. On the thermal projects and the Sunrise phase 2 build out, any color on how you're seeing capital costs trending there going forward and any indications of inflationary pressure as you're building out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay. I mean, just to reiterate, when we &#x2013; as we described at the Investor Day as well, we had a quite comprehensive strategy on cost control around the Sunrise project in particular. And we employ a contract strategy with a lot of lump sum components to it. And at the moment we have lump sum and convertible fixed price contracts make up about two-thirds of the total cost and about half these contracts have already been converted to lump sum. And we're all on schedule for conversion of the remainder at the moment.</p>
          <p>Drilling, of course, is reimbursable in the project and consists of about a third of the total cost. And as we outlined before that's going well, it's on schedule, it's on budget, and so we feel pretty good there. So we've substantially reduced our risk. I think the overall point on escalation is clearly we see escalation in costs across the whole industry with oil in this $100 a barrel region. So there is a little bit of a linkage here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're basically we're also seeing higher revenue. If you're seeing higher, costs it's related to higher revenue and the two seems to go together in this industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And then, my next question is just on the Ansell play. Given where gas prices are, could you speak a bit more to the economics there and your plans for 2012 and going forward? Do you see the liquids content as enough to keep you from needing to slow down the pace there at all? And then, I guess, a second question within Ansell, do you have any just general comments on how the JV process is going there? That would be great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alister, why don't you take that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, Ansell as Rob said is the key component of our 2012 plans. We've also said and I have said it many times is that we've put ourselves in a very strong financial position with the activities that we've undertaken. And while we're looking at a joint venture process, because that would only happen if it adds additional value to what we can do ourselves. So clearly we're looking at that &#x2013; no decisions have been made, and when we have something we would obviously tell you about it.</p>
          <p>From a development process, Rob outlined, we completed the construction of the additional offload capacity in the fourth quarter and are moving forward with the drilling program in 2012.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You had a question about the liquids prices but overall I would say the Ansell economics continued to be as good as anything that we can see in Western Canada.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's more liquids-rich gas, I would say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly we are seeing very low gas prices today. Well, Ansell has good &#x2013; is a reasonable project for the long &#x2013; a very good project for the long-term we believe. We'll adjust pace depending on opportunities as we see going forward here.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, gentlemen. A number of quick questions. Alister, in the deferred tax is there any kind rough guidance you can give us in 2012, 2013? In 2011, I think about 40% of your reported taxes are cash tax. How is that ratio going to look like for the next two years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think at our Investor Day in December, I think, I made the comment that we'd expect that the cash tax for 2012 and 2013 will be very close to 100% of the tax charge. Really two reasons. One is we've utilized most of our losses, tax losses we had in the U.S. from our refining business and moving, forward that will be cash taxable.</p>
          <p>And the second one is with the changing law around the deferral partnerships in Canada, we have to bring in to &#x2013; we have to pay &#x2013; the deferral remains over the next five years and that's about another CAD150 million to CAD100 million a year in cash taxes we'll pay next year. So it will be a net 100%.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And is that going to be the case that go beyond 2013, or that your investment in Sunrise and other area will start to make you back into, not really such a big cash taxpayer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct, Paul. As we move further out and as we stand, the expenditures ramp up. It will certainly bring down the cash tax charge. But we will have for five years the impact of the deferral partnerships, and that's roughly CAD200 million a year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And that, given the current gas price there, have you guys shut in any gas well or that you're just reducing your new drilling activity, but that the existing well you didn't really shut in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, let me take that. On the gas side, we have taken a lot of steps. And as I said in December, we've substantially reduced our dry gas development. Couple of other points to note is that, 2012 will focus on liquids-rich gas resource plays, such as Ansell.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About a third of our gas production daily, we actually use internally for our various facilities, whether it be the refineries of the upgrader, and in certainly thermal in Tucker. That will increase over time as you bring on new thermal projects in Sunrise. But we do continually monitor the environment and certainly. But at this price, we don't have any plans to shut in gas on the basis that it's still cash flow positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. A final question for Rob. Rob, do you have some number you can share with us on the year-end production <mark type="ph" /> exit rate (28:55) for the non-conventional shale play in your portfolio? Breakdown between oil and gas and also that what if you have any target for those then in 2012 and 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I don't &#x2013; I'm not going to give specific guidance on that at the moment. I think one of the things about the whole oil resource and gas resource play portfolio, as I think we've been conveying at the Investor Days, is we're still at our relatively early phase of development here and by the &#x2013; I think, my hope would be by the end of this year, we'll be able to give a much better feel for what this all looks like at our next Investor Day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. But can you share with us that what is the year end exit rate and maybe that if there's any data in terms of the 30-day IP or expectation of the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:43) per well and the well course background information?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Not at the moment.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Yeah, this is Ed Welsh with Dow Jones Newswires, actually. I just wanted to ask, you mentioned about the volatility in Western Canadian crude pricing. We saw really large widening and spreads. Could you talk about that phenomenon and how it's going to affect your business this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think the point that Alister made was to the extent that oil is backing up, there will be less utilization upstream. However, given our unique position of what we've called targeted downstream integration, we expect to recover the lost upstream margin in downstream, however, there is a timing lag because the time in which we recognize it upstream is sooner than when we recognize it downstream. There will be a straddling of quarters, but across the year, we expect it to be internally hedged.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. Given your refining capacity is going to protect you from some of this that might otherwise hit your business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Exactly. Though you make less upstream, but your input costs go downstream.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Yeah, my question is sort of along those same lines. I'm wondering if you have any sort of internal view on how long this situation might last with this huge expansion of heavy and even light synthetic crude differentials.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't. I think I want to hearken back to what I've said in previous Investor Days. As a company, we firmly believe in the merits of a balanced portfolio and internal hedges. And I think that diversification of the portfolios are proving to be a moderating factor in our results, has done so for the last year, and, as we get more and more focused on creating those balances, we just want to ground-proof company from such volatilities.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. A couple of questions, just first guys you mentioned in your MD&amp;A that completion of two Duvernay wells is expected in 2012. Should we be thinking about that as maybe first quarter here and maybe you have some results to share with your Q1 results? Or can you narrow down that timing at all for me?</p>
          <p>And then second question I guess would be on your Lima refinery, just wondering if the Lima refinery is seeing any discounted crudes flowing into the refinery there? I know that a lot of it comes up from the Gulf Coast area, but just wondering if there's a &#x2013; a portion of that is looking quite a bit cheaper these days?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> (33:27) first and then Bob you'll take the final one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. On the Duvernay fairly briefly, I would say is we have a vertical well into there, and we now have a horizontal well that we are hoping to get completed in the first quarter of this year. When we have some significant results to speak about, we will.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the Lima crude slate, we're using between 70% to 80% of our feedstock is on discounted crudes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you very much. Thank you for joining us. So I just want to summarize. On behalf of the team, I think in conclusion, we can say we have accomplished much over the past year, but we are focused on the path ahead. We do have some lumpy events which will affect us this year. So I wish to remind you of the two off-stations yet again, and secondly I wish to remind you of the point that the &#x2013; that the question before last addressed that given the volatilities that we are seeing in pipeline connectivities, there will not necessarily be a smooth quarter-to-quarter profit delivery because of the disconnect between upstream and downstream profit recognition.</p>
          <p>But overall our strategy is clear. The results demonstrate that the strategy is taking root and we are delivering against our targets. But we recognize much remains to be done. Thank you for joining us.</p>
