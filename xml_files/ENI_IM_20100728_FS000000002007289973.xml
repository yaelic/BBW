          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Eni SpA Update and Second Quarter Results Conference Call hosted by Paolo Scaroni, Chief Executive Officer.</p>
          <p>For the duration of the call, you'll be in listen-only mode. However, at the end of the call you will have the opportunity to ask questions. Now I hand you over to your host to begin today's conference. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our 2010 interim review. In the first six months of the year, we achieved strong results with &#x20AC;8.5 billion of adjusted operating profit, &#x20AC;3.5 billion of adjusted net profit, and cash flow from operations in excess of &#x20AC;9 billion.</p>
          <p>Our healthy cash flow from operations, coupled with some progress on our disposal plan, has reduced leverage to 41%, down from 46% at the end of 2009. I will propose an interim dividend of &#x20AC;0.50 per share to the Board of Directors, convening on September 9.</p>
          <p>During the first half of the year, we make good operational progress. In E&amp;P we are delivering on all our targets. In Venezuela, following the agreement with PDVSA for the development of Junin 5, we will sanction the first phase of the total capacity of 75,000 boe per day at the beginning of next year, targeting first oil by 2013.</p>
          <p>In Iraq, the Zubair rehabilitation plant including the major contracts has been approved by the first party and we are ahead of schedule with the start-up cost recovery by year-end. We delivered five major start-ups, while the start-up of Appaloosa has been postponed as a result of the moratorium in the USA.</p>
          <p>Production grew by 1%, thanks to our strong performance in Nigeria, Congo, USA and Italy, partially offset by weaker gas offtakes in Libya.</p>
          <p>The really good news of the first half has been the exceptional result of our exploration. We have added 600 million boe of resources mostly from Block 15/06 in Angola, Perla in Venezuela, Jangkrik in Indonesia.</p>
          <p>In Gas &amp; Power, overall gas sales were down 6%. In Italy, as expected, we suffered from higher imports, with the Rovigo LNG Terminal in the Adriatic Sea now running at full capacity.</p>
          <p>Our international business has, however, continued to grow, with sales up by 6%. This was driven by an excellent performance in the key countries of France, Spain, Germany, and the Benelux, while in Turkey sales were weaker than the previous year.</p>
          <p>Power generation performed particularly well with kilowatt hours sold up by 21% and an increase in our market share in Italy from 10 to 12%. Regulated businesses and international transport are doing well benefiting from the synergies in Nam and their higher volumes.</p>
          <p>R&amp;M performed better than expected in a still challenging environment. Refining margins remain depressed but cost reductions and enhanced flexibility of our operations are supporting steadily improving profitability. In marketing, strong campaigns by our competitors have caused a dip in our market share. We've, however, maintained satisfactory margins.</p>
          <p>I will now hand you over to Sandro for a more in-depth analysis of our first half results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paolo, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. In the second quarter of 2010, the macro environment showed positive trend compared to the same period of last year. The Brent price increased by 33% compared to the second quarter of 2009, averaging $78 per barrel.</p>
          <p>The average European refining margin Brent/Ural was $4.5 per barrel, up 15% versus the corresponding period of 2009. Finally, the euro depreciated by 6% versus the U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>Moving to our results, adjusted operating profit in the second quarter totaled &#x20AC;4.1 billion, up 62% year-on-year. This result mainly reflects the stronger contribution of the Exploration and Production division. Adjusted net profit in the second quarter increased by 80% to &#x20AC;1.6 billion, as a result of the good operating performance, partly offset by an increase of over 1 percentage point in the adjusted tax rate.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter of 2010, Eni reported oil and natural gas production of 1,758,000 boe per day. Production was substantially unchanged from a year ago, when excluding the effect of the updated gas conversion rate.</p>
          <p>Our performance was positively impacted by organic growth of 111,000 boe per day achieved in Nigeria, Congo and Italy as well as new start-ups and production ramp-up at fields which were started up in 2009.</p>
          <p>These increases were offset by planned facility shutdowns in the North Sea and in Kazakhstan, mature field declines, and lower gas uplift in Libya due to oversupply conditions in the European gas market.</p>
          <p>Libyan production in the second quarter of 2010 was 12,000 boe per day lower than in the second quarter of 2009 and 50,000 boe per day lower than in the first quarter of 2010. Second quarter adjusted operating profit amount to &#x20AC;3.4 billion, up 67% compared to the second quarter of 2009, mainly as a result of higher oil and gas realization in dollars, of the positive impact of the depreciation of the euro over the dollar, and of lower exploration expenditures. These positives were partially offset by higher operating cost and DD&amp;A.</p>
          <p>The overall gas volume sold in the second quarter of 2010, including both consolidated and associated companies totaled 18 Bcm, a decrease of approximately 6% year-on-year. This decline will reflects the lower volume sold in the Italian market, which is experiencing higher competitive pressure, partially offset by steady growth trends in the <mark type="inaudible" /> European markets.</p>
          <p>Adjusted operating profit decreased by 9% compared to the same period of 2009. In the second quarter adjusted operating profit doesn't include &#x20AC;61 million of gains recorded in previous quarters, but which could be associated with the sales of gas and electricity procured in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Gas and Power adjusted pro forma EBITDA for the second quarter of 2010 was &#x20AC;825 million compared to &#x20AC;821 million in the second quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Results in the marketing segment declined mainly as a result of slower volumes sold and lower margins in Italy due to increased competitive pressures as well as the unfavorable trend in energy parameters. These negative factors were partially compensated by the renegotiation of certain long term supply contracts as well as portfolio optimization.</p>
          <p>The regulated businesses generated &#x20AC;350 million, up 16% versus the corresponding period of last year. The increase mainly reflects the recognition of new investments in tariffs as well as the remuneration of fewer gas costs and higher volumes transported. Finally, international transportation results showed a 20% increase as a result of the return to full capacity of the TMPC pipeline, which have been damaged in an accident in December 2008.</p>
          <p>Turning now to R&amp;M, the utilization rate declined slightly year-on-year, but increased by seven percentage point compared to the first quarter of 2010 as a result of the announced integration of our production cycles.</p>
          <p>Second quarter results showed a significant improvement with adjusted operating losses narrowing to &#x20AC;52 million compared to a loss of &#x20AC;106 million in the second quarter of 2009. This performance was driven by improved refining margins on complex throughputs, mainly thanks to the reopening of light-heavy crude differentials in the Mediterranean area. Results are also benefited from the appreciation of the dollar over the euro.</p>
          <p>Marketing reported a flat performance due to lower volumes sold in Italy, reflecting a poor national demand for automotive fuels in the quarter and some improvement in the international business.</p>
          <p>Our petrochemical business has shown significant improvement after several quarters of poor performance. Operating losses declined to &#x20AC;11 million, compared to &#x20AC;146 million the year before, driven by a stronger demand and an increased market share.</p>
          <p>Saipem delivered adjusted operating profits of &#x20AC;343 million, up 15.5% versus Q2 2009. The other activities segment reported an operating loss of &#x20AC;51 million and corporate posted an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;75 million.</p>
          <p>At the end of June net debt was &#x20AC;23.3 billion. Our leverage decreased from 0.46 to 0.41 well on track for our target of a debt to equity ratio below 40% in the plan period. We have also been making progress on our &#x20AC;3 billion disposal plan. We have already completed sales of marginal no synergic assets for over &#x20AC;1 billion of which 800 million were cashed in by June.</p>
          <p>The completion of announced sales of some Italian offshore assets is currently on hold due to possible changes in the national environmental regulation, which could effect offshore operations.</p>
          <p>The sale of our European gas transport pipeline is proceeding as anticipated. For Transitgas and TENP we are arranging an international offer. While we are going ahead, with <mark type="inaudible" /> for a disposal of our stake in <mark type="inaudible" />. We expect to close all these transactions by year end. Thank you for your patience and I will now hand you over to Paolo for his closing remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sandro. In conclusion, E&amp;P, we're delivering on our strategy, with a healthily pipeline of projects coming on stream to support our organic growth. This year production will be flat, but will grow in the coming years, confirming our plans.</p>
          <p>Lower gas offtakes from Libya will be compensated by new production from start-ups in Italy, Algeria, Norway, Angola, Nigeria and Egypt. In Gas and Power, the lower demand caused by the economic recession and the unprecedented divergence between spot and long-term prices will continue to affect our short-term performance.</p>
          <p>2010 remains a challenging year for this division, with a possible decline in pro forma EBITDA. However, the second quarter showed some positive trends. Gas demand has begun to recover and the gap between spot and long-term prices have started to narrow. Looking ahead, we see the European gas market moving towards a situation where our large and diversified long-term supply portfolio will again provide a valuable competitive edge.</p>
          <p>In R&amp;M, we expect weak refining margins for the rest of the year. As a result of our increased flexibility and efficiency, this division would return to breakeven in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, our plan remains unchanged. We will continue to invest for growth in the long term interest of our company and its shareholders, while maintaining a firm financial discipline, a strong balance sheet and our divided policy.</p>
          <p>We will now be pleased to answer you questions.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from Mr. Alejandro Demichelis from Merrill Lynch. Mr. Demichelis, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Two questions, if I may. The first one is, maybe you can update us on the situation in Kazakhstan. We have seen some news over there, maybe how you see it going forward.</p>
          <p>And the second question is, there are some reports of you going to acquire some downstream assets in Turkey. Maybe you can explain us the rationale of putting more capital into downstream division at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me answer first the second question and then I would pass it over to Claudio for Kazakhstan. No acquisition of any downstream in Turkey. We have no intention of doing that thing. Claudio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kazakhstan, I think that you are referring to Karachaganak, so the discussion with Republic continue. And there are good discussions on the two arbitration process; I think that we are aligned. And we hope that by the end of the year, we can find a solution. So we are positive on Karachaganak.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great. And coming back to the downstream situation Paolo, you mentioned about a breaking even in the second half of the year. What kind of margins do we need to see before you break even there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Breakeven, which business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In the downstream business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In downstream R&amp;M, you mean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are expecting to have refining margins in the region of the $4, $4.5 per barrel. So more or less where we are today. For the rest, we think we'll be breaking even -- the only -- of course, question mark we have is the differential between heavy crude and light crude, which has been quite good in the first months of the year, worsening lately, but we expect to improve again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fantastic. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question from Mr. Jason Kenney from ING. Mr. Kenney, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Thanks for taking my question. You've had very good exploration success and the development start-ups continue to progress. Is there anything that's making you feel more optimistic that the significant contingency you maintain, the medium term volumes could be reduced early next year?</p>
          <p>And secondly, when do you think you can feel more confidence about raising the dividend? You seem to have an outlook for quite positive free cash flow cover at this juncture and it would be nice to have a signal on improved cash returns again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now let me answer, then maybe Claudio will add something about the first one. You quite correctly remember that we took a provision, so to say, in setting our targets as far as production growth is concerned.</p>
          <p>And I have to say that we did it rightly because the bad news of this year has been the fact that from Libya we are losing roughly 30,000 barrels of production simply because this is gas and demand for gas, particularly demand for Libyan gas, in Italy and in Europe is not as high as we anticipated. And we are &#x2013; we can still fill our target of a flat production this year despite this loss of the Libyan production simply because we had been doing better in other areas of the world.</p>
          <p>Now, we think that to keep a contingency is wise because there is always something happened somewhere. Nevertheless, we expect production to grow starting in 2011 as anticipated in our plan. Then maybe Claudio will add something.</p>
          <p>As far as the dividend is concerned we are not changing our dividend policy simply because our cash flow is improving or not improving. We said that we will review the base for our dividend, not our dividend policy, only if in the next plan we will have a different number than $65 a barrel, which is the number we are using today for our planning process. It is early days to say what will be the number we would use in our 2011 -- 2014 plan. This number will come out sometime later this year, possibly towards the end of the year. Claudio has nothing to add to what I've said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question from Mrs. Lucy Haskins from Barclays Capital. Mrs. Haskins, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Two questions, please. Firstly, on sort of gas guidance, do you think the chances are now that you will come in below the 3.5 to 3.6 sort of range that you gave us to steer to this year?</p>
          <p>And the second question regarding Iraq, and how you plan to account for profitability and barrels of production and reserves from <mark type="inaudible" /> either towards the end of this year as we move into 2011 and beyond?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will let Domenico to tell you something about our guidance for this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the decrease in demand, now also prices and the growing competitive pressure particularly in Italy has reduced the commercial margins in the last quarter. As a consequence today most of our longer term contracts are under revision.</p>
          <p>As Paolo said, there are signs of recovery of demand that we get between the longer term and <mark type="inaudible" />. However, in the worst-case scenario, for us means that the gap remains better today, that we don't penalize the supply condition by the end of this year. And this was a safe scenario. I would expect to decrease of the pro forma adjusted EBITDA of around &#x20AC;500 million in respect of 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question, about Iraq. So our Zubair project in Iraq is going very well. We are -- I understood you and I think that we are a growing company that has been through the experimental then rehabilitation project program. And we already award most of the main contracts for <mark type="inaudible" /> and for drilling facilities. So I think that &#x2013; if we are able to continue like that we will be able in the near further to count some barrels in 2010 and for sure in 2011. So I think that's &#x2013; so from Iraq up to now good news.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just go back the guidance in terms of the sort of gas. So you, in what circumstances will you formally sort of revise your -- or is this the formal revision of your guidance for this year in terms of what you just said?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Well, let's say, you are hitting a -- let's say, a tricky point in the sense that we are under revision right now of our major supply contracts. Now if this revision will go as we would like it to go then we think we can be closer to the guidance. If on the opposite, we will not be able to change the condition of our contracts, then in the worst-case scenario that is the market as it is, the differential between long-term prices and spot prices, and the present contract that we have will be &#x20AC;500 million worse than the guidance you had so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is it looking 3 to 3.1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Talking about EBITDA, we will be in the region of 3.7, 3.8, if I'm not wrong, Am I correct, Claudio? Okay, 3.7, 3.8 in terms of EBITDA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question from Mr. James Hubbard from Morgan Stanley. Mr. Hubbard, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Two questions, please. One, when you look at the kind of assets that BP now they are selling, basically mature decline, high intensity mature fields basically. Are those the kind of things that you think you have some core strengths in dealing with -- and so you'd be looking to be a net buyer of such assets around the world?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on the same kind of theme, you mentioned in your remarks that you are delaying the sale of your offshore Italian assets due to potential changes in offshore regulations. I assume you're connecting that to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill fallout. I mean what impact do you think there could be on Italian shallow water offshore fields? Is it reasonable to expect there would be any impact from what's happened in the Gulf of Mexico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Claudio, will answer both questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So first question, first of all, I want to remember that we don't need to buy or acquire any assets for our growth plans so it's not in our program to buy any producing asset.</p>
          <p>We're sure that we have some common asset with BP in Egypt and in Indonesia and we have the differential rights of these assets. So it depends and from opportunity point of view if they are going to sell those assets -- at the moment I don't think that is the case. Maybe we can plan, we can be interested. For the rest I think on the other part of the world we are not interested to BP assets.</p>
          <p>Second point is to &#x2013; after the BP and probably in the Gulf of Mexico our Ministry of Environment issued a decree that is not still applicable but in any case is a decree that is not &#x2013; that doesn't concern the past.</p>
          <p>So first of all I want to assure that there is no program on the past production. And for the rest we have to interpret it because there is some regulation for the really shallow water, 5 miles close to the coast and from our &#x2013; from looking at our assets we don't have any asset close to the coast in our offshore.</p>
          <p>So I think that for the future and especially for us for restoration, I don't foresee any, any problem for our future offshore development in Italy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, I had two questions please. So first, is it possible to give us some guidance on your expected 2010 asset disposal proceeds? And in relation to that if you could perhaps remind us of the position on Gulf.</p>
          <p>And my second question is on capital expenditure, if you could perhaps help us to understand what portion of the 1 billion annual increase is due to the stronger dollar? And what is genuine increase E&amp;P activity? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now let me answer the first two questions, I'll move to Sandro on the third one. On the asset disposal in total, we expect 3 billion this year. As far as Gulf is concerned, let me just remind you that Gulf has been a fantastic business for us. We invested &#x20AC;900 million and we cashed almost &#x20AC;1 billion so far between dividends and tax credits.</p>
          <p>Now the market value of our stake is may be in the region of &#x20AC;3.5 billion. Having said that, as I had the opportunity to say before, the situation of being a minority shareholder is not going to last forever. You know that we have a standstill agreement until the end of this year, so we cannot do anything. When this agreement will expire, we really evaluate all the opportunities that may arise at that time. Sandro?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as CapEx is concerned, Irene, you are right, we are forecasting an increase compared to our original estimate by 1 billion. And we can say that more or less half of this amount relates to appreciation of the dollar versus the euro and the remaining percentage which is the remaining half to the expenditure of the E&amp;P predominantly for optimization of projects for our production.</p>

          <p>Next question, Mr. Alastair Syme from Nomura. Mr. Syme please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Can I come back to the question on the gas guidance, again? I mean it seems to me that Eni has been negotiating with its suppliers for much of the last couple of years. Am I right to take it that the many of the negotiations that have gone on previous, presently delaying the problem with the hope that the markets is going to recover and now that the market is not recovering we happen to renegotiate things that have already been renegotiated, is that the way to think about this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Alastair, you are wrong. We negotiate when we have a window of negotiation. For example, I will give you just an example. The Libyan contract, which for us is an important one for many reasons, including for the fact that half of the gas is our own equity gas in the country, has a window of negotiation, which we negotiate from the 1st of October the price. So we could not negotiate before. We have not negotiated before. We started negotiation in the last few weeks. The only contract that we have renegotiated so far is the Russian contract for the simple reason that the window allowed us the renegotiation. Now we have the Libyan and in the next few weeks we'd start negotiating the Algerian contract. So it's simply a question of windows of negotiation, no renegotiation at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask you a supplementary, where are you at this time...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...relative to your take-or-pay obligations under this contract roughly, are we above or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, maybe Domenico will reply.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, we said it before, the different strategies that lead to the significant decrease of gas demand in Europe and a situation of over supply. We expect, we hope it will change, will come to &#x2013; and always there will be, we've seen already signs of that and we're storing the gas consumption and growth on the other sales, but it will be a bit of time before going back to the 2008 levels.</p>
          <p>As a consequence of this situation, our withdrawals from the supply contract are in below the minimum, so I expect that we'll find ourselves by the end of the year in a take-or-pay situation. Of course, do remember that take-or-pay means that you have to pay a quarter of the price of gas you are not taking and the cost at the moment, which in the future of next few years. If you take this gas you have to pay only the difference irrespective of what have paid already. So it's a kind of financial arrangement in fact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>By the way, I would like to add that in the negotiation we are undertaking now, we are renegotiating not only the price, but also take-or-pay conditions. So it is a negotiation, which involves every aspect &#x2013; every economic aspect of our long term supply agreement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that guidance for 3.7 to 3.8 worst case EBITDA includes maximum take-or-pay...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Includes maximum -- we had maximum &#x2013; take-or-pay does not involve anything in terms of economic impact. It is a balance sheet impact but we are not considering the take-or-pay a profit-and-loss issue. But this worst case scenario implies that we are not in condition of renegotiating any contract, particularly the Libyan and Algerian that we have in front of us within the next six months.</p>
          <p>I just would like to remind you that the next six months are particularly important because the campaign for gas start 1st of October. So ,let's say, what we can do in the next few weeks is very relevant for our results in terms of the winter campaign, which start the 1st of October and ends up by the 31st of March I think or April.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had a couple of questions, first of all could you update us on your tax rate guidance for this year? Then secondly, could you remind us what are the key FIDs that you intend to take before year-end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the tax rate is concerned the adjusted tax rate where -- you can extend more or less the same tax rate we experienced by the end of June for the rest of the year. So, we are forecasting more or less an adjusted tax rate in the region of 57% over the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we saw at the end of the year, we're going to sanction Zubair. And now we've got approval, so that is 100% sure. We have the Block 16 west hub in Angola, and <mark type="inaudible" /> in Russia. And early production of Perla and also the enhancement problem for <mark type="inaudible" /> so the &#x2013; we can say the second phase of <mark type="inaudible" />. And the FIDs projects that we are going to sanction totally this year, we'll bring in term of 2P reserves more than 1 billion barrel.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning to everybody. Follow-up question on the take-or-pay contact, if any. Can you tell us also what's the impact you expect in terms of net working capital in a worse case scenario you're not able to renegotiate this contract? And then as the confirmation of the further &#x2013; you do not have any further open window for negation with Gazprom until 2012. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now let me answer the second question, then I will leave either Sandro or Claudio some elements on the working capital. Now the final negotiations we made with Gazprom is from the 1st of January 2009. Yes, so the next window will be 1st of January 2012. 2012. Okay, on working capital, I am not sure we want to give you this number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. There are many uncertainties in fact, because we will know only after the end of the year what will be exactly our take-or-pay or exposure. At this moment, that's unpredictable what this number could be.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Last year we have already declared that the number relating to 2009 was a negligible amount of money. But we have already know this year will be more significant, but it is still too early to have -- to define precisely what could be the magnitude of this amount. But, however, it is amount which is absolutely in -- is sustainable as far as our financial forecast is concerned.</p>
