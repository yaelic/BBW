        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mar&#xED;a.</p>
          <p>Good morning to everybody. As you can see, our second quarter results show a significant improvement quarter-on-quarter, with a better performance across all the metrics from OIBDA to net income in underlying terms.</p>
          <p>OIBDA in absolute level rose on a quarterly basis, and profitability enhanced sequentially with quarter-on-quarter growth across the board. These results today show the benefit of our diversification, our key strength to face very different realities, with a posted positive revenue growth on the back of further commercial push and a very solid evolution in Latin America.</p>
          <p>On top of that, we have been taking bold actions to improve market dynamics and enhance our business model through efficiency gains, like the removal of our handset subsidies in Spain and a gradual reduction in the U.K., and the network-sharing agreements reached in U.K. and in Mexico. In addition, recent news about regulation in Europe point to a drastic change in the way the telco industry has been regulated in recent years, and is a very, very positive signal for the sector as a whole.</p>
          <p>On the financial side, we have taken decisive actions to improve the balance sheet and defuse potential risk, including an exceptional use demand of remuneration policy, which allow us to have a full year refinance maturity behind the end of 2013.</p>
          <p>We are managing productively our portfolio of assets with visible results year-to-date, and we have decided next actions, including preparations for an IPO of Telef&#xF3;nica Germany in the fourth quarter. And we continue making significant progress to enhance our growth profile and capture the significant growth opportunities arising in the digital space.</p>
          <p>Let me now review with more detail our first-half performance, starting with a summary of the key financials on slide number four. In the first half of both 2012 and 2011, we booked several significant exceptional items. So to better understand the underlying performance of the company, we are providing a P&amp;L excluding those non-recurring effects and non-cash impacts.</p>
          <p>January-June revenue grew 0.3% year-over-year to reach almost &#x20AC;31 billion, with underlying OIBDA topped at &#x20AC;15 billion, with a better performance in the second quarter. <mark type="ph" /> One did of the (4:37) CapEx operating cash flow came close to &#x20AC;7 billion. Underlying net income was over &#x20AC;2.8 billion, and earnings per share stood at &#x20AC;0.62 in the first half.</p>
          <p>Let me mention that both metrics significantly improved their year-on-year performance in the second quarter. CapEx to sales was 12%.</p>
          <p>The <mark type="ph" /> main (5:03) highlight of the second quarter results is the quarter-on-quarter increase in OIBDA across the main regions and key operations, as you can see clearly on slide number five. As a result, the consolidated OIBDA margin stood at 34.6% in the second quarter and expanded 180 basis points sequentially, leaving a significant lower year-on-year erosion versus the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>In my opinion, OIBDA reached the bottom in the first quarter of the year, and I want to underline that. It is my total conviction that the OIBDA reached the bottom in the first quarter of this year, and improved trends will consolidate in the second half of the year. And I'd like to highlight the better performance in Spain, where OIBDA was up 3% versus the first quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>The slide number six outlines how we are further enhancing our geographical diversification. We have increased our exposure to Latin America significantly in the last 12 months, representing circa 50% of key financial metrics of our results, with significant contributions from the individual market.</p>
          <p>And as you can see, we are not only highly diversified in terms of regions but also in currency terms, with a risk perception that is totally decoupled with the fundamentals of our business. Our exposure to Southern Europe or even to the euro is well below the exposure of other European players whose headquarters are not in Spain. And importantly, operating cash flow in Spain remains pretty stable quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>Our revenues, results and operating cash flow are clearly one with the most spread and diversified of the whole industry, as is shown very clearly in this slide. And we are not talking only about the diversification, but also about reforming our business model from a traditional telco to a digital telco where growth opportunities are very, very large.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> The array (7:22) in the coming transformation a wider parts of the economy, including security, education, public administration, health, financial service and other areas that represent between 35% and 40% of GDP &#x2013; with an addressable market for us of up to 2%, which is nearly double the market today of the telco industry &#x2013; represents a tremendous opportunity, and I can assure you Telef&#xF3;nica will not miss this huge opportunity.</p>
          <p>As you can see in the slide number eight, telcos can use three models to capture the value coming from digitalization wave: as connectivity providers, as an enabled retailer, or as a service provider. Connectivity plays in our strengths &#x2013; infrastructure and spectrum among others. We expect this to remain our strongest play for the coming future. Digital service and complements &#x2013; the more are being used, the better clearly for us. Here we had made already a number of announcements on fiber and LTE deployment, network-sharing agreements, and tariff initiatives.</p>
          <p>We see enabler-retailer role very important. This is where our asset base complement all the players in our ecosystem. This is about creating new markets, not taking markets from someone else. Here again, we <mark type="ph" /> progress a regimen (8:56) on many fronts.</p>
          <p>Digital services, we would need to maintain relationship and customer engagement on few selected services, for example, communications, financial services and other. We will be selective and focused on some of those services where we can make a clear difference with further opportunities to come in the coming future. It will be our big innovative, develop and self-produce behind connectivity to social needs, and to be a catalyst for change in business value chains, while reinforcing our core business.</p>
          <p>Our view of digital telco, none of these three models, but it's really one of the combination of those three models. Eventually, with differences is work depending on the local market conditions. This is the reason why we organized Telef&#xF3;nica the way we did. Different divisions working together towards a common goal with different roles, responsibilities, assets and skill set. And we have done that clearly ahead of our peers.</p>
          <p>And now let me hand it over to Angel for a detailed review of our operating and financial performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, C&#xE9;sar.</p>
          <p>Please turn now to slide number nine. In the second quarter of 2012, we continued to regaining commercial momentum, despite strong competition across countries. Our customer base surpassed the $610 million mark at the end of June, 6% more than a year ago, driven by the growth in key strategic areas.</p>
          <p>Strong focus on the smartphone adoption fueled the solid 18% growth in mobile net adds versus the first half of 2011. Smartphone net adds grew 40% versus last year figure, with growth rate reaching 99% in Latin America. In parallel, we are advancing a transformation of our fixed line businesses with a selective deployment of ultra broadband services, in those markets where there is potential demand and appropriate regulation and competition. Approximately 24% of our fixed accesses are currently ready for commercial ultra broadband services, and out of them, around 7% are already connected.</p>
          <p>As the slide number 10 shows, revenue growth was driven by the robust performance at Telef&#xF3;nica Latin America and mobile data across the group, offsetting headwinds in Europe. Data revenues continued to deliver a sustained ramp-up in their quarterly year-on-year increase and over the account for 55% of mobile service revenue on the back of a profitable data monetization, leveraging tier pricing along with integrated tariffs.</p>
          <p>I would like to stress the marked sequential slowdown in OpEx in the second quarter of 2012, reflecting the continued focus on efficiency improvements and eased commercial cost growth on the back of the new handset policy in Spain. As a result, consolidated OIBDA improved its year-on-year trend in the second quarter and EBTIDA margin expanded 180 basis points sequentially. Year-on-year, margin erosion also improved by almost 100 basis points versus the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Please turn now to slide number 11 to start with our Latin American operations, where business fundamentals remain sound. Organic revenue growth rates keep healthy levels, driven by a double-digit growth in mobile, thanks to sustained commercial activity with gross adds growing above 20% in the first six months.</p>
          <p>Smartphones adoption continues booming in our base, more than doubling its penetration on the base year-on-year. Mobile revenue growth is fueled by strong mobile service revenues on the back of increased data consumption and growth in voice services. The weaker performance in the fixed business is strongly affected by specific factors in Brazil in the quarter. Increasing mobile traffic is affecting traditional fixed business. However, our exposure to traditional fixed voice is just 20% of revenues in the region while the remaining 80% keeps growing almost at double digits.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide number 12. Our OIBDA in the second quarter showed the sequential improvement. It was higher than in first quarter in absolute terms, but it also improved both in terms of year-on-year evolution and margins.</p>
          <p>In such a diversified portfolio, there are, as always, negative and positive impacts affecting quarterly performance with our sales and some other specific factors in Argentina, Venezuela and Brazil affecting margin evolution. However, efficiency gains were visible in the quarter, supporting the quarter-on-quarter margin improvement.</p>
          <p>In terms of year-on-year comparisons, profitability continues to be explained by the increased commercial activity in 2012 and the higher effort in transformation towards mobile data. Year-on-year commercial efforts will be more comparable in the second half of the year, leading to a lower margin erosion.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 13 to review our Brazilian operations. We continue to read the market, leveraging our differential propositions, both in terms of asset and strategy. Our focus on providing superior service quality is clearly bearing fruits.</p>
          <p>Telef&#xF3;nica Brazil maintained a strong commercial activity in the quarter, with mobile net additions up by almost 30% year-on-year. Smartphone users multiplied by three times versus June 2011.</p>
          <p>VIVO is leading mobile broadband adoption in the market, on the back of its superior 3G coverage and network quality, which are clearly visible at revenue level. Data already accounts for more than 25% of mobile service revenue, a benchmark in the market. We aim to continue leading quality in the Brazilian market, and for this, we keep investing strongly for the future, as shown by the recent acquisition of spectrum.</p>
          <p>In the Fixed business, we're accelerating the transformation, speeding up ultra broadband connections with increased CapEx in the second half of the year to enhance commercial momentum in the fixed broadband market. I would also like to highlight the successful rebranding, and just one quarter after marketing our fixed business under the VIVO brand, the company is leading customer satisfaction in Brazil.</p>
          <p>In terms of financials, revenue growth in Brazil continues to be sound, with marked differences between businesses. Mobile service revenues kept growing pretty nicely at over 13% year-on-year, ex-regulation, with pretty strong prepaid top-up levels and no signs of slowdown.</p>
          <p>In terms of fixed-to-mobile substitution, it should be noted that mobile service revenue expansion is more than 2.5 times the erosion in traditional fixed voice revenues, resulting in the net of both impacts being clearly positive.</p>
          <p>Fixed revenue performance quarter-on-quarter was impacted by several issues, with two-thirds of the weaker performance explained by nonrecurrent factors. This include full consolidation of TVA from second quarter 2011, retroactively to 1 January of that year, which means that in Q2 2011, we included six months of TVA's results, instead of just three months. They also include the seasonality associated with different execution of projects in the corporate segment. On the other hand, OIBDA improved sequentially, both in absolute terms and in margin.</p>
          <p>Moving to our operations in the Southern Region on slide 15. The highlights are that revenue growth remains strong across key countries, mainly fueled by the strong commercial activity and solid mobile data revenues. Especially remarkable is the good growth recorded in Peru and Argentina with top line in Columbia being hit in Q2 by seasonality of IT projects. Chile continued to deliver a steady performance amid increased competition. OIBDA level as we already explained there are different specific factors impacting performance in the quarter, especially in Argentina and Peru.</p>
          <p>On the next slide number 16, we summarize the results recorded in the Northern region. Let me highlight that Mexico is already showing revenue growth in the second quarter, a significant progress from previous quarters and just one year after the introduction of aggressive MTR cuts. In addition, the recently announced agreement with Ucell and our new commercial proposition will drive further benefits.</p>
          <p>Let me now give you our performance in Europe starting on slide 17. We have regained commercial momentum across our footprint over the second quarter on the back of the good traction of our refreshed tariffs and term reduction, which led to a strong performance in mobile contract net adds, up 22% quarter-on-quarter. Moreover, focus on expanding smartphones led to a 32% penetration rate.</p>
          <p>Improved commercial results were compatible with a better OIBDA evolution. OIBDA reached a growth to &#x20AC;2.7 billion in the second quarter, up 6.3% quarter-on-quarter, leveraging a sharp cut in commercial costs, down close to 7% in the quarter. As a result, margin improved sequentially to 35.5% in the quarter with further benefits to come from our recent decisions to improve profitability across markets. Top line continued to be impacted by the intense macroeconomic, competitive and regulatory pressures.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 18, to review our operations in Spain, I would like to highlight that our plan to revert the situation is starting to yield positive results. Our initiatives to recover competitiveness through our proactive migration of customers in the consumer segment through our refreshed tariffs have led to more than two-thirds of fixed broadband customers and over 50% in the mobile contract business already enjoying better propositions.</p>
          <p>The major benefit from this fast repositioning is the sharp churn reduction across services, which has become more visible in Q2, leading to a much better evolution of net adds quarter-on-quarter, especially in mobile contract segment. Please note this, that net adds in contact voice accesses were already positive in May and June. On the other hand, the rapid adoption of the new tariffs is negatively impacting ARPU, though we expect ARPU erosion to ease from Q4 on the anniversary of the new portfolio.</p>
          <p>The second key lever of our turnaround plan is the implementation of a new industrial model to enhance efficiency. On this front, results are also evident. Our decision to remove mobile subsidies for new customers from March was followed by some competitors, leading to lower activity volumes in the portability market, with a better trend in our net results despite the introduction of the 24-hour portability from June 1.</p>
          <p>Subsidies removal is driving significant net savings in commercial costs, which are already flowing into the P&amp;L. Additionally, improved quality has led to a strong reduction in customer claims, driving further cost savings.</p>
          <p>Efficiencies gains are also coming from the rapid completion of the redundancy program in the fixed line business, positioning us well ahead of our peers, to benefit from the sector transformation derived from the new regulatory framework in Europe. We have already done our homework to adopt the cost structure of the legacy businesses, with very material savings in personnel costs, close to &#x20AC;120 million in the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>The gradual improvement in operating performance and a tight cost management make us comfortable to assess that our Spanish business reached the bottom in the first quarter. With a better financial performance expected for the coming quarters, as we fully capture the benefits from the new commercial model and the head count redundancy plan. This better revolution was already visible in Q2.</p>
          <p>OIBDA reached over &#x20AC;1.7 billion in the second quarter, increasing sequentially. OIBDA margin also expanded quarter-on-quarter, reaching 45% in the quarter, with a very limited year-on-year erosion. This performance was achieved despite the increased top line pressure in the fixed business.</p>
          <p>Mobile service revenue remained more resilient in April to June, with a much lower sequential deterioration than in the previous quarter, where we recorded a positive impact from the midyear. This performance is explained by a low impact from our loyalty programs, which offset the negative drag from the termination of a contract with an MVNO in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Enhanced quality and lower churn are also driving CapEx efficiencies. Despite the significant higher budget for fiber investment in 2012, 30% up year-on-year, total CapEx in Spain will be down versus 2011, further supporting an improved operating cash flow year-on-year performance versus 2011 along the year.</p>
          <p>On top of that, let me stress that the recent news from regulation will be particularly positive for our business in Spain where abundant local loop prices are well below the European average.</p>
          <p>Please turn now to slide 20 to review operation in the U.K. Telef&#xF3;nica U.K. consolidated its improved market momentum in the quarter, expanding its mobile base on increasing contract gross adds, up 26% year-on-year in Q2 and a sustained contract churn improvement. As a result, contract net adds grew sharply totaling 251,000 in Q2 with further increases in the contract mix to 51% over the total base. At the same time OIBDA performance improved, rising quarter-on-quarter on the back of efficiency measures and contention and commercial expenses, as the company gradually lowered handset subsidies and upgrades slowed down. This resulted into a sequential OIBDA margin expansion to reach 23.4%.</p>
          <p>The better trading activity led to a consistent improvement of revenue trends with mobile service revenues ex-MTRs, consolidating their stabilization trend. Non-SMS data sales growth accelerated to 19.5% in the second quarter, on the back of successful data monetization strategy. We expect to continue strengthening mobile service revenue in the second half of the year, despite competitive pressures in the market.</p>
          <p>In Germany, our strong franchise continues to deliver a solid set of results as the slides 21 and 22 show. Our new commercial approach, adapting our contract portfolio with the launch of O2 Blue reinforce value for money propositions. LTE tariffs recently launched an additional focus, are delivering continuous churn improvements and a steady mobile base expansion, with a better customer mix as contract segment already accounts for 52% of our mobile base.</p>
          <p>The strong commercial momentum has led to consistent market share gains, especially among higher value customers, reaching a 19% share in the contract segment and reflecting our marketing in smartphone penetration. Additionally, the strong investments in recent years to expand our distribution channels, our solid network and the spectrum to exploit the mobile data opportunity leave us in the best position to capture future growth in the effective German market.</p>
          <p>We experienced solid trading momentum and ARPU growth year-on-year and sequentially. Leverage on better contract mix and higher consumer spend due to successful data monetization. All of these flow into financials, with mobile revenues growing 11% year-on-year in the second quarter and total revenues accelerating their growth trend to close to 7%.</p>
          <p>OIBDA is up close to 13% both quarter-on-quarter and in the first half, on the back of strong top line performance and efficiency measures driving an OIBDA margin expansion to 25.7% in the second quarter. January to June operating cash flow increased by 13.4% year-on-year, showing the strong acceleration in growth from top line to cash generation.</p>
          <p>To finalize with the operating performance, let me update you on our guidance for 2012. Last February, we gave our guidance for revenue growth about 1% in current terms at the specific foreign exchange assumptions. However, given weaker than anticipated macroeconomic conditions and a stronger drag from regulation than previously envisaged, we now expect to deliver flat to positive revenue growth by year end.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, we've reiterate it our expectation for OIBDA margin erosion in 2012 that will be lower than in 2011 with a better year-on-year evolution in the second half of the year, driven by better year-on-year comparisons in commercial activity, net savings in commercial costs in Spain and further cost efficiencies across countries. On top of that, operating synergies in Brazil will become visible in the coming months. CapEx to sales guidance remains unchanged at similar levels than in 2011.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to the financial side on slide number 24. Net financial debt increase in the quarter is mainly related to the timing of the dividend payment and the execution of the share buyback, which coupled with negative FX movements, commitments, cancellation and the impact of temporary financing offset positive free cash flow generation and the &#x20AC;1.5 billion debt reduction from the closing of the Columbian restructuring.</p>
          <p>Further positive impacts from our asset rationalization strategy will be visible in the short term. We have already got all the necessary regulatory approvals for the partial sale of our stake in China Unicom, which will effectively reduce our debt burden from July 30. This coupled with the sale of our stake in Hispasat will contribute with &#x20AC;1.3 billion cash proceeds.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow generation will improve in the second half of the year on the back of better operating performance and the unwinding of the working capital consumption recorded in the first half of the year. Debt reduction will be significantly accelerated by the shareholder remuneration measures announced yesterday that will generate significant cash savings.</p>
          <p>We maintain a solid liquidity position with debt maturities covered until the end of 2013. This comfortable position is driven by our strong activity in the bond and credit markets since the beginning of the year and the recent adjustments of our remuneration policy, which improved liquidity immediately and reduces refinancing risk.</p>
          <p>We fully refinanced 2012 maturities in the first quarter, and we have also reduced 2013 maturities by nearly &#x20AC;1 billion to &#x20AC;6.7 billion. Our cash position excluding Venezuela stood at over &#x20AC;5 billion at the end of June, while total undrawn credit lines amount to &#x20AC;8.9 billion with over 80% maturing long-term.</p>
          <p>It is worth to highlight the geographic diversification of undrawn credit lines, with about one-fourth of them signed with Spanish institutions while American and Asian banks represent another fourth and the rest being widely split among diverse other European countries. Let me say that although credit markets have deteriorated, we have demonstrated our ability to refinance and extend existing credit line maturities for an amount of &#x20AC;2.4 billion in the year.</p>
          <p>We are also benefiting from our geographic diversification and in the current credit environment, we have recently secured full underwriting of a BRL2 billion debentures issuance that will be closed in the coming weeks. Effective interest costs have increased in the quarter though continue to remain at the middle part of our guidance. And the acceleration and debt reduction will lead to lower than anticipated financial expenses affecting positively the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>Let me now hand it back to C&#xE9;sar.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Angel.</p>
          <p>Let me stress that we are fully committed to enhance our financial flexibility and to deliver our leverage targets for year-end. In the current extremely challenging economic and financial environment, exogenous factors are creating severe instability and are exacerbating potential financial risks.</p>
          <p>These factors are clearly behind Telef&#xF3;nica control. It is crucial that the company takes definitive steps to effectively diffuse potential risk. In consequence, the Board of Directors decided yesterday under the criteria of prudent administration, it is in the best interest of the Telef&#xF3;nica's stakeholders that dividend in share buyback term corresponding to 2012 be cancelled as a one-time exceptional measure.</p>
          <p>The rationale behind this decision are: first, to further strengthen the balance sheet; second, to substantially accelerate their resolution in the short-term; third, to decouple from exogenous micro factors affecting our country of domicile; fourth, to immunize from debt market liquidity conditions by having refinanced maturity behind 2000 &#x2013; the end of 2013; fifth, to de-risk the execution of the early announcement of the portfolio management; and sixth, to continue investing in profitable growth in our operations.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we are fully committed with the execution of the already-announced portfolio management and asset divestment program, including the sale of Atento and the IPO of Telef&#xF3;nica Germany in the fourth quarter of this year in the analysis of potential listing alternative for Latin American business. On top of that, we are continually monitoring market conditions to make further selective asset monetization. All of these actions should help to reduce the company risk position to levels that are aligned with our business fundamentals.</p>
          <p>To sum up, in second quarter we have delivered OIBDA performance across metrics from OIBDA to net income in underlying terms. Our risk position is clearly decoupled from business fundamental, and does not reflect our best-in-class diversification. OIBDA improved materially quarter-on-quarter, with sequential increases across operations. And OIBDA margins performance in the first half of the year is consistent with our 2012 guidance, with the better evolution expected for the second part of the year.</p>
          <p>We have taken further initiatives to optimize resources and improve business profitability. And in the current extremely challenging economic environment, we are undertaking actions to improve balance sheet and diffuse potential risk. And we are clearly making significant progress in our journey to become a total digital telco.</p>

          <p>Great. The first one is on Spain. While the wireless business has stabilized on the quarter-on-quarter basis wireline seems to have accelerated the downturn. Could you explain what is behind that and is that something which will continue throughout the year? And second one would be on the credit lines. Are the credit lines entitled to any rating? Or with other words, could they be cut or pulled if your rating gets downgraded by two more notches in any case? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking your question on the evolution of the wireline business revenues in Spain, let me say that this is partially due to an induced movement that we have been doing in actively migrating our most valuable broadband customers to our lower tariff and therefore right now more than two-thirds of our customers in broadband have already migrated to new tariffs and this has created a short-term impact on the revenue growth.</p>
          <p>But at the same time, we have been able to manage a better average margin per user performance, because churn has been significantly reduced and before that we used to have probably 50% of the customers are already stepping out of a promotion, leaving the company for another supplier. Right now we are able to preserve those customers. And that jointly with the fact that we're significantly increasing the quality of our services here in Spain, means that churn are at historically low levels in Spain. So it is true that has been affecting the short-term additionally to the macroeconomic conditions. Revenue performance in Spain that would stabilize progressively, but we have a much more loyal customer base, much lower churn, much better operation and metrics and a margin evolution.</p>
          <p>And on top of that, that's going to have a significant impact on lower CapEx, because the effort of preserving those customers is definitely stalling &#x2013; or getting more customers from the outside was putting significant pressure on CapEx. So overall it is true that that has been affecting our revenues in this quarter and is probably going to be affecting in the coming months. But the overall equation is positive as it is further contributing to a further, to a bigger margin per customer and the lower intensity of CapEx. By the way, the equation is solidly based on the fact that churn is at historically low levels.</p>

          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I wanted to go back on your positive comments about the European Commission policy statement on fiber and I wanted to ask you two things. Firstly, how that statement is going to change your fiber strategy, let's say, over the next 12 to 18 months? And secondly, picking on the point that the commission emphasizes that they endorse a technology-neutral approach, whether this statement will push your network architecture more towards the fiber to the node compared to fiber to the premises?

          <p>This is Julio Linares. Thank you for your question. Our view on new regulatory policy for Europe is positive as it is for the investment community. We really believe that there is significant change in the right direction that this is addressing the first priority for the European market trying to achieve a less regulated policy framework that is the most adequate one, in order to push and stimulate investment around next-generation access network.</p>
          <p>As you know, there are two new recommendations coming with this general policy that has one for non-discrimination, and the second one around cost methodology, to be applied for the determination of the regulated wholesale services. That will take several months, and then it will be very unlikely that will have <mark type="ph" /> a real team part (40:33) in the next six months. But of course, it will be a very positive impact for the next coming months.</p>
          <p>Saying that, in addition to this general framework, I think it is very positive to take into account that there are not going to be any pressure on the current <mark type="ph" /> money (41:00) local loop prices. On the other side, taking into account our prices in Spain, we have even an upside possibility here.</p>
          <p>I think, as you said, that it is very important that this policy is technologically neutral. But we don't see any impact on our current strategy regarding the deployment of the different technologies.</p>
          <p>As you know, we will use the best mix of the available technologies in each market, depending on the current competition on situation of each individual country and market.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Two questions, please. My first question is from the country of domicile. This was one of the reasons you mentioned that drove the decision to cut the dividend. And as you highlighted earlier on Page 6, you are a lot more diversified than some of your peers, <mark type="ph" /> yet they had of course seemed (42:18) to make all the difference.</p>
          <p>Can you clarify if it would be possible, in principle, to change domicile, if it's feasible in practice, and whether, if you have to make such a move, it would be enough to decouple your rating from that of the sovereign.</p>
          <p>And my second question is on the dividend. Can you please confirm that the &#x20AC;0.75 for 2013 onwards will be all in cash or &#x2013; and whether will &#x2013; you will roll out script dividends in the future? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is C&#xE9;sar Alierta. If you see the evolution of our debt, basically, the evolution of our debt is due to two factors, the buying of O2 and the operation in Vivo.</p>
          <p>So we are being penalized for having invested outside Spain, which is clearly, to me, a very clear contradiction, okay? The increase of our debt is due basically, to investing in Europe and in Brazil, and investing in some of the biggest global market. And I see a very clear contradiction that a correlation between the financial risk they are giving to Telef&#xF3;nica, which is three or four times more than our peers, who have more revenues inside euro and less diversification than has to us.</p>
          <p>And we have the domicile in Madrid, and we will keep the domicile in Madrid because we are in 25 countries, and I think our business will be <mark type="ph" /> looked (43:42) from the cash flow generated in the 25 countries. And I'll remind you that Spain generates 51% of the revenues and are stable. So that is very clear.</p>
          <p>And that's the reason that &#x2013; anyway, taking the <mark type="ph" /> key and the (43:57) present situation, it was clear to the Board that we had to take an action to the courtroom and make the reality be related to the fundamentals of our business, and that's the reason we took this decision on the dividend, extending the maturity behind 2013. And that means then that we feel very comfortable.</p>
          <p>We will achieve the leverage ratios we said that we'll reach at the end of the year, and we'll continue on optimizing our asset portfolio &#x2013; on deleveraging Telef&#xF3;nica while not affecting the growth potential of Telef&#xF3;nica. And this is clear, and we can do both things.</p>
          <p>And the thing we have done in the first seven months of the year are very clear, with the optimization of portfolio, and they're what we're going to continue to do.</p>
          <p>And we are going to pay &#x20AC;0.75 in cash. And I might remind you that &#x20AC;0.75 is less than 50% payout of our free cash flow with respect for the coming years. So that's the answer to your question.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon and thank you. First, the question with regards to your revenues. As you've shown that you still have good revenue growth in most of Latin America, yet there's been a slight slowdown when we compare it to Q1. There's also some slowdown in some European countries.</p>
          <p>And so my question was how do we reconcile that with the fact that you have continued to invest over the last few quarters? And is that the reason why you changed the revenue guidance, because you're seeing a slowdown already in some countries? And related to that, where have you been disappointed? The reason why you downgraded the guidance, is it because of Latin America? Is it because of Spain?</p>
          <p>And second question has to do with your financing strategy. And I'm trying to reconcile the slides that you put up today about debt maturities, and that's slide 25, and the equivalent slide you put in Q1 result. At that time, you were talking about 40% of the 2013 maturities being prefinanced. That number doesn't show here this time. Maybe it's just a presentation issue. If you can clarify that?</p>
          <p>And also, I see that undrawn credit lines have declined from the previous quarters. So maybe also if you could clarify that? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding your first question, we see that Latin America revenues are growing, and they will keep growing. Then the only reason to change our guidance for revenues is basically that we expect weaker macro conditions in some countries. Not of course in all of them, but in some countries. And because we took into account as well the stronger drag from regulation that we are already facing.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Mathieu. This is &#xC1;ngel. With respect to maturities of 2013, you are seeing on slide number 25 a lower figure than in the first quarter because we have been extending the maturities of some financing beyond, and then we have brought them forward. So that's why the figure is lower.</p>
          <p>And also, what we said at the end of the first quarter, that we had the 40% of maturities covered. Now what we're seeing is that we have 100% of those covered. So we already have, even in the absence of divestments &#x2013; and once we have closed the China Unicom transaction, we have all debt maturities covered until beyond the end of 2013. So here, we are in an exercise of expanding our liquidity action for the next period until the end of 2013 and beyond.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, if I can clarify that? By covered, you mean, prefinanced, as you mentioned in the previous quarter? Is that covered by the free cash flow? Or is that covered by existing lines that are undrawn?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. I wondered if you could confirm whether you've spoken with the credit rating agencies about this decision, and whether you have some reassurance that this can isolate you from the potential risk of a downgrade to the sovereign rating in Spain, reflecting the diversification you've been discussing.</p>
          <p>It would it also be helpful to understand whether, with this stronger balance sheet, you are able to be more price-sensitive on any potential asset disposals that you plan? To just give you &#x2013; for example, if market conditions become even more challenging &#x2013; does it give you flexibility to delay potential IPOs? And I guess related to that, does this change the way that you're thinking about German consolidation, given your balance sheet is again getting stronger? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Angel Vil&#xE1; again. My first observation about ratings agencies should be one of coherence. All of us have read the latest reports from S&amp;P, Moody's and Fitch, which were issued in May, June and July respectively. They are public. And they state objective metrics which would lead to stabilization of our ratings.</p>
          <p>The results that we are presenting today, where we have a quarter-on-quarter sequential improvement, expected improved performance in the second performance in the second half, and the dividend action, would position us in compliance with those metrics. So we would expect rating agencies to be coherent and properly incorporate these facts into their assessments.</p>
          <p>The second observation is about decoupling from sovereign rating. As you know, certain agencies have methodologies that link sovereign and corporate rating. And a rigid application of such methodologies that would fail to take into account the geographic diversification, the solvency and liquidity of Telef&#xF3;nica could create some potential undue damages to Telef&#xF3;nica. Therefore, we would expect that the methodologies that would be applied by rating agencies would be applied in a way that recognize the diversification, solvency and liquidity of Telef&#xF3;nica.</p>
          <p>With respect to the second part of your questions, which is &#x2013; and by the way, we have had preliminary conversations with ratings agencies after the announcement that we did yesterday, and they are showing or interpreting this as a very positive movement from Telef&#xF3;nica.</p>
          <p>With respect to the second part of your question, which relates to the divestment policy, we continue to be committed to the divestments program that we have, but obviously, since we have other debt maturities covered until beyond 2013, even in the absence of those divestments, this provides us the flexibility with respects to timing, with respect to evaluation of those divestments &#x2013; to which, I insist we remain fully committed.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. First question, actually just following on from the last one, on the need for an IPO in Germany. I mean given the cancellation of the 2012 dividend certainly doesn't seem have to led to a sharp move in the share price, I just want to understand why you're still committed to IPOing the best European asset? And why would you not potentially also delay restarting dividends in 2013 to prevent you from having to IPO Germany?</p>
          <p>And the second question is actually on Brazil. Quite a bit more evidence I think in the quarter of tougher competition, especially on wireline. And I think certainly adjusted for a big provision reversal and some tower sales, the OIBDA is falling high single-digits in reais. I just wonder if you can talk a bit more about the prospects of being able to generate consistent underlying OIBDA growth, given the commentary you made about operational synergies being noticeable or coming through in the next couple of quarters? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, this is Angel Vil&#xE1;. Regarding the first question, we have not contemplated cutting the dividend beyond the one-time exceptional cut of 2012, because as we have <mark type="ph" /> definitively (53:40) expressed in the past, it's in Telef&#xF3;nica's DNA to have an attractive and compelling dividend to its shareholders. And the financial projections that we are having with the operation of the business and the different measures that we are taking, we can be comfortably covering such a dividend.</p>
          <p>With respect to the German IPO, it provides &#x2013; that's a project that provides not only a potential source of liquidity and debt reduction, it's a project that provides a platform in Europe that can allow us to highlight the value of such an asset, that can provide us a platform for capital raising, in case there were continued financial volatility in Europe. And it provides us with a platform for further development. It's a very attractive asset, which we have been highlighting, that is growing in all its metrics from revenue to OIBDA to operating cash flow, has a very attractive cash generation, even after taxes because of its tax position, and we believe that it should be very attractive for potential investors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And let me highlight one thing. Clearly we want to highlight the value of the group, and the IPO of Germany is one of the reasons in which, when you look at the sum of the parts, there is clearly discount we are having on the value of Telef&#xF3;nica because of having this domicile in Spain. We want to highlight the value of the group.</p>
          <p>And I want to reiterate you one thing. For Telef&#xF3;nica, the domicile is the 25 countries in which we are. That is our domicile. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Will, this is Santiago. Let me try and answer your question about Brazil. Well, number one, I appreciate that Q1 and Q2 have been quite busy in one-offs. I will not go into detail, but I'm more than willing to spend time on those.</p>
          <p>The one thing I can say is that two of those, the brand and launch, that was expensive but successful, with Vivo now encompassing both fixed and mobile products &#x2013; is clearly one-off event, and it will not happen again in the second half of the year. And the restructuring coming from the putting together of the fixed and mobile businesses is also behind us. So clearly on those two fronts, the second half should be better.</p>
          <p>You were right to point out that the weakness lies exclusively on the fixed end of our businesses, and they are in particular, all voice. And we have two observations there. One is that broadband continues to expand &#x2013; that we continue to have an active presence in that market. And second, we are ready to launch around October our new IPTV product, which we think is going to help us sell more to the upper echelons of the market, and will show that, though we may be coming in a bit late into the growth of that particular segment, we are going to make a lot of noise.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thank you. I have two questions. On Page 25 first, it sounds like I'm not the only one who is a little bit confused by how your liquidity situation stacks up. And maybe one way of answering it is could you perhaps give us your view of what that liquidity chart, the cash and equivalents plus the undrawn credit facilities, would look like if you hit your guidance for the full year. What would that look that at the end of the year?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, a question on Germany again. Clearly it's been widely reported that you were close to a deal with KPN on E-Plus but couldn't get credit agency backing. Are you still working on resolving those credit agency concerns? And is it still an option in your plan to revisit that opportunity if credit agencies can be pacified?</p>

          <p>This is C&#xE9;sar Alierta. In regards to your second question, I mean, it's very, very clear that there were substantial synergies in the market consolidation in Germany. But, we said very clearly that the priority for Telef&#xF3;nica is deleveraging and to improve our financial flexibility. And that's the reason that this deal hasn't been done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Angel Vil&#xE1;. With regards to the first question, we will not give guidance on what would be the cash position at the end of the year, but clearly this will be influenced by the position that we have now, by the cash that we're going to be generating in the second half of the year that will be substantially higher than the one that we have generated in the first half, and also on the financing exercises that we can execute in this second part of the year.</p>
          <p>With respect to the evolution of cash between now and the second half of the year, the operating cash flow decline that you have seen in the first half will be lower. So the second quarter has already been better than the first quarter. The second half will be better than the first half, and you should see a better evolution of operating cash flow.</p>
          <p>Also the working capital consumption, which you can see on slide number 24, is cumulative close to &#x20AC;2 billion in the first half of the year. It will more than fully reverse in the second half. Working capital, as you can see in every single one of the last years, is highly cyclical, and this will more than reverse.</p>
          <p>Third, on interest expense, we are having a higher interest expense because we have higher debt and we have higher interest cost. Also in the interest expense and payments that we've had in the first half of the year, we had about over &#x20AC;200 million of non-recurring items. This financial expense in the second half would also go down because the debt will go down. And we are saving on taxes so far, compensating the increases that we've seen in Spain with savings that we're getting in other jurisdictions.</p>
          <p>So you should be expecting a much better free cash flow generation in the second half of the year, which coupled with financing activity, will result in the position that we will have in cash and on our own lines by the end of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you very much. I had two questions please. The first one is just regarding wireless in Spain, comparing your performance with that of Vodafone. I mean, obviously, it's been widely publicized you're both changed your subsidy policies.</p>
          <p>But if I look at your average pricing per minute, Vodafone decided to give some of that value back to customers by cutting its voice pricing sequentially, whereas your average price per minute seems to have actually gone up sequentially from Q1. Do you think that differential in pricing trend is sustainable? Please, it'd be interesting to get your thoughts on that.</p>
          <p>And secondly, I have another question with regards to Brazil. It's now coming up for almost two years since the deal completed. I was wondering if you could just give a feeling of what's going on behind the scenes on the synergy process. Why is it now, two years on, that you feel confident the synergy is going to come through in this second half? And why haven't we've been able to see them in the first two years since the deal completed? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking your question on wireless in Spain, namely on the comparison that you're making against Vodafone. We don't know &#x2013; we don't see those differences. And in fact in the &#x2013; in market trends on the average entry points, so we think that we have become highly competitive. So it's probably due to some of the bundle assignment that we have. So I would invite you to check that numbers with our team. I'm more than happy to go through those because we don't really feel that difference and in fact the market trends are very positive on our side on this part of the business. So, it might be some bundle assignment. But on the effective price per minute, we are very competitive and we have been competitive both in contract and progressively in prepaid. And thanks to that, we have been able to show a significant improvement in churn. And we have been back to positive market gain, market net ads in contract namely. So, we don't experience that difference. Please check those numbers with our team. We are more than happy to go through them because those doesn't account for market reality today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you think your price per minute hit could stabilize?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in fact, what we see is that we have become competitive, as I was saying. The ARPU, if you measured that in terms of mobile service revenues in Spain, it has been stabilizing. So, how we &#x2013; we have been migrating already 52% of our total contract customer to a lower tariff. This difference of tariff is roughly &#x20AC;6 and the main comparison that you should drive is what if we would not have done this? We are already passing through the point in which our revenues are already stronger today than if we will not have done that because the churn levels that we were having before and customers are all &#x20AC;60 were roughly 6%. And now we have historical low levels of churn.</p>
          <p>So thanks to that, the average margin per user is higher today than it was before. And, in fact, the revenue trends compared to the one that would have been and we would have not moved our entry points is today starting to be better. So I think that now is not just our subsidies. It's about the entry points. It's about the quality of services is allowed about the fact that the number of calls that we are getting to the call centers has basically halved. And, therefore, the OIBDA margin trend is much more sustainable than before.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is Santiago, again. In terms of when the Brazilian synergies will show up, let me just make two comments. One is that it is almost two years exactly to the date that we signed the deal with PT on Vivo in the second half of &#x2013; Brasilcel, to be precise. But it's only a year-and-a-half or slightly less than since the deal closed. And, it's only been six months, since the two companies finally integrated. And obviously a lot of the synergies are going to show on the negative side, that, I just mentioned in terms of integration cost. And from now on, I would commit to say that through the end of this year, we should be more specific about what those synergies have actually turned up being. That should also include that the tax synergies, which are not insignificant as a result of this merger, which only happened in February.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I've got a couple of questions. Firstly, Angel, you were talking about the interest expense. In the last couple of years, we've become used to interest payments being well below the crude interest costs and yet in this first half of the year, that situation has turned around. I was wondering &#x2013; could you give us some idea of what you're expecting for H2? And then, on the Spanish business, when I look at the churn, the churn's obviously come down to very low levels. Could you give us an idea of &#x2013; for the new plans, if the churn is significantly below the average churn you're showing in these charts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, James. This is Angel. In the first part of the year we have recorded some non-recurrent interest expenses to the tune of &#x20AC;200 million. Part of this had to do with Columbia one-off; before we took all the debt reduction there was one monthly payment that had to be put into the financial expenses that went into the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We also had some one-times related to Peru, and so on. Also very seasonality in the coupon payments. There is concentration of coupon payments in the first part of the year that also make distortion of that. Now, so, this is basically the &#x2013; either a seasonal or non-recurrent items that were in the first part of the year. From here, you should expect debt reduction. As I said before, next Monday, on July, 30, we are closing the transaction regarding China Unicom. That will provide an immediate debt relief in excess of &#x20AC;1.1 billion. And that, we continue with our efforts to divest assets. And the cancellation of the share buyback will result in us having the shares in our treasury stock. They will not be cancelled. And, we have full flexibility with respect to those, obviously, we would not contemplate divesting them in this price, because it's not reflecting Telef&#xF3;nica's value. And then the saving of the November, the &#x20AC;0.40 in November, that's around &#x20AC;1.8 billion also saving. All of these will result in reduction in the interest expense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Any guidance with respect specifically to payments versus accrued interest, either cash flow interest rather than P&amp;L interest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't say that payment will be lower than accrued in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking on to your question on the Spanish business and churn lows. The answer is, yes. On the customers that we are retaining on what we call the evaporation rate, which is the early signs of churn of the customers that we are acquiring and the ones that we are retaining on voice, which means that we are effectively having a better performance that the churn levels that you have to do are seen on the slides on the voice part of the business. We are still suffering from some dongles impact coming from previous year, coming from previous campaigns, that is still affecting our churn levels. But if you ask me about the customers responding to the new policy, yes, the churn is even lower than the level that you have seen there. And that's why we think it is a sustainable trend.</p>
          <p>As you might imagine, we are monitoring that because that is the compensating factor or the fact that we have reducing the entry points, the prices, and that's why this equation is working in terms of average margin per user. If you include on top of that the fact that the quality increase is having as a result, a much less intense call center activity, and therefore a significant cost reduction, the overall equation is becoming very positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned voice, would that include &#x2013; would you include fixed broadband in your churn calculations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we are talking voice versus smartphones. I'm excluding the dangles, I mean, because it was specific one-off.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is the fixed broadband churn also well below what you're reporting for &#x2013; as an average churn for broadband?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, on fixed broadband, it's in average similar. But again, remember that we were losing the most valuable customers in both sides of the business, wireline and wireless. The effective result of this strategies that we have been stopped exporting high valuable customers for the portability market. And that means that the portability market has been significantly reduced, and in fact, it has been focused on the less valuable customers because we have preserving the most valuable ones.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Two questions please. First on Spain. The question is on the VAT increase we are going to have in Spain in September, whether you are planning to pass it onto customers at least for mobile contract and fixed broadband, or you are planning to absorb VAT within your margin? And the second question is on Brazil. We've seen recently some regulatory action from ANATEL, which was leaving Vivo in a very good position, relative to peers. The question is whether you think that this is suggesting that the regulator is more vigilant now and could take action in other areas, maybe forcing Telef&#xF3;nica to invest further, and interest CapEx maybe in fiber or any other area? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Luis, I'm taking your question on the VAT in Spain. Our prices &#x2013; the market prices in Spain, as what we said before VAT and therefore, I think that the market prices will keep the same structure and therefore, VAT will be passed to the customers. So we will not say to change that strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the Brazilian regulatory action, I think the only thing I can say is that we're happy, not to have been included on that list. But we don't have any further comments on whatever the regulatory actions are. And it also has been a very demanding and very vigilant, as you said, regulator. And we don't expect that to change. However, I think it proves that over the past couple of years, we've been investing just about right, in order to prevent these things from happening. Although, we will continue to monitor all the quality indicators, and that are numerous and not always easy to manage, so that regulatory hurdles are not an obstacle.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. If I can follow up on the VAT question, and thank you for your answers. Obviously it's quite difficult to pass onto prepaid customers, VAT. So I presume that they will be giving less minutes for the same price? Are you expecting a very direct relation between VAT increase and reduction in prepaid ARPU?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you're right. I mean, customers are used to top up a specific amount of money and therefore, effectively, they will have either less minute for the same price. So the answer is yes. How this is going to be affecting elasticity is still not clear, but we'll keep you posted.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Two questions, M&amp;A. First of all, to follow up on the question on E-Plus. So I guess the market can appreciate that acquiring assets is difficult in the current credit environment, but will you consider reopening discussions with them based on different structure, on the merger or JV for instance? And secondly, on Latin America, you mentioned Germany as a kind of platform for further operations in Europe. Would you consider Brazil as a similar vehicle for Latin America IPOs? Or would you plan to work on the individual asset basis? Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding Latin America, we are still in the internal phase of analysis  of several alternatives. Clearly, we have a very good collection of assets in the region, second to none, and they are many different possibilities on how to structure it, albeit country-by-country basis, regional or semi-regional. All the alternatives have pros and cons and we are still in the internal analysis phase of the course of action.</p>

          <p>Hi there. Two questions. The first relates to &#x2013; I guess if you- have you spoken to the rating agencies about, I guess, if you raised debt at any of the subsidiaries, or I mean, are they still worried about subordination as a negative credit event? And then &#x2013; and as part of that, if you could remind us, where you are on your cash repatriation from Latin America? And then my second question, historically, a strong part of Telef&#xF3;nica's DNA has been management's commitment to share ownership. You mentioned there were treasury shares, will management be acquiring more shares?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the first question, we have got positive informal responses from rating agencies to remove, that we announced yesterday. With respect to LatAm repatriation, we have been repatriating in the first half of the year over &#x20AC;600 million, and with respect to the share ownership question, I will pass to C&#xE9;sar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. I mean, the margin of Telef&#xF3;nica is heavily invested in Telef&#xF3;nica shares and the reason we are heavily invested in Telef&#xF3;nica shares is we believe that Telef&#xF3;nica value is much more higher than it is today. We know the fundamentals. And I don't think &#x2013; we can look at exogenous factors out there but exogenous factors &#x2013; at the end of the day, the important thing is the fundamentals, and we're fully committed, and we're very happy with the purchase of shares we make. And I cannot say any more on that, as we believe, and I want to stress this that the real value of Telef&#xF3;nica's is basically more higher than today, and we know the cash flows and you know the numbers.</p>

          <p>Sorry, I just realized, this is Angel, that my response previously was incomplete. We have room for that in subsidiaries, at this stage about 15% of our proper gross that is sitting in subsidiaries, so we still have room to increase that we have in those subsidiaries, even up to around 10% before we hit any concern that rating agencies may have regarding subordination.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon to everyone and thank you for taking my call. My first question returns to the Spanish Fixed Broadband business, and firstly Mar&#xED;a, would you characterize your strategic repricing to new ADSL tariffs as substantially complete? Because it appears that your realized average broadband ARPU in H1 is now broadly level at about &#x20AC;38 per sub per month with Jazztel and ONO, much as your domestic mobile realized ARPU is now lower at &#x20AC;20 across the piece for all major carriers. So my question is, do you feel that the new tariff in domestic broadband is now broadly affordable for current market conditions? Or does the price value equilibrium for Telef&#xF3;nica and the whole Spanish broadband market still need to reprice lower, over several more quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for your question. Well, the answer is that remember that we have been taking the entry point down from &#x20AC;39.9 to &#x20AC;19.9, the basic offer; and &#x20AC;24.9, the basic offer plus value-added services. Today, the take-up of customers is that the vast majority of them, the vast majority being more than 70% of them are going to the &#x20AC;24.9 offer. And that means that we have become competitive. If you are to that fact &#x2013; to that, the fact that we have been turning positive net gains in this quarter, that means that we are back on track being competitive. We are commercializing the fiber at a higher entry point and now that when we will be massively &#x2013; as we are massively deploying the fiber today in Barcelona and in Madrid, we'll keep you posted about this enterprise, but today we feel competitive.</p>
          <p>The next step for that is for the going farther into what we call the totalization, which means that bundling farther the broadband products with voice and with wireless and potentially with TV, having a single approach to the customer would help us to become even more competitive and to increase the perceived value for money for the customers. So, the answer is yes, we feel we're competitive. We think that the commercial <mark type="ph" /> views (1:20:05) that we are getting and the traction that we are getting to support that assessment. The fiber is the next step, and you should expect from us totalization strategy to increase our competitiveness and the attraction of our lower prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">

          <p>That's very encouraging. If you will just oblige me one other question, if I may, to Angel on the financial model. I just wondered whether you could provide me and other investors with some realizable upside potentially from higher ULL pricing and also quantify some benefits that we may have from the various active network sharing arrangements that would support the Chairman's viewpoint that we have reached the trough in European OIBDA here in H1?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:21:05) to answer that question. I mean, I am more than happy to go through it at any point. I mean, in terms of unbundling we feel comfortable with the current prices. Remember that the prices today in Spain is below the &#x20AC;9 that have been established by the European <mark type="ph" /> thrift co (1:21:24). So we'll keep you posted on that potential asset at any point.</p>
          <p>And on networking sharing, we have done a very aggressive network sharing, aggressive meaning really ambitious active and passive negotiating agreement with Vodafone in the UK. That is going to help us to do two things at the same time. First, to catch up with the best network in the UK in a shorter period of time and to do in a much more efficient manner. We think this is a very valuable agreement and we intend to extend that to wherever we can do it in Europe because we think it is the most sensitive way of deploying the next generation networks. And I think that Europe doesn't have room for &#x2013; there are too many networks in Europe today. So we need to work very intensively for this agreement because it provides time to market and significant amount of synergies and therefore a huge amount of value for the customers.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Jerry Dellis of Jefferies.</p>

      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. I've got two questions please. Firstly, in Spain, Vodafone said that a side effect for them was the new subsidy model was that they found that gross adds coming under heavy pressure. And they said on the conference call the other day that they may have to take a few measures to regain commercial traction in the weeks and months ahead. If Vodafone were to increase subsidies, how would you potentially react to that?</p>
          <p>And then in Germany, your recent margin growth momentum is obviously very strong, service margin is almost back to 30% now. Do you believe that margin expansion is sustainable bearing in mind the repricing that's really hitting the market from a number of your competitors, particularly &#x20AC;20 flat rates? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for your question. In terms of the overall market in Spain and without willing to comment on what might be the intention of one specific competitors, I think that this is &#x2013; the model is starting to work. And why I'm saying that, because, in fact, remember that Vodafone has started this thing one month later than we did, and therefore the benefits of churn reduction will take a little bit more to flow through their own accounts. But basically the goodness of the model is not yet from the subsidies.</p>
          <p>For us, the attraction of the model is such that it is one part of that equation, but the lowering of the entry prices, the lowering of the entry points, retaining the most valuable customers, getting the kind of churn levels that we are getting, getting the number of calls that we are getting which are significantly reduced, basically half in six months. We're entering into kind of a virtual cycle in terms of &#x2013; and the subsidies is one component of that.</p>
          <p>So we will monitor permanently the situation but if the portability market might be one proxy of the short-term impact of those strategies we have become pretty attractive on the port &#x2013; we have improved significantly our portability metrics. And on top of that, we have been able to significantly drive it up that market. So we'll keep you posted but subsidies is just one part of the equation. I mean, the sustainability of our market is not based on that.</p>
          <p>Remember that this is not just effective margin, it is also positively affecting CapEx in Spain because of the fact that we are having a much lower level of churn means that we can do the same kind of market share with a significant less CapEx intensity in terms of routers in the homes of the new customers. So it's starting to have a significant impact on capital allocation. We will keep you posted. We will monitor that significantly, but for the time being, it is starting to get traction.</p>
          <p>In terms of Germany, we think it is sustainable. We even ambition a little bit more. We have changed the model in Germany as well. Remember that we are not subsidizing handsets in Germany that we have this My Handy instrument which is a factoring instrument that the customer decides how they want to finance their own handset. We have been changing significantly the approach to market. We're getting traction on our customer base mainly on postpaid, and therefore it will have the cumulative benefits of the recurrent revenues.</p>
          <p>And on top of that, we have learned that it is very valuable to churn our &#x2013; to change our strategy and to become much more regional because being more regional, because of the tariff structure in Germany means that we can enjoy a better margin on the on-net traffic even on the off-net traffic in the German market. So there, we have several levels that we are tracking and monitoring. We're learning a lot on that market. Churn is coming down significantly again. So, yes, we ambition to have, to preserve those levels of margins in Germany.</p>

          <p>Hi. I've got two questions, one on liquidity and one on cash repatriation. On the liquidity, could we get further clarification on this $5.1 billion cash and equivalents, ex-Venezuela, because I'm struggling slightly with that on the basis that the consolidated balance sheet only shows $4 billion cash and equivalents. So does the $5.1 billion include some of the $8 billion that's included in your net debt definition? And if so, can you just give us some idea of what the $8.3 billion consists of if it's not normal cash and equivalents? And what is the true cash and equivalents position, ex-Venezuela, as per the balance sheet definition, because clearly it's lower than the $5.1 billion that's in slide 25?</p>
          <p>And then the second question on the repatriation, I think did I catch you earlier in saying it was &#x20AC;600 million to-date? I think last year you did $3.3 billion. so are you expecting an acceleration in the second half, or can you give us a feel therefore of what the full year expectation for repatriation from LatAm is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to the second question, yes, we have repatriated slightly above &#x20AC;600 million in the first half. We're expecting this to significantly improve in the second half of the year. We do not expect to hit the repatriation figure that we had last year of about &#x20AC;3.3 billion, but we should be close to &#x20AC;3 billion for the whole of the year.</p>
          <p>With respect to the second question that you're asking, I can only say at this stage that the &#x20AC;5.1 billion cash and cash equivalents excluding Venezuela has been calculated in a consistent manner with the way that we have been presenting this information every quarterly presentation and we would encourage you to get in touch with our IR Department so that they can give you all the details on that reconciliation.</p>
