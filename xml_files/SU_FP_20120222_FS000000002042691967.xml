        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning. Good morning. Welcome to Paris for the people in the room. Welcome to this webcast for the people connected through the web. We're going to be this morning first taking you through the results of 2011 with Emmanuel Babeau, our CFO and Carina Ho, the Head of our Investor Relationship.</p>
          <p>So I'm going to be following the presentation; you certainly have the booklet. I'm going to move straight to slide three after the disclaimer to give you the highlights of year 2011. First mark of 2011 is very strong growth at 8.3%. Still a very strong growth also in Q4, 6% organic growth; current growth at 14.3% leading to sales for the first time in our history of Schneider Electric of &#x20AC;22 billion.</p>
          <p>Second point, sustained profitability in a complicated environment; remind you a few elements about 2011. The first thing, big impact of raw material inflation, &#x20AC;430 million plus. Remind you that the highest we had had to face in the past was &#x20AC;250 million, so very high, very fast variation on our costs that we had to compensate by price increases, but these took some time. Second element of disruption in 2011 was the supply chain with the tragedy in Japan, tsunami, Fukushima, affecting the whole electronic supply chain and we've got plenty of electronics in our products.</p>
          <p>And finally, this is more internal, but the surge in our portfolio business of our solutions projects on services which come together with a different profile of profitability but also a different profile of capital employed. So this was a year of variations of external disturbances.</p>
          <p>Anyway, our EBITA was up 7%, and reached there again the historical high of &#x20AC;3.2 billion, so the first time we crossed the bar of the &#x20AC;3 billion, on the EBITA margin at 14.2%. Net income, in consequence, up 6% at again historical high of &#x20AC;1.8 billion, leading to earning per shares to &#x20AC;3.39.</p>
          <p>And finally a very strong cash generation in the second half; you remember that in the first half the cash generation had been disturbed by the supply chain issues, the supply chain disruptions. This was to a great extent recovered in H2; &#x20AC;1.7 billion of cash generation in the second half, the highest ever on a yearly free cash flow of &#x20AC;1.5 billion. Thanks particularly to a remarkable action on inventory far beyond the initial target of &#x20AC;300 million which we had announced middle of the year. This leads to a cash conversion for the year at 83%.</p>
          <p>So remind you what I have presented at the end of July, our operational priorities continue to drive organic growth. Many opportunities in H2 of last year, operational efficiency, both on productivity and <mark type="ph" /> triple function (03:40) costs, price, inventories on cash, on integration of the acquisitions we have done in the first half, numerous acquisitions, starting to drive the synergies.</p>
          <p>Next slide, if we take two views to the growth of the year 2011, first view is about business view. And we've got here two business, Industry and IT, which are growing above 10%, double-digit growth. Like to mention specifically the exceptional performance of the IT division, which clearly took market share. It was a transition from the product business to more integrated data center business, but clearly that space would get that <mark type="inaudible" /> (04:20) kicking in for our Infrastructure division.</p>
          <p>Third group, which is Building, with a growth close to 5%. I remind you that this business has the peculiarity to be less exposed than the other business to the new economies. We are building this presence, which is weighing on the profitability of the specific business, but this is still a business which is principally a Western economy business.</p>
          <p>What is &#x2013; we've also noticed, you know that our two growth engines are Solutions and New Economies. Solutions grew by 12% and played fully their role of growth booster. This is to be compared with the product growing at 6%. Solutions were more than 50% of our turnover in Q4. They represent on the full year 37% of the turnover, but in Q4 they represent more than 40% of the turnover. Very balanced also portfolio; we've got the percentages of those business into a portfolio and clearly our business end market is getting more balanced across the various applications that we cover.</p>
          <p>Next slide, slide six; another view, which is a geographical view. <mark type="ph" /> In pole (5:56) position for growth in 2011 came Asia-Pac, with 15% organic growth. Then a second group of regions, the other new economies international: Africa, Middle East, Latin America and Eastern Europe, with very strong performance overall. Actually, Latin America and Russia are doing very well and, Africa, which suffered in terms of growth of all the events which happened, particularly in the north of Africa. But overall, this other presence in new economies is delivering a very solid growth.</p>
          <p>North America with good dynamics, and this has been particularly true at the end of the year in terms of growth. And, obviously, Western Europe with more difficult dynamics due to the events that took place, the debt issues that happened from H2. And actually the fourth quarter, which is negative by 3% in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>Now we're going to speak more in detail about that, but the dynamics between the different countries are pretty diverse. Clearly, we are suffering of what is happening in Southern Europe, typically a place where we were strong and where we are strong, and particularly in Spain. The north of Europe is doing, to a large extent, very fine in terms of business. There again, the figures show that we implement our strategy new economies once again are delivering 15% organic growth, which is exactly 10% more than the mature countries. Another mark of the year has been that Asia-Pacific has passed North America in terms of percentage of our sales; 27% of our sales respect to 23%, due obviously to the quite extraordinary growth that we realized in Asia-Pac.</p>
          <p>While this is about growth, 2011 was also marked by a strong work on efficiency in the continuity of what we have initiated in our One Schneider Company program. So productivity of &#x20AC;376 million; clearly lower than in 2010 for obvious reasons in H2, which is a decrease of volume. We had an inventory to absorb on the way to softening demand in Europe.</p>
          <p>First reason, less volumes, second reason, launch of new products, particularly we launched in the second half full volume our new offer for miniature circuit breakers, which is a key offer for Schneider. This is good news for our customers, good news for Schneider, but those products come to the market not at the objective manufacturing cost. So during the time, there is a transition that we have to support.</p>
          <p>Second point, we kept on working on the efficiency of our support function costs. While we saved on one side, we kept investing in R&amp;D and geographical coverage in the new economies and solutions. But globally, we kept on decreasing the ratio of support function costs on sales. 1.5% respect to 2008, which was a kind of peak year in terms of performance with high sales on where &#x2013; with very low costs, on 3% below the year of 2009. So, a continuous work on the productivity of our support function costs.</p>
          <p>Move to slide eight and speak about the disruption of the year, the first one being the strong and unforecasted to this magnitude raw material inflation that we had to face. Again, historically the highest we had had to face was &#x20AC;250 million. On the year, it was &#x20AC;430 million. So, we started to price up during H1 and then this really kicked in in H2. And the realization of H2 has been quite impressive, it was &#x20AC;195 million of price increases which is 1.8% of our total turnover. But I remind you that for feasibility reasons, we just measure price increases on the product side of the business which means that if you report it to the ratio of the product it's more than 2% that we increased in H2. This brings a total price increase for the year to &#x20AC;241 million, which is an achievement of 1.2% above the objectives that we had declared to you middle of the year.</p>
          <p>Second disruption was the supply chain, and we ramped up our inventory mid of the year to serve our customers. We did &#x2013; our supply chain did a great job in reducing the inventory. We also put a lot of emphasis on our receivables in the second part of the year. And the cash generation has been to the level of &#x20AC;1.7 billion in the second part of the year vis-&#xE0;-vis increasing our performance in Solutions, on the cash model in Solutions, which is taking more importance in our business.</p>
          <p>We can't speak about 2011, and I'm going to next slide, without mentioning something which is more strategic, which is building at Schneider of a new world leader division in the sector of Infrastructure. Two years ago, what we are calling our energy business, our medium-voltage business, was at &#x20AC;2.3 billion sales business, number three worldwide. I would say a distant number three; quite specialized in terms of product offering on secondary medium voltage and mostly serving industry on building as key segments.</p>
          <p>Two years after, this business has a global turnover of &#x20AC;5.3 billion, is number one worldwide with a total coverage of medium-voltage on-grid automation, covers all the parts of the competencies you need to address the issues of electro-intensive customers and discovering extensive use segments of utilities oil and gas building on industry. Due to that expanded coverage, we changed the name of this division from Energy to Infrastructure, because it's really covering the whole issues of smart cities and smart grid.</p>
          <p>Going to next slide very quickly, we delivered more than &#x20AC;50 million of synergies in 2011 in the integration of Areva D. While this is in advance of the plan, a large part of those synergies were delivered on costs, and particularly at the level of purchasing, product rationalization, manufacturing optimization, but we have started also to generate significant revenue synergies by cross-selling with the networks, sales networks we had and with the offers we had collected and gathered together on both sides of the equation.</p>
          <p>Second integration, Telvent is with us now since September. Great; adding to the company already a lot of cross-selling opportunities. We have 80 cross-selling opportunities Identified. Soft year in terms of growth in 2011 for Telvent. Easy to understand that the Spanish market, which the part of their sales on our sales was not very brilliant but very optimistic about the cross-selling on the revenue synergies that we're going to be creating here. Right. So this shows here the integration in process.</p>
          <p>I'll go to next slide to show you the economics &#x2013; major economics of this integration. Again, we spoke about the growth of infrastructure in 2011, 7%. The adjusted EBITA has been at the level of 10.4% positive in terms of volumes generated by the revenue synergies, the integration, on good markets where we are positioned and the acquisition synergies where we over delivered on the plan,</p>
          <p>We have suffered from cost inflation because this is an activity which is quite intense in raw materials. And we have suffered of a weak transformer activity which has been very competitive last year. I think we've not been the only one on the market to speak about that.</p>
          <p>I'd like to tell you that this has been a year of transition and integration. When I consider that at the end of 2011 this integration, putting the people together, giving key assignments to the team is done. And we are starting 2012 still with issues to resolve which are more from the system point of view, reporting point of view, but the accountabilities, responsibilities on the operating model is clearly defined.  We're in a good position to deliver on the objective we have for this new division is to have an EBITA margin between 10% to 15% over &#x2013; in the midterm.</p>
          <p>Very simply, and to give you a big picture of the new capability of Schneider that we have for efficient infrastructures. We used to be delivering medium voltage <mark type="ph" /> chemicals (15:07), right? These are the needs we are able to address with our customers. It's about efficient energy management, efficient mobility with software for transportation which directed product into our electrical infrastructure that we are developing for the electrical vehicle and everything we do in the city infrastructures. Water management, which is already a big sector for Schneider; security where we have a big activity also on efficient buildings and the homes which combine together in connected communities to share together the fruit of energy efficiency.</p>
          <p>That's for the qualitative part of year 2011. I'm going to now hand over to Emmanuel for the financial part of it.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jean-Pascal. Good morning, everyone. So let's go through our P&amp;L for the full year 2011 and let's dive into some analysis.</p>
          <p>Let's start with sales and margin first and I would like to focus really on the right end part of this chart. Here you have the number in 2010 which take 12 months of Areva distribution, and therefore they are fully comparable with our performance in 2011. You see that our sales have reached &#x20AC;22.387 billion. It's included that 14% increase, organic in with it, plus 8.3%.</p>
          <p>Moving to the margin on comparable basis, that's where you see that we have reached &#x20AC;8.4 billion of gross margin, 37.7% of our sales. It's 1.2 points lower than 2010 on comparable basis. And really, three factors to explain this decrease.</p>
          <p>First of all, of course the unprecedented &#x20AC;430 million impact on the raw materials. We've seen that. We've seen the price hasn't been able to compensate for that. Second, the mix impact and the growth in Solution and the consequence in term of margin; and third, the impact of the acquisitions of the year which has been somewhat dilutive to the gross margin. And these three negative impacts have not been fully compensated by the productivity that we have generated throughout 2011. So these are really the elements that explain the minus 1.2 points.</p>
          <p>In front of that, we've been working on the evolution of our support function cost. They have been growing at 5.5% on an organic basis so lower than the 8.3% that we have experienced on our sales. And therefore we managed to reduce the ratio, on an organic basis, SFC on net sales. And that is the reason why I start taking these elements into account. We get to an EBITA before acquisition and integration cost of &#x20AC;3.178 billion, plus 7% versus last year and 14.2% EBITA margin, 0.5 points below the previous year.</p>
          <p>Analysis of the evolution between 2010 once again on comparable basis and 2011. First impact, quite mechanical, the volume impact a little bit more than &#x20AC;500 million growth of the EBITA. Then the mix impact which has been negative, most of that, not all of that, but most of that is coming from the growth into Solutions and the consequences of margin evolution in Solutions.</p>
          <p>Then the price impact, Jean-Pascal commented, I really want to emphasize the 90% compensation in H2 of the raw material inflation through price increase. So we're really in good shape now to get to this full compensation.</p>
          <p>And then, of course, the two elements which are not matching during this year, the productivity at plus &#x20AC;370 million and the global COGS inflation, both raw material and other labor inflation, which was reaching minus &#x20AC;520 million. That's really where the margin consideration has been principally.</p>
          <p>Then evolution of our SFC, each time we think it's important to show two things. First of all, a kind of natural, I would say, evolution of our SFC which is largely coming from inflation. And this year, we see &#x20AC;150 million increasing SFC coming from inflation. And then what has been a net &#x2013; let's really realize it, it's a net amount between investment and savings that we have been generating. A net further increase in investment, new initiative, growing our skills, developing into new territories, new economy of &#x20AC;112 million. Then you have a minus &#x20AC;47 million Other elements that includes the increase in restructuring costs. There is a pension element. There is other element in term of provision on inventory on renewable. The scope effect, the &#x20AC;98 million, which is coming from all the acquisitions that we have made through the year.</p>
          <p>And then the currency impact, minus &#x20AC;72 million; I want to clarify the fact that you have a positive impact on raw material inflation by &#x20AC;40 million. So the total raw material inflation impact without the decrease of the dollar versus the euro on average in 2011 would have been minus &#x20AC;470 million. But this year the dollar has been on average decreasing versus the euro and therefore that generated some good news, some savings in term of ForEx. If you take that into account, the net impact at the group level of the ForEx for the EBITA has been minus &#x20AC;32 million.</p>
          <p>Looking now at the margin, no surprise; the EBITA margin has been declining at the group level and therefore we find in all our businesses but one a decrease in EBITA margin. One exception, the Infrastructure evolution in term of margin stability. We've seen that this has been achieved despite raw material inflation which has been quite significant on the Infrastructure business. Difficult situation on the Transformer business, so clearly if we manage to maintain the same margin, it's thanks to the work that we have done in integration of Areva distribution, the beginning of Telvent, and the synergy that we have generated.</p>
          <p>If I look now at Power, we are down 0.7%. This is largely due to raw material inflation on industry close to stability with more reduced inflation on raw materials. IT is down but it's really here the strong push, strong growth into Solutions and the Data Center business, which has been extremely positive for us in 2011. And Building, the biggest decrease 1.2%; we keep investing in our building business. As you know, it is still mainly mature country business today; a little bit more than 15% of exposure to new economies only and therefore we are strongly investing in teams, in skills outside the mature country and that is having an impact on our margin for Buildings in 2011.</p>
          <p>I keep going down our P&amp;L below the EBITA before acquisition; precisely you have acquisition and integration charges. Let's say a very exceptional year in that respect because we've reached at the end of the year &#x20AC;99 million. That has to stay as an exceptional year and certainly not as a kind of recurring cost. But of course given the number of acquisitions that we have made, all the costs including these acquisitions, that is fully explaining this amount.</p>
          <p>Then moving to amortization of intangibles, very much in line with last year and nothing very specific to mention here. In term of EBIT, we reached after taking these elements to account &#x20AC;2.853 billion; it's a 6% increase.</p>
          <p>Net financial expenses, a charge of &#x20AC;415 million. In fact, versus last year, the full difference is explained by the ForEx impact. Last year, it was a positive &#x20AC;20 million; this year it's a negative &#x20AC;45 million and that is a gap between last year and this year.</p>
          <p>If I look at my financial curve, they are very close to stability this year despite the fact that we have more debt following acquisition. And this, underlying the fact that we keep reducing the average cost of our debt, that has been the case of 2011, we've been entering new a financing long term at a cheap cost. And as we see in the future financing that will come to an end at higher costs and that we will keep financing the group on the current basis at a lower cost, we should continue to improve the average cost of our debt in the future.</p>
          <p>Income tax, we've been decreasing the average income tax rate from 40% to 43.1%, so it's a positive element in 2011. Equity investments, here we have all the subsidiaries that we consolidate through the equity method. That is our Russian JV, Electroshield Samara, the Fuji JV in Japan. So a significant increase of the profit derived from this JV.</p>
          <p>And then minority interests are all the profit corresponding to JV that we have &#x2013; where we have minority partner. Some of them are in China and we have, of course, to take that out to get to our net income group share which reached &#x20AC;1.820 billion plus 6%, and a record high for Schneider.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share, &#x20AC;3.39, 3% growth. You have a dilutive impact here which is really coming from several elements. The equity increase that we have done for employees; this is the one first element. The fact that we have been selling in 2010 some shares that we were owning and as you know, we have been selling them, that creates some dilution. And the fact that we have paid the dividend in 2010 partly in share but it is fully contributing in term of impact this year. So these are the reasons which explain the difference between the net income growth and the earning per share.</p>
          <p>The free cash flow, which has been certainly one of the very good elements of our second half, you see that globally for the year we have an operating cash flow of close to &#x20AC;2.6 billion. Change in the trade working capital has been only been negative by &#x20AC;359 million. Compared to the previous year, we have only a marginal positive impact coming from non-trade working capital. And you see that another big element which explains the difference between last year and this year in term of free cash flow is a strong increase in term of CapEx. I mean we are back this year on a kind of normal cost in term of CapEx. We have renewed investment both in term of manufacturing and industry and investment and in term of R&amp;D investment because in this line you have both manufacturing CapEx and what we take as CapEx on the R&amp;D. In total, free cash flow of &#x20AC;1.5 billion with a remarkable second half.</p>
          <p>Then you have the dividend, of course, that we have paid to our shoulder. The &#x20AC;2.9 billion of acquisition that we have made this year; capital increases that I've described which is both capital increase for employees and some subscription exercise. And then on this slide, Other, you have a significant impact this year of ForEx. We have more than half of our debt which is in dollar or dollar pegged. We have a significant increase of the dollar versus euro between the value at which we have entered the Telvent acquisition and other dollar acquisition and the proving rate, so that is most of this amount.</p>
          <p>On top of that you have significant payment for pensions so we have decided to fund our pension plan in various countries in the world. And then on that line you have the dividend that our subsidiary where we have partners, minority partners, when we have paying dividends, this is on this line as well. At the end of the year, we finished the year with debt a little bit below &#x20AC;5.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Just this slide to show that we have been good at managing our working capital this year, because you'll see that the normal evolution of working capital should have been giving &#x20AC;4.8 billion of working capital and we managed to decrease that notably through great performance in term of reduction of inventory. We are significantly beyond the &#x20AC;300 million that we were targeting when we were commencing our first half results back in July.</p>
          <p>Cash conversion has been good, &#x20AC;83 million despite the strong CapEx &#x2013; 83%, sorry. If I look at the three year average of one, we have been beyond the 100 conversion rate. So we have been right in line with the objective of having a full conversion of our net profit into free cash flow generation.</p>
          <p>And then debt on EBITA, we of course have been increasing this ratio because of the acquisitions that we have made in 2011, but we stay and we remain with a low ratio at 1.4. And that is calculated on an adjusted EBITA of &#x20AC;3.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Sorry, we are going to propose a dividend. Sorry, okay, anyway, we're going to propose a dividend of &#x20AC;1.70 per share. That would be fully payable in cash and that represents no surprise as it is our policy, 50% of our net income.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the outlook and before handing over to Jean-Pascal, I would like to make a clarification on the criteria on which we're going to report on the future. We have seen, certainly because of the volatility of the environment over the last few years, a significant volatility on the criteria that we were using in order to report our performance. And we have seen that the restructuring costs, for instance, could vary quite significantly from one year to the other. And therefore we want to move to something giving more visibility, more flexibility and therefore we think that we need to get to something more stable.</p>
          <p>And we are going, therefore, in the future to use a notion that we call the adjusted EBITA, which is basically the EBITDA from which we're going to extract non-recurring elements, which are of course the restructuring costs, and what we call other income and expenses, which can be positive when we talk about capital gain, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:32) pension; which can be negative when we talk about the capital loss or acquisition costs. But all these elements were creating really disruption on the visibility and the understanding of our performance.</p>
          <p>So in the future we will be communicating, reporting and taking for guidance adjusted EBITA. And for your files, we have been making here the retreatment. You see that this is a less volatile <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:02) than some other criteria and that we've been quite consistent over the last few years and we stay between 13% and 15% for this adjusted EBITA criteria. If I just look at 2011, we talk about an adjusted EBITA of &#x20AC;3.230 billion, that is the reference, it's 14.4% of our sales.</p>
          <p>Now Jean-Pascal, I hand over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, before we move on 2012 actually, just realize that 2011 has been quite an important year for several reasons and you can read it that three levels. First, it was a year of strong growth again, that at the end translated into solid cash generation; this in a very complicated environment, a volatile environment on &#x2013; there were up two things happening. Most of the correction happening like in H2 in many aspects; but I would say also we've learned the new Schneider, with on board Areva, with on board new companies and we've unlocked 40% of Solutions and we are starting, we are coming operationally into 2012 with the right cross point and with the right discipline on many issues.</p>
          <p>Second point, it's been an intentional deployment of our strategies. We have, and we have declared it at the beginning of 2011, invested in R&amp;D, invested in Solutions, which is competency, invested in coverage of more cities into the new economies; and this is a good and important investment for the future.</p>
          <p>Also this year has been defined in terms of implementation of our strategy; Q4 more than 40% of our business in Solutions, more than 40% in new economies. That's somewhere &#x2013; it's one of the major accomplishment of One. Remember, those were the priorities of One. Acquisitions, very intense in acquisitions, especially during H1 with Telvent. And there's plenty of acquisition in the new economies that we are now integrating. And finally what I already mentioned in the creation of a new world-leading activity of business at Schneider with Infrastructure business.</p>
          <p>Now, if you take a <mark type="ph" /> survey (34:17) of reading on 2011, this is what we're going to speak about that during the day, it's a closing of One; the last year of our One program, which was certainly the most transformational program we've had in the history of Schneider. And we are starting the new program with one name, one identity, Schneider, which has now become the brand of our company, one house; a place where all our teams are gathered on one team, with collaborating to sell our customers. So really a very intense year in many aspects: operational, strategy, and transformational in the creation of One.</p>
          <p>Now, moving on to 2012, on this &#x2013; and related to our new company program. Well, what we are saying now is that for 2012 there is &#x2013; we acknowledge a certain lack of visibility. We see some form of dynamics in North America which is interesting, a recovery in North America. Western Europe is very segmented and very differentiated by zones and difficult to predict where it's going.</p>
          <p>New economies have certainly a very strong foundation on structural, very strong dynamics, but some of them have put some restrictions on credit and we want to have a better estimation of what is happening there before taking a more certain stance. So assuming all that lack of visibility, what we see is a flat to slight organic sales growth for 2012 on an adjusted EBITA between 14% and 15%. So that's the new measurement that were putting for the EBITA level.</p>
          <p>So that's for our presentation. Thank you for your attention and we are ready to take your questions if there are any.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Daniela Costa from Goldman Sachs. Actually three points; the first one on the 2012 guidance. So even assuming no operating leverage due to the uncertain scenario on the growth side, wouldn't you benefit still from some tailwinds off the pricing raised in the second half and also from the softening of the raw material increases and the productivity? So why is the guidance not above the 14.4 percentages that EBITA you did in 2012, basically?</p>
          <p>And second, on your return on capital targets, given you plan to grow significantly faster on services and solutions and that's I guess less capital employed, you seem to already be at the midpoint of the return on capital targets. So why is that not more aggressive again?</p>
          <p>And then third just M&amp;A, how do you view that in 2012 and in the years going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Daniela, you are anticipating on a number of points and questions that we'll be very happy to debate in the course of the day, so I'm not sure I'm going to enter into details to all your questions. Now, on the guidance for 2012, certainly we are going to benefit from a positive carryover impact on price, very right. All the action that we have been taking, notably towards the middle of the year and in the second half, will be delivering some positive carryover in the second half. The best estimate I can give today on price is a positive carryover between &#x20AC;100 million and &#x20AC;150 million. So we have these positive elements.</p>
          <p>Now on the RMI that we can expect, we, on the current price, let's be extremely cautious because the volatility is still enormous and just looking at the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (38:17) you can take $1,000 only in a few days. So we have to remain extremely cautious. But on the current basis, we have without the ForEx impact slightly positive impact today on RMI, but taking into account the fact that the dollar is stronger versus the euro on average, and I would expect that the average in 2012 could be higher, then we are clearly having a slightly negative impact. So that's where we are on the raw material.</p>
          <p>On productivity, we have an ambition for the three years to come and we'll be very happy to comment that later on today. There will be some ramp-up on that ambition, for sure, as we are entering into a number of new actions that will deliver progressively. We believe on top of that that the growth in volume will be modest this year. I mean, we've seen that with the guidance that we are giving today. So we are taking the view on productivity that we could be growth productivity between &#x20AC;250 million and &#x20AC;350 million. That's our vision today.</p>
          <p>In front of that, you will have other element playing in what is a final evolution in term of growth; what is inflation, what is the mix in terms of Solution. Certainly, we can expect Solution to grow stronger than Product in the current environment, so all that will be playing. And that's why we are giving this guidance which is opening the door for improvement of margin. If we start at 14.4% and then we said that the top of the bracket is 15%, we don't exclude that. But we are not saying that this should be, clearly, taken for granted. We are saying that we are between 14% and 15%.</p>
          <p>On the return on capital employed, I would prefer to save that for this afternoon. And on the M&amp;A activity, we may also discuss that and detail that further later on but certainly to tell you that we entered 2012 very much still in integration mode and without much visibility, so for at least the first part of the year, you should expect reduced M&amp;A activity at Schneider.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So we can take the second question. Ga&#xEB;l, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. So this is Ga&#xEB;l De Bray from Soc Gen. The first question is on the Infrastructure division because it seems to be the division where most of the integration work will have to be done and where most of the prospects for profitability improvement remains within the group. So could you give us maybe a little bit more color on the pricing environment and what the growth outlook looks like for that business?</p>
          <p>And also prior to Areva D, your medium-voltage operations had a double-digit margin relatively close to 14%. So do you think that this profitability is achievable again for the group within the new company timeframe, so basically over the next three years? Or do you think the mix has changed in a so significant way that margins will remain structurally below what they were a couple of years ago?</p>
          <p>Also, to finish on that, could you elaborate a bit more on the integration of Telvent, how the integration is doing and how you could reuse the Telvent solutions to develop a transversal offering for the other divisions in terms of software, obviously?</p>
          <p>And maybe a second question, if I may, sorry for that. It's a bit longer, I know.</p>

      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks very much. Just on the extra spending you've made in innovation and customer-facing resources in 2011, how should we think of that going into 2012? Because, well, basically most of your competitors have recently indicated they would continue to invest massively in research and commercial resources this year again. So shall we expect those kind of extra spending to be a bit more structural for you in the coming years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, on infrastructure and growth, I would repeat what I said for the global business. I mean there is lack of visibility today. Very uphill growth we have delivered in 2011. We're entering 2012 with some backlog. But, again, quite difficult to make big prediction on the midterm. When we're going to be a bit more sure of what is happening, we're going to be back to you and tell you where we are going.</p>
          <p>What I see is that there is what we generate from the market and there is what we generate from our own forces. And we have had an intention in 2011 of putting the forces together and people together. And now they are connected and the sales force can carry all offers so we generate ourselves our own factors of competitiveness, right. But while we do also a significant part of our business, not majority but a good part of our business, in Europe, and Europe today is carrying some uncertainty for instance.</p>
          <p>In pricing, most of the issues have been with the transformers. And we spoke about that and we are working on it and we get more clarity about what we are doing there while we are simplifying the product offering on the line-up of the new built division. So we're going to keep working on that.</p>
          <p>This is linked then to the second aspect on the profitability; I really &#x2013; I came on board with a mix which was much more turned to Solutions and to very large customers, right. So with a margin which clearly was not up to the level where we were. And we have clearly indicated in our presentation that our ambition is to have an EBITDA between 10% to 15%. So, clearly, the ambition to improve what we have today and to keep doing more cost synergies and revenue synergies.</p>
          <p>There were two elements, of course, which were very negative for Areva. First thing is that they were trying to enter into some part of the offer that Schneider was dominating, the secondary offer. And this is obviously a saving. And a second point that they were entering into the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:10) market trying to without a sales force and Schneider has it negative. So we have structural reasons to be able to improve this profitability. But there is more Solution than they used to be in this business before. In Solutions you don't just don't look only to the margin, you look also at the asset operating efficiency, so this is something we're going to discuss during the day. So yes, we have the ambition to improve this profitability.</p>
          <p>Integration of Telvent, done from September, very good contact between the teams. We've decided to keep, to a large extent, Telvent as not autonomous but as a very integrated entity. But we plug all the commercial capabilities that we are creating through our network. And, again, very fast in a few months, we're able to generate 80 cross-selling opportunities in the grid environment as well as in the water and oil and gas environments. So very promising.</p>
          <p>Are we able, shall we able to push more the software capabilities into the other business? Yes. Just by creating a link between our control system and the operation level that Telvent is mastering on controlling. So a lot of very productive discussions taking place. During the day, you're going to have a few presentations on the software and you will immediately realize what are the potential behind this combination.</p>
          <p>Extra spending, I don't know if you should call it spending. We call it investment at Industrial. But in R&amp;D, yes, we're going to keep driving R&amp;D investment, we're going to between 4% to 5% of our turnover, investing into the coverage of new cities. That's going to be, by and large the subject &#x2013; some of the subjects of the day. But we &#x2013; this has been the subject of many discussions with you guys over the past numerous years. It's yes, we invest, but we keep it in line with the development of our margins. So it's going to be from investments that we push forward in line with the expansion of our margins. But you know our directions for investments. We are very clear on this, we're going to keep investment there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Andreas Willi from JPMorgan. I have a question on your growth outlook and what we've seen in Q4. You finished the year with 6% like-for-like growth in Q4 and you look at a material slowdown then for 2012. Maybe you could give a little bit of a profile how you see that developing. Is it a weak start to the year? Do you already see a much weaker Q1 and then acceleration again as we go through the year? Or is Q1 just stepped down and then another step down as we go through the year?</p>
          <p>And also, to what degree is that because you are slowing down the Solution growth and you have invested less in the second half relative to the first half in terms of growth initiatives? And to what degree is that just your view on the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the question, on the answer <mark type="indiscernible" /> (48:24). Just on the outlook, first element is, I repeat, lack of visibility and the &#x2013; well I think we've &#x2013; we are &#x2013; yeah, we have &#x2013; we can say what we are sure of and we are not totally sure of what there's going to be, I think.</p>
          <p>First thing, very difficult to read the beginning of the year which is a traditional thing at Schneider. So if you look at January, it tends to be a weak month. We are a Northern Hemisphere company in many cases, so when many things have stopped or are starting. On top of that in Asia, and we are becoming big in Asia, you've got Chinese New Year, which is always introducing a bit of productivity in the results. So nothing shocking in Jan., but I'm not expecting a great Q1 for one very simple reason is that the basis of comparison is very demanding. We had a very, very, very strong Q1 last year. So put the Q1, put some weakness in Europe, which actually Europe seems to be doing better with our customers, but today we are selling on a basis of the mood of our customers in Q4 and Q3, and that was not the best of the mood on earth, so I &#x2013; all of that leads us to that forecast.</p>
          <p>Now if you look a bit long term, I don't want to speak about figures, but we see some rebound in the U.S.; see if it's going to be confirmed. We see in Northern Europe, which at the end of the day is faring correctly. In the new economies, the foundations for growth are always as good as before. So, we are going to be back to you when we're going to get more visibility and adjust our guidance on our indication from this basis.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Olivier Esnou, Exane. Three questions. So coming back on One, how do you assess your performance in terms of having achieved GDP plus 3% and your personal view on the margin range? You've achieved <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:35) at the end of the period.</p>
          <p>Second question, if I look at the Solution business, maybe you'll talk about it later today, but what is the margin level you assess of this business today? Because you want to improve it by 2% but we don't know the level. And what have you changed in the way you run it operationally to drive the performance? Because as it looks now, I just have the impression you're doing an arbitrage, slowing growth to have a better margin, but I don't have the feeling yet you run it differently so that it performs better. Maybe there's more to come.</p>
          <p>And last question, maybe on the margin range, it's a larger range, so what's driving the larger margin range? Because your latest acquisition, Telvent, and your other I think have a higher margin range than the group.</p>
          <p>And maybe a question for Emmanuel, are you now &#x2013; have you decided for using more hedging to protect your &#x2013; the volatility of raw material, because you've seen hedging impacting you as early as February last year and still it had an impact in H1, an impact in Q3. So how do you protect yourself going forward versus that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on this hedging policy, no we haven't changed. And I can tell you that I'm very happy not to have massively hedged the group when the copper was at $10,000 per tonnes or when the silver was at more than $40 the ounce. So I keep having this view that there is &#x2013; even though there is some volatility on raw material, on non-ferrous metal and so on, there is a pretty good correlation between the GDP growth and macroeconomic situation and the cost of these raw materials. So when the economic environment is good, it's good for our business, it's good for our volume. We generate productivity, it's good for the margin. At the same time, we have some raw material inflation, but we can cope with that.</p>
          <p>On the contrary, if things are turning negative, I'm very happy to benefit quickly from that and there is always a lag, because there is several months between the decrease in terms of cost and when I start benefiting from it. But that's really something I want to take benefit from and I'm not going to change my vision on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, then going up to the one question, which is split in four parts. On the larger margin range, I think we've learned. We just learned in the past three years, I've said the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:24) could go down by 16% and then grow the next few years by 10% or close. On the &#x2013; if you take the past cycle, which has been extremely balanced and you use the new EBITA measurement, we've been between 13% and 16%.</p>
          <p>So as we are unable &#x2013; I don't see it all nowadays, but even if there was another economic shock coming from external factors, then we know that the last resistance point was at 13% and we feel good about reaching that threshold if there was that kind of balance downside again. Again, I don't see it but we've learned, okay? And we don't want to repeat in case this would come.</p>
          <p>On the other side, we've reached the top of 16% with a different mix of business. It was less Solution; we didn't have Infrastructure fully on board. But we have, because we are one company and because we develop higher margin kind of business, the ambition to go up to 17%. It would benefit from a sustained, high level growth. So this is what the margin is saying.</p>
          <p>It's a corridor because the cycles are becoming more brutal, more unpredictable. On the recent year, I mean if we would have met three months ago, probably the likelihood of having a big shock would have been probably higher than today, so that's the main thing. But we've shown, and that's probably for the afternoon, but we've shown that we are very resilient in terms of margin and cash generation when the crisis are severe. And at the same time that when there was a development of the economy, we are able to capture growth in a very efficient manner.</p>
          <p>On the Solution business, take in consideration that we have been in the investment mode during One. It was one of our two strategic priorities. On Solution business, it's about people and we don't recruit ready-made or really pick up people on the market. So the time before you recruit, you put in place, it's 18 months and if a person produces a result, it's 18 month. So we've been kind of tuning this development of our resources, capabilities together with revenues on the business we are generating.</p>
          <p>Developed a lot of innovating offers and we learned; started different kind of systems and frankly the first system is far less profitable than the second one and less profitable than the third one. So we are developing &#x2013; and we're going to be speaking in detail about that in the afternoon. There's going to be more service, more professional systems and more efficiency on the cost of the equipment which are integrated in our systems. And we've got a roadmap, a very good roadmap, structural roadmap and there is a clear path of improvement on this case.</p>
          <p>Now on the One summary, well, I feel very good about One. I feel very proud about One because it was a very big transformation to accomplish and very clear focus of our strategy in a very rocky environment. And we exit One, and we're going to be speaking about that, with a company which is truly one. With a footprint in the countries in the business which is really in order of march with an organized presence in the field of services, in the back office, in the project centers, that we absolutely didn't have before. We really start the new company with a brand that we can promote, which is important for our partner and product business.</p>
          <p>And when you look at the results of the two growth engines and the results in terms of efficiency, of course we can always do better, but we've delivered on the growth of new economies and actually we're one of the most new economies company of our industry, with a presence which is not a project presence but a diverse presence, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (57:30) presence with thousands of partners with daily interaction with our customers; as well as for the creation of a new leg growth which is a Solution business. We've developed it to 37% of our business in not many years.</p>
          <p>So yes, we've accomplished our objectives. We had said at the beginning of the year for the productivity that we would keep on developing the manufacturing productivity. On the support function cost, as we had reached in absolute values against we wanted in two years that we are now reverting to a percentage of the sales, which again we have done. And we have said also, we are reinvesting and we have done what we are saying we would do. So yes, I'm very proud of what we've done in One.</p>

          <p>Martin Prozesky from Bernstein. Just one question, please, on Industry. The Industry growth in Q4 came down quite sharply from &#x2013; on the trajectory. And you said that the U.S. was up. So is this German and China weakness in the end of the year? Is it center? Is it also a destocking? What's driving the growth in Industry and what do you expect into the first half of 2012?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's been printed &#x2013; we have had some decrease in China, actually, because of the OEM market, machine manufacturers exporting less. And we've had some softening in Europe. This an activity which is strong in Europe. But when you look at the global performance of Industry plus profit on growth, it's been &#x2013; it is a business for which we have a lot of good prospectives, a lot of good potential.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, I mean, I won't repeat that visibility at the end of January is not exactly what it needs to be, so we're going to be &#x2013; in Industry, we are really developing now &#x2013; we developed a lot of machine structure with the machine manufacturers in the past years. And we are launching, at the moment a new development of plant structure which is a <mark type="ph" /> genuine (1:00:03) automation. And, clearly, we see serving very well the trend of industrialization of &#x2013; in new economies, so we're quite optimistic about that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you; Simon Smith, Credit Suisse. I have three questions. The first one was just going back to the trends you've seen in Europe. You obviously gave us some help there in terms of the fact that you felt that some of the trends you might see in Q1 would not be totally reflective of the environment but more history. Is there any way you can give us some feelers to whether you've seen destocking in some elements of the European business and in any way of disaggregating that in terms of the negative three you saw in Q4 or what you may effect in Q1?</p>
          <p>Second question would be on your new guidance for EBITA. I think as the removal of the restructuring charges is very clear and understandable. The other elements &#x2013; the breakdown you've given in the release, there's a lot of elements to it and some of them can be quite volatile but actually net out to be not very much. I mean is there in any way you can give us an understanding as to what we should expect, roughly, from the acquisition side? What would be maybe a reasonable take-over number for acquisition costs? The other that is generally a positive element as to whether that would generally be neutralizing it just would be helpful for forecasting.</p>
          <p>And then the third question was you've been very helpful giving us certain elements of the bridge as we go into 2012. I guess on the inflation side, you're already got some reasonable insights into wage inflation you have coming through elements of the business. Is it possible to put a number to that?</p>

          <p>Right. Trends in Europe, just looking in Q4, no, we cannot report any clear sign of destocking that would have been penalizing us in Q4; and therefore, we don't expect a rebound the beginning of the year due to that. So nothing specific to report on that.</p>
          <p>On the new guidance, I mean the difficulty with acquisition costs is precisely that this largely depends on the activity on M&amp;A. If you look last year, it was &#x20AC;30 million. This year of course it was a big number, close to &#x20AC;100 million. I mean, I would tend to say look at our M&amp;A activity and based on history try to make your mind. I'm sure you will get to a pretty good estimate of what it can be. I mean if we do very little acquisition, the costs will be extremely reduced so that is what you should take into account.</p>
          <p>And for the rest, I mean, again, you have a lot of elements playing. If we sell an asset and we have a capital gain or a capital loss; it's true that from pension, on several years in a row, we have had some positive elements in terms of cost elements. Is it going to continue? I don't know, I don't discard it, but I don't have visibility. So precisely, I mean, why we are taking this line now is that we have lower visibility on what it's going to be. And therefore, it's very difficult to give a number.</p>
          <p>On wage inflation, I mean, take something which is line with what we've seen. I think we are getting close to &#x20AC;100 million impact globally at the level of COGS. I cannot say that this is going to be the amount, but I think it's a rough assumption of what it could be.</p>

          <p>No, I was just on COGS. On SFC, I think it's more difficult. I mean, you know the inflation at the worldwide level. I'm sure you can make your own estimate.</p>

          <p>Yeah, we'll just take one last question and don't be frustrated. You will have many opportunities to continue the dialogue with the management today. We will have many other Q&amp;A sessions, okay. So we'll just take one last question from Martin and then we'll go for a break.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Good morning. It's Martin Wilkie for Deutsche Bank. Just one question on the flexibility of your cost base. You mentioned earlier that you're not changing your hedging quality, but of course last year there were other surprises in your cost base in terms of inflation and so forth. When you're looking at your cost savings plan, is that also going to be increasing your flexibility such that if there were to be a surprise, even in inflationary pressures or even the growth rate, you'll be able to adopt much quicker; just when we think about some of the surprises that we saw through 2011. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Right. I think the biggest surprise was really raw material when you look at 2011. The rest was pretty much predictable in terms of &#x2013; then there was clearly in terms of cost, the disruption brought by what happened in Japan, which made negotiation &#x2013; the focus, the productivity falls, right, when you are redesigning your products to change a microprocessor which has been wiped out by the tsunami and you are not in as good position to &#x2013; and when you do that, by the way, your costs are increasing, your base costs because your R&amp;D people are doing that plus the rest, plus, plus, plus. So there was a lot of firefighting on both sides in the first half.</p>
          <p>We keep working on the flexibility of our model. We keep working and we don't do it only for flexibility, we do it because we are becoming more technology <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:05:27) so more focused and therefore you need more specialized, more professional suppliers. So when we say we've brought the purchasing with our key suppliers from 40% of our business to 62% of our business, that means we have simplified incredibly the chain between those guys and us. We've also put more confidence in the relationship and that helps us with bigger volumes, with better flows, to be more flexible up and down.</p>
          <p>And we've tested it in H2 last year, because I tell you reducing &#x2013; ramping up the inventory to cover the risk anchored by what happened in Japan, but more so trimming it down in not so many months, while it seems easy on our computation and some spreadsheets, but it's very complicated in the day-to-day life because as we are very outsourced, what we do inside which is really trimming down the volumes, in softening volumes, is really impacting all our chain of supply.</p>
          <p>So I think this chain, this articulation between Schneider and its suppliers on the downstream flows is getting better and better. This afternoon we're going to have a session with &#x2013; on the supply chain, on the Telvent supply chain. And I think we are going on the next step of progress because there are plenty of things to do. Plenty of &#x2013; I've said many times that I was seeing that as a bigger source of productivity for the next years to come; plenty of things to do in this sector.</p>

          <p>All right, so we'll break for now. I will invite you to come back at 11:00, okay, so in about you know a little bit more than 20 minutes time. And while you're having coffee, I will invite you really to take this opportunity to go to our exhibition hall where you'll be able to talk to a lot of our business people who'll be able to show you many, many interesting things. So, enjoy.</p>
