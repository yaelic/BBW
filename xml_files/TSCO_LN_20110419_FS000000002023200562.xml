        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good morning, everyone. Welcome to our results presentation and especially welcome to Philip, our new CEO and his first results, which I believe are a good set of results. Phil, we all wish you well, not only today, but also going forward as our leader. On the presentations today, Philip will go first; followed by Laurie; and I'll then chair the Q&amp;A and obviously Steve Webb will be with us throughout. So can I introduce Phil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Well, thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. We're going to do things a little bit differently this morning. I'm going to start the meeting today, not much with an update, although Laurie and I will do that, too. Instead, I'm going to talk about how I see the business as the new CEO and what our immediate objectives are.</p>
          <p>For those of you who don't know me, I've been with Tesco for quite a long time now, over 35 years, and I've worked in most parts of the business, in stores, in commercial, in marketing and in supply chain. And until I got the call from David to say that I was to succeed Terry last year, I'd been running Asia, Europe and <mark type="ph" /> IT (1:17) for eight years. So I'm used to running big businesses and large teams, but first and foremost I'm a retailer.</p>
          <p>And Tesco is a really great business. It's built around customers, it's built around staff, with very high quality assets around the world and multiple opportunities for growth. I think that's a pretty good platform on which to start. And my job is to build on that for all of our stakeholders, but most importantly for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>You'll mostly see continuity, because the strategy is a good one, because we've got a strong team and because we think the period of highest risk in the diversification of Tesco is now behind us. But there will also be change. There will be change because we know we can do some things better and because as customers change so must Tesco. We made a start and there will be more to come. The new management structures are in place and they're about equipping the group for global growth. That means the big driving business units of the U.K., Asia, Europe, America, Services and Property will be supported by integrating functions, such as brand marketing, grouped buying, IT, finance and personnel, so that we leverage the skill and the scale of the group. And my new executive team brings that all together.</p>
          <p>I believe Tesco has reached the point in its development where it's the right time to move to the matrix approach that the <mark type="ph" /> FMCG (2:57) companies have adopted, so that we're ready for the next phase of our development. And that's why we've done it. The biggest part of the change is in the U.K. It's now got its own Board and it's bringing more focus and energy to our largest business. But of course structures don't manage companies, people do, and looking at the U.K. as an example, we put a very strong team in under Richard Brasher, and have taken the opportunity to bring some of our best, some of our most experienced general managers who've done senior jobs internationally back to the U.K. There could be no better demonstration of the depth of talent across the Tesco Group.</p>
          <p>This brings me on to the C &#x2013; six key objectives I've set for the business. I'm going to return to them regularly in these meetings, because they're what I expect to be judged on. The first one of these is keeping the U.K. strong and growing. It's top of the list. Second, we want Tesco to be outstanding internationally, not just successful. Third, and as the combination of stores and online becomes compelling for customers, we aim to become a multi-channel retailer wherever we trade. Fourth, we will deliver on the potential of Retailing Services, of which the bank is a very big part. Fifth, by applying group skill and scale, we can add even more value and competitive advantage to our business. And finally, after a decade of substantial investment in building the platforms for growth, we'll deliver higher returns on capital to shareholders. This has already begun, and I'm certain that it will continue.</p>
          <p>Now these are our immediate management objectives. These are the things that Tesco is focusing on right now. It's not a new strategy. The strategy that served us well will continue. Tesco is and will remain about growth, and we've got multiple opportunities to pursue that growth in the U.K., in Asia, in Europe, in America, in Food, in General Merchandise, in Clothing and in Services. And of course it will be growth that recognizes our responsibilities to the people that we serve and our commitments to sustainability.</p>
          <p>So as the fundamental elements of our strategy won't alter, some are evolving. For example, as I've said, to recognize our much stronger focus on Internet Retailing. What I'm going to do now is go through each of these objectives in turn, starting with the U.K.</p>
          <p>It was not an easy consumer environment through last year and current conditions are clearly still challenging. Household budgets are under strain from a combination of higher taxes, pressure on incomes and benefits, higher fuel costs and inflation. So it isn't surprising that consumers are cutting back to try and make ends meet.</p>
          <p>As we've seen it's already visible in terms of industry growth in both food and non-food retailing. In Food, fallings in the market are muted. There are positives. Inflations is still low as this chart shows, and food price inflation is quite a bit lower than government statistics might suggest.</p>
          <p>Although the timing of Easter has got some bearing on the rate of inflation, it's running at more like 1% to 1.5% now, not the mid-single digits that get talked about.</p>
          <p>Also, significant numbers of customers are continuing to trade up. In our case that's into Finest, as they look to save money by eating in, by buying better quality to reduce waste. Nevertheless, overall Food growth is unusually low.</p>
          <p>And Non-Food has been much more affected. Overall market demand has faltered since about November, particularly in high ticket in non-essential categories. Again though, it isn't uniform. Customers will spend if you've got the things they want to buy, but generally the environment is difficult and sales are hard to come by.</p>
          <p>However, this tough macroeconomic environment cannot disguise the fact that our performance has been below par. On almost any metric the U.K. is an outstanding business, market share, sales density, margin, returns, but it's lost a bit of momentum. It hasn't been leading and as today's numbers show it hasn't had a great year by its standards.</p>
          <p>Although the background has been unhelpful, it's loss of form has meant that we haven't coped as well as usual with tough trading conditions.</p>
          <p>We didn't lose share, but like-for-like was below the market in the second half and profit growth was below our plan. So we've got some work to do. The issues are not structural. I've taken quite a lot of time to study it. It's really all about the detail.</p>
          <p>Our basic operating standards are fine. We're delivering a pretty good shopping trip most of the time. Prices are good. We've done a lot of things well such as the new stores which continue to perform very well, Express, which has had an outstanding year, and Clubcard that's driving higher and more stable levels of loyalty. But the core business needs to get back to doing things first for customers and executing better, particularly in some areas of Non-Food such as Electronics and Clothing. We need to drive a faster rate of product innovation, we need to make sure there's more sharpness in our communication to customers. The focus and energy which the new team is bringing is starting to make a difference, and there's a lot more to come.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our businesses outside the U.K., I'm going to start with what was not so good, the increased U.S. losses. It's essential that losses come down this year, and so I've spent a lot of time with the Fresh &amp; Easy team and visited stores in every market in recent weeks. As a result, I remain confident that breakeven towards the end of '12, '13 remains a realistic objective.</p>
          <p>The key thing for Fresh &amp; Easy, like any retail business, is getting to shop door profitability. After that, it's mostly about scale. To get there in the U.S., we need more customers. The ones who use Fresh &amp; Easy now, well, they love it. We just need more of them. And I can see quite a few things we can do to drive traffic.</p>
          <p>One very small example, we're already opening our stores earlier in the morning, we're already selling coffee and pastries from an in-store bakery from 7:00 in the morning, not 8:00. That's normal in America, but we weren't doing it.</p>
          <p>There are many, many more things that we can do like that, and I see some promising signs already. Two-year like-for-likes are at 20%, new stores are averaging over $13 a foot. Our best store is now taking over $200,000 a week.</p>
          <p>We've got 30 more stores which should cross the line into profitability during the current year, and I'll be updating you on progress in October.</p>
          <p>We've also seen important improvements coming through in our campus and our distribution productivity. As a result of integrating Wild Rockets and 2 Sisters, that means we can hit breakeven at 300 stores rather than the 400 in the original plan.</p>
          <p>Asia and Europe did very well. They delivered more than two-thirds of the group's growth in trading profit. That was good. But the really important thing for me was we did it at the same time as we had improved like-for-likes and good market share performance.</p>
          <p>We haven't had things our own way in all of our markets. The strong headwinds in Ireland and Hungary, two very important markets for us, did slow us down.</p>
          <p>Let's take a look at Asia first. Sales and profits grew strongly, despite a slower than expected performance in China in the second half, mainly as a result of the government's economic policy tightening. Korea, Thailand and Malaysia delivered good growth and improved returns. It's no accident either they're all strong, winning businesses, and they've got the potential to push on from here to become much bigger contributors to the Group in the future.</p>
          <p>The tough retail environment in Japan has continued to impact our small business there. Obviously, our hearts go out to all those affected by the earthquake and its terrible aftermath. We know we've got work to do with the business there, and we won't commit more capital unless we can clearly see a way to win.</p>
          <p>In Central Europe, where it's been hard yards for many years, I believe we're fully really starting to break through to a new level of performance. Poland and Czech &#x2013; in the past, difficult markets for us &#x2013; and Slovakia all delivered strong growth. Hungary also grew well, and although the background remains difficult, we're winning market share and coping much better than most with the conditions there.</p>
          <p>And there's a lot more to come in Central Europe. Small formats are growing fast. They are profitable. They have low capital intensity. And the Extra format will give our existing hypermarket network even stronger momentum. The eight stores converted so far are seeing uplifts of 16%, and we'll be converting a lot more this year.</p>
          <p>Ireland also made progress in the year, and although the background has remained challenging, we've seen good market share growth. Overall, Europe profits grew well with improved margins.</p>
          <p>We've got a good international new space pipeline for the year, 8.4 million square feet, giving us sales area growth of 12% overall, 14% in Asia, 9% in Europe and 26% in the U.S. This growth includes a steadier pace, with one strand of our expansion in China. That's the freehold mall development. We'll still push hard on with leasehold hypers, but we've got to recognize that getting permissions for the big freehold projects is not as easy as we thought, and it will take longer than we planned.</p>
          <p>To sum up International, we're enjoying increasing success outside the U.K. We've got some really excellent businesses, which I would already define as outstanding. Strong in their markets, growing well, not reliant on the Group to fund their expansion, and returns ahead of the cost of capital.</p>
          <p>In some markets, of course, we still have a long way to go on these measures, and mostly that's about building skill and scale, because we're profitable at store level in all but two countries.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the third objective, matching our Internet capability with our strength in stores to become a truly multi-channel business wherever we trade. We think the combination of stores and online, of clicks and bricks, can have compelling appeal for customers who want alternatives in terms of both how they shop and how their order fulfillment is achieved. Our existing store network, including Express, can make it really convenient for customers, and we think this will be a strategic advantage for Tesco against the pure play retailers and <mark type="ph" /> detailers (14:50).</p>
          <p>For Non-Food in particular, it means going well beyond our present range online. Tesco Direct has been a good start, but we aim to go further, with multiple times more range in stock, moving towards more than 100,000 SKUs and our equivalent in the marketplace. Clearly a key part of this will be taking our General Merchandise, Electronics and Clothing offer to the next level, both in stores and online.</p>
          <p>But this is not only about the U.K. We're also about to take some important steps outside the U.K. this year. I'll give you a couple of examples. Dotcom grocery will be in Prague in the next few months, and Warsaw in early 2012. A sizeable online Non-Food launch is planned in Korea to complement our growing and profitable Dotcom grocery operation there. So there's more to come.</p>
          <p>Whilst investment is needed here, the opportunity enjoys low capital intensity, because it leverages our existing store assets as well as our global and local supply chains and IT infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Our fourth objective, delivering on the potential of retailing services, is mostly about the Bank, because as it emerges from the period of migration, it's going to pick up speed and be the main driver of the push to &#xA3;1 billion of profits from Services.</p>
          <p>The Bank has made good progress in some key areas. Our new IT platforms are fully operational and on time, and we'll complete the migration from RBS in the next few months. And as a result, we've been able to start launching our first new products, such as Fixed Rate Saver, you can see here, launched in October. It went really well, pulling in 40% more funds than we anticipated. Our two new Bank customer service centers, they're up and running, having taken on and trained over 1,000 staff.</p>
          <p>And the trading performance has been good. The Savings book has grown strongly, up by over &#xA3;500 million, as has the Loan book with improved margins. The Credit Card business has had an excellent year, with transaction values up 20%. The Motor Insurance book is growing again, having plateaued before acquisition.</p>
          <p>The Bank has got momentum on customer growth, the migration is almost complete, and our operating ratios, such as bad debts and product margins, are much improved. The completion of migration will improve our offer and service levels for customers, and it will pave the way for important new products, including mortgages later this year. Clearly, there's a lot to do, but the visibility of the good underlying progress in the Bank will begin to show as we go through the year.</p>
          <p>Telecoms has also made good progress, as it broadens its offer into the attractive contract mobile market. Customer numbers are up 24% and Tesco Mobile was the fastest growing network in the U.K. last year. We achieved good growth in contract subscribers, helped by the iPhone 4 launch, and our broadening handset range that we sell through our growing network of Phone Shops. Profit was held back by the initial costs of setting up the Phone Shops and of handset subsidies, but we expect it to pick up this year as the business moves beyond this initial phase of growth.</p>
          <p>And the Telecoms story is not only about the U.K. We've now got an MVNO signed for Slovakia. That has already got itself into profit after a very short period of time.</p>
          <p>The fifth objective is to add value and competitiveness by applying our Group skill and scale across all of our businesses. In the past we've described this as step change, but it's much bigger and broader than that now, and there are three key elements of it. Firstly, better buying. We now source over &#xA3;2 billion of Food and Non-Food product at cost through our global and regional sourcing hubs with substantial savings, and these will grow fast. That's because it's really about countries buying more together, using our efficient global supply chains, for example to do more primary distribution and therefore buying for less.</p>
          <p>The second element is infrastructure sharing. That's delivering big savings, too. For example, our support center in Bangalore not only supports the U.K. business, but is taking on activities currently done in businesses across the Group from invoice processing to store design. Without it, we'd already have to add back around &#xA3;100 million a year to our global cost base, and that saving will only get bigger.</p>
          <p>The third element of applying Group skill and scale is the operating model. That ensures we don't have to reinvent things as our countries grow. It means we can be quicker and cheaper to market for customers as we build our brand around the world. For example, it costs us just &#xA3;0.5 million to put Clubcard into a new market today, and installing world-class sales-based ordering only costs &#xA3;2 million compared with the &#xA3;100 million it cost to develop in the U.K. These are already material benefits, and with our renewed determination they will rapidly increase.</p>
          <p>And finally, our sixth objective is to deliver higher returns for shareholders by capitalizing on the platforms built and the investments made. As you know for well over a decade including through the recession, we've been investing hard in our strategy. We've done a lot of the heavy lifting now, putting the networks down, building the capability, the infrastructure, the scale and the competitiveness.</p>
          <p>The investment case for Tesco has also been about growth and returns. That won't change and we see some exciting growth to come, but with those investments maturing, returns and cash generation are also coming through. That's why we're setting a date for our return on capital employed target to be met. We plan to hit 14.6% return on capital employed by the 2014, '15 financial year.</p>
          <p>With well over &#xA3;20 billion of capital employed in the group, on a good current level of return by industry standards, this is a substantial increase and it's happening now. Laurie will talk about that in more detail very shortly.</p>
          <p>Linked to this, we're not only aiming to align more closely performance and reward around returns in the board room, we're also going to take a similar approach for the whole senior management team, which today is over 500 strong.</p>
          <p>So, to sum up, we've got six clear objectives. They're about continuing to drive forward growth, about sharp execution and about a very strong focus on delivering increased returns for shareholders now and in the future. But in closing I wanted to say a few things about what shareholders should expect from me.</p>
          <p>The first thing, and for those of you who know me, this won't be altogether new, is more focus, more energy, more drive and determination. That's the way I like Tesco to work. I like us to be in shops. I like us to be close to customers. I like us to be close to colleagues.</p>
          <p>The second is that I aim to be open and willing to engage, including discussing what's not so good about our performance as well as the many good things that are going on. Tesco's success is all about people, about serving customers well and gaining the loyalty and the commitments of our staff.</p>
          <p>We've also put communities at the heart of what we do and have established a leadership role on sustainability, particular &#x2013; particularly in the area of climate change. Shareholders can only benefit if we keep our unrelenting focus on all these things: our customers, our colleagues, the communities we serve.</p>
          <p>We built a great business and we're really excited about the future. In the end of course, it's all about performance. That's what matters and that's what we intend to deliver. Thank you for listening. I'll now hand over to Laurie.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Phil, and good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>So despite a difficult economic environment in a number of our markets we've delivered a strong Group performance, double-digit profit growth, a strengthened balance sheet and an increased return on capital employed. Here's a summary of our group performance: Group sales were &#xA3;68 billion, up 8.1%. Group trading profit rose by 7.8% and underlying profits grew by 12.3%.</p>
          <p>Before property profits, underlying profits also grew by 12%. Consistent with our policy of growing dividends broadly in line with diluted underlying EPS, the full year dividend is 14.46 pence, up 10.8% on a constant tax rate basis. Net debt has reduced by more than the &#xA3;1 billion in the year to &#xA3;6.8 billion, that's beating our target by &#xA3;200 million. And return on capital employed has increased from 12.1% to 12.9%.</p>
          <p>I'd like to highlight some of the important areas of this year's performance, what's not so good and what's good, starting with the income statement. In the U.K. we achieved a respectable profit performance in challenging conditions. Sales growth was slower than the historical trend, principally due to the pressure on consumers from petrol prices, inflation more generally, and taxes. We estimate that for the typical family the combined effect is about &#xA3;18 a week, or the equivalent of a 7% rise in the basic rate of tax.</p>
          <p>Moving to the U.K. profit performance, we maintained a stable margin despite the higher rents from sale and leasebacks and the additional investment in Clubcard points. Stripping out the impact of the increased rents, our U.K. profits grew by 6.4%, significantly ahead of sales.</p>
          <p>We delivered a strong performance in Asia; sales grew by 22% and profits grew by 30%. Margins strengthened by 35 basis points to 5.6% and with increases in Thailand, Malaysia and Korea. The margin for Asia is now back to its pre-recession level. The acquired Homever stores delivered a 6.5% margin and this is just two years after they were loss making at acquisition.</p>
          <p>In China we performed well but we didn't reach breakeven in the second half. This was due to the impact on customers from the government's tightening economic policy, high cost inflation and our store rollout being slower than planned. Of course we are planning to improve on this performance in the coming year.</p>
          <p>In Europe sales and profits grew at their fastest rate for a number of years. We made significant market share gains and margins improved to 5.7%. The benefits of our continued investment through the downturn are starting to bear fruit.</p>
          <p>In addition, a lot of good work has started on our regional scale initiatives, such as joint buying, harmonizing of seasonal promotions and the rollout of our Extra format. In Hungary, we've been subject to a retrospective crisis tax of &#xA3;32 million. The European Commission is investigating the legality of the tax because of its discriminatory impact; however, as it currently stands, we're due to pay a similar amount in the next two years.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. we had previously guided that losses had plateaued, but they, in fact, they increased by &#xA3;16 million at constant exchange rates. Let me explain why. As you can see from this chart, the strong like-for-like margin performance were offset by the impact of new stores. This represents about 40% of the estate. The rise in losses, however, was primarily caused by the short-term additional integration costs from the acquisition of our two key fresh suppliers. There were many positives in Fresh &amp; Easy's performance, as Phil touched on. Like-for-like sales were consistently strong through the year, and in Q4 we had a two-year like-for-like of 20%, so real progress. Many of our financial and operational metrics are improving, including losses per week per store, which are coming down steadily.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Bank, we had a strong trading performance with good growth in customer numbers. For example, Credit Cards were up 11%, Loans up 17% and Motor Insurance up 8%. Income has benefited from continued improvement in interest margins, larger customer balances and a 20% growth in credit card spend. We've been able to absorb the higher running costs during migration phase, and going forward, our cost/income ratio will improve.</p>
          <p>Our bad debt charge was 26% lower despite growth in the Loan books, so that's extremely encouraging. The stronger underlying performance has resulted in the release of provisions created under acquisition accounting, specifically &#xA3;155 million of fair value and &#xA3;50 million of payment protection insurance. Reflecting an industry-wide trend of higher bodily injury claims, we've increased our provisions by &#xA3;99 million.</p>
          <p>As you can see from the chart, after stripping away the various adjustments, the baseline profitability of the Bank was up 20% while absorbing the impact of our migration costs. In 2011 and '12, the headline trading profit number will not increase much as the fair value provisions release has materially unwound. But we are expecting a good improvement in the base line profitability.</p>
          <p>During the course of the year, the Bank's capital position strengthened, moving its risk/asset ratio from 12.8% to 13.5% and its core Tier 1 ratio from 12.9% to 15.9%. This reflects our prudent approach to the Bank's balance sheet, and a steady preparation for mortgage launch.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the Group balance sheet, net debt reduced by &#xA3;1.1 billion to &#xA3;6.8 billion and CapEx was &#xA3;3.7 billion, which was 5.5% to sales. Going forward we expect to maintain CapEx in the range of 5% to 5.5% while maintaining our freehold mix at around 70%. The maturity of our investments in Asia and Europe, coupled with our improving capital efficiency, is key to achieving this lower rate.</p>
          <p>Our cash flow from operations was strong once again. The U.K. generated &#xA3;3.6 billion versus &#xA3;1.7 billion of cash CapEx. Although CapEx for our International business was slightly greater than our operating cash flow, we were cash flow positive in Korea, Ireland, Thailand and the Czech Republic.</p>
          <p>With our strong operational cash flow and our growing property divestment program, net debt is set to fall further in the coming years. However, as we have a balance sheet, a balance of funding from corporate debt and leases, it's important to look at our liabilities holistically. So for this reason, I'll be focusing more on fixed charge cover, which we are targeting to be between 4 and 4.5 times. As you can also see from the chart, our total net indebtedness has already improved to the levels of 2008, and we are targeting this to improve further to 2.5 times.</p>
          <p>Our property strategy is an integral part of how we retail, and at our interims, we promised to update you on this. But before I get into the detail, I'd like to set out the overall philosophy. Tesco's property activities have one principal objective, to ensure that we have the best properties from which to retail. As a result, we also create long-term shareholder value from property development and management. This year we sold &#xA3;1.9 billion of assets at sub-5% yields, and this now completes the five-year program set out in 2006. In summary, this program has delivered in excess of &#xA3;5 billion of proceeds, &#xA3;1.3 billion worth of underlying profits and funded a 1.1 billion share buyback.</p>
          <p>I think the best way to describe our strategy going forward is in the context of a couple of questions. First, is the profit from the sale of property a real and sustainable profit stream? And second, if it is real, what would be a reasonable expectation of the level of profits a property owner, such as ourselves, should deliver?</p>
          <p>Looking at the first question, the only profit we intend to release is the value we add when we develop a site into a completed store that has a vacant possession value higher than its net book value. There's no way to release this value except through the sale of the property, as it's effectively trapped. This is shown in the chart in green. As long as we are creating as much development profit as we are releasing, then it will be sustainable. And any other profit through rental inflation or Tesco's covenant, shown here in yellow bars, would get to shareholders through trading profit.</p>
          <p>In terms of the amount of profit we intend to release, we are targeting &#xA3;250 million to &#xA3;350 million per year and these next few charts illustrate why this kind of figure makes sense. First, property companies typically earn about 8% on assets and that's on the market value of our properties, this would equate to about &#xA3;2.5 billion of income a year, shown here as the blue bar on the left.</p>
          <p>If Tesco's freehold stores were rented at the market rental yields this would return about &#xA3;2.1 billion, which would leave a sum, which is &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; is the sum in the red bars on the chart, and this leaves about &#xA3;400 million to be earned from development activities.</p>
          <p>A second approach is to look at our own empirical experience as a developer. As with any portfolio there's a range of performance, but looking back over the last decade, when we compare the market value of a completed site with the capital invested we've typically created a 10% uplift on U.K. projects and mid-teen uplifts internationally. And based on our current annual investment in land and building of around &#xA3;2.5 billion pounds, a 10% to 15% uplift would mean that in a typical year we'll generate between &#xA3;250 million and &#xA3;400 million of value as a developer.</p>
          <p>So bringing these two methodologies together, as shown on this new chart, it's our judgment that &#xA3;250 million to &#xA3;350 million is an appropriate and sustainable target, and that's what you should expect from us going forward. It's a little less than recent history, but it won't have an adverse effect on earnings growth or dividends, and that's because the reduction will be gradual and profit growth in the rest of the Group will be strong. We expect to divest just over &#xA3;1 billion pounds per year to generate this level of profits, and clearly if we're divesting &#xA3;1 billion pounds while investing &#xA3;2.5 billion pounds in stores and land, this is a sustainable strategy and the asset base will continue to grow. With a steady level of divestment and property profit, we expect rent as a proportion of the Group EBITDA to remain broadly constant.</p>
          <p>In our Asia and Europe business we have sizeable mall portfolios, which are important contributors obviously to country profitability. However, mall income grows at a slower rate and produces lower returns than a Tesco Hyper. Some of our malls have been fully developed, but many have significant opportunity for redevelopment, for example, to convert a small strip of shops alongside a hypermarket into a large mall. This chart shows an example of a prospective development in Asia and the expected value creation from the project. The plan is to expand the mall from 170,000 square feet to 600,000 square feet. The cost of the redevelopment is expected to be about &#xA3;50 million, but the increase in market value will be about &#xA3;100 million. Importantly, this results in a far superior shopping experience for our customers.</p>
          <p>In the future you'll see us selling some of our fully developed malls and leasing back the hypermarket. We'll then use the proceeds created to redevelop some of our smaller strip malls, but importantly it will always be our objective to manage our malls.</p>
          <p>The final subject I'd like to discuss is returns, and at over 12%, Tesco's return on capital is already good by industry standards. I'm pleased to say that we've made good progress in the last year, increasing our ROCE from 12.1% to 12.9% and on our way to our 14.6% target. As you can see from this chart, most of the step up came from operational improvements in the form of strong profit growth and improved working capital, and about 40 basis points came from greater capital efficiency as a result of the sale and leaseback program. To demonstrate our commitment to the increased focus on returns, we'd like to provide more clarity on both the shape and timeframes for the improvements going forward. We plan to reach our 14.6% by 2014, '15. As this chart shows, our profit growth starts to outweigh our capital growth materially as businesses become more mature and our margins improve.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows the current ROCE of each part of our business. Our largest businesses, the U.K., Korea, Ireland, Thailand, Hungary and the Bank, which combined represent three-quarters of the group's capital employed, are achieving good returns already. In Poland, Slovakia, Czech, Malaysia, the infrastructure's broadly complete, we have leading market positions, and our weighting of immature capital will fall. Now this cohort will be around about 10% ROCE by 2014, '15.</p>
          <p>And finally, we have our emerging businesses, and these are building infrastructure, have a high proportion of immature capital, and are not yet profitable. Now as a growth business, we'll always have some immature capital, but we expect this cohort to <mark type="ph" /> be returning to (38:44) the Group's WACC within the next four years. So what's currently a significant drag on the Group today, will start to diminish.</p>
          <p>The U.K. will also contribute. Returns have made steady progress in recent history. Sales densities have held up well and the capital cost per square foot has fallen and margins have risen. And going forward, we will see more of the same but with particular emphasis on reduced WIP and the growth in Retail Services.</p>
          <p>So to sum up, we've delivered steady profit growth in the U.K., and outstanding growth in Asia and Europe. We're making progress in China and the U.S., but clearly we've got more to do. We're in the last few months of the migration phase in the Bank and strong underlying profits are coming through. We have an excellent property portfolio that will release sustainable profits. And finally, with strong cash flow, good capital discipline, we'll be strengthening our balance sheet and delivering an improving return on capital employed.</p>
          <p>Thank you. We will now take questions.</p>

          <p>Good. Thank you, Laurie. We'll just open it up for questions, right? There are microphones around. So if you put your hand up and if just say where you're from, that would always be helpful. Let's start with Andrew. Sorry, Philip.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Andrew Kasoulis, Credit Suisse. Phil, just sort of three things that you didn't touch on, just to get a sense of where you are at the start of your tenure. Views on double Clubcard points, please. Do you think you'll keep them? Secondly, you spoke a lot about base infrastructure, do you think you'll be entering any more countries over the next few years? I know you've touched on, talked about Indonesia in the past, for example. And thirdly, can you give us a bit more detail on what you're thinking about linking a broader management base to returns. Will you keep the same measure of return on capital for example and link a bigger pool of people to that current return on capital or will you change your definition of return on capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I'll answer them in reverse order, because the easy one was at the end and the more difficult one was in the middle or the beginning. Yeah. We'll keep the same definition of return on capital employed. We want to incentivize the top 500 to deliver their share of the returns growth as much as their share of the top line and the profit growth and we haven't done that quite as systematically. So that's what we'll be doing. And 500 managers there, broadly speaking, in all of our businesses, the top couple of levels.</p>
          <p>New markets, always tempting. I think we recognize that at least for a year or two we should focus on what we're doing and demonstrate that we can make good progress in each element of our strategy and against our six objectives.</p>
          <p>Clubcard points and doubling has really worked for us in terms of improving the loyalty of our customers, our most loyal customers in the U.K. So I think we'll stick with it, but I mean I wouldn't like to rule out anything, because I don't really know what will happen in the next 12 to 24 months in the U.K. We're being cautious about these things. I also wouldn't want to give too much away to my competitors.</p>

          <p>Hi, there. <mark type="ph" /> Philip Dahlgren of Pamio (42:37). Can I just ask three questions, please, sir? Can you just say, Phil, what you think in Non-Food you're doing wrong and what you're doing to improve it? Secondly, why did you lose market share over the year in China? And did I detect that you were changing your sales targets you outlined in November, or was that just me mishearing something with old age? And thirdly, what were the actual U.S. losses when you add back the restructuring costs with the two manufacturing businesses and you add back the foreign currency movement, which you took out, what was the actual loss that you incurred, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm going to answer two of those questions, the Non-Food and the lose market share in seven cities and then I'll let Laurie talk about the total losses in the U.S. Non-Food, just around about the time people were trying to balance their budgets even more, our clothing wasn't on song. It wasn't of the moment in the U.K., and our general merchandise was a bit stale. It could have been a bit fresher. It had got run down a bit during the recession, more good than better, and hardly any best. Space allocations need to change, because consumers buy different things, too. So that's the issue for us in Non-Food. Only in the hypermarkets, only in a couple hundred stores, but it did make a difference.</p>
          <p>Market share, the market share we showed up there on the chart is only seven cities, because that's all we can get at the moment, and we're trying to grow in three big regions. We're trying to get a better market share number. I don't worry about that at all, and I'm not revising my opinion of where the sales number can get to in China. Clearly we need to step up our rate of growth, which is all part of our plan. It is difficult though to get new stores as quickly as would we like, whether they're leasehold or freehold. I don't want to give up on the quality. I want stores that can sustain.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Inc. ForEx, the loss was &#xA3;186 million, backing out the ForEx, got us to &#xA3;181 million on constant currency. And the impact of integrating 2 Sisters Food Group and Wild Rocket Foods was &#xA3;9 million. So if you back that out as well, then you've got a deterioration in the U.S.'s performance of about &#xA3;7 million year-on-year at constant currency, and without the impact of the two new suppliers being integrated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>One of the things I'm quite pleased about Fresh &amp; Easy is the Campus, having had a good chance to look at the business case, the rationale and then seeing it in real life. Wild Rocket, 2 Sisters plus the Campus, take out all the management, lots of ex-pats, run it with your own team, and then start to buy properly for the three. Now all of our chicken now is all bought for the Campus, the kitchen and the meat. So that's meant that the increased productivity stream we can see coming from there is going to mean breakeven at a few other stores. We haven't got to go up 400 to get there. We can do it at 300. And the quality is improving as well. We were out there a couple of weeks ago, David and I, looking at it, and the meat quality is significantly better because we're buying it, and we're controlling the end-to-end supply chain.</p>

          <p>Hi. It's David McCarthy, Evolution Securities. Just two questions, first of all your predecessor had given us some medium-term guidance for U.K. growth of 3% to 4% like-for-like and 3% to 4% for new space. Are you going to sort of accept that guidance? Or are you going to do your own thing and give us some different numbers? And then secondly, you talk about developing countries like Poland, Czech, Slovakia, et cetera, but you've been in these countries now for 15 years and you're still only getting a 5% return. So when are we going to see these countries, the underperforming ones, actually make a step change and deliver good returns?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then. You do the second one first then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I do the first one now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you're right. We've been in Central Europe for quite a while, but as you remember there was a real space race into Central Europe. A lot of retailers came in. If there was a silver lining in the cloud of the recession, it's been particularly difficult for many of our competitors. It's been difficult for us as well, but it does feel that we're winning the war of attrition in terms of those particular markets, as shown by our market share improvements. There's been, I feel, a very good start in terms of looking at Central Europe as a homogeneous region. We are organizing distribution as one region. We're buying as, this may surprise you, but we didn't buy for the same season at the same time. We didn't run the same marketing campaigns ostensibly across all those markets. That has really helped us in terms of the efficiency of POS or the efficiency of the distribution team, or the efficiency of our marketing.</p>
          <p>We're also doing much more group buying for the Central European business. So that's not just the Central European business. We're adding the U.K. business and the Republic of Ireland to our buying power, which is helping our margins. And if anything, David, it's a margin story. We get actually a very similar asset turn in Korea as we do to Central Europe. It's just our margins aren't high enough. And what we've seen, particularly over the last financial year, is a very good improvement in the margins in those markets. And as I showed in that cohort slide, we feel within the '14, '15 timeframe, that we'll be getting to a 10% return on capital employed for those markets. Not brilliant, accept that, but a very good improvement, and to do that within the next three or four years I think will stand us well.</p>
          <p>Of course added to the ostensibly hypermarket investment that we've done in Central Europe, we're now in-filling with a lot of more capital efficient and higher-returning small format stores, convenience stores, expresses. You saw us do the recent small acquisition in the Czech Republic that of course gives us a really good kick start to convenience retailing in the Czech Republic as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the other thing, David, is, my view is that we've seen some consolidation but there will be more. There are some major operators who are not making any money, and we agree with you that 5%, we want more. There are some that are making no returns, and I think in the next few years, if we keep pushing on, then that gap will widen, and it will be to our benefit.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And to your first question, I think I will do my own thing, as it happens. And I can see good opportunities to improve the competitiveness of the U.K. &#x2013; of the U.K. business. I see opportunities to improve like-for-like. But I'm not going to be pinned down to a number. I think that would be foolish now given the cautious outlook that most people have on the U.K. economy, so. We don't need the economy to dramatically improve for Tesco to improve its performance. And, yeah, so I think I'll do my own thing.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Alastair Johnston from Citigroup. Just a couple of questions with your Motor Insurance, I see you took a big hit there of &#xA3;99 million. Is that purely in the second half, first of all? And then I presume going forward, you've seen premiums go up very strongly, so can we assume that premium growth will kind of more than offset that in a way, in an operational sense over the next couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, why doesn't Laurie give us the facts about Half 1 and Half 2 in Motor Insurance so I don't call it wrong? Before he does that, Alastair, the important thing that has happened is that we've actually built a bank and we've transitioned the systems, the processes, the people, the selling, the risk management, the underwriting, away from RBS to our own team of people, backed up by Aegis, who are the experts behind the scenes. And the experience for customers is very, very different. It's remarkably different. I just tried to renew my motor insurance and got handed over from RBS to Tesco, and well it was &#x2013; it was <mark type="indiscernible" /> (51:59), it was that different. And so we're now &#x2013; we'll complete that migration by November, which means any new business we're writing ourselves on our new rating engines, and then from November it will be every other policy will go the same way. So it's a better experience, better controlled, completely in our own hands, not black boxed. That gives us much more certainty and we feel very good about that.</p>
          <p>On the provisions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Alastair, you're right that the &#xA3;99 million was taken in the second half of our financial year.</p>
          <p>As you'll know, there are two types of provisioning behind bodily insurance claims. There's capped claims, which are kind of less than &#xA3;100,000 and typically have been growing over the last three to four years. The ambulance chasing type of phenomena.</p>
          <p>And the second side is the uncapped claims. And these are large claims, multi-million pound claims.</p>
          <p>And what happened in the second half is actually the provisions that had been provided in 2003 and 2004 weren't sufficient to make the claims on those particular events by about &#xA3;5 million in 2003 and &#xA3;6 million in 2004.</p>
          <p>So that's the actual performance. What then happens is the actuaries extrapolate that experience through all of your provisions, and coming up to the end of 2009, that would have been about &#xA3;82 million, &#xA3;83 million. And then there were five large events in 2010 that were individually over &#xA3;6 million in total.</p>
          <p>So that encompasses why we've had to increase our provisions so radically in the second half, as opposed to why didn't it go with the trend now? It's of course an industry trend. You've seen RBS's own numbers and other motor insurers having to do the same thing.</p>
          <p>In terms of the second part of your question, yes, there's a significant increase in the cost of premiums, and that therefore widens the margin and increases our ability to cope with a higher level of what is called net operating loss or net loss ratio in insurance parlance.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Clive Black, from Shore Capital. A few questions, if I may. Firstly, is there any reappraisal of your thinking about long term space plans in the U.K. and do you see cannibalization as a particular issue for you in this market? And how do you measure that?</p>
          <p>Secondly, you didn't mention India in your appraisal of the world.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, with respect to the balance sheet, should we assume that dividends rise in line with property profits? You may have said that in the statement, but if not, could you clarify that?</p>
          <p>And you mentioned share buybacks, Laurie. Would you consider those being back on the agenda in the foreseeable future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Clive. Why don't you take the balance sheet, dividend rise, share buybacks points first, Laurie?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the property profits are in our underlying profits. I know you guys like to back it out, but we've always put it in. And our dividend will grow in line &#x2013; broadly in line with the underlying diluted EPS at constant tax rate basis. That's our basic policy.</p>
          <p>And share buybacks, we feel we've got a lot of heavy lifting to do to get to the 14.6% and make our balance sheet much stronger in terms of fixed charge cover and our level of indebtedness, which I hope you're happy with the kind of balance that we're taking there.</p>
          <p>So really a conversation about share buyback is not really on the table at the moment, but once the heavy lifting is done, then we can have that conversation, if that's the best thing to do with the cash that Tesco is generating.</p>

          <p>I didn't mention India. It's very small for us. It's, at the moment, 10 hypermarkets we operate for Star Bizarre. They're going very well. We were just there, I was just there a couple of weeks ago, actually.</p>
          <p>So very exciting. But you know that foreign-backed investment is not allowed, and so we play the waiting game. We help Tata and Sons grow their business, and who knows what might happen there in the future. I think it is one very much for the future. I'm glad that we're there, though, to be honest with you, because we're learning a lot and we're thinking about how we might be part of the growth of that economy, consumer economy.</p>
          <p>You asked about reappraising U.K. space growth. Our space growth is largely a consequence of the work in progress that we've had on the balance sheet for a few years. These are stores in places we want to be. We've always wanted to be there. And we still see that they are going to give us a good store and a good return. So there's no major reappraisal of our space growth strategy.</p>
          <p>There is, though, as part of our immediate set of objectives, a real determination to build out the Internet Retailing business in the U.K., 'cause we see them, the two, existing quite nicely as means of distribution and means of being a shop window for what's available online at Tesco.</p>
          <p>2.5 million square feet of space opening in the U.K. this year. Extras superstores, high-street stores and convenience stores. And the percentage growth in the space will gently fall away in the future, because it isn't always going to be possible to do as much. But I'm glad that we are going to.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. Sreedhar Mahamkali from Macquarie. Three questions, please.</p>
          <p>Firstly, Phil, in the U.K., can you talk about U.K. board's focus outside Non-Food? You spent a bit of time on Non-Food.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In Food, what are the focus areas, what are you doing? Can you give us some examples?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in Non-Food, when should we start to see some improvements from a lower base in the second half, clearly? That's one.</p>
          <p>Number two, can you talk about differences in performance by format in the U.K.? Is Extra continuing to struggle? Is that what you're building out in terms of your expectations? Is it just non-food and Extra? Is there anything else? That's the second one.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, can you also talk a little bit about how the year has started for you, please? Thanks. New year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that was four questions actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was, yeah. My counting is all over the place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't really want to talk very much about the focus of the U.K. board, beyond to say that it's the U.K. business. And every day they get up, they've only really got to focus on one thing.</p>
          <p>Richard Brasher leads the U.K., and so it's, about 335 days of the year, his thing. And we've put a good team around him, and they know precisely what it is that we expect of them. And they're getting a lot of help to pursue that. So I don't really want to say much more than that.</p>
          <p>In terms of, I think your third question, which was how the format is performing, well, there is a weakness in the Extras, in part because they're out of town and people have to drive to them, and in part because of the Non-Food issue. And so I may just have given you an area of focus for the U.K. that I didn't want to give you, but we all make mistakes.</p>
          <p>And how has the year started? Very well, outside the U.K., in America, in Asia, in Europe, we've been very pleased. It's difficult to call most of Europe and the U.K. because of the Easter timing. This is Easter week. We'll judge it at the end of the first quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. It's James Grzinic from Jefferies. I had two very quick questions.</p>
          <p>The first one was, did we hear today &#x2013; your full commitment to the U.S. today, is this saying Tesco is fully committed to Fresh &amp; Easy in the U.S. for the long term?</p>
          <p>And also I had a quick question for Laurie in terms of longer term, what should we think you &#x2013; what yield will you achieve on the &#xA3;1 billion of the property proceeds longer term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I thought you'd already answered the first one, Phil, buy maybe is there anything you want to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, did you say &#x2013; did I say I was, or did I say I wasn't?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you fully committed for the long term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are there to stay...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I like to take it one step at a time. I've had a couple of weeks to look at the business up close. I've already explained this is the year we want to see the losses come down. So let's get the losses down. Let's get the customer numbers up. We can talk at the half-year about what's next.</p>
          <p>We've already got one other milestone out there, which is '12, '13, we want to be getting to some months of breakeven. So let's take it one step at a time.</p>
          <p>In 2004, someone said to me, get out of Malaysia. You've got four stores. You make no money. You're never going to be anything. A lot of hard work meant that today we're the market leader in Malaysia, and we generate good profits and the prospect of strong returns.</p>
          <p>So that's the way I look at it. The easiest thing to do is just to fold, but I think what we'll do is we'll just lay out the milestones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Laurie, anything else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. You should expect us to continue to do more of the same in terms of yield performance, James.</p>
          <p>The yields are &#x2013; in terms of the portfolio of assets that we own, the yields are best in the U.K. at the moment, not surprisingly, because of kind of low GDP growth. But we will do increasingly more internationally, and the yields are wider in those markets.</p>
          <p>But we're seeing quite a bit of yield compression, and that's going to be a good profit stream for us. There's significant improvements in both Asia and Central Europe, even over the recent history of the last three years. But on average, you'd expect us to do a sub-5% yield going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Simon Dunn from Liberum Capital. Two quick questions, if possible?</p>
          <p>Could you flesh out a little bit more of the comments about the China, the Planning Commission and the reduced building of the freehold malls, the <mark type="ph" /> lifescan (1:03:18) malls? I think you talked in November about 50, with 50 of these by 2014/15. Clearly that's something that you're revising. Could you give us a little bit more flavor on that?</p>
          <p>And secondly, can you help us out a little bit about the fourth quarter, where there looks to have been quite a sharp like-for-like deterioration, particularly given what you told us on the Christmas trading statement? How much of that is sort of the Easter pool? And how much of it is underlying? And should we be concerned that there appears to be a new low in terms of underlying growth and the impact on margins in the U.K.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're going to take the Q4 first. Laurie, yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, the headline like-for-like, as you can see from the broker pack, it did come down in the fourth quarter. But actually it's just purely a function of the comps of the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>If you looked at the two-year like-for-like &#x2013; I'm talking about outside the U.K. and specific to Asia, Simon, I think that's your question, yeah? Because if you look at the two-year like-for-likes, they continue to increase, even in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was actually talking about the U.K. -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh. I thought you said China and then you went into fourth quarter. So, sorry. You lost me a bit there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. No. China was just &#x2013; you mentioned...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the U.K. we had a negative quarter in terms of like-for-like. And that was purely performance driven. There's not really any seasonal impact that can account for that. That was our own underperformance, and we've explained that pretty fully.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do get confused with all these numbers on Page 4. I've now got to have inc. VAT, inc. petrol; inc. VAT, ex petrol; ex VAT, inc. petrol; ex VAT, ex petrol, and IFRIC13 compliance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. No. It's good that you gave us the disclosure. So we're happy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the interesting things about that number though is, the top number, which is inc.VAT, inc. petrol, the Half 2 growth was 1.6, the Q4 was 1.7, and the Q3 was 1.6. This shows how much people are having to spend on petrol, if you look at the delta between the two. It goes back to the Extra point. Difficult for people to put petrol in their car and drive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shopping malls, yeah. I've been surprised at how difficult it's been to actually get the schemes to Planning Commission. We've got 22 which are contracted and are going to be built. We'd have liked that number now to have been 50.</p>
          <p>Originally we said we would get 80 of these things open. It looks now like that original 50 number is going to slip by at least a year, maybe two years. It is only one way in which Tesco was ever going to grow in China, leasehold, convenience. There'll be more ways to grow. So you'll see about six more open this year. We'd have liked that to be have been more like 12. It isn't going to be. And then we'll steadily build up the number opening, but it will take us longer than we thought.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the trend in terms of the capital that you predict, is it the same sort of &#x2013; should we push it back by roughly the same proportion? I think you talked about &#xA3;2.3 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. You could push it back by proportion, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that somebody over here was trying to ask a question. Sorry, I couldn't see you around there. There we are. It's John Kershaw, is it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't see you, John. Got you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's John Kershaw from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Just a couple.</p>
          <p>First of all, on the U.K., Phil, if you may, why are you so confident you can turn it around without investment in the margin? Because you've already done price guarantee, and there has been a marked step-up in investment. Competitors even acknowledge that. So perhaps expand on that. Perhaps in the context of where you see the U.K., as well.</p>
          <p>Secondly, in terms of your return slides, they actually seem to suggest that you can grow returns without the benefits of sale and leaseback. So can you just make that statement clean? Because I think the market, just hearing the underlying sort of returns pre-property sale and leaseback go up in all regions would be positive, in the new sort of openness era.</p>
          <p>China, how opening fewer stores did that make you make more of a loss? Normally don't you carry a start up loss? And <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:07:44) openness, the U.S., we knew the costs from the two production facilities at Half 1, so is there another reason why losses got a bit weaker?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's four questions actually, in this period of openness. I thought I'd just share that with you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with the ROCE one...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Laurie is taking the answers away from me. Laurie?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the ROCE does improve to 14.6% from 12.9%, really not requiring any contribution from the sale and leaseback program. Actually our property profits will actually decline through that period, so it's becoming lesser of an effect from the 12.9% to the 14.6%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Question Inaudible] (1:08:34)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You do, yeah. But the key driver in terms of the numerator is obviously the property profit, and if property profit is lower from the start point to '14, '15, then you're actually going to get actually a neutral effect of contribution to ROCE from sale and leaseback programs. So that was one of the four.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on China, we said that we'd get to breakeven, which meant we were losing money before. We planned to get to breakeven. We didn't get to breakeven, didn't increase our losses. We didn't ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Question Inaudible] (1:09:12)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's true, but you also bring in new store income, and it depends when you open the stores in the year. On the USA, it really is as simple as you have to get more customers. And I know I'm sounding like a bit of a stuck record, but in all other respects it does very well, it just doesn't get enough customers. And that means then you &#x2013; that means, well it's as simple as that. The new stores have got to open with more customers and the existing stores have got to have more customers and that's it. And that's the game.</p>
          <p>Little people need to shout loud in order to get attention. And it's a little business that needs to shout loud, and a few other things besides.</p>
          <p>On the U.K., why am I so confident? It's because there's nothing structurally wrong with the U.K. business. Our prices are good. Our quality is good. Our ranges are good. Our service is good, but they can all be better.</p>
          <p>And Tesco's customer base is very loyal. It just wants us to be back on form and then we add the other elements of our competitive offer, which include the Internet Retailing business that can go a bit faster, Non-Food that can go a bit better and a bit stronger. So that's why I'm confident.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question or two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the left.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Geoff Ruddell, Morgan Stanley. Just firstly, following up on John's question. You need more customers in the U.S., what sort of like-for-like do you need over the next two years in the U.S. in order to hit that breakeven target?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, in the broker pack you sort of set out the space growth plans for the year, and it's very noticeable that the second half seems to have the vast majority of the new space in the U.K., on a ratio of sort of five or six to one relative to the first half. I was just wondering if there was anything strange behind that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the space growth is just because of the way in which the program unwinds. It's all about when you start work and when you finish it. That's all it is, I think. Nothing sinister about that at all.</p>
          <p>Well we do need higher levels of like-for-like in the U.S. than we're getting today. And I'm not really going to pin myself down to a number. Someone else will learn our costs, that's not the quite the right thing to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Any other last questions, one here and then we'll break up. It's Matt, is it? Yeah. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, there. Matt Truman, JPMorgan. Two sort of medium term strategic questions I guess. One, how quickly can you ramp the U.K. Internet business up? How quickly does it become a driver taking the lead, presumably with a view of Amazon in the rear mirror? And secondly, just international margins, obviously a big step up this year, approaching 6%, borderline industry leading. Obviously if you exclude rental income a little bit more to go for, but how realistically can these margins keep progressing and progressing, how high can they go medium term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have been ramping up the Internet business at home, firstly in Food. We invested in one-hour delivery slots in London. Should have done that a bit more quickly. That's been very good for growth. And the Non-Food infrastructure is largely down. It's now about the range enhancements. And so you'll see things happening today and in the future.</p>
          <p>On international margins, that backs to our whole point about leveraging the Group skill and the Group scale. I think those are great opportunities for us. If you actually back out the mall income in Europe and Asia, margins are lower than the U.K, which doesn't have any rental streams. We don't see any reason why our margins from our Store business can't be in the region that they are from the U.K. business, as the businesses themselves get more scale. And they get more skill, because if you treble the size of China, you can have another 150 buyers, and that's really what matters. The ratio of buyers to SKUs, the narrower it is, the more expertise you get, the better able you are to put together categories that really work for customers. Thank you.</p>
