          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Express Scripts Third Quarter 2009 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we'll conduct a question-and-answer section and instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. David Myers. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. With me today are George Paz, our Chairman and CEO, and Jeff Hall, our CFO.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I need to read the following statement. Statements or comments made on this conference call may be forward-looking statements and may include, but are not necessarily limited to, financial projections or other statements of the company's plans, objectives, expectations or intentions. These matters involve certain risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ significantly from those projected or suggested in any forward-looking statement due to a variety of factors, which are discussed in detail in our filings with the SEC. In addition, a reconciliation of EBITDA to net income can be found in our earnings release which is posted on our website.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, who will provide details on our third quarter results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David. As most of you know, we had another strong quarter with adjusted EPS of $0.81. This excludes non-recurring items, but includes $0.18 of financing cost related to the NextRx transaction. On an apples-to-apples comparison of the base business, we're up 22% over last year due to strong underlying financials. Gross profit percentage for the quarter continued to strengthen at 10.9%, up 140 basis points from last year.</p>
          <p>Total adjusted scripts were up over 2%, due to some mid-year starts and increased utilization patterns and home delivery claims were up again sequentially as our behavioral economics tools continued to show positive results for our clients.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned last quarter, due to our strong operating performance we've increased our investment in the core business. We expect these initiatives to drive increased member and client satisfaction, higher levels of productivity, and to enhance our intellectual property, and extend our lead in the application of behavioral economics to the pharmacy benefit. As a result of these investments, SG&amp;A, excluding non-recurring items, was up about 10% in the third quarter over last year. Despite these investments, adjusted EBITA per script was $3.38, an increase of 18% over last year and 6% better than last quarter, which further demonstrates the power of our aligned business model.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from continuing operations was also strong as we generated over $395 million in the quarter, which is a 62% increase from last year. We are hitting the home stretch in the pre-close work on NextRx and we now expect to close in the next four to six weeks. The time we have taken pre-close will help us to ensure that we have a smooth transition and will put us in a position to integrate WellPoint members onto our system on the lower end of the 12 to 18 months we have told you about before.</p>
          <p>All things considered, we are happy with the progress we have made so far and remain excited about the long-term prospects of this acquisition to create significant shareholder value for us while lowering cost and improving health outcomes for WellPoint and their members.</p>
          <p>Moving on to our 2009 guidance, again, because we have not yet closed the transaction, our guidance is only for our existing business. So for 2009, we are now expecting core EPS in the range of $3.76 to $3.82. This excludes any non-recurring costs and financing costs related to funding the acquisition. Table four in our press release provides further details.</p>
          <p>Finally, we've been getting a few questions on why we decided to give 2010 guidance with our Q4 earnings. It's really pretty simple, so let me walk you through our thoughts on this. First, we don't have any new information that would lead us to change our view on the expected accretion from the acquisition.</p>
          <p>Second, as we have been saying, we will only give guidance for the combined company, and we will wait until we've had a chance to validate our assumptions after the close to do this. These factors and the expected timing of the close would have led us to provide guidance in late December or early January. Given that, we decided it would be more useful, and quite frankly, more efficient, to wait a few extra weeks so we will be able to not only more fully validate our expectations, but also see how membership for NextRx is changing in 2010 and therefore guide to a more precise range. Just to be clear, we are waiting to give 2010 guidance so that we can give a more precise range, not due to any changes in our expectations or any new information.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn it over to George.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As you know, we've all but wrapped up the signature account season. And clearly, this is our strongest selling season in recent history. We won eight new signature accounts, which we define as those accounts with a million or more annual scripts. We won roughly half of the signature accounts that changed PBMs this year.</p>
          <p>Overall, we've won 238 new accounts and we anticipate driving that number even higher as we wrap up the middle market season. Even with a loss of a major managed-care client which was acquired earlier this &#x2013; earlier in the year, we still anticipate positive script growth in 2010.</p>
          <p>Equally as important, we have retained 98% of our current book of business. We attribute these results for our business model of alignment coupled with outstanding service levels and client relationships. Also we've deployed next generation reporting tools that our clients and prospects are enthusiastically adopting. These tools enable our clients to manage their benefit more efficiently and unlock tailored savings opportunities.</p>
          <p>Finally, our clinical offerings enabled by our advanced understanding of human behavior provide an unparalleled value position in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Yesterday, we hosted a conference at the University of Chicago to explore the convergence of behavioral economics and healthcare. The 150 plan sponsors in attendance have reinforced a growing sentiment that cost cutting edge PBMs will need to bring an advanced understanding of consumer behavior and decision-making to drive better healthcare outcomes.</p>
          <p>Consumerology is the tool which improves existing clinical program performance through increased member engagement. We are leading this movement and are seeing results that are surpassing our initial expectations. This will continue to differentiate us in the marketplace. The time, energy and resources invested in consumerology could not have been more timely or relevant and certainly the experiences and knowledge we've gained are not solely applicable to the pharmacy benefit.</p>
          <p>We are looking forward to the potential application of this knowledge into other areas of healthcare. Through our relationship with WellPoint, we are committed to changing the delivery of healthcare in order to improve health outcomes while driving out waste.</p>
          <p>While it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of the healthcare debate, one thing is certain, reform will bring about change. We have a proven track record for capitalizing on change. We believe that any reform provides opportunity for us to demonstrate our evidence-based value proposition. Throughout our history, we have demonstrated a thought leadership in the creation of value for clients and their members. Our business model alignment coupled with our behavior centric approach is a template for the solutions that Washington is seeking.</p>
          <p>At this point, we are happy to answer any questions. Operator?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning. And thanks for those comments regarding the 2010 guidance recognizing the nature of the transaction warrants waiting. If we put the transaction aside, though, looking at 2010 just on an organic basis, you talked about a very strong selling season. How would you characterize the outlook for 2010? Is it consistent with your outlook for '09 last year this time, better, worse?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me just take a stab at this, then I'll ask Jeff to maybe comment if he has anything further to add. But it's a &#x2013; 2010 has a lot of things going on in it. Obviously, we've had a very strong selling season, we've been -- we've actually been redeploying some of our capital into our base business to actually position us well for the future. We believe investing in our &#x2013; in the future. As I said at the end of my comments, healthcare reform will probably take some -- I suspect there'll be some level of healthcare reform and therefore change and we need to be prepared for that. I think we are very well positioned to take advantage of that. Probably one of the more positive things is, utilization trends have picked up some, but when we go back to historic levels we're still trailing historic levels fairly broadly on a pretty big margin. So that's something that still needs to get better inline.</p>
          <p>I think the fact that we've turned the corner and are showing increases in script counts is definitely positive, but keep in mind how our business works. When you add a lot of new accounts or a significant amount of new start-up costs as we have to convert those clients over on one-one and take all the calls and convert all the mail order files over, so there's usually some higher costs associated with that. So there's a lot of headwind, but more often we've had a lot of tailwind. So we feel very good about where we're positioned. As far as getting any more specific than that, I think it would be better for us to wait until we can give you a complete picture once we integrate &#x2013; after we get some time with the WellPoint data and see where they're at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then finally, in terms of a jumping off point for modeling 2010. Is it fair to just throw back in the financing costs related to the transaction and exclude the one-time items? Or can you talk about -- what do you see as a real run rate 2009 number to use as we model our 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think obviously the financing costs are going to continue. But the way we look at it is the base businesses here is 3.76 to 3.82. You've got -- the financing cost is going to continue, so certainly you'd have to factor that in. And then to take a look at where you think what the addition of NextRx is going to add, and what we've said is moderately accretive to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, gentlemen. The commentary on the selling season was obviously very encouraging particularly on the signature accounts. I know this is sort of a big focus of yours for this selling season versus some of the success you've had in the past in the midmarket. What do you think was sort of the key element to drive the hit rate that you had, which was quite good on the business that changed hands? Was it the behavioral economics and the consumerology efforts that were really starting to resonate? Or was it any other sort of differentiation in the approach, the way you went about things this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, everything in our business, probably similar to yours, is based on relationship. So, for us to win a new account means you can't just meet them for the first time at the finalist presentation. So we have to be focused on being out in front and starting to build relationships and talking about what we do. At the end of the day, we're selling to very astute businessmen and what they're looking for is manage &#x2013; to better manage their healthcare trends. So what we have to do is be able to demonstrate that we are better than our competitors in managing those trends. When you get right down to it the backbone of any PBM that's going to admin claims and grow has to be around clinical services. The most important thing you can deliver is clinical services that drive out waste while not disrupting the members.</p>
          <p>That's a big statement, because when you run step therapy programs, prior authorization programs, mail order campaigns and other things, there's member involvement. And what we have to make sure we do is drive those members to the lowest cost products while not causing them to become upset or to feel like they are limiting access or anything else. So we've invested a lot of money in that. So how do we do it?</p>
          <p>Our approach is through consumerology. So consumerology is an enabler, it's a tool that we use to get our clinical programs to gain better traction, and that resonates extremely well in the marketplace. As I think you've heard us say in the past, when you look at healthcare, we've got a lot of accountants and medical people that are trying to influence a population at large. And at the end of the day, the proven companies that know how to market to individuals, the Anheuser-Busch's and the P&amp;Gs and on and on, really know how to get to those members, and I think that's the approach we're taking, that you just can't come in with a stick and a carrot. You really need &#x2013; members today want to better understand their healthcare and where we're successful, want to take a stronger foothold in managing their healthcare, and so we need to provide that medium and those tools for them to do that. And once we get them bought in, then we can move them in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Our approach is paying spades for us. At the end of the day though, the other thing you have to have is, is you have to have the tools for the client. We've invested heavily this year and rolled out a new reporting package for our clients. So we're focused on the member because you have to take care of trend, member by member, one member at a time. But at the end of the day, it all aggregates up to a composite trend and so the client needs to be able to see what's happening in their underlying business, where their high-cost patients are, and what's happening with those people, from an adherence perspective, from a compliance, from a &#x2013; just overall perspective of how those members are &#x2013; the cost and healthcare of those members.</p>
          <p>And so we've got a new program that I believe is best-in-class at allowing the client to look at very broad data and then drill down into specific areas, specific therapy classes, ever how they want to &#x2013; whichever way they want to cut their data to better manage their trends. And I think the combination of all those things together make for the &#x2013; to gain clients. So it's really not any one thing. But as you said, it's been a focus of ours and I think it paid off for us in spades this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, George, that's really helpful. And Jeff, just quickly, as we look at the guidance now as it stands for this year on an apples-to-apples basis with '08, it looks like earnings growth will come in something like 20, 22%, that's without a whole lot of cash flow deployment. That's certainly a lot better than sort of what the initial take was when we started the year. If you sort of had to rank kind of where you were most pleasantly surprised on execution or where kind of profitability came in better than the original expectation, kind of what would the top three things be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think first of all, we had some nice mid-year starts, so the -- we delivered some nice wins here which has gotten script guidance up. I think at the beginning of the year we said, forecast, with scripts we're going to be down 2 or 3% and we now expect it to be better than that. And along those same lines, as I said in my prepared remarks, utilization has come up. Certainly the uptake in our behavioral economics program has worked out well for us and we are &#x2013; we do have a very aligned business model. So as we deliver more savings for our clients we make more money and certainly in this economic environment, our clients have been looking to save more money. So that just gets to the power of the aligned business model and certainly, the team here is great and the focus on execution has been good and we're driving productivity and we're making investments we're excited about. So things have moved nicely through the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you, Jeff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now go to the line of Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you. Just a couple of quick ones. George, you mentioned with the good selling season there's some start up costs there. Are the bulk of those sort of Q4, Q1 or how should we think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, they come in towards the &#x2013; in Q4, so that's clearly anticipated in our guidance. We have to get the people out and head for the call centers and all those things and actually load the eligibility. So all those things are happening as we speak. But then, there's always a significantly higher call volume and a lot more work that goes into the start-up of a client, as you probably know. A lot of the mail order's drugs don't necessarily get transferred to us very smoothly from other providers. Some of the C-IIs and C-IIIs, those type drugs can't be transferred, so we have to get new scripts. So there's a lot of work that goes in when we sign up a new account and all that takes place in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I think you mentioned, Jeff, investing in the core. I think you had some IT investments, if I looked at the 10-Q right, that were sizeable. Can you maybe just give us a little color on the types of things that you're working on in that area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I mean, at the end of the day a lot of the investments are around IT. So we've been doing a lot of work to get our Department of Defense &#x2013; as you know, we have a new contract coming on line there, so there's been a lot of IT work to get those systems up and running and very efficient. We've also continued to invest in our behavioral economics initiative, which is people and systems and just new ideas and building out what I refer to as intellectual property. So a lot of what's showing up in SG&amp;A is really pretty close to R&amp;D and a lot of these things.</p>
          <p>So as we build up barriers to entry around consumerology and behavioral economics and continue to extend our lead in that space, we're investing a fair amount of money there. And then, just a continuing improvement of systems to build out better and better systems. This is certainly a culture of continual improvement and we're driving our teams to just keep looking for new ways to drive incremental cost out of the business to keep improving profitability, and we're seeing lots of opportunities to make solid investments there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Last question if I could. Just wondering if there's anything that stood out this &#x2013; during the selling season or as you're designing benefits with your existing clients, if clients are more willing to be aggressive in certain areas as you think about the economy and benefit design for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's a great question. In 2009, as Jeff said earlier, some of our -- our better than expected financial results are attributable to the fact that companies, CFOs, CEOs, are really becoming focused on taking cost out of their own equation to make their own SG&amp;A &#x2013; to meet their own SG&amp;A target. That really lends itself well to what we do and who we are. If you go back three or four years ago, and you saw trends that had moderated down to the low single digits, that wasn't an issue for most HR directors.</p>
          <p>Today, no cost can be left unturned. Everybody has to focus on how do I take more cost out of the equation to meet my profitability goals and those things all work really well for us. It allows our clinicians and our account management team to work closely with the clients. I was out on a trip a few weeks ago with a bunch of other CEOs, and there was &#x2013; it was right at the front of their &#x2013; at the head of their list on other ways that we can help. There wasn't a CEO in the group that wasn't talking about looking at productivity measures, looking at efficiency measures and looking to figure out other ways to take out cost. So to the extent we could come in and drive trends from low single digits to zero to negative is very well received today.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks for the question. George, given what's soon to be an enhanced footprint with your market position with NextRx, anything different that you're hearing from your clients with respect to the integrated PBM retail model? And then secondly for Jeff, obviously, good cash flow this quarter. Any update that you can provide us on the capital structure and debt repayment targets as you think about 2010? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll be honest with you. I don't hear a whole lot about a retail centric model. I do believe that &#x2013; there's different clients with different expectations and if you &#x2013; probably if you're looking for that type of a focus then Caremark's your answer. I mean I think you probably would go to them and that's going to be your choice as a PBM. We don't really hear that in our prospect meetings, at finalist presentations. I don't hear a whole lot of push for that. I think the concern is always that once you start filling at retail, do you run the risk of those being converted back to 30-day scripts.</p>
          <p>And at the end of the day, the 90-day script is a huge money saver for the client and they realize that. And so I don't think anybody wants to take those risks of losing the savings. Now, I'm not &#x2013; I'm certainly not saying anything negative about Caremark. I think it's a great company and they've got a lot of great things going for them and I think they're a fine competitor. But our approach is different. And our approach certainly resonated this year as we had a significant win in the selling season. So, I like where we sit, and really not hearing -- none of my clients have come to me and told me to give me a 90-day option at retail. Jeff?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Randy, overall, on capital structure, our position hasn't changed. We think optimal for us is strong investment grade credit, which means one to two times leverage, we think. After the close, we're just about there. We certainly feel like we've got the cash flow expectations to be able to pay down the debt that's coming due here over the next several quarters out of operating cash flow. And certainly as that gets repaid, we'll look at what the right capital structure is and it's going to depend on what the debt markets look like and what the rest of the economy looks like and how our business is shaping up at that point. But at this point, we feel pretty good about our capital structure and certainly good about our cash flow.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thanks very much. George, another question about the type of discussions you're having with clients. When you sit down with them does the NextRx transaction come up all that much? And if so, do you see it helping those discussions or hindering them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it doesn't come up very much to be honest with you, because it is a big consortium of Blues plans, and it doesn't really. I think the beauty of the transaction quite honestly is, as you know, we do a lot of Blues plans already. And so since they all have segregated territories and states, there's not really a competitive threat by doing the WellPoint transaction. So I think it really aligns nicely with our business model.</p>
          <p>What it does do for us is it puts us on the road map as a major player in the space. I've always believed we were there. I think our leverage over the supply chain, as you've seen in our numbers in the past really spoke for themselves. But I do believe that in fact &#x2013; it just &#x2013; with those &#x2013; we're now one of the &#x2013; we're tied right up there with the big three. So I mean that just really catapulted us to a higher position. But quite honestly, I don't, from an employer perspective, really there's been three out there. So I don't see that a whole lot. I do think one of the things it does do for us though, is I believe there is a tremendous opportunity for us and WellPoint to change the delivery of healthcare.</p>
          <p>I've said this many a time, and if you go back through our history and you look at all of our acquisitions, they weren't just done for pure economic reasons, they all added something. EPS got us in the managed care space, Priority really did cap out our need to get to some much needed exclusive drugs to meet the needs of our marketplace. And all of our acquisitions provided tremendous strategic opportunities for us, and WellPoint takes us to a whole new level. I think that &#x2013; I know that Angela at WellPoint is committed to changing the way healthcare is delivering and taking out the waste, improving healthcare outcomes. The things that healthcare reform should really be about is what I think we are both focused on. And I'm excited about that. I think it can provide a whole new opportunity for us in the future, and I talk about that with our clients, and I think they get excited about it, because they see some of the inefficiencies that exist today in the healthcare delivery system. So I think as we look out to the future, there is a great paradigm for us.</p>
          <p>The other side, quite honestly from an internal perspective &#x2013; keep in mind the WellPoint transaction's over a 10-year period and we're hopeful it's a permanent situation for us. But in addition, the DoD is a five-year contract with two options, and last time they always exercised those options. So again, just to reiterate what we said on previous calls, we've got 50% of our book of business, more than that, all locked up for seven to 10 years. That's a pretty good place to be that most companies don't find themselves in that situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. And a quick follow-up for Jeff. Given that it's been a more quiet year for generics. Could you give us some perspective on that 18% profit per script number that you were able to report in the quarter? If you were to rank the key drivers of that improvement, what would you put at the top of the list?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't really get into the details in a real discrete way. But certainly, it's been a lower than average generics year in 2009, and quite frankly, 2010 looks to be also lower than average.</p>
          <p>The other thing going on, as I alluded to earlier, certainly our clients are looking for us to help them save money. And as we do that through a whole host of tools that we can do, which isn't just about generics. I mean there's also just getting to the right place in the formulary. So a lot of times we can move from brand to brand where it make sense or to lower cost brand, and we can realize just as big a savings for our clients as we can on moving to generics in some cases. So there's certainly lots of tools that we pull here and we're expanding our tool kit pretty much every day with the investment we're making in behavioral economics and other spaces.</p>

          <p>We will now go to the line of Robert Willoughby with Banc of America. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. George or Jeff, I believe you gross up the TRICARE contract in the fourth quarter. Can you offer some guidance on the boost in revenues, and hit to gross margin that we should see there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So I think we talked about this a little bit last quarter, so just be discreet about it, I think it's a good question, because we want to make sure that nobody is surprised by this. At the end of the day the accounting for the DoD contract is changing, it was on a what we call a net basis and it's going to a growth basis because we're doing so much more work for the DoD in the new contract. The net impact of that from an accounting standpoint is that for the full year it's about an $8 billion increase in revenue. Again, just to be clear, it's no change to gross margin, but it is an $8 billion increase in revenue.</p>
          <p>For Q4, we're going live next week on this, so we're going to get about two months of this gross up. So one sixth of $8 billion is going to hit in Q4. And then obviously, as the revenue goes up, the gross margin as a percentage of revenue will go down. I don't have the precise numbers in front of me, but I think you're all capable of dividing through by a bigger number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That is helpful. And maybe George, just on the thought process around the WellPoint guidance that you ultimately will provide, is there anything that you can say or do to put some parameters around the contribution when the deal closes? Because it strikes me as somewhat difficult here waiting for the next Express Scripts press release for sometime in early February potentially. I mean do you not run the risk that consensus starts to run on you here as expectations continue to build?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Bob, at the end of the day, I'm an accountant by education and I prefer to be &#x2013; I don't like to just throw numbers out there that I don't &#x2013; that aren't grounded. We don't know anything more today than we knew when we closed this deal. Matter of fact you could argue we know less, because the information has become stale. We haven't closed, and so I can't look at the profitability of those accounts. They don't give us changes in membership. We don't see what's happened from inside the company. We've made a lot of guestimates and we still feel very good about those.</p>
          <p>I think we do a very good job, the due diligence, but our focus hasn't been over the last six months to confirm due diligence, because that doesn't do anything for us. Our focus has been on enabling a smooth transition and making sure that there's no member disruption. And most important of all, it's about changing their ability to sell in the mid-market and large market employment space, so that they can grow their membership, so WellPoint can add new lives, which in turn gives new lives to us. And we are very well equipped, we've got teams on the ground that are ready to go out and help &#x2013; start helping them learn how to sell PBM better and give them the tools to make their offering better. Bob, quite frankly, I just &#x2013; there's just really nothing's happened since we announced this deal that causes us any concern nor causes us to deviate from where we were at.</p>
          <p>So if we're going to close the deal &#x2013; so what happens? At closing all of a sudden now we start doing a lot of conversions. We're taking a lot of things from their systems, but we still don't really have it until the first month closes, so we might as well see what that looks like. We'll see all the one-one changes that come through. And so in February, when we're ready to give guidance, we'll feel very good about where we sit and the guidance we can give. So, I'm sorry if that's not quite meeting your needs, but I really do believe that's the best we can do at this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess there's &#x2013; the other issue, George, you are for better or worse for years have been genetically wired as a company to give 20 to 25% sort of earnings growth as the guidance range. Clearly you've been able to comfortably exceed that in the past. But I can really get to some numbers well above that guidance range quite easily just by backing out things like the WellPoint dilution this year. So how do you philosophically think about putting out a high EPS growth rate for next year, which has been against the company's grain for fear of upsetting some of the clients that you deal with? Is that something you're wrestling with currently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, if you're trying to get back door at my guidance number, I'm not going to do that. I think what I would tell you is that if my profitability is going up, it's usually because my clients are doing better. And I don't get challenged too often. I won't say always, but too often from my clients that I make too much money. At the end of the day, if you take my total script counts and divide it into my after-tax net income, I don't make a lot of money per script. It's just not a lot of money. And look at all we do, we do step therapies, we do mail order, we do prior authorizations, we consult with our clients on best ways to manage their membership through very difficult times as they make tough decisions. We're not taking a bunch of money.</p>
          <p>Do the same thing for CVS or Walgreens, take their total net income and divide it by their script count. Now again, they've got some front end, but if you can back out some thoughts there, we don't make what they make. And they're, at the end of the day, dispensing pharmacy when we're a pharmacy benefit manager adding tremendous amount of value into the chain, or into the supply chain process. So I don't feel like we need to apologize for the money we make. I think we do great things for that money and at the end of the day, we'll give guidance at the end of the fourth quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> How about one more question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much and good morning. George, as we look at the new business won for 2010, I had a couple of questions. One, can you maybe talk about where it came from? Did it just come from the, your other two big competitors or did you see any carve-in business this year? And then secondly, you've talked about the success of your mail program, Select Home Delivery, can you talk about the number of clients or potential scripts for 2010 around this program? And was that a key driver to winning some of these signature accounts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would tell you &#x2013; that's a great question. I think the whole concept of consumerology, which included better ways to manage generic bills, move people towards better adherence. Although companies are trying to save money, Lisa, they're still very focused on making sure their diabetics take their diabetic medication, that they want their hypertensives taking their high blood pressure medication on and on and on. That's still a focus, because a first line of defense is medication in any healthcare treatment. So people have become very focused on wellness and very focused on making sure that, for that 50% of their membership that's taking acute medications, chronic medications that they are getting what they need to take. And that sells well, our whole approach.</p>
          <p>The way, the whole way that the mail program works, it really depends on what their mail penetration rates are. Those clients that have, that are with an existing PBM that have a mail order offering and that client has done a &#x2013; the vendor has done a very good job of driving mail, they're probably less likely to choose special Select Home Delivery, because they already have strong mail penetration rates, so there's not a lot of upside to that. So the focus is more around generic penetration, clinical programs, other ways to drive cost out of the equation.</p>
          <p>Those that have low mail penetration rates, it's been a huge home run for us, because it allows clients to go to the mail order program without making it mandatory. And what it really does, is it forces that member to call in or to go online, hopefully online because we can get &#x2013; handle a lot more that way, to understand what the mail benefit is all about. And this way they can still opt out. But the conversion rate is quite significant once they see how easy it is and how we will do everything for them to keep those drugs coming to their house on a regularly scheduled basis. And that's a very nice option for many plans.</p>
          <p>As far as where do the membership comes from, I still see a tremendous amount of carve out occurring as the brokers and the consultants are basically the Fortune 500, for that matter, the Fortune 1000 have chosen whether they want to carve in or carve out, those decisions are made. Some of them are still moving more towards carve out.</p>
          <p>But as you look at the consultants, they need to grow their revenues and they need to stay in front of clients as well to meet their earnings needs and so they're going further and further down the line and looking at and talking to clients. We've seen clients with as few as 5,000 and 10,000 members coming to us through a consultant these days, direct &#x2013; not direct but jump to a process. And so often these would be joining consortiums or doing &#x2013; going through TPA's when they get smaller. And more and more of these people are going direct as they're looking. It really depends on their &#x2013; on how much they have deployed with respect to HR support, that's whether or not they want to carve out or not. The beauty -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How about, though, for the eight signature accounts, George. I mean, was that just primarily competition amongst the big three or are we seeing big signature accounts, those with more than a million claims actually carving out that haven't carved out before? I think that's really what my question is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's both. It's both, Lisa. It's some from the others and some from carve out, though it's a combination of both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, as we think about these and we think about the potential profitability around these accounts, did they have a lot of mail when you picked them up as we think about what the mail penetration looks like for the book of business for 2010? Is it similar to your existing book, is it greater than your existing book or is there opportunities to improve that over the next couple years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, without speaking to any significant highlight, let me just buckle them all together and just speak to the overall. Overall, the mail penetration is lower than the book of business. So you'll see that in the first quarter when those numbers come through that it'll drive mail penetration levels lower. But obviously, that's a great opportunity for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do they &#x2013; I guess that kind of goes back to my &#x2013; to the first part of my question, which is that do they sign up for programs that they give you the visibility to see that mail order is going to improve, especially as we get into 2011, 2012 which are big generic years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, some of them have and some of them haven't. I mean it just depends on why they're coming to us. If they had a terrible service issue, right now they're just trying to get away from a problem. Keep in mind, our business is like every other business out there. There is a relationship person at the front. If the relationship person screws up a relationship, the client wants to leave, and they may not be concerned about their benefits at that point. They're more concerned about getting somebody that's going to take care of them and we'll sell those people after we get in and build the right relationship. But a lot of them came to us for &#x2013; certainly for our mail order capabilities and our ability to move generic drugs. So again, you can't &#x2013; every client's different, every need is different. They're not all the same.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then just one last question as it pertains to all this is how would you characterize the 2010 selling season from a competitive perspective? Do you think that the players are rational? Are you finding that any of the competitors are irrational in the market, as we've seen in the past?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My perspective this year is it wasn't &#x2013; last year, and you heard me say this last year, was it was a couple deals that traded hands that I couldn't understand how in the world people priced at those levels. Again, I didn't necessarily say they were irrational. They may have been smarter than us, they may have seen something we didn't see, they may have seen an opportunity to drive something that would really help the client and help them as well. So I'm not sitting here <mark type="inaudible" /> majority of the business last year was not priced irrationally from my perspective.</p>
          <p>This year, isn't like that, I didn't accept well it's different . I didn't see any big deals that were changing hands that had what I saw as crazy pricing. I think it was more of &#x2013; again, when you get crazy on the pricing, you're really trying to eat away at a very small margin out of our business. There's a much better answer by driving trend and the right programs to get much bigger savings for the client. So we're successful at doing that, we're selling our capabilities, not giving way our little bit of margin. So I haven't seen, Lisa, a tremendous amount of &#x2013; I haven't seen any price irrationality this year, to be quite frank.</p>
