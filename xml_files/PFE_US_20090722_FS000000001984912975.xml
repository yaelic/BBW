          <p>Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the Second Quarter 2009 Earnings Call. Chuck Triano, you may now begin the call.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review our Second Quarter 2009 performance. I'm here with Jeff Kindler, Frank D'Amelio, Ian Read, Martin Mackay and Amy Schulman. The financial charts that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our home page at www.pfizer.com in the Investor Presentations tab by clicking on the link Quarterly Performance Second Quarter 2009.</p>
          <p>We know this is a busy day for many of you with other companies reporting. And we will keep opening remarks brief, and then move to Q&amp;A. The call will last for 45 minutes, and we will end at 11:45.</p>
          <p>Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K.</p>
          <p>Also, the discussions during this conference call will include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's Current Report on Form 8-K dated today, July 22, 2009. These reports are available on our website at www.pfizer.com in the Investors SEC Filing section.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Kindler. Jeff.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chuck. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I'll start this morning with a brief overview of our second quarter results, then offer a few comments on the integration planning for the pending Wyeth acquisition and conclude with a few short remarks on healthcare reform in the United States. And then, as always, I'll turn it over to Frank for a more thorough review of the quarter.</p>
          <p>First our results. On a constant currency basis, every one of our Pharmaceutical units as well as our Animal Health business generated revenue growth during the quarter, with the exception of the Established Products unit. In previous calls, we've explained that since the Established Products unit manages a portfolio of products that generally have lost patent protection or marketing exclusivity, it is expected to experience declining revenues at this stage of its life cycle.</p>
          <p>As you've heard from Dave Simmons, the President of that business, our plan is to recapture value for these products and ultimately stabilize and then grow revenue for the business. It's important to note that in this quarter, this unit again performed inline with our expectations, as did all of our business units.</p>
          <p>Our solid second quarter performance comes despite the effects of a challenging global economy and the highly competitive conditions we face in most of our markets. Despite the various challenges, our colleagues remain intensely focused on meeting our commitments to our shareholders. As a result, we remain on-track to meet our financial goals for 2009. In fact, today we are increasing our 2009 guidance for reported and adjusted diluted earnings per share, as well as raising the lower end of the range on our 2009 revenue guidance.</p>
          <p>As you saw in our release, we posted revenue of $11 billion in the second quarter. This represents a 9% decrease compared to the second quarter of last year. Revenues were flat on a constant currency basis. Operationally, many of our key products performed well, including Lyrica, Geodon, Sutent and Revatio as well as Lipitor, which performed well internationally despite intense generic competition.</p>
          <p>As for the bottom line, we're building on the achievements of the last two years by continuing to reduce our cost base and improve our productivity. Overall, operational improvements decreased our adjusted total cost by about 410 million in the second quarter. We plan to reinvest a portion of these savings throughout the rest of the year, including increased investment in our Emerging Markets and Established Products units, where we have identified important high potential growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>For example, we plan on increasing our investment in China to continue to grow our field force and enhance our support for key product opportunities there, including Lipitor, Champix and Celebrex. And following recent changes in the Chantix labeling here in the United States, we also plan to invest in increased communications with smokers and physicians about this important medicine.</p>
          <p>In addition, we intend to further support our late-stage development portfolio. This quarter we presented positive Phase 2 data on our JAK3 inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis, as well as positive Phase 1 data on our oral ALK Inhibitor for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Our pipeline now includes more than 100 projects, and we remain on track to meet the R&amp;D commitments we made to shareholders last year. All of this demonstrates that our colleagues are focused on delivering on our commitments, even as Pfizer continues to change to meet the demands of an evolving global healthcare marketplace.</p>
          <p>In that regard, I'm pleased to report that our planning to integrate Wyeth following the closing is moving ahead smoothly. Teams from both companies are meeting regularly, and our planning is being guided by lessons learned from past integrations. These teams have kept to a minimum the distraction and disruption that large scale integrations can sometimes cause. And I believe this bodes very well for a successful and rapid integration once the transaction closes.</p>
          <p>On the financing front, following the successful offering of notes in the US and Europe, we terminated the bridge loan facility that we entered into in order to finance a portion of the acquisition. No amount has been drawn down under that facility.</p>
          <p>On the regulatory front, we continue to engage in a constructive dialogue with the appropriate agencies around the world. Last week the European Commission approved the pending acquisition, a decision that includes our commitment to divest certain Animal Health assets in Europe. We are pleased to have achieved this significant milestone for the pending acquisition. In China, the Ministry of Commerce extended its review of our regulatory submission past the initial 30-day review period. This was not unexpected since this is the first major pharmaceutical transaction under China's new Anti-Monopoly Law.</p>
          <p>Here in the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission last month declared our Form S-4 Registration Statement effective, registering our common stock to be issued in connection with the Wyeth acquisition. And on Monday, Wyeth shareholders voted overwhelmingly to approve the merger of their company with Pfizer. This is an important milestone, and we are grateful for their expression of confidence in Pfizer.</p>
          <p>I want to take this opportunity to express my personal appreciation to Bernard Poussot for the outstanding leadership that he has provided and that he will continue to provide throughout this process.</p>
          <p>All in all, our planning is proceeding well. We remain on track to close the transaction around the end of the third quarter or during the fourth quarter. And we're confident that when the deal closes, we'll be ready to execute our plans quickly.</p>
          <p>Finally, I'd like to comment briefly on US healthcare reform. At Pfizer we have long expressed our support for comprehensive reform of the US healthcare system that would expand access, improve quality and increase value, while preserving patient choices, the doctor/patient relationship and strong incentives for medical innovation and American competitiveness. We believe we played a constructive role in the process, and we will continue to do so. We're pleased that policy makers have been open to our ideas, and that we have the privilege of having a seat at the table.</p>
          <p>An important step in this regard came a few weeks ago when we and our colleagues in the biopharmaceutical industry reached an agreement to help millions of senior citizens achieve improved access to high quality and affordable healthcare coverage. Helping to fill the Medicare prescription drug coverage gap will help seniors who are in need of medicines, which will improve health outcomes and lead to better control of chronic diseases.</p>
          <p>Regarding proposals related to the taxation of overseas earnings, we're encouraged that policy makers have announced plans to review this in the scope of overall tax reform; in all likelihood some time next year. Now obviously the legislative process is far from final, and it's premature to predict the impact that it may ultimately have on our business. But we will continue to participate constructively in the policy discussions.</p>
          <p>Before turning it over to Frank, let me just sum up by saying that like many other businesses we face a challenging economy and tough competition. And in our case, we also face a very dynamic operating environment and the particular challenges of significant losses of exclusivity.</p>
          <p>I am proud of the fact that the changes that we have made over the past three years in our operating model and in our culture, but most importantly, the enormous skill and dedication of our people have enabled us to overcome those challenges, to seize the many opportunities ahead of us and to continue to deliver on our commitments. And we will continue to do just that.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Frank to give you more detail on the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeff. Good morning everyone. The charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast, and will help facilitate the discussion of our second quarter 2009 results. Now let me get to our financials.</p>
          <p>Our second quarter results, as well as our results for the first half of 2009, remained consistent with our expectations given the continued challenging economic and operating environment. Reported revenues for the second quarter of '09 were 11 billion, a decrease of 9% year-over-year. On an operational basis, revenues were essentially flat. However, foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of approximately 1.1 billion, or 9%.</p>
          <p>Second quarter 2009 reported net income was 2.3 billion, a 19% decrease compared with the year-ago quarter, and reported diluted EPS was $0.34, compared with $0.41; both driven by the negative impact of foreign exchange, the increase in the effective tax rate related to the financing of the pending Wyeth acquisition and acquisition-related cost. These were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, lower cost associated with cost reduction initiatives and lower IPR&amp;D charges in 2009.</p>
          <p>Adjusted income of 3.2 billion and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.48 decreased year-over-year by 12% and 13% respectively. These results reflect the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and the increase in the effective tax rate, which were partially offset by savings from cost reduction initiatives.</p>
          <p>Adjusted revenues of 11 billion, which exclude a minimum &#x2013; a minimal amount of transition services from the sale of the Consumer Healthcare business declined 9% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was 15.4%, versus 16.9% in the prior year quarter. The improvement was due to savings from ongoing cost reduction initiatives and foreign exchange, which decreased cost by 264 million versus the year-ago quarter.</p>
          <p>Adjusted SI&amp;A expenses decreased 12%, or 432 million, year-over-year due to savings from ongoing cost reduction initiatives and foreign exchange, which decreased expenses by about 253 million versus the prior year quarter.</p>
          <p>Adjusted R&amp;D expenses decreased 11%, or 213 million, year-over-year due to savings from cost reduction initiatives and foreign exchange, which decreased expenses by approximately 68 million versus the prior year quarter.</p>
          <p>On an adjusted results basis, foreign exchange decreased second quarter revenues by approximately 1.1 billion, or 9% year-over-year. In the year-ago quarter, foreign exchange increased revenues by 796 million, or 7%, versus the second quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Cost reduction initiatives continued to favorably impact our adjusted total cost this quarter. In addition, foreign exchange reduced these costs by approximately 585 million, or 8%, year-over-year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted total cost decreased operationally by 412 million, or 5%, year-over-year.</p>
          <p>While foreign exchange continued to lower our cost and expenses, it also continued to lower revenues this quarter, resulting in a year-over-year net decrease of $0.05 related to adjusted diluted EPS.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move to the results of our businesses. On a constant currency basis, all Pharmaceutical units and Animal Health achieved revenue growth, with the exception of Established Products whose products, as Jeff explained, have generally lost patent protection or marketing exclusivity, resulting in revenue declines at this stage of their life cycle.</p>
          <p>Primary Care revenues were 5.1 billion, a decrease of 6% year-over-year. Operational growth of 1%, driven by Lyrica's strong international performance, was more than offset by the 7% unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on revenues.</p>
          <p>Specialty Care revenues of 1.4 billion decreased 5% versus the prior year quarter. Operational growth of 2%, driven by the solid US performance of certain products such as Revatio and Geodon, were more than offset by the 7% unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>Oncology revenues of 352 million decreased by 8% year-over-year. Operational growth of 4%, driven by Sutent and Aromasin's strong international performance, was more than offset by the 12% negative impact of foreign exchange on revenues.</p>
          <p>Revenues for the Established Products business were 1.6 billion, a year-over-year decrease of 20%. Operationally, Established Products revenues decreased 13% year-over-year, and foreign exchange unfavorably impacted revenues by an additional 7%.</p>
          <p>Revenues generated in the Emerging Markets were 1.5 billion, a decrease of 8% year-over-year. Operational growth, primarily driven by China and Turkey, of 9% was more than offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange, which unfavorably impacted revenues by 17%.</p>
          <p>Animal Health revenues of 648 million decreased 9% versus the prior year quarter. Operational growth of 2%, driven by emerging markets and certain new products worldwide, was more than offset by the 11% negative impact of foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter, we continued to make progress on our ongoing cost-reduction initiatives, achieving about 410 million in net cost reductions versus the year-ago quarter on a constant currency basis. These cost-reduction initiatives continue to span essentially all divisions, functions, markets and sites across Pfizer. Broad categories of activity include manufacturing and research site exits, targeted workforce reductions and outsourcing.</p>
          <p>We continue to have opportunities for outsourcing, which include manufacturing, logistics, finance, facilities, legal and IT. And these are in various stages of implementation. For example, outsourced manufacturing comprises about 24% of manufacturing versus 17% at year-end 2008.</p>
          <p>We're also continuing to size our workforce level with current market dynamics, with a workforce level of 76,500 at quarter-end. This represents a net decrease of about 5400 compared with year-end 2008. Since beginning of 2008, our total workforce decreased by approximately 10,100 people.</p>
          <p>For the first half of 2009, we realized a decrease of about 740 million in adjusted total cost at 2008 exchange rates. During the second half of the year, we expect to make investments in business opportunities and in support of our late stage development portfolio among other things, which will offset a portion of these savings.</p>
          <p>We remain on track to achieve our $2 billion net cost reduction target by 2011, which is in addition to the approximately four billion in deal synergies related to the pending acquisition of Wyeth that we expect to realize by 2012.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to 2009 financial guidance. We remain on track to achieve our 2009 objectives. And today, we are increasing the lower end of our revenue and increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance. We currently expect reported 2009 revenues to be within the range of 45 to 46 billion, versus our previous expectation of 44 to 46 billion. And we now expect adjusted diluted EPS to be within the range of 1.90 to $2, compared with the previously expected $1.85 to $1.95.</p>
          <p>We are also improving the guidance for adjusted SI&amp;A and R&amp;D expenses, and increasing the lower end of the range of adjusted other income guidance, while reaffirming the remaining components of the 2009 guidance; including adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue. And as I said, we continue to expect to achieve our net savings target of two billion by 2011, versus '08 at 2008 foreign exchange rates.</p>
          <p>As Jeff previously explained, to-date we have achieved significant milestones related to our pending acquisition of Wyeth. The items remaining include continuing to execute on our '09 goals, obtain the remaining regulatory approvals, continuing to develop detailed synergy plans and ultimately closing the transaction. We continue to expect the transaction to close late in the third quarter or during the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>So to summarize the key takeaways, we continued to deliver solid operational results despite the challenging macroeconomic environment. On an operational basis, our total revenues were essentially flat year-over-year. We reduced our cost by approximately 410 million this quarter on a constant currency basis, due to operational cost improvements. And we've increased the lower end of our 2009 reported revenue guidance range, and raised our adjusted diluted EPS guidance ranges, improved guidance for certain expense items and narrowed adjusted other income guidance. Finally, our integration planning remained &#x2013; our integration planning remains on track while we continue to advance our integration plans.</p>
          <p>And now I'll turn it back over to Chuck.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the review, Frank. And operator, at this point if we could move to the Q&amp;A segment please? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question is from Catherine Arnold of Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Catherine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks everyone. Wanted to ask you two questions. One is related to the repatriation and tax rate. I was wondering if you could, even just in relative terms, put into context how much repatriation the Company did this quarter versus past history? Was it double? Was it 25% more? Just give me something directional so I can appreciate the tax rate and the impact of that activity.</p>
          <p>And then also along that line I'm trying to square the fact that your interest expense for the Wyeth deal seems more manageable perhaps than your conservative scenario that you had put forward when the deal was announced. And I'm wondering if you have any thoughts on whether that means you'll need to bring back less and the impact on tax rate? Now that's a long winded question, but if you could address those issues.</p>
          <p>And the second question, just to put them both out there, is related to the US review. I understand that you have certified compliance and that you provided FTC everything they need for the second phase. Could you confirm that that's correct? And if so, what was the date for which that happened? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Catherine. Obviously Frank will take the first question, and Amy the second one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on repatriation Catherine, we said at the beginning of the year we would repatriate international earnings. We have been repatriating international earnings. And obviously, we've been repatriating more international earnings than we have in the past.</p>
          <p>And the way you can see that is in the tax rate. If you look at the adjusted rate last year in Q2, it was 20%. This quarter it was 28.1%. And there will be some, I'll call it volatility, in the quarterly tax rate. Last quarter, it was 29.7. This quarter, 28.1. 29% on a year-to-date basis. And we've &#x2013; we reinforced the guidance of approximately 30% on that tax rate for the year. And what causes that volatility, the changes from quarter-to-quarter, are really just, I'll call it, geographic mix; where the income is that we're repatriating in the different jurisdictions have different tax rates. So that's the way to think about the repatriation.</p>
          <p>Relative to the interest rates, we took out the bridge facility with two tranches or two offerings here in the US. The rates we paid, I'll call it on a blended basis, for those two offerings were about 5.5%. I'll call it &#x2013; from my perspective, we did good relative to what we went out with and the rates that we got. And clearly, that's what driving the interest expense relative to the Wyeth &#x2013; what we're doing from a financing perspective to get ready for the Wyeth acquisition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Amy on the FTC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Catherine. So let me reiterate what we have stated previously, which is that we continue to work cooperatively with the FTC. We've been responsive to all of their requests. And continue to believe, as we have stated previously, that we're on target to achieve a close towards the end of the third quarter or during the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Operator, next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And next is David Risinger of Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Hi, thanks very much. I have some revenue questions, and then an R&amp;D question. In terms of revenue, the revenue performance seems to be a bit sluggish in both the US and ex-US, even excluding currency. And I was just hoping that maybe Ian could comment on how you evaluate the negative impact of sales and marketing spending cuts on revenue given that there must be some trade-off, and how you balance that?</p>
          <p>And also how you're tracking towards the $70 billion in revenue in '12? And then on R&amp;D, I'm just wondering how you plan to evaluate internal R&amp;D productivity now and going forward given the change to move molecules to the business unit leaders after Phase II, particularly since the business units may make different decisions than the R&amp;D team would have planned? So I would appreciate your thoughts on that as well, Martin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's break this if I could, Dave into a number of different parts. So maybe Ian can talk about the impact on marketing spend on the revenue, and give you some thoughts about '12. But I'd also like Frank to address the 70 billion '12 issue. And then both Martin and Ian may have some thoughts about R&amp;D productivity metrics under the new &#x2013; that's okay. So you'll hear from all of us on those various subjects, if that's okay. So Ian, why don't you start?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So David, firstly, I think on the &#x2013; Frank may have more specific numbers, but I was very satisfied with the ex-US performance on operational growth. It's being masked a little bit by exchange. But operationally, it was a very strong quarter and strong year-to-date in both Lipitor and Lyrica and Celebrex and most of our major franchises, including Sutent.</p>
          <p>Regarding the question of how we balance the field force support and the revenue, we look at it in &#x2013; with sophisticated models. And I think what we're seeing here is, in the first half any rate, is a temporary dislocation of field force focus in the US as we move to a new Primary Care field force model. And we feel this model's important, as we see the loss of effective traditional detailing. And we move to a de-averaging approach in the US, where &#x2013; when traditional detailing works like in Alabama, we have traditional detailing.</p>
          <p>And where in the west, where you've got more group practices and you need different approaches, we go to those different approaches. So we look at it brand-by-brand. And I'm satisfied that aside from what I think is a temporary dislocation, as new relationships were established, that our brand have a healthy level of support.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Why don't we turn to the 2012 number, Frank</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Right. And Dave, let me just spend one minute on &#x2013; to punctuate something Ian said in terms of the results for the quarter and year-to-date. From an international perspective if you remove the impacts of foreign exchange, we're up operationally about 2%. So about 2% in the quarter, and about 2% on a year-to-date basis. So operationally from my perspective, up, in clearly challenging overall environment.</p>
          <p>And with some products performing very well in international markets. Lyrica and Sutent, if you look at how they're performing from an international growth perspective year-over-year, quarter- or year-to-date, they're both growing, give or take, about 30%. So those are clearly two of the reasons why the international number operationally is up 2%.</p>
          <p>On the 70 billion, this is a question that we periodically get asked. The way I think about it is if you look at, I'll call it some of the consensus numbers out there, the average numbers, they average around 65. Then obviously we look at some of the details of that. And clearly we think, if you look at those numbers versus our own estimates on the 70, the two areas where, I'll call it there's differences, are inline products, and what we believe we can do with products like Lyrica, Sutent and Chantix versus what some of the consensus numbers are.</p>
          <p>And then Established Products and Emerging Markets, where we think there's lots of opportunities. And for example, this quarter Emerging Markets grew 9% on an operational basis, and in the focused countries and priority countries like China and Turkey.</p>
          <p>I used statistics on this. I've said this before. If you talk about Asia-Pacific and remove Australia and New Zealand and Japan, in 2008 that was a $50 billion market. We had 4% of that market. By 2012, we think that's a 70 to $80 billion market. If we only kept our 4%, we'd pick-up $1 billion in incremental revenue. If we can pick-up a share, one point of share, for every point we pick up, it's 7, $800 million.</p>
          <p>We think we can pick-up a point or two of share because of our ability to execute in these markets. Given our capabilities in these markets, our field force in these markets, our relationships in these markets, our logistical capabilities in these markets, we think clearly there's lots of opportunity there for us to not only hold our share, but to grow share.</p>
          <p>So those are the kinds of things that we think help us get to the 70. And business development will also be a contributor to helping us to achieve the $70 billion. So that's how we talk <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me suggest, Dave, to get your final part, I do want to &#x2013; this is obviously a very, very important topic, R&amp;D productivity and metrics, that we could spend a lot of time on. But there's a lot of folks in the queue, and I want to get to other questions. So let me just ask briefly, Martin will give you the perspective from research, and Ian from the perspective of the business units. Martin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'll be brief. David, first of all, to say the commitments that we made in March '08 still stand today. In fact, of the four commitments we've made, one we've already achieved. And that was the number of Phase 3 starts in the first year from that date. And the other three are all on track to be achieved. And that is clearly very important to our productivity, that we move our pipeline into that Phase 3, that cohort along and obviously on to the marketplace. That stands today.</p>
          <p>In terms of the R&amp;D piece and the hand-off, that positive proof-of-concept, which scientifically and clinically makes absolutely the most sense to move it into the business units. And whilst it's a hand-off, I can say that the business units are heavily involved prior to that decision, and clearly R&amp;D are heavily involved after that decision. So for example we are doing mechanistic studies in JAK3 and Dimebon and other programs.</p>
          <p>What I've really noticed and I see has exceeded my expectations in terms of moving to the business unit model has been this prioritization that's going on. And like never before we're seeing folks looking at our portfolio and making, in some cases, pretty tough decisions on what areas we should invest more in and what areas we should pull out of. So I think it's been well documented that we stopped some late-phase programs. But the really important thing is that we invested more heavily in these critical programs such as JAK3, tanezumab, our IGF1R antibody and axitinib. And this is a very positive, a meaningful step forward, I believe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so David, I think Martin really described it very well. The only thing I would add is that this &#x2013; I think one of the advantages of this shift, that proof-of-concept, is the increased focus that the business unit will bring on clinical outcomes and outcomes research and meeting access needs. And that's also healthy.</p>

          <p>Okay, thank you. Next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Jami Rubin, Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jami.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Frank, a couple of questions for you. First, obviously in the &#x2013; is &#x2013; inline with the previous question, obviously R&amp;D productivity has been a huge issue for the Company over the past eight, nine years or so. When you look at the combined R&amp;D expense at both Wyeth and Pfizer, it's about $10.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Can you share with us how you think about what the appropriate level of R&amp;D spend should be? And then my second question is when you announced the deal with Wyeth in January, you sent a message to investors when you cut the dividend. And now once the deal closes, just curious to know what will be the message you want to send on the dividend going forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So on R&amp;D productivity, your numbers are roughly right. I think -combined spend of the two companies last year was almost 11 billion. We're about 7.6, and I think Wyeth was about 3.3; which is 10.9, which is around the 11 billion. In terms of what the spend of R&amp;D will be for the combined Company, we've looked at lots of different metrics on this in terms of benchmarking productivity, and I think the short directional answer is it will be less. So there'll be less R&amp;D spending for the combined Company than there is for the two standalone companies as they exist today.</p>
          <p>What that number will settle at, we're still working on. We're working through detailed planning with Martin and with Mikael Dolsten from Wyeth, as well as with many folks on our respective teams. And so that work is all very much underway, and lots of detailed work is taking place in that area. But I think the short answer to the question is it will be less.</p>
          <p>In terms of the dividend, you're right. Back in January when we announced the Wyeth transaction, we cut the dividend in half. So it was $1.28 annually, $0.32 a quarter. We cut that to $0.16 a quarter, $0.64 annually. If you think about the number of shares we'll have post-close, it will be about eight billion shares. So if you run the numbers, Jami, it will still be about a $5 billion dividend, but we also saved $5 billion in US cash flow, all of which was part of our planning for financing the acquisition.</p>
          <p>In terms of going forward for the dividend, from my perspective we have lots of opportunities on how to deploy our capital, how to deploy our cash. The five priority areas that we typically talk about are: the level of dividend that we pay, share buybacks, debt paydown, business development and the level of earnings we repatriate from overseas; because we could choose at some point to repatriate less, which would lower the tax rate, raise our earnings. Now all of those are priority areas. And we'll do what we always do, which is try to deploy capital in terms of what's best from a total shareholder return perspective.</p>
          <p>And then specific to the dividend, now each year in December we have a Board meeting. And one of the topics of that Board meeting is what the dividend payout will be for the following year. So in December of 2009 at our Board meeting, we'll make a determination on what the dividend payout should be for 2010.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for the question. A couple of questions for you. So going back to your 2012 comments, you mentioned three products that might account for the gap between the consensus model and your internal model: Lyrica, Chantix and Sutent. But it seems like Lyrica continues to decline. Chantix has been struggling as well. And then Sutent seems like it's flattened out.</p>
          <p>So I don't know what that &#x2013; I guess my question is why do you see the future of those products differently then how the Street might seem them? And second question is on Emerging Markets. Your underlying growth, ex-currency, seems to be a little bit lower than what I'd expect by looking at some &#x2013; what some of the other drug companies are reporting. And I'm wondering is that just a function of the mix of those revenues, or what exactly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Ian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim, let me try the Emerging Markets first. Frankly, I'm &#x2013; I believe we were up operationally 9% in the quarter and up 12% in the key markets, some of the BRIC markets we look at. And when I compare our IMS data across those markets of our competitors, we are very competitive. In fact, we're running neck-to-neck with Novartis, and that's our major competitor in those marketplaces vis-&#xE0;-vis growth. So I'm not quite sure what data you're looking at. But the data from IMS and what I'm looking at, I'm satisfied that we are competitive in those marketplaces.</p>
          <p>Regarding Lyrica, Chantix and Sutent, I think I'll ask Martin to talk a little bit, the new indications of Sutent. This is the Lyrica. Lyrica's growth internationally, if you &#x2013; Lyrica while it has slowed up in the US &#x2013; and that's undoubtedly we can talk to that &#x2013; but Lyrica was up 12% in the quarter globally. Operationally, up 18% year-to-date. Up 32% internationally in the quarter, of which the whole franchise now, international is half of the total Lyrica franchise.</p>
          <p>So Lyrica per se in the US, let's talk about it. It's facing, as is Celebrex, as is Lipitor, a recently genericized market with managed care pressure and co-pays, and facing an economic downturn in the US. While at the same time, we're remodeling our field force, which I think's essential to have a field force that splits the purpose for the healthcare environment we'll be facing in the next two to three years in the US.</p>
          <p>So all of those things are undoubtedly a drag on the performance of Lyrica in the US. We're focusing on fixing that by looking at driving up diagnosis rotes of fibromyalgia, driving up the treatment of the pain indications and using co-pays to try and offset the managed care tiering. So Lyrica, robust continued growth outside, and agree we have issues we need to fix in the US.</p>
          <p>Chantix, the labeling discussion I think as &#x2013; it will allow us to go forward and begin to re-educate from a firm base with a label we've agreed upon on the FDA. That's important for us. It, well that gives confidence to our field force. It allows us to talk about the product and start to really educate on that. So you can see, in fact, in the third semester Scripts are up above, I believe, 30% above the Script rate of the fourth quarter. So with the label discussions behind us, I really believe we can now motivate our field force to move that product forward.</p>
          <p>And on Sutent, I'd just like Martin Mackay to make a few comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Tim, just briefly, as you know we have approval for renal cell carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Growth will come from other indications. And we're continue with our breast cancer studies, our non-small cell lung carcinoma studies. And then in Phase 3 somewhat earlier, hepatocellular carcinoma and hormone refractory prostate cancer. So that's where we expect the growth to come from.</p>

          <p>All is well, thank you kindly. Just a question, please, on the shift in sales ongoing from the Established to the Emerging Markets, the strength there.

        <plist>
          <p>Harlan, I'm not quite sure if you're talking about are we're moving resources into the Emerging Markets to strengthen our ability to drive growth? Absolutely. We've been doing that over the last two to three years. We've accelerated that. I'm not sure vis-&#xE0;-vis your question on Established and Emerging. With the Established business unit, we're certainly re-sourcing it up in countries, giving it specific focused resources to drive our every opportunity country-by-country. Does that answer the question?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Somewhat Ian. More to the point, on something like Lipitor, which is in decline in the United States, are you shifting resources out of that product in advance of that decline? Are you still fighting the battle for every point of market share? At what point do you begin to accelerate the removal of resources from the Established, call it the US market,</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I wanted to stick with at least one product question, and that's on Sutent, which has done extremely well internationally as you pointed out. But Ian, and maybe Martin to some degree, I'm, I am curious with a new entrant from Novartis in Afinitor, which at least in the US, albeit new, has shown some traction in new prescription trends in renal cell carcinoma.</p>
          <p>And assuming its approval internationally, I'm just curious if you've thought about or had some best practices to think of from a competitive standpoint in the US that you're able to apply internationally that'll allow that product to continue to grow despite that competition? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I actually say that our &#x2013; I'm not sure I'd be sharing best practices from Europe into the US actually, given the performance internationally of Sutent, growth of 31% in the second quarter. The US has done a very good job, too. The US field force and our performers, we've got above 60% market share in first line.</p>
          <p>We are getting competition, you're right. And the way we have to deal with that prior to new indications is to focus on maintaining its standard of care in first line, focus on keeping the dose at the right level and getting as &#x2013; the longest number of cycles as appropriate for the patient. In the US, it will be a slower growth rate or a difficult market as we get competition coming in. But Sutent has got a lot of growth left internationally. And we've got six plus Phase 3 trials for new indications.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the questions. Question for you Jeff. Now that you've had an opportunity to really dig in and evaluate the Wyeth assets, can you comment on how you view the strategic positioning of the nutritional and consumer business? Traditionally, Pfizer likes to have a number one or number two market share position in businesses that it's participating in. Could you just comment on the positioning of those businesses, and if there's a potential opportunity to divest those assets to help pay down debt?</p>
          <p>Second question just has to do with cash flow, cash flow in the quarter, if you can provide, Frank, any commentary on that? And then third question just has to do with Aricept and the exclusivity there. I think Eisai had indicated they weren't able to secure pediatric exclusivity. Can you just remind us the period of time when it loses exclusivity and implications for the alliance revenue line? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll let Frank to talk about the cash flow, and Ian'll cover the Aricept exclusivity. And &#x2013; but regarding nutritional and consumer, John, they look &#x2013; and the more I've learned about them, they're really interesting and exciting businesses. We're not looking to do anything different but grow them. We are very excited about the people that are in them. And actually, we think there're tremendous opportunities by combining our resources and our distribution channels, particularly in the Emerging Markets, with these assets and the people that are leading them.</p>
          <p>And we're very excited about the portfolio of products that they provide, and the opportunities to meet unmet medical needs. So our intention is to grow these businesses, and to create additional value in combination with the assets and the people and the distribution channels that we have. So we're very excited about that.</p>
          <p>And as you know, Cavan Redmond, who is one of Wyeth's terrific leaders, has agreed to join us, and among the businesses that he'll be responsible for are nutritionals and consumers. And in the conversations that we've already had, he's already demonstrated that he'll be bringing a lot of value to the table in helping us think about how to grow those businesses both in and of themselves, and in combination with ours. So we're quite excited about that.</p>
          <p>Frank, you want to talk about the cash flow?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So, John, we haven't issued Q2 operating cash flow yet, but I can run numbers for you, give you a feel for the rhythm of the numbers. The Q1 operating cash flow number was 3.1 billion. That compared to 3.3 billion in last year's Q1 '08 operating cash flow number. And then just in terms of the cash flow numbers for the last three years, last year it was 18.2 billion. In '07, it was 13.4 billion. And in '06, it was like 17.4 billion. So first quarter of this year tracked closely to the first quarter of last year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think on Aricept, John, from memory the exclusivity in the US goes in the fourth quarter of '10, and in Europe or in Western Europe in '12. I'm not sure exactly what month in '12.</p>

          <p>Oh, thanks very much. So just maybe getting a little bit deeper into the questions around Wyeth and the opportunities in the Emerging Markets, can you give us your thoughts on the interaction of the vaccine portfolio that Wyeth brings to the table as it links to nutritional and consumer in the international markets?</p>
          <p>And how perhaps revenue synergies in &#x2013; with those new products might start to help to support the $70 billion revenue estimate? Again, you're talking about two percentage points of market share gains. But as we look at the growth that we're seeing in Emerging Markets, while it is good, it's not so strong that I think that you would get that kind of a jump in market share. So, thanks.</p>

So we're not putting forth anything like that. I will just tell you that we're having right at this point appropriate and preliminary, but still very exciting conversations with the Wyeth people about opportunities for our businesses to work together.</p>
          <p>And you've certainly identified one of those areas where we think there are tremendous opportunities and potential between the businesses. So stay tuned. And as we go forward and close the deal, which is our focus at this point, we look forward to lots of opportunities to talk to you about the potential that these two businesses have to drive great value for our patients and shareholders going forward.</p>
