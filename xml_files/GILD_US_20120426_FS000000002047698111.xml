          <p>Thank you, <mark type="ph" /> Stacy, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Gilead's first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. We issued a press release this afternoon providing earnings results for the quarter. This press release is available on our website as are the slides that provide more detail around some of the topics we will cover on today's call.</p>
          <p>Your speakers for today will be John Milligan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of R&amp;D and Chief Scientific Officer; Kevin Young, Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations; and Robin Washington, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>Robin will first discuss our financial results, Kevin will review our commercial performance and Norbert then provide an update on our research and development progress. John Milligan will wrap up our prepared remarks by discussing our Quad drug and our future outlook and opportunities. Our Chairman and CEO, John Martin will not be participating on today's call as he is currently out of the office.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, during today's call we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook in addition to regulatory and product development plans. These risks include the possibility of unfavorable results from our clinical studies including those evaluating GS-7977, GS-5885 and GS-9669 alone or in combination with other antivirals, the possibility that we may be unable to meet the anticipated timing for receiving clinical data and making regulatory filings and the possibility that we are unable to develop an all oral antiviral regimen for HCV Genotype 1 patients or a pangenotypic regimen for all HCV patients. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. A description of these risks can be found on our latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, please note we undertake no duty to update or revise them.</p>
          <p>We also will be using non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business performance. The GAAP reconciliations are provided in our press release as well as on our corporate website.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Robin Washington.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today.</p>
          <p>2012 began with solid first quarter financial results. Our commercial execution continues, delivering product sales of $2.2 billion an increase of 19% year-over-year and 4% sequentially despite a challenging macroeconomic environment. The U.S. contributed $1.3 billion to product sales, up 25% compared to $1 billion in the first quarter of last year. Europe contributed $764 million to product sales, up 7% year-over-year driven primarily by growing underlying product demand.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP product gross margin decreased to 74.5% from 75.7% in the same period of last year primarily due to the higher cost of efavirenz and changes in product mix as Atripla and Complera increased as a percentage of revenue while Truvada decreased.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP R&amp;D expenses for the quarter were $331 million compared to $237 million in the same period of last year due to increased clinical activities, particularly in liver disease, and expenses associated with the continued advancement of our product pipeline.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP SG&amp;A expenses for the quarter were $308 million, up from $263 million in the same period of last year primarily due to an increase in expenses to support the ongoing growth of our business and an increase in the U.S. pharmaceutical excise tax.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, we completed the $11.1 billion acquisition of Pharmasset and have allocated the purchase price as follows. The balance sheet includes in process research and development of $10.7 billion, goodwill of $75 million and net assets and liabilities assumed of $64 million. The GAAP income statement includes a $194 million compensation charge expense for acceleration of unvested stock options. This compensation expense also negatively impacted operating cash flows for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to interest and other income and expense, during the quarter, we recorded a net loss of $40 million or $0.03 per share related to Greek bonds as a result of the Greek government debt restructuring. Subsequent to the restructuring we sold all of our Greek bond holdings, which as you may recall, relate to payments for accounts receivable from the years 2007 through 2009. We no longer hold any Greek bonds, thereby eliminating any further exposure to write-downs.</p>
          <p>We continue to focus on deleveraging our balance sheet and achieving a targeted net debt to EBITDA of 1.5x by mid-2013. As part of that commitment during the first quarter we repaid $350 million of our bank debt.</p>
          <p>Our operating cash flows during the quarter were $453 million net of the impact of the $194 million stock-based compensation expense and other Pharmasset related payments, the timing of vendor payments related to our fall 2011 ERP system implementation and payments for R&amp;D milestones.</p>
          <p>And finally, as detailed on slide 18 we are reiterating the full-year 2012 guidance provided to you on February 2 with the exception of acquisition related stock-based compensation. As a result of the $194 million compensation expense we recorded after finalizing the acquisition accounting for Pharmasset, which equates to $0.25 per share, we now anticipate the impact of acquisition related restructuring and stock-based compensation related expenses will have a full year 2012 diluted EPS impact of $0.56 to $0.59 per share.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Kevin to share more with you regarding first quarter 2012 commercial results.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Robin. I'm very pleased with the solid start we have made to 2012. Our antiviral franchise generated product sales of $1.9 billion for the first quarter, up 18% over first quarter 2011 and up 4% sequentially.</p>
          <p>Performance in the U.S. was particularly robust with Atripla and Truvada delivering year-on-year growth of 21% and 17% respectively. We also had a very healthy U.S. contribution from Complera of nearly $50 million. I'll return to Complera in a moment.</p>
          <p>During this most recent quarter there was no change in major U.S. wholesale inventory levels. They remained at the lower end of our contractual range. However, it was an exceedingly strong quarter for non-retail purchasing. The biggest quarter in absolute terms we have seen.</p>
          <p>There was clearly a demand-based component to the large ADAP purchases recorded in the first quarter. As of last week ADAP wait lists are down by 67% from their peak in 2011, the current number being slightly in excess of 3,000 patients. Growth in total prescriptions, especially those for STRs, single-tablet regimens, also remain very positive. All major ADAP states now have both Atripla and Complera on their drug formularies.</p>
          <p>Finally the March, 2012 update in DHHS guidelines further reinforced earlier treatment of HIV-infected individuals. However, over and above solid market growth characteristics it is important to highlight that ADAP purchasing likely carried an inventory component with states like Florida, Illinois and Virginia adopting a use it or lose it approach recognizing that fiscal year 2011 federal budgets were only finalized in September of last year. Whilst it is very difficult to predict quarter-by-quarter ADAP purchasing, the strong first quarter performance may have a knock-on effect to our second quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>The ADAP federal budget for 2012 has now been confirmed at $935 million, an uplift of $50 million over 2011 and already states have received their individual allocations up to a national total of $900 million. The remaining $35 million is subject to an application process. This very early budget transparency bodes well for ADAP stability in 2012.</p>
          <p>Returning to Complera. The first quarter results are very encouraging. We are starting to see Complera recognized as a robust regimen for HIV treatment and an alternative STR to Atripla. According to the Ipsos Synovate Q4 data, Complera is the fifth-most prescribed regimen across all treated patients with approximately 5% share. More importantly, Complera is already the second most prescribed regimen for treatment naive patients with 19% share behind only Atripla at 40% share.</p>
          <p>Complera has undoubtedly produced significant growth in patient share over and above this headline. Our new single tablet is helping Gilead retain patients through lines of therapy. Prior to the launch of Complera approximately 75% of patients who switched off Atripla retained Truvada in their next regimen. Now with the introduction of Complera approximately 85% of patients who switch off Atripla retain Truvada either as their NRTI backbone or as part of Complera.</p>
          <p>Whilst it's too early for detailed quantitative results on the launch of Eviplera in Europe the qualitative feedback is matching that of the U.S. Eviplera is now on the market in the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Austria and the Nordic countries. In a recent awareness and usage survey performed in Germany by Gilead approximately 80% of the HIV physicians polled said that they would become frequent prescribers of Eviplera. The major markets of Spain, France and Italy will launch in the second half of 2012 and I look forward to providing more color on the EU Eviplera rollout as we go through the year.</p>
          <p>Before I leave HIV, I wanted to provide you with a quick update on the preparations for the launch of the Quad. Based upon the strong results of studies 102 and 103 and pending a successful FDA advisory panel review in May and subsequent approval, we are confident we will have another important single tablet regimen for HIV physicians and their patients.</p>
          <p>Our U.S. commercial teams are in the final stages of launch readiness. We will have an expanded sales team who are fully trained and ready to go by early June. This timeline will be matched by the commercial manufacturing, national accounts and medical affairs organizations. In Europe, we will start to mirror these efforts in the second half of the year. All in all, the Gilead HIV business looks in good shape for 2012.</p>
          <p>And finally, it would be remiss of me not to call out the first quarter performance of Letairis where we recorded a 40% growth over the first quarter of 2011. I am proud of the progress made by the Gilead PAH team. Our proprietary market research indicates that we now have a 50% share of all treated patients and just in the last few weeks we added another significant change to our label with the addition of three year survival data.</p>
          <p>To conclude, Gilead delivered a solid set of commercial results laying down a firm foundation for the year. I will now hand the call over to Norbert Bischofberger. Norbert?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kevin. Just last week we had a significant scientific presence at the European liver disease conference, EASL. This meeting has grown considerably over the years and this year there were more than 9,000 healthcare professionals and scientists in attendance. More than 30 presentations covered Gilead programs and products and new data were presented on GS-7977 our nucleotide analog for HCV infection, GS-5885 our NS5A inhibitor and GS-9669 our novel NS5B inhibitor. Also presented were very important data on Viread for the treatment of hepatitis B.</p>
          <p>The very first presentation at the EASL conference reported on an arm in the ATOMIC study, which evaluated a regimen of GS-7977 with pegylated interferon ribavirin for 12 weeks in Genotype 1 infected patients. These data indicated that this regimen resulted in 90% to 94% cure rates without the need for response guided therapy algorithms. The addition of GS-7977 to pegylated interferon ribavirin did not result in additional side effects and thus this 12-week regimen could be an important advancement for the field.</p>
          <p>Data from the ELECTRON study were also presented and in addition we chose to include data from the QUANTUM study in last week's press release. Both data sets were from study arms evaluating GS-7977 with ribavirin for 12 weeks in Genotype 1 treatment naive HCV infected patients. The studies are ongoing and only SVR4 data were available at the time of the EASL conference. The SVR4 rates in ELECTRON were 88% and in QUANTUM 59%. These are exciting results and indicate that it is possible for Genotype 1 patients to be cured with a 12-week course of GS-7977 and ribavirin.</p>
          <p>Bristol-Myers Squibb presented data from their study utilizing GS-7977 in combination with their NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir with or without ribavirin in Genotype 1 infected patients. After 24 weeks of treatment, 100% of Genotype 1 HCV treatment groups achieved SVR4. BMS has also initiated and is enrolling a 12-week study evaluating GS-7977 and daclatasvir with or without ribavirin and data from that cohort is anticipated to be available in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>We also presented data on the antiviral activity, resistance profile and persistence of drug resistant mutations to our NS5A inhibitor GS-5885. Three days of monotherapy with 5885 resulted in median maximal HCV RNA reductions of greater than 3-logs at all doses 3 milligrams or higher. GS-5885 showed pico-molar activity in genotypes 1, 4 and 6 and nano-molar activity in genotypes 2 and 3.</p>
          <p>Another poster described the antiviral activity of GS-9669, a novel NS5B non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, in genotype 1 infected patients. GS-9669, when dosed for three days at 500 milligram dose once daily resulted in median maximal viral load reductions of 3.5 logs in both genotype 1a and 1b. These data indicate that GS-9669 is one of the most potent non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitors described to date and has the potential to co-formulated with GS-7977 into a single tablet regimen.</p>
          <p>Based on Phase II data in Genotype 2, 3 patients, which we were disclosed previously, we have advanced GS-7977 into two Phase III studies called FISSION and POSITRON. Both studies will reevaluate the 12-week treatment course of GS-7977 with ribavirin in genotype 2, 3 infected patients.</p>
          <p>FISSION is conducted in 500 treatment naive patients and uses a pegylated interferon ribavirin standard of care 24-week control arm. That study should be fully enrolled by the end of this month.</p>
          <p>POSITRON evaluates GS-7977 ribavirin in 240 interferon ineligible or intolerant patients and utilizes a 12-week placebo arm as the control. That study should be fully enrolled at the end of May. Thus with these two studies we should be able to file for approval for GS-7977 for the treatment of genotype 2, 3 infected patients by mid-2013.</p>
          <p>A GS-7977 and GS-5885 drug interaction study has been completed indicating that no dose adjustments are necessary when the two agents are used together. This, along with our safety database that includes over 800 patients dosed with GS-5885, will allow us to advance this combination of GS-7977 and 5885 into a Phase II study as an arm in ELECTRON in genotype 1 null-responders and also into other clinical studies.</p>
          <p>There are several paths we could pursue that could accelerate our entry in the market in genotype 1 patients but until we complete the dialogue with regulators and this path is crystallized we will not project what that could look like at this time.</p>
          <p>At EASL there were also a number of presentations that highlighted the use of Viread for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis B infection. The study showed that Viread results in high virological suppression and is safe in patients with baseline renal disease.</p>
          <p>Now turning to HIV, I would like to provide a quick update on ongoing studies further exploring the use of Quad. We've initiated two 48-week Phase III B studies to evaluate switching of virologically suppressed patients on an NNRTI plus Truvada regimen to Quad and from a protease plus Truvada regimen to Quad respectively. Both studies are approximately 20% enrolled. We've also initiated a 50 patient 12-week switch study from raltegravir plus Truvada to Quad and this study is approximately half enrolled.</p>
          <p>In January, we announced the initiation of a Phase II clinical trial evaluating GS-7340 for the treatment of HIV infection in treatment naive adults. We have now completed screening for this 150 patient Phase II study that compares GS-7340 as part of a once daily co-formulated single-tablet regimen that also contains cobicistat, elvitegravir and emtricitabine to our Quad single-tablet regimen.</p>
          <p>We have recently completed the co-formulation of the first protease inhibitor containing single-tablet regimen consisting of GS-7340, emtricitabine, darunavir and cobicistat and just this month we began screening patients in a Phase II study comparing this single-tablet regimen to Truvada, darunavir and cobicistat.</p>
          <p>With respect to Complera, we fully enrolled the single-tablet Phase III B head-to-head study versus Atripla and anticipate data in the fourth quarter of this year. As you may recall the Phase III studies that supported the approval of Complera were blinded studies utilizing rilpvirine, efavirenz and Truvada as single pills given multiple times per day rather than a single-tablet regimen administered once daily. This design could have led to the data that underestimate the true benefit of single-tablet regimens.</p>
          <p>As a final R&amp;D highlight, three Phase III studies will be initiated in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, which is 1101 in combination with rituximab with bendamustine rituximab or with ofatumumab. The first two of these studies are anticipated to begin enrollment &#x2013; enrolling patients this quarter and the third study will begin in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>All in all, I'm very excited about our pipeline and we very much look forward to advancing these programs to the commercial stage. I will now turn over the call to John Milligan. John?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Norbert. I, too, am very pleased with the progress of Gilead's extensive portfolio of investigational agents and would like to add a few additional comments regarding our HIV products.</p>
          <p>In early March, the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, also known as CROI, took place in Seattle. Gilead had a significant presence with 45 abstracts focused on Gilead's marketed and pipeline products. Key oral presentations and posters included data on Quad, GS-7340, Viread for HPV and GS-7977 for HCV, as well as Truvada for the prevention of HIV or PrEP.</p>
          <p>Importantly, for the first time we were able to present the data from studies 102 and 103, the two registrational trials of Quad. Data from Study 102 indicates that Quad was not inferior to Atripla based on the primary end point of percentage of patients below 50 copies per milliliter at week 48. Quad demonstrated advantages in neuropsychiatric side effects and in cholesterol levels. Likewise, Study 103 demonstrated that Quad was non-inferior to a regimen containing ritonavir-boosted atazanavir and Truvada. In this second study, Quad had advantages over the boosted atazanavir regimen with regard to elevated bilirubin levels and triglyceride levels.</p>
          <p>In both studies, discontinuation rates due to adverse events were similar. The full results of these two studies have been submitted for publication in a peer reviewed journal and the applications for marketing approval are under review in the United States, Europe, Australia, Canada and Switzerland.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. FDA will convene an antiviral division advisory committee panel to discuss the Quad application on May 11. As many of you know, the PDUFA date for Quad is August 27.</p>
          <p>Over the past few years, we collaborated with various organizations to explore the use of Truvada for PrEP. Several studies have shown that the use of Truvada in uninfected, at risk adults can reduce the risk of HIV infection. Based on these results, a supplemental NDA was submitted to FDA in December to expand the indication of Truvada to include the prevention of HIV infection among uninfected high risk adults. To get expert advice on this application, FDA will convene an advisory committee meeting on May 10, one day before the Quad hearing. We look forward to these back-to-back panel meetings beginning two weeks from today.</p>
          <p>Gilead is off to a strong start in 2012 with solid first quarter financial results and an exciting and robust pipeline of products. Our 4500 employees continue to drive unprecedented execution across our organization committed to rapidly bringing better options to patients around the world. The remainder of 2012 looks equally bright and we look forward to sharing results with you as we continue to drive commercial performance, launch new products and advance our pipeline.</p>
          <p>I have one corporate announcement to make prior to opening the call for Q&amp;A. After 23 years of exceptional service, Susan Hubbard has announced her intention to retire from Gilead. Her presence at the company will surely be missed. On behalf of all of Gilead's leadership team, I would like to thank Susan for her many contributions.</p>
          <p>[Applause]</p>
          <p>At this time, we will open the call to Q&amp;A. Stacy?</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on your retirement, Susan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I got a couple for you on Hep C. So the first one is, is there a new data set that you're waiting for as kind of a gating factor to start an all oral Phase III for genotype 1?</p>
          <p>And then the second part of that is what would a Phase II look like when you combine say 7977 and 5885? Would the bias here be for a sort of a fast simple study or more of a comprehensive study that looks at things like duration, different doses, population and things like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, Geoff, I'll answer these two questions. So what would a Phase &#x2013; what are we waiting for? We are not necessarily waiting for any particular data set but we will have discussions very soon with regulatory authorities to make proposals to them and at this point we really don't know what regulatory authorities think. We need their feedback and input.</p>
          <p>But the two upcoming data sets that are both very interesting that will determine or could determine both the design and the duration of the Phase III study is number one, the 24-week data in QUANTUM with GS-7977 and ribavirin. And secondly, the 12-week data from the Bristol-Myers study with 7977 and daclatasvir. So both of those things really address one, if you extend the duration of the 7977 ribavirin can you get higher response rate or secondly, if you shorten the Bristol-Myers daclatasvir 7977, can you maintain the high response rate. Those are the two questions that are being answered.</p>
          <p>Then regarding Phase II, we are really thinking about something short because we feel there are no concerns. We don't have any outstanding concerns about safety of any of our products, 5885 or 7977 so we feel comfortable moving into a large Phase III study. And with regards to efficacy all those questions really have been for the most part answered with the exception of the two that I mentioned before.</p>
          <p>And let me just say one last thing because it may come up. We also feel very comfortable extrapolating from daclatasvir to 5885 because these two compounds by all criteria are very similar at least in genotype 1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just as a quick follow-up, Norbert, would you be in position to start several or multiple different strategies for Phase III for an all oral? Or do you want to have a single strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>No it would be &#x2013; absolutely we would favor multiple because, as you know, there's the issue of treatment duration, there's this issue of complexity, for instance ATOMIC design. That's still on the table, that's actually a huge step forward from if you think about where we are today in terms of standard of care to be able to shorten that to something 12-week, no response guided therapy with a well-tolerated 7977 added to Peg/Riba, that's certainly an option as well.</p>

          <p>No, congratulations, in all seriousness. Hey, I was just wondering &#x2013; I have a question on the genotype 2, 3, Phase III study versus standard of care. Is that a non-inferiority trial or a superiority trial? And if it's non-inferiority &#x2013; sorry, and if possible could you give us the criteria for non-inferiority or superiority?</p>
          <p>And the second question is today Bristol-Myers expressed on their earnings call a desire to partner with Gilead. I was wondering if you could walk us through your updated thoughts on partnering with Bristol. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, Mark. The first question is very simple. It's designed as a non-inferiority study with a delta of 15% but I would like to tell you that FDA has communicated to Pharmasset previously, so none of us were at those meetings, that even if they miss non-inferiority it would still be approvable because it's a huge advantage and a huge step forward to treat somebody for three months with a two oral drugs rather than six months with beta interferon. But the answer is it's non-inferiority with a delta of 15%.</p>

But with regard to how or where or when we might work with Bristol-Myers, we're just not going to be able to comment on that strategy because I think it's very &#x2013; as we've learned in the past it's very difficult to negotiate these things in public. And so I'm basically going to be held to no comment for today on this subject.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I hate following Mark, but I have a question on the HCV program. Surprise, surprise. My big question for you is why are you expanding ELECTRON specifically in null responders? You've got a 90% relapse rate with the two drugs. Now you're looking at these two different triple options with 5885 or 9669. Didn't we learn from EASL that the null population is particularly difficult and really setting a totally different bar relative to naives? Why not go in and just do the naive 12-week data and then even throw in 9669 on top of 5885 to get the triple more potent regimen instead of keeping riba in there. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Rachel, you have a very good point and the answer to that is very simple. We're doing both. We actually have a drug interaction study that is about to complete with 9669 and 7977. Once we get the data from that study we will initiate a Phase II study in treatment naive patient genotype 1 to test that hypothesis.</p>
          <p>But Rachel, so the second point I would like to make, this is a small pilot experiment with ten patients so it's really not a big study but it's an experiment.</p>
          <p>The third comment is we debated this internally, if you look at 7977 ribavirin in genotype 1 null-responders give you high relapse rates but we felt we wanted to change only one variable and not two. If you do a two variable experiment both extend the treatment duration and add another drug, then in the end you don't know. So we made the decision to add one more drug and see whether the results will be different.</p>
          <p>And lastly, let me also tell you from the large amount of data that we're getting, I think it's clear now at least with 7977 which has a very high barrier to resistance, you can have a longer treatment duration and good responses or a shorter treatment duration but then you have to add other drugs. So we think 12 weeks of 7977 with NS5A &#x2013; with the 5885 and ribavirin I am convinced will give you good treatment responses. But again, we will find out once we get the data.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But just to clarify, it looks like you're not actually doing that in naives. You're not going to replicate the daclatasvir study. You're going to let Bristol's 12-week data in the fourth quarter provide the proof of principle in naives and you're going to explore the rest of this in nulls? Do I have that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. Rachel, as I said we feel very comfortable scientifically to extrapolating from daclatasvir to 5855 at least in genotype 1 patients, not in two and three, but in ones and we think there's no reason to believe that we wouldn't get the same results with 5885 as Bristol-Myers has achieved with daclatasvir.</p>

          <p>Great. Thanks very much for taking the questions. It's a little bit of a broader question on hepatitis C. I understand that you can't talk about the specific path for its advancement until you speak with the FDA but can you talk a little bit about as many options as you can that could potentially take it forward and what the rationale would be for taking a 7977, 5855 combo directly into Phase III without a Phase II? And do you have any indication for whether or not the FDA has a position on that at this point? Thanks a lot.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yah. Hi, Matt. So no, I do not &#x2013; we don't have any indication what the FDA is thinking about that. So I'm of course speculating now, but if we did this it wouldn't be jumping with both feet into a large Phase III study but rather something like you enroll a cohort, you do a certain interim analysis after a certain time point and we still have to figure out what that time point is, convince yourself that the data looks good and then you enroll the rest of the cohort. So would be like a Phase II/III approach and that's something we just have to think through carefully and propose to the FDA.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It would be a super pan-genotypic nuc. I have two questions. The first one, just maybe for Norbert, just a little bit &#x2013; do you have any sense, what happened at QUANTUM? Why is the data so bizarre and different than ELECTRON?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, with respect to when we spoke at EASL it sounds like one of the things you were thinking about in Phase III is potentially doing a doublet &#x2013; a 7977/5885 arm for 24 weeks. So my question is do you need to do some kind of a small Phase II where you actually test them together for 24 weeks or is the FDA going to be comfortable extrapolating the data separately from each drug separately?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the answer to the second question &#x2013; I said before we really have to have a debate with the FDA and we haven't done that yet. I do not know what they think about it. And as I said we wouldn't &#x2013; certainly the proposal would not be jump into a 500 patient Phase III study with both feet, but rather do something like a cohort first and then you do an interim analysis and then you enroll the rest of the patients. So it would be something like more of a Phase II/III study.</p>
          <p>And regarding your second question, the difference between QUANTUM and ELECTRON, the short answer is I don't know, but the two comments I would like to make. There was a difference in baseline CC genotype between the two studies as you may have seen in ELECTRON. There were 44% of the patients were CCs and then QUANTUM if I remember correctly 16%. So the QUANTUM underrepresented statistically what you would expect in a general population and ELECTRON over represented. That may be one reason why the ELECTRON patient population responded better.</p>
          <p>The other thing is keep in mind these are still small numbers. It was 17 in QUANTUM and 25 in ELECTRON...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, the other way, yes. And the other thing the CC genotype &#x2013; I think it was clear at EASL &#x2013; there were two presentations, one by BI and one by BMS were it was clear that CC IL28 genotype does matter even with all oral antiviral so it's entirely possible that, that explains the discrepancy between these two, ELECTRON and PROTON results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you would think that the CC wouldn't matter depending on the potency right? With 7977 we've seen daclatasvir it doesn't really matter so when you get to pretty high potency at that point it doesn't matter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's true. But then argue if you have a high enough potent regimen you don't get the influence of IL28 baseline genotype disappears and again we will find that out along the way if we add either 5885 or 9669 to 7977 then if that influence of IL28 disappears, then you're right.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the question. I have two quick questions. One is just how do you get the comfort with your NS5A on the efficacy side. I understand your rationale on the safety side that just the 800 patient data set but please help us understand on the efficacy side.</p>
          <p>And second just a quick clarification on the potential ADAP inventory levels. How should we think, how much of this trend this quarter could potentially be knocked off as you said in 2Q, just for forward thinking for 2Q estimates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sapna, I'll take the first question. So the efficacy side on the NS5A &#x2013; we look at both modeling so you look at in vitro antiviral potency against genotypes and within genotype and polymorphs and our compound is very, very similar to daclatasvir in genotype 1. Then you can do the reduced dose &#x2013; the 60 milligrams daclatasvir versus the 90 milligram of 5885. You do the protein adjusted IC50 or the IQ and those IQs are very similar and lastly you look at existing data that we have from 5885 both on monotherapy and when you add it to PEG interferon-ribavirin, you look at the steepness of the viral load decline and it's again very similar. So we feel very comfortable that 5885 from an efficacy point of view will mirror daclatasvir. It will be a good compound.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Sapna, it's Kevin. Thank you. I was feeling a bit lonely here so it's lovely to get questions. Yah, just let me quickly talk about ADAP funding.</p>
          <p>So it was a big quarter for the end of the 2011 financial year for ADAP. That was particularly Florida and Illinois, less so places like Texas and Puerto Rico. The main products that they have purchased in is Atripla and Truvada because of course they're the workhorses of their budgets. Difficult to estimate what that will do to quarter two.</p>
          <p>We're very pleased that the 2012 budgets have gone out already. You can find those on the HRSA websites so basically everything bar the $35 million that was announced by President Obama on World AIDS Day have gone out. So that's a great reassurance and remember last year they didn't know their actual numbers until September so that did lead to the big fourth quarter and quarter one of this year. So I think that provides a lot of stability.</p>
          <p>Clearly Complera is starting to pick up which is great for us and I think the experience has been very good in the field with Complera. So it was one of the biggest that we have seen in absolute terms not in percentage terms but in absolute terms and I think we'll just have to see how that plays out for Q2/Q3.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe I just ask an HIV question if I don't bore anyone. But your European market looked a little bit weaker &#x2013; a little flat quarter-over-quarter as far as patient adds and I was wondering if you could give some color on the trends you're seeing in Europe and whether not you think that you could see growth reinvigorate in the latter half of the year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Robyn, it's Kevin. Thanks for the question. Yeah, I think I'd agree with you. For the past quarter it has been flat but actually ticked up in a very positive sense. Europe is not easy, particularly Southern Europe and I think we continue to do very well. If you look quarter-on-quarter there was about a 2% growth in demand. We got a positive 1% in FX and about a minus 1% in price. So it wasn't a bad quarter. We're starting to roll out Eviplera now. Two of the big markets, the U.K. and Germany, both have got the products in and initial response I think has been pretty positive. So I think on the back of Eviplera we hope that we're going to have another burst and another push around single-tablet regimens.</p>
          <p>I should also add, Robyn, that guidelines continue to start to highlight single-tablet regimens and fixed dose combinations. In our slide on guidelines that's in the earnings deck &#x2013; you may have noticed the new draft BHIVA guidelines. I'll point out two things on those guidelines.</p>
          <p>Number one, the preferred regimens are all Truvada so the alternative regimen is now abacavir, so it's been downgraded. There's a call-out there highlighting the preference for fixed dose combinations avoiding selectivity of the individual agents. So again, the preference and the benefit of single tablets is coming through more and more. So I think you can call it a solid quarter in Europe and we're certainly looking forward to Eviplera being a driver of growth in the second half of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well again, I wouldn't look too much into 1% here, 1% there, Robyn. I'm literally looking at my market share slide for the big five markets and it hasn't gone down but it's basically flat when you look at total Truvada split out by Atripla and Truvada itself. So again, extrapolating from similar numbers is quite hard sometimes. Please bear in mind that the European databases are just not quite as good as the U.S.</p>

          <p>I had a Hep C question. I didn't get a chance to talk to you all after the poster on 5885 when the resistance profile was presented over the weekend. How should we interpret the data in genotype 1B where it looked like there's about 1,000-fold shift with 5885 with the Y93H mutations but only a 24-fold shift with the Bristol drug? Your comments on the ability to extrapolate the Bristol combination data to 5885 suggests that you don't think that, that's actually that big of a deal and would love to understand what other factors we should keep in mind in interpreting that resistance data? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Thomas, that was the one polymorph that showed actually the biggest difference. And all I can say, that polymorph is extremely rare and has not been described in the literature as really occurring. It's one that we generated ourselves in the lab to just see how far can we push the system. So whether that polymorph is in any way exists or is relevant clinically is an open question.</p>
          <p>The other thing you also should keep in mind that even with that shift at the 90-milligram dose we're still way above a multiple of the IQ. So if you at least believe what we learned from HIV, this would act even against that polymorph would be a very inhibitory compound at the 90-milligram dose.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Just wanted clarification on this Phase IIb combination study that you're going to run as an extension arm of ELECTRON, can you again clarify why you're running the non-responders? Isn't that risky? Could you just run multiple arms? And then as a follow-up, can you co-formulate 7977 and 5885? I don't know anything about that. I assume that's an easy hurdle? But just ask.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, Michael. The answer for the second question, that's an effort that's ongoing that we have prototype pills internally of course they have to go through the usual stability analytical method and then PK evaluation at least in humans. But that seems to be fairly straightforward. These compounds from a physical-chemical point of view are both well behaved.</p>
          <p>So the reason why we're doing the null-responders is simply so it's not that we're only doing the null-responders, we're thinking about treatment naive patients more in a Phase II/III sense. We're more certain that the combination there works because of the experience with the Bristol-Myers data and what we don't know and what we really would like to find out in the genotype in the null-responders. Remember in the 12-week studies 7977 plus ribavirin null-responders we had nine out of ten rebounders, but there were no breakthroughs.</p>
          <p>So biologically this is a very, very potent regimen, but maybe we just didn't have enough pressure on the system to cure a significant number of patients in 12 weeks and that's why we decided to add another drug &#x2013; to repeat the same experiment that we've done before, just adding another drug. So it's one variable experiment that will give us some information at the end. That was the decision.</p>

          <p>Hi. It's Kevin here. So in terms of the breakout, yeah, I've got that data for you. So 35% of the Complera patients are coming from na&#xEF;ve, so basically new patients. And by the way, that's our label today in the U.S. that we stay on with our field force. 40% are switches from products other than Atripla, and that's largely the protease inhibitor combinations, and 25% are switches from Atripla itself.</p>
          <p>Just to paint a little bit of color for you in terms of patients, the vast majority of patients, more than 90% of the patients that are going on Complera are those patients below 100,000 copies, again, as per our label. There's actually quite a large percentage as we expected that are female patients, approximately 30% of the starts on Complera are female. That compares with only 13% as a comparator for Atripla. So a high proportion relative to Atripla for the female patient, because of the better pregnancy category.</p>
          <p>In terms of Quad, just like Complera, we will have, we expect to have a naive label, there won't be switching there, so the studies that were highlighted today are very important to us. We'd like to get that data into the label. Switching patients is still an important bucket, as you can see from Complera. So yes, we would want that data, but we will only initially be able to go out seeking the naive patients.</p>
          <p>But I do want to emphasize that the nice thing about Quad, it will be our first detail with our expanded field force, is that we've got that larger slice of the naive pie, because we've got the data 102 versus Atripla and 103 versus the boosted protease. So as I said in the past, we have the opportunity to address the nine out of ten patients that are beginning in the naive setting. So it gives us a much, much broader expanded horizon than we've got today with Complera.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This is Christine Cho in for Tony. Thank you for taking the questions. The first is your QUANTUM study still has 24-week treatment arms left to read out. And let's suppose that 7977 and ribavirin for 24 weeks do lead to a competitive SVR. Do you think this combo is still relevant, given what took place at EASL and would you really still develop this 24-week combo for GT1?</p>
          <p>And then second, we're beginning to see the growth momentum for Incivek slowing down, and what do you think this says about the HCV market? Thank you for the time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So regarding 7977 ribavirin for 24 weeks, I do believe that's a valid regimen, because it's one drug and cheap generic ribavirin that many physicians tell me they're comfortable with and not unhappy with. And then of course you have to balance is that a better regimen than something more drugs, more complicated, maybe more expensive for 12 weeks? And obviously we're going to do both and see where the clinical data leads us. And what was the second?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the second one, Norbert. So the question was about Incivek sales slowing down, what does that say about the market. I think it says more about the profile of the protease inhibitor containing regimens of Peg/Riba, where it's very clear that while the overall response rates has gone up, the overall complexity of the regimen and the side effect profile is much more severe, especially in severely ill patients than people had previously thought. And there was numerous data sets at EASL that outlined the cost and complexity of keeping people on these protease inhibitor containing regimens with the need for transfusions and the very poor side effect profile in certain patients. And so what it suggests to us is that now that doctors and patients know that easier regimens are on the horizon, they're going to continue to warehouse those patients until those first regimens are on the market. And they also know they're coming very soon, so that's exciting for them as well.</p>

          <p>Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question, Susan I was very, very sad to go. You've really been one of the best IR people on the Street that I've ever experienced.</p>
          <p>I just wanted &#x2013; maybe I can get some top line commentary on the Hep C landscape from you guys and where you might see yourself in the competitive space. Obviously I think we can all agree it's going to be a very, very meaningful driver to be the first mover to have an all oral. I'm just wondering what you think of if a competitor were able to navigate a pan-genotypic oral regimen to market between the approval of genotype-specific regimens anchored by 7977 but before you could get your own Gilead own pan-genotypic regimen. What sort of impact do you think this could have commercially? Do you think this is a big deal to be the first mover here? Or do you think this is less of a competitive advantage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, it's Kevin. I'll kick off. I think it's a very big deal to be a first mover, particularly with 7977. I think the results that we saw in Barcelona and everybody around this table were there in Barcelona &#x2013; says that we have a very, very potent agent. So a good drug being first is to me, a double whammy and so we look forward to hopefully that opportunity. We have a lot of expertise and extremely good relationships in this setting. We have field forces here in the U.S. and in Europe who visit the liver disease specialists. We'll have to expand those activities and we'll have to balance our HBV responsibilities versus HCV but we really do have very, very good relationships and that overlap is even bigger in Europe. So we're already starting to do the work on field force sizing. I can certainly reassure you that we'll have an incredibly committed presence in Hepatitis C, and of course there's the other dimension for Gilead, is are there additional opportunities with the infectious disease doctor.</p>
          <p>So we're planning to be ready along Norbert's timelines for the genotype 2 and 3 and then hopefully not too further down the road we can get the genotype 1. So yes, first mover advantage is important and we look forward to the opportunity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe be a little more specific. I'm talking what you would think about the impact of being first mover with a pan-genotypic regimen. I'm looking at Bristol and saying if you're extrapolating that daclatasvir data to 5885 maybe it's also reasonable to extrapolate some of the 7977 data to at least the 200 mg dose of INX189. It would seem that Bristol has a viable pan-genotypic combo at least moving into clinical development very soon. I'm just wondering if they would take the lead in a pan-genotypic? Do you see that as a major competitive risk?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that two and three will give us a very, very nice entry. And I'm hoping that Norbert and the team here will hopefully get us into one very, very quickly and ultimately with our own pan-genotypic regimen. So time will tell. I think it's very difficult to make predictions on that race, if you like, between Bristol-Myers and Gilead. We think we've got the best backbone here and we think we've got alternative approaches as you've heard from Norbert. So I think we're going to be highly competitive in that race to pan-genotypic.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and Susan let me add my congratulations on your retirement. Thanks for all the help over the years. A question on the upcoming Quad panel. In the past you've suggested that the reason why the FDA probably wanted to review the Quad was because the cobicistat component. Now that we're just a couple weeks away from the panel, I'm guessing Gilead has reviewed the briefing documents that the FDA's prepared. Could you give us some more information on what issues if any the FDA has with the Quad and whether we should suspect any surprises when we see those briefing documents in a couple weeks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well so obviously those documents are not public and won't be released to the public until a couple of days ahead of time, so we just can't comment on those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, Phil, I think I said last time that the one issue that we always felt was something that warrants discussion has to do with that cobicistat increases creatinines and that it generates some question to the practicing physician when is the creatinine elevation just simply a laboratory thing that's caused by cobicistat and when is it something that you have to take serious as an issue of nephrotoxicity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what could come out of the panel on that topic? Would it be a discussion of labeling or what kind of conclusion could the panel draw.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what I think the discussion will be about. What should the physician do in terms of &#x2013; you normally use serum creatinine for a measure of kidney function. Now that we have cobicistat that increases creatinine, how do you interpret serum creatinine levels? That's what &#x2013; I think &#x2013; well, I don't know what it's going to be, but that's what I guess is going to be the nature of the discussion and the potential outcome could be labeling or monitoring recommendations or something like that.</p>
