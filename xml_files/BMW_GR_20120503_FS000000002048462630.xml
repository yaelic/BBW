          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to welcome you all to the telephone conference of the BMW AG on the First Quarter 2012. With me today are Dr. Norbert Reithofer, Chairman of the Board of Management; and Dr. Friedrich Eichiner, our CFO.</p>
          <p>First, Dr. Reithofer will give you all an update on the business performance during the first three months of the year. Dr. Eichiner will then take you through our financial results for the first quarter. Afterwards, we will have time for a Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>Mr. Reithofer, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, in 2016, BMW will be 100 years old, a clear testimony to our company's ability to evolve and grow. This is a true milestone as we continue our success story. This means that we will keep acting with foresight and a long-term global perspective in mind just like our investors expect of us.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of 2012, we managed to further build on our successful business performance of the 2011 financial year. In terms of sales, it was the most successful first quarter ever for the BMW Group with a total of over 425,000 cars sold worldwide.</p>
          <p>It was the most successful first quarter ever for our three automotive brands: BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce, as well as for BMW Motorrad. It was also the best first quarter ever with regard to our pre-tax result on the group level, which stands at &#x20AC;2 billion. We recorded an EBIT margin in the Automotive segment of 11.6%.</p>
          <p>The BMW Group continues to benefit from the decisions we made as part of our Strategy Number ONE back in 2007. And today, we are clearly looking far ahead again. In 2016, we aim to sell over 2 million cars. We also aim to generate sustainable profits. This means a goal to achieve an EBIT margin in the Automotive segment in the range of 8% to 10% over the long-term. So far, almost no car company has managed to achieve this performance for a longer period of time.</p>
          <p>For the year 2020, our vision remains clear, to be the leading provider of premium products and premium services for individual mobility. In order to meet these goals, we have to make large-scale investments now in new technologies, in all our German and global facilities, and in training our staff successfully to meet today's and tomorrow's challenges.</p>
          <p>What are our expectations for the year 2012? We are targeting a new sales record for the Group, new all-time highs for our three car brands, and a new record pre-tax result on the Group level. These targets are based on the assumption that the economic and financial conditions will remain largely stable. Nobody can forecast how the financial systems and consumer demand will develop, given the high level of public debt in various countries. As well, the economic strength in individual Southern European markets may weaken further. But one thing is true. There continue to be opportunities for future growth in the premium car market. Demand for our young and attractive model portfolio remains strong with customers all around the world. Our segment leaders are: the BMW 1 Series and the X1, the BMW 3 Series Sedan even with the model change in the first quarter of 2012, the BMW 3 Series Convertible, the BMW 5 Series, the BMW X5 and the BMW 6 Series.</p>
          <p>By summer BMW and MINI will have introduced further new models and variants. Let me give you a few examples. This March saw the launch of the next member of the MINI family, the MINI Roadster. Next will be the BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe in June. It's the first four-door coupe made by BMW. The model update of the BMW 7 Series will arrive at the dealerships in July. One of the highlights in the second half of the year will be the revised Phantom Series II at Rolls-Royce. And this fall, we'll launch the BMW X1 in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the development of global car markets varies from region to region. In many markets we recorded double-digit growth in the first quarter. This is especially true for larger regions such as North America with 17% increase and Asia with a 32% increase. This strong performance allows us to compensate for the decrease in demand we are currently experiencing in some countries in Southern Europe, which has been especially affected by the financial crisis. Thanks to our flexible reduction at work and a wide range of models, we react quickly and effectively to changing market demands. It is for this very reason that we continue to strive for balanced growth across the globe.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter 2012, the BMW Group's largest individual markets of Germany, the U.S. and China were fairly balanced. In absolute terms, China was our best performing market in the first quarter, ahead of the U.S. and Germany for the first time. The Premium segment in China will continue to offer positive growth opportunities. However, customers and Chinese authorities are setting specific requirements for the car industry in China. We will continue to align our production, our products and new technologies to meet these requirements.</p>
          <p>Our new plant in Tiexi opens in mid-May. At the Beijing Motor Show, the BMW 3 Series long wheelbase version for Chinese customers celebrated its world premiere. We will bring BMW brand e-cars to China and develop a specific offering for the Chinese market in cooperation with our partner, Brilliance.</p>
          <p>Political regulations around the world affecting the automotive industry remain on the agenda. Specifics vary from country to country. In China, the government is strongly pushing for electrification. In the U.S., the government has established CO2 emission targets for 2025. E-cars will be receiving credits. They will be factored in several times when calculating a brand's fleet average.</p>
          <p>In Europe, the EU Commission will decide this summer about the European fleet average of 95 grams of CO2 per kilometer as the target for 2020. At present, e-cars in the EU also receive a so-called supercredit. However, this bonus is supposed to expire in 2015, which would prove challenging.</p>
          <p>In order to meet the diverse CO2 emission targets, we are consistently pursuing the development of future technologies. Our goal for 2020 is to reduce our fleet's CO2 emissions by 50% compared with the mid-1990s. So, what steps are we taking? We continue to invest in efficient dynamics, as well as in plug-in hybrids and e-cars. We have signed a cooperation agreement with Toyota Motor Corporation. Together, we want to take the lithium-ion battery technology to the next level.</p>
          <p>The carbon fiber for the BMW i family is produced in our new hydroelectric-powered plant in Washington State. We are producing car body parts from this carbon fiber, as well as components for the eDrive in Bavaria. We will then build our e-cars in Leipzig. That way, we strengthen Germany's position in the fields of industrialization, e-mobility and light-weight construction.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we are preparing our staff for the challenges ahead. In the past 12 months, we have trained more than 1,000 employees &#x2013; from apprentices to engineers in the field of e-mobility at our new training center in Munich.</p>
          <p>We are facing a variety of different issues such as political regulation, diverse market conditions, demographic change, shortage of specialists, new mobility services, the value shift in our society, and new demands from upcoming generations.</p>
          <p>Our strategy is clearly focused on addressing these challenges as an independent company. All our efforts are clearly geared toward remaining the leader in the Premium segment. Thanks to our experience positioning Premium brands, we will continue to grow the strengths of our three brands: BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce. We will act with foresight and maintain a long-term global approach. This has been and continues to be the foundation for our success moving towards 2020. Thank you very much for your attention.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Norbert Reithofer. And now, Friedrich Eichiner will give you an update on the financials of the BMW Group. Mr. Eichiner, please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, a good afternoon from my side as well. Our quarterly results, with new sales revenue and earnings records, is once again clear evidence of our operating and financial strength. The credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's upgraded our rating in April based on our positive business development and solid financial position. This gives us the best credit rating of all European car manufacturers.</p>
          <p>The BMW Group's quarterly earnings before taxes improved year-on-year to &#x20AC;2.076 billion, an increase of 21.8%. Our Group EBIT margin was 11.3%. A change in accounting in our 2011 Group financial statement has also resulted in a restatement of certain figures for the individual quarters of 2011. The change concerns the revaluation of products leased through BMW Financial Services. The adjusted 2011 figures are identified in the quarterly report. The quarterly adjustments for the whole of the 2011 financial year can be found under note 3.</p>
          <p>Now first, let's take a look at the Automotive segment. Demand for our three premium brands was positively high in the first quarter. We delivered more than 425,000 BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles for revenues of &#x20AC;16.16 billion in the segment, an increase of 12.4% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>We saw dynamic sales growth in China and the United States in particular, as well as in many emerging markets in Asia and Latin America. However, the situation has become less favorable in a number of Southern European markets, and competitive pressure has increased.</p>
          <p>The segment EBIT for the first quarter totaled just under &#x20AC;1.88 billion. This is an increase of 10% over the same period last year, result of sales growth and product mix. The EBIT margin in Automotive segment remained exactly the same level as last year at 11.6%.</p>
          <p>As previously announced, our upfront investments in future projects, the expenditure for research and development were higher than in the first quarter of 2011. The total amount was in the low three-digit millions.</p>
          <p>We are taking advantage of our earning power to make targeted investments. Our development spending on lightweight construction and alternative price technologies will secure us a stronger market position in the future. Our vehicles will need to become even more efficient to meet stricter CO2 standards worldwide. Over the full year, this will result in additional expenditure between &#x20AC;800 million and &#x20AC;1 billion.</p>
          <p>Inventories increased by more than &#x20AC;1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2012. This is essentially due to the global market launch of the 3 Series Sedan and sales growth in our overseas markets. As previously anticipated, we expect a burden from pricing due to the 3 Series Sedan model changeover throughout the first half of the year mainly because not all new models are available yet in overseas markets.</p>
          <p>The segment's dynamic operating performance generated a strong operating cash flow and a free cash flow of &#x20AC;1.635 billion. We expect this positive trend to continue throughout the rest of year and are targeting a free cash flow of more than &#x20AC;3 billion.</p>
          <p>The positive development also had a positive impact on Group liquidity.  We have a strong liquidity basis and are in a good position to cover potential volatility. As of the 31st of March, Group liquidity totaled &#x20AC;12 billion. Net financial assets in the Automotive segment amounted to &#x20AC;13.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the Financial Services segment also benefited from our sales growth. We concluded almost 306,000 leasing and financing contracts with retail customers in the first quarter. This represents a 10.5% increase over the same period last year. At the end of the first quarter, the total number of contracts in place reached 3.65 million. This also includes ING Car Lease contracts.</p>
          <p>Our business also profited from attractive financing conditions. The segment generated a pre-tax profit of &#x20AC;434 million in the first quarter. This includes positive one-off effect in the amount of &#x20AC;43 million from end-of-lease business. Earnings were therefore slightly higher year-on-year.</p>
          <p>The Financial Services segment provided leasing or financing for 38.2% of new BMW Group vehicles in the first quarter. This rate is slightly lower than last year due to China's rapidly growing share of sales and the fact that the penetration rate is still relatively low in the Chinese market. This situation developed as expected in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Used car prices remains stable in U.S. and Germany. The price situation decreased slightly in the UK. Used car prices fell in the Southern European markets, and we also see potential risk here for the months ahead. Overall, we expect market development to be uneven and more volatile.</p>
          <p>The weighted risk for the Financial Services segment remains stable in the first quarter. However, individual market performance is likely to vary over the coming months. The integration of ING Car Lease has made the BMW Group one of Europe's leading fleet service providers. We'll be expanding our market position for new offerings. Our fleet management company, Alphabet, won the first major corporate customers for its AlphaCity innovative mobility solution in the first quarter. New telematic solutions and accounting systems will allow companies to loan their fleet vehicles to employees for private use and optimize their fleet utilization. This new form of cashiering will open up new growth opportunities for Alphabet's mobility services.</p>
          <p>We remain confident overall about the prospects for our Financial Services business. BMW Financial Services continues to benefit from strong growth in the premium segment. Our excellent position is due to adopting more conservative residual values during the financial and economic crisis, the lower total volume of off-lease vehicles and our healthy level of risk provision.</p>
          <p>In the Motorcycle segment, first quarter sales rose by almost 8% to more than 27,000 units. Growth in Brazil, the U.S. and Germany more than offset the decline in sales in the individual European markets. Segment's revenues climbed 12.8% to &#x20AC;448 million in the first three months. At the end of the quarter, EBIT totaled &#x20AC;37 million and was therefore 19.4% higher year-on-year. With its attractive model lineup, the Motorcycle segment can expect to make further sales gains in the shrinking total market.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the BMW Group will continue its successful course in the second half of the year. We expect the positive trend in sales to continue, thanks to the new Series Sedan and the 6 Series Gran Coup&#xE9;, the updated 7 Series Sedan and other new models.</p>
          <p>However, we are well aware of the uncertainties in the market. We are responding to competitive pressure in Europe with an attractive product lineup. Nevertheless, increased competition could have an adverse impact on pricing in specific markets. A number of growth markets are characterized by market regulation measures such as import duties and special taxes. At the same time, we are taking the necessary steps in preparation for stricter CO2 taxation.</p>
          <p>Current uncertainties make it more difficult to predict business developments accurately. We remain cautiously optimistic and continue to make sustained, profitable growth and a sound financial position our priority. We are maintaining our guidance and expect all three brands to achieve record sales. Assuming the global situation does not deteriorate, we forecast record earnings at Group level and in the Automotive segment, as announced in March.</p>
          <p>The EBIT margin for the Automotive segment is likely to be at the high-end of our 8% to 10% target range. We will remain on course and consistently pursue our goals. We are monitoring economic conditions so that we can respond flexibly to volatility.</p>
          <p>And now, ladies and gentlemen, we will be happy to take your questions. Thank you.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Dear ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> One moment, please, for the first question. The first question comes from Ms. Kristina Church from Barclays. Please go ahead, madam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I have a number of questions. The first question relates to excess liquidity. I was just wondering, is &#x20AC;10 billion still the level that you see &#x2013; of gross liquidity that you see as necessary within the business, and what do you think could be a use of any excess cash over and above that level given how comfortably you're sitting right now?</p>
          <p>My second question is just on pricing. It does seem that Europe is your key concern right now, not China as some investors have been focused on. Could you just talk a little bit more on a country level about pricing in Europe, particularly Germany and the UK? What sort of pricing levels are you seeing at the moment? Are you seeing declines there already, or is it still holding firm; you're just worried about the future?</p>
          <p>And then finally on your 8% to 10% margin guidance that's a medium-term range: do you believe that you're in a place to be less cyclical than historically, or is it just that you're at a higher point? I'm just trying to get a feel for, within that 8% to 10%, how low margins could go in down years and how high they could be above that range in good years? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Kristina. Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kristina, thank you for the questions. I'd like to start with the liquidity issue first. Actually we disclosed &#x20AC;12 billion. I think this year a level of &#x20AC;10 billion would be the right number for us. I mean, that's what we need in order to support our rating, as well as the reserve we need to protect the company for the volatility we experienced, for example, in the financial crisis 2008. So that is the level we are targeting. That was the first question.</p>
          <p>Then to run you through the markets, I mean, we all know the situation in Spain and Italy. Just to give you a number, if you look at the market size in Spain and Italy in 2007 and compare it to the market today, it really is only half of it. So we lost 50% of the market. So that's a significant downturn. And of course, this is leading to some pricing pressures at the same point in time as everybody is fighting for the remaining share. So that's what we anticipated to a certain extent. And our main would-be opportunities, especially in overseas markets, the other way to compensate.</p>
          <p>What is more serious is the development in the big markets in Europe like the UK and Germany. So far, Germany is fairly stable. We see some signs of tougher competition. But in UK, there's more weakness to be seen, especially on the pricing front, as compared -- the competition is very aggressive. So that's what we've seen so far. Now, the question is how this will move forward, and that's where we're a bit uncertain for the time being.</p>
          <p>Now, the last question was about the margin range. I mean, as  we always disclosed, for us, it would be a huge achievement and Dr. Reithofer pointed this out, to keep the range going forward stable within 8% to 10%. Of course, the <mark type="ph" /> one model (25:41) year when maybe there's no product momentum available, exchange rate is favorable to us, the markets are pulling and then you could do better. I mean, we demonstrated it last year. And this is something we cannot rule out. But think about 2008 and 2009, we had the opposite. And I would say it could progress as well. But I would say 8% to 10% should be something, in a more or less normal situation, the company should be in a position to achieve this range going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Could I just follow up your &#x2013; the first question on liquidity? If you do have excess levels, what would you see as a use for that excess cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I mean, you know we have 12 &#x2013; now, we have &#x20AC;12 billion and not &#x20AC;10 billion. But you have to see there are maturities in the second quarter. And we did some refunding in order to compensate, so end of the second quarter, my expectation is that we are coming close to the &#x20AC;10 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, thank you very much, Mr. Eichiner. Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Arndt Ellinghorst from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. It's Arndt Ellinghorst, Credit Suisse. I have two questions. The first one is on credit risk and whether you see an increasing risk to restructure your European dealer network in some regions, as you mentioned the weakness, of course, many times now in certain areas of Europe.</p>
          <p>And also, how big could that restructuring be, especially in the light of the fact that you mentioned &#x20AC;16.7 billion dealer financing &#x2013; maximum credit risk from dealer financing in your report. So is that something that we should really worry about? Could that be really a big number moving forward this year?</p>
          <p>And secondly, could you share with us your visibility that you currently have. Would it be fair to assume that you have two to three months visibility roughly? Could you talk a little bit about the second quarter and also whether your production levels in Q2 will be roughly on the same level as in the first quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Arndt Ellinghorst. Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually, our credit loss rate is very low. As you know, it came down to 0.35%. Having said this, we all know that the market in Spain and Italy, for example, is very difficult. We have planned for a restructuring and we grew provisions in the first quarter of 2012 already of around &#x20AC;100 million. We think this should be, from today's  perspective, sufficient. I mean, keep in mind those markets account for 7% to 8% of our portfolio though. So, it's not &#x2013; the issues are not huge credit and leasing markets for us. So, I don't think that it's a huge risk for us, but you never know, right? The situation is worsening and actually as we see it. That was the first point.</p>
          <p>Then your question about production levels in quarter two. We still are in a ramp-up phase of our new products, especially 3 Series, and I expect the number to be higher than in the first quarter of 2012, but are not significantly higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then could you also talk about your order book visibility?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The order book &#x2013; we see weaknesses in the critical markets. So, the order intake in Spain and Italy is not at a level you want to see it. It's as expected in Germany. In the overseas markets, we are not counting order intake, but there, the demand is still strong, very satisfying. We are, for certain models, even short in supply. So that's more on the positive side, and those are big markets like China and U.S. And for the new models like the new 3, the order intake is better than budget.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Good.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Georges Dieng from Natixis. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>Yes. Hello. Good afternoon. So, several questions. First of all, I know that on a quarterly basis, you usually don't go for the walk down of the EBIT for the Auto business. But could you give some indications of &#x2013; on the efficiency gains versus the investment cost and the net pricing that you incurred in the first quarter?</p>
          <p>The second question on the elimination line. I understand the changes that were implemented last year. But when we look at the elimination line in the first quarter, could it be a good proxy for the run rate for the coming quarters?</p>
          <p>And the final question on the upfront investment cost, the &#x20AC;800 million to &#x20AC;1 billion range. Will that charge be evenly spread throughout the years in terms of quarterly sequence? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Georges. This question will be answered by Mr. Eichiner.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start with the pricing issue. I mean, our expectation was that the introduction of the new models, especially the new 3 Series models, it should be possible to improve pricing this year further. For us, this assumption is basically on risk as the market situation in Europe is working against it. In the first quarter, we had a headwind of 50 basis points. So that's what I can say about this.</p>
          <p>Efficiency gains, well, yes, they are coming in. They are related to the introduction of the new models. But our new C Series has a better cost structure as its predecessor. And the more we ramp the volume up, the more it will help us. So we are talking a three-digit million number again, and it's basically supporting our profit target.</p>
          <p>On the upfront investment costs, they are really net costs. We had the burden and it's between &#x20AC;800 million and &#x20AC;1 billion. It has a lot to do with R&amp;D spendings and with the ramp-up of investments in our plants for new technologies, like lightweight construction, carbon fiber, electrification and so on and so forth. That's where the money is going to. And I think we had to swallow the first chunk of around about &#x20AC;200 million in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, the last question was about the consolidation. Well, basically there, in fact, we expect consolidations to make a contribution 2012 that is less negative than in 2011. So the change in the methodology will bring something back to the bottom-line.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Christian Breitsprecher from Macquarie. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon. It's Christian Breitsprecher from Macquarie. I have three questions. One on the 50 basis point headwind in pricing, does that purely refer to the problematic markets in Europe or to your complete Automotive revenue?</p>
          <p>Second point, in terms of the headwind from the 3 Series switchover, is it fair to assume that we have seen the peak of that in the fourth and first quarter this year, or is a similar amount to be expected in the second quarter?</p>
          <p>And the third question I have is on China. I mean, you had a volume growth of about 36% in the first quarter. You're officially talking about a double-digit growth for the full year. Basically, you could have no growth in the rest of the year and you would still end up probably in slightly double-digit growth area. So what should we assume for the rest of the year and what is driving the volume growth? Also in terms of your delivery behavior into that market, would it be fair also for the following quarters to assume a growth above 10%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you very much, Christian. I think we start with the last part of the question, China, and the Chairman with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would like to give you is an overview that you have a feeling where are we at the moment. I think if you see our regions, Europe, Asia and America, then I can say in the first quarter in Europe, retail volumes remained at the same level as last year, around 200,000 units. If I see Asia, our total volume in the first quarter was roughly 118,000 units. That was a plus of 32%. And you mentioned China. It was 80,000 units with a plus of approximately 37%. Then if I move to America, the sales volume was in total, roughly 92,000 units. It was a plus of 15% and the U.S. was about a plus of 17%. That is the growth. That means Europe is still, as one region, ahead of Asia, but Asia is already &#x2013; if I make a rough calculation, the level of 119,000 units, and America is behind with about 92,000 units, only to give you a feeling.</p>
          <p>So then, you ask China. I mean, China, the Chinese passenger car market is estimated to grow by 8% in 2012 to just over 13 million units. However, more restrictive lending in China is likely to act as a brake on investment and consumer spending.</p>
          <p>How we see it, I mean the premium car segment in China will have a two-digit growth rate. And that is true as well for BMW. That is more or less how I see Europe, Americas and Asia. And our strategy, as you know, is to have a balanced growth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'm coming back to your question about the pricing. So the 50 basis points are based on total revenue. In specific markets like Italy and Spain the hit was so much higher, but it was washed out by the very stable markets like China and the U.S. And then your question about the 3 Series, I think that we are definitely through the peak of launch costs, but now there are some remaining issues, for example, on the pricing side. I give you one example: most important overdrive market will get a supply of overdrive 3 Series late in the year, and we have to bridge that gap with the old 3 Series with xDrive. And this has to carry a certain base support; otherwise, it will not work. So, those are the kind of remaining pressure on this side.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Horst Schneider here from HSBC. Just a few questions have been left. I would like to get a feeling for the next few quarters for Financial Services. I mean, we have seen in Q1 some one-off gain related for better sales for cars coming off lease. Should we expect here positive one-offs also in the next few quarters, or is it all over now?</p>
          <p>And in general with regard to residual values, I think we have seen recently in Germany that also here, residual values come a bit under pressure. At least we have seen some news on that in the newspaper. So, do you see a trend that also in Germany now residual values come a bit more under pressure? And with regard to your guidance on production, which could be higher in Q2 than in Q1, does that incorporate already any potential strikes that we see due to the wage negotiations in Germany&gt; Maybe you can update us in general what are your expectation here for that regard? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with production. I said in Q2 slightly higher, that's more or less on the same level, although small differences in production. And of course, if we would have a strike, this would have an influence <mark type="ph" /> in one model once (39:37). And then the question is how quickly we can recover and compensate. So, that's something that's open. But in the areas of plants which are running the 3 Series, I mean, of course we need every 3 Series now, and this definitely would have an influence.</p>
          <p>Now, on your question about the Financial Services business? Well, actually, we see ourselves on the safe side with residual values. I mean, we &#x2013; our residual values setting is very conservative as a consequence of the crisis. In the U.S., for example, we have heavily reduced the number of leased vehicles. So, those are all decisions that help us to stabilize the used car market.</p>
          <p>You know we have problems in Southern Europe but for that we have provisioned, as I explained already today. So our expectation is that this should be a very solid position throughout this year and no extra burden to be expected from this.</p>
          <p>Well, the gains from the maturity business, I think it was a one-off in the first quarter, and we are not expecting further one-offs in that size going forward. We are enjoying a fairly stable margin in the business; that's a positive. And I'm not expecting high-risk positions to come in in the course of the year.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Stuart Pearson from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. Just a couple of questions left as well. Just on the capacity side, obviously, it's an impressive 461,000 units. Just thinking longer term, given the stronger top line growth that you're seeing and I guess that many of us had expected or have been positively surprised, is there any upward pressure longer term to your CapEx targets that you've set out? And when you're thinking about capacity, how soon or what's the latest date by which you'd be able to take the decision on the next phase of capacity expansion in China? Obviously, you have a lot of it in process there, but is by 2013 or 2014 that perhaps you might need to see the next stage in your business plan for China?</p>
          <p>And then just on Brazil, I saw your comments earlier in the press conference, still considering that in the light of the tax changes. If you could update us on your latest thinking there and whether you might consider Mexico or other countries as Audi has recently as a production base for BMW?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, our principle is, as you know,  the production follows the market. So, you're absolutely right; we have to talk about China. But keep in mind we've already taken huge steps forward implementing capacity in China. So this month we will be in China opening our new plant in Tiexi, and this gives us a lot of room to maneuver. Having said this, same point in time, we are planning to increase capacity in our existing plant in Dadong as well. And this should cover the supply we need in China for the next couple of years. And that gives us time to prepare for further decisions. But as I said in the beginning, first, we want to see the potential and then the next capacity decisions will be taken right in time. For the next couple of years, we should be on a safe side in China with the latest investments.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll talk about Brazil, I'll come back to what Dr. Reithofer said. We need to, clearly, to have a business case. We are prepared to go forward. We are prepared to take the investments. But actually, we're still in the negotiation phase. And we need to explore different countries as potential locations for future production sites on a regular basis. This is part of our long-term production growth strategy without there being any definite plans to set up a manufacturing location now. And so, that's where we are.</p>
          <p>Now CapEx, your question about the ratio, well, our ratio last year and in 2010 was quite low. So you know our guidance is less than 7%. We've not been even close to that number. This year, we would be coming closer to the 6%, as a consequence of the investments for future &#x2013; into our future. And this will then hold on in 2013 as well.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Fraser Hill from Bank of America. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Fraser Hill from Bank of America. Just two questions for me. Firstly, on China, could you give us your thoughts on the inventory at the dealer level and also some color on your order books? A lot of speculation in the media that the inventory has grown and order books have almost disappeared. How do you see that from your perspective, maybe with some thoughts on the eastern versus the western territories and perhaps also in terms of your locally produced product versus your imported product?</p>
          <p>The second question would be turning to the Automotive margin for the quarter. On some pretty healthy revenue growth, I mean the drop through was somewhere close to 10%. I guess we would explain part of that with the 50-basis points of pricing headwind that you saw and also a slight pick-up in the R&amp;D. But still, the gearing looks pretty low in terms of the contribution in the first quarter. So what else is kind of holding back the contribution margin there? Is the raw material headwind that you've flagged for the year pretty sizeable in the first quarter or what dynamic are you seeing there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Fraser Hill. The question will be answered by Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, talking about China, I mean, there is a difference between the mass market and the premium market.  The premium market still enjoys fairly stable demand. In certain segments, the competitive pressure is higher, talking about our 7 Series versus S-Class, for example, and we've seen sales allowances coming in. But in the other segment, it's fairly stable.</p>
          <p>So we are not looking at an order book in China because they are selling the cars out of stock. But what we see coming in and the demand from the dealer side for the new cars, especially, for the new 5 Series, for the X5, X3s and those kind of cars is very strong. And then keep in mind that we are now very close to the launch of our new 3 Series. It will be a specific version for China, a long wheelbase car. And I think this will make a difference as well. We are expecting the same effect we've seen for the 5 Series. So overall, as the product portfolio is very fresh in China, we should be in good shape when it comes down to demand, and dealers are really not overstocked.</p>
          <p>There is a difference looking at the western part of China compared to the eastern part.  I mean we've seen some separation in areas like Shanghai and Beijing. And you know about the restrictions there, but the growth opportunities now are more in the western part of China. We have more than 180 cities with more than 1 million inhabitants. And as soon as infrastructure investments are going forward, the car business follows. That's our experience, and our dealer investments are targeted in those areas.</p>
          <p>Now, the question about the margin, well, actually, we see a lot of volatility out there. And as you know, we have a very problematic situation in Italy and in Spain. And as long as it's restricted to the Southern European area, we should be able to compensate. Now, we've seen the first weaknesses in the UK, and we don't know if those spill over to Germany at a later point in time. That's where our concern is. And that's why we say it's too early to change the guidance now.</p>
          <p>We are, to a certain extent, not pessimistic, I would say, because, as you said, we had a strong first quarter. But we don't want to be over-optimistic after three months this year. So, we need more evidence that we go through the European crisis healthy and with a solid margin, and then maybe after the second quarter we can talk again about a possible positive outlook this year. But today, I think it's too early.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Three questions. Firstly, on the revenue per unit, if I look at your revenue growth, it's about 1 percentage point greater than your unit sales growth. If you could just highlight what the export level growth in China  was in Q1. And also, roughly, how do you expect that to develop? To some degree, you've got a negative mix effect coming in China and on the models, but maybe you could give us some more guidance on that?</p>
          <p>Secondly, if I look at the Automotive cash flow, you've got a positive there add back on the provisions, &#x20AC;292 million, a pretty big number. I don't know if any of that relates to the employee payments. I think you have &#x2013; Q2 typically, you get the annual payment. Is it a big chunk on that?</p>
          <p>And then finally, looking at important smaller markets like Russia, Middle East, how are they developing in recent weeks? And what's the order intake for you there? And if you could maybe comment on the talk of the Russian some sort of tax on larger-engine cars in Russia. I don't know if you've got any more update on what that might be. Many thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will give you a couple of examples, including Russia. The first four months, that means including our last calculation for April. That means not the first three months, the first four months. Russia, the figures above plus 45% volume increase. Markets, for example, like Malaysia, above 20%. Thailand, above 40%. Markets like South Korea, roughly 13% plus. Markets like Japan, above 30%. So, you can see, it's not just China. We have a lot of other markets in a good shape as well. And even in Europe, we have markets like the Netherlands, during the first four months, with a plus of above 25%. And of course, we have other markets as well like Spain and Portugal and Italy. They are weak at the moment. So, that is a rough overview from my side.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I want to touch your question about the revenue per vehicle. We've seen an improvement in the first quarter and it's due to, first of all, the performance in overseas markets where we have a strong mix, but secondly also because the currency inflated the revenue number as well. Those were the both factors.</p>
          <p>Now, the provisions, you touched &#x2013; yeah, you're right. I mean, it has to do with HR cost, and it's related to our bonus scheme. That's the major effect in there. And then the question about the ratio between imported and locally produced cars, with the ramp-up of the new 3 Series in China we'll be &#x2013; it would be launched in July, I think the local share of production will grow at a higher speed than imports.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, there. Thanks for taking the question. Just one left for me. And it's just going back to the question of pricing; you touched on the idea that we still had an impact from the 3 Series runout in the first quarter. And I was just wondering if you could perhaps help us: what would the pricing have been without the 3 Series runout? My understanding is that concerning the fourth quarter, the 3 Series runout reduced pricing by sort of 1% to 1.5% or so. So, I mean would we have seen pricing perhaps up by sort of 50 bps or more without the 3 Series runout in the first quarter? Thanks a lot.</p>
