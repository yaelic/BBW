          <p>Thank you, Denita, and good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us for this discussion of Potash Corp.'s first quarter performance. We look forward to providing insight into our record results and also into the global factors that are drawing considerable attention to our industry and our company.</p>
          <p>The issue of global food supply has moved to the forefront in many countries as people are increasingly aware of the long-term need to increase food production. At Potash Corp., we build our company and executed long-term strategies in anticipation of rising global demand for food and along with that fertilizers, especially potash. The benefits are now evident as we are capturing greater value from our world-class assets in potash, nitrogen and phosphate.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, we earned a record $1.74 per diluted share, nearly three times last year's first quarter result of $0.62 per share, which was a record for our company at that time. Gross margin of $856 million was the highest of any quarter in our history and more than double the $370 million in the first quarter of 2007. We also eclipsed past records for cash flow and EBITDA this quarter.</p>
          <p>In addition, our offshore potash investments benefited from these strong market conditions, increasing their contributions and value during the quarter. We see this as just the beginning, as the fundamental drivers behind our performance have now firmly taken hold giving us the opportunity to deliver even greater returns for our investors.</p>
          <p>At the heart of this is the increasing global demand for more and better food. The world's population continues to grow, especially in many Asian countries, and those same countries are enjoying an ongoing surge of economic growth. Hundreds of million of people around the world now have higher incomes and the first thing they want to spend that money on is more nutritious, protein rich food.</p>
          <p>We are seeing the impact not only in the growing demand for our life-giving nutrients, but in the faces of people as we visit key markets around the world. This incredibly positive human development story is providing people in developing nations with their first opportunity to dramatically improve their lives.</p>
          <p>But it is also putting tremendous pressure on the world's food supply. Over the past decade, grain consumption has grown at a much greater pace than increases in food production. In eight of the past nine years, including this year, the world has consumed more grain than farmers have produced. This has gone largely unnoticed by global leaders and the public, because countries were able to meet food demand by drawing from inventories, keeping food prices artificially low.</p>
          <p>Now the cupboard is almost bare, and concerns about the world's food supply and food inflation are daily headline news. While we have been largely insulated from this in North America, earlier this week the United Nations called the pending food crisis a silent tsunami that knows no borders. It is suggested millions of people on every continent will feel the pain of hunger, a situation that threatens the peace, happiness and security of us all.</p>
          <p>This crisis can be averted, but it will take a commitment to intensive farming practices and proper fertilization. It is not a short-term issue that can be resolved in a single growing season. Given the expected growth in food consumption, farmers will need to produce a record crop each and every year just to meet the world's demand, and this assumes no major production problems in key growing regions.</p>
          <p>We have a new long-term reality, and the world must work diligently to increase food production and begin the slow process of rebuilding grain inventories to ensure food is readily available and affordable. Today this is underway, as many countries have come to the realization that fertilizer equals food. This is driving unprecedented demand for potash, nitrogen and phosphate, which are essential to increasing crop yields and quality.</p>
          <p>As a result, supply of all three nutrients is extremely tight. This is especially true of potash, which has historically been under applied in many regions. Significant catch up is required to improve soil fertility, but available supply is limited. potash producers around the world have been working to de-bottleneck their operations and expand their capacities. But even operating full-out, our industry is challenged to keep pace with demand. Developing new production takes a long time, a lot of money, and an expertise that few possess. These limitations are leading to significantly higher prices offshore, and in North America.</p>
          <p>Last week Canpotex, the offshore marketing company for Saskatchewan potash producers, announced a price and volume agreement with Sinofert in China for the remainder of 2008. The new deal raised prices to China by $400 per ton. Annual volumes have been reduced by 1.5 million tons to 40% of the previous levels because of strong global demand, late signing of the contract and limitations on supply. This shortfall is obviously a concern for the Chinese, who are working hard to stave off staggering food inflation in their country. Further, it is expected to leave them with extremely low potash inventories by year end, creating potential supply concerns for 2009.</p>
          <p>Price increases have taken hold in all other key markets as well as Canpotex recently announced spot market prices of $750 per ton for Brazil and $725 for South East Asia starting in June. On Tuesday, the Belarusian Potash Company announced its intention to raise spot prices to these regions to $1,000 per ton on July 1. That demonstrates the tightness of the market and the value that potash is commanding. The bottom line is that the world needs more potash, and this is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>The combination of strong demand and rising prices pushed our first quarter potash gross margin to a record $515 million, almost triple the 174 million in last year's first quarter. We now anticipate our potash gross margin for 2008 will be at least three and a half times last year's total. Added to this, we are generating record gross margin in nitrogen and phosphate.</p>
          <p>Food production concerns led China to recently announce export taxes in excess of 100% on all fertilizers. The intent is to keep more of these essential products within its borders. While this is suppressing domestic nitrogen and phosphate prices in China, it is having the opposite effect globally. Urea prices have increased by more than $150 per ton since the news broke almost 2 weeks ago.</p>
          <p>In recent months, numerous governments have suggested political solutions to the global problem of food security. History has shown, however, that export bans and tariffs are often counterproductive and that distorting the market ultimately does more harm than good. The only real way to fight food inflation and increase food security is to grow more food. Farmers around the world must be motivated to increase production and will do so when they see the reward. The answer lies in agricultural fields on every continent and fertilizers will be an important part of the solution. To ensure we do our part, Potash Corp. is taking aggressive steps to increase our potash production capabilities. We are the only company with the ability to significantly increase potash production over the next five years. By doing this, we can contribute to global food production while capitalizing on our unique strength in our core nutrient.</p>
          <p>A series of expansions in Saskatchewan and New Brunswick are expected to raise our operational capacity nearly 50% to 15.7 million tons by the end of 2012 and up to 17.2 million tons by 2015. The next of these to come on stream is at our Lanigan operation where our project to raise annual capacity by 1.5 million tons will be completed early this summer. Later this year, our 360,000 ton project at Patience Lake is also scheduled to be completed. This will give us an ability to capture a significant portion of new potash demand going forward. In addition to benefiting from higher volumes and prices, we expect to realize cost efficiencies as volumes rise.</p>
          <p>We estimate second quarter earnings of $2.20 to $2.50 per share. We've also raised our full-year guidance by nearly 50% for 2008 to $9.50 to $10.50 per share.</p>
          <p>These conditions have us very excited about the future. This is the environment that we have anticipated for two decades and we are prepared to deliver new levels of performance in the future. More than that, we will play an integral role in helping farmers keep pace with the global demand for food. With our unmatched ability to provide more of the essential nutrients needed around the world, we look forward to having a significant and positive impact on the global food story. As we do this, we intend to capture the full value for our shareholders who have supported our growth and development over the years.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your interest in Potash Corporation today. I'm joined by members of our senior management team so we'll open this up and answer your questions.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen we will now conduct a Question and Answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from Don Carson of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Bill, a question on potash pricing I guess essentially, how far and how fast can pricing rise, a couple of specifics. You mentioned, that you'd posted or Canpotex had posted 7.50 granular price in Brazil effective June 1, BPC is out with 1,050 on July 1. Would you raise your price to match that? And then could you also address the issue of affordability by your customers in terms of what constraints, if any, that puts on pricing over the next several years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right Don, thank you. I think affordability is the real question here because we know potash is short, so potash is going to be price allocated as we go forward for the foreseeable future. In terms of payback, if you look &#x2013; we just did an analysis, an updated analysis on the basis of today's grain prices and fertilizer prices. And if you look at just three examples from around the world: a corn farmer in the US today for every dollar spent on fertilizer gets $3 back. An Indian wheat farmer gets $7.60 back for every dollar spent on fertilizer. Pretty compelling economics I would say in both cases. Still looking around the world, in Indonesia, palm oil producer, $9 back for every dollar spent on fertilizer. So with record high grain prices and edible oil prices, the affordability is certainly there.</p>
          <p>How fast and how far on potash, you know, in my opinion we've been moving at a good speed. We have a $200 increase through the Canpotex organization for Southeast Asia and Brazil, taking it up to $725 for a ton of standard in Indonesia from 525; and a similar type increase up to 750 for granular in Brazil.</p>
          <p>You saw the announcement, as I commented on in my remarks from the BPC. For July 1 &#x2013; what I would say about that is I think we're going to get there. I think we're going to get to 1,000. July 1 might be a little bit quick. We tend to remember our customers in this company. And I think that you have to go at this from a reasonable gradual approach to the marketplace. And we'd rather have them understand what we're doing, give them time to digest, give them time to plan. It's very, very important that we always keep the customer first and foremost.</p>
          <p>So, I do think we're heading towards $1,000 a ton. When we get there remains to be seen. I don't see it happening July 1 after a rather large increase June 1, but it's coming and it won't be all that long. But we're going to give our customers plenty of time to be able to adjust. It will still be a shock to some of them, believe me.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Jacob Bout of CIBC World Markets. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a question on global inventory levels and where you see it for producers but also for the retailers as well. And just, provide a bit of color here in light of China being out of the market for essentially a third of 2008. Is there any indication that there's been hoarding in other places of the world, in particular in Brazil for potash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, Jake. Thank you. What I'll tell you is that global inventory levels for potash, both at the consumer and the producer level are extremely low. China had the best inventory position going into 2008. Better than some producers. But by not really being in tune with the market, they squandered that inventory relatively quickly and ended up really putting themselves behind the eight ball with delayed negotiations which will impact the potash negotiations in China for 2009, because China is going to go out this year short.</p>
          <p>We think as much as 3 million tons short in China alone before the end of 2008. A staggering figure and a staggering turnaround. China should have been the first in line and they ended up being the last in line; not a very smart position.</p>
          <p>And I would tell you the reason for that is because of the government involvement in the purchasing process. There was a buying consortium in China in which there were nine member companies that paralyzed the negotiating process when the commercial companies, the companies that deal with it everyday, Sinofert and CNAMPGC, who know the business, who know the market, were anxious to close as early as last fall, were prohibited from doing so because of the paralysis placed upon the effort by the buying consortium. So really did a disservice to China and I think its going to have repercussions for the foreseeable future, including 2009 negotiations.</p>
          <p>In terms of hoarding potash around the world, I can tell you that nobody minds having inventory in their warehouses. Hoarding is a little bit tough when everyone's on allocations. And when I say everyone, it's both in North America and in the market offshore. We don't have anybody that's able to take any excess and hoard it because it's just simply not available.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Edlain Rodriguez of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Bill, you noted that there's no short-term solution to the current grain crisis tightness that we're seeing now. But is there a fear that some might be tempted to take the easy way out and propose solutions to the food and fuel battle in terms of ethanol strategy and policies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know Edlain, I think that ethanol is the most popular whipping boy in the agricultural world at the moment, but I think it's a very convenient whipping boy. Because when you look at the numbers it doesn't add up. 95% of the total grain crop worldwide this year will go into food. So to say that bio-fuels is the culprit clearly underestimates the demand and really shows a gross misunderstanding of the world food situation.</p>
          <p>Clearly, in North America, it's more an issue because of the percentage of the corn crop that will go into ethanol, but what I would say is, what I've read criticism-wise of it, it's a very short-term approach. It doesn't mean that if we had some sort of major drought, in this country this year, that the government shouldn't back off a little bit from the ethanol program that it has in place. But for a long-term solution, in this world, and certainly within North America, we need all energy sources. And we have the technology with fertilizer and seed and best management practices to grow all the food we need for both food, fiber, fuel, and animal feed. So I think a little bit longer-term approach is necessary when you're talking about bio-fuels.</p>
          <p>But I just came back from two weeks in Asia and I can tell you that there wasn't one bio-fuel discussion with any customer. It's just not an issue in Asia. I mean if you think about rice, which we all know with the story is there when you see Costco and Wal-Mart limiting purchases of rice in this country, which is just unbelievable, there isn't a grain of rice that's used in bio-fuels. It's all food demand.</p>
          <p>And it's a very, very serious situation which is being exacerbated by governments doing exactly the opposite of what they should do. By limiting exports of rice, they've tried to keep the price of rice low in their home country, which doesn't give any stimulus to farmers to grow more rice. We have to grow more food; we have to increase yields.</p>
          <p>And governments who have been asleep on this issue until just recently &#x2013; we have been talking about this issue, stocks-to-use ratio, the world grain supply, for years. Every speech that we've given, we've talked about this situation. Governments finally wake up to the problem, they go into a flat panic, full-lather, and they make policies that are absolutely wrong-headed and are making the situation worse, not better. So bio-fuels is the convenient program to blame. But when you look at it from any type of serious analysis, it just doesn't add up.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Dave Silver of JPMorgan. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I had a question on the Chinese export tariff situation. So Bill as you pointed out there's substantial tariffs now on urea and also on DAP, and you noted the big move in the urea price since those tariffs became apparent or perceived in the market. I'm a little surprised, or I was wondering if you were surprised that phosphate pricing has moved relatively little since then and if you think that the price of DAP has room to move higher maybe in conjunction with the big moves we've seen recently in potash pricing and in urea.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right Dave, I'm going to ask Dave Delaney to answer that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes David, this news obviously is really big in the marketplace. We think with the 135% export tax on phosphate it will take 2.2 million tons of MAP and DAP out of the market between April and September. Obviously the world is still short of P205 with the Indian settlements just completed at $1985. We think the Indians are still short of phosphate. They ended their crop year here in March with only 222,000 tons of DAP in inventory. They produced only 4.2 last year, they used about 7.2, so we think they will need another 1 million tons between now and March.</p>
          <p>The Brazilians bought up to 1 million tons last year; they're going to be short. So I do think with the current market and with these tonnages taken out that there is room for DAP and MAP price to go up. From am aggregate standpoint, there's about 1.8 million tons of urea exported from China from that April through September and obviously there's been a quick reaction there. And I think again, India being the big consumer in the world will likely need between 6 and 7 million tons and will have trouble sourcing that I think this year. It's very tight.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Bill, obviously Potash Corp has been ahead of the curve strategically on a lot of its own competitive positioning. I wonder if you could comment on where we might be going over the next say five or six years in terms of Canpotex and BPC. Do you see with the shifts in emerging market growth, Potash Corp's tonnage heading in a different direction? Are we going to be selling less into Northern Asia and more into Latin America? Is BPC and Canpotex going to run into each other less often? I'm just trying to think four or five years out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mark. I would say four to five years out you're going to see more former Soviet Union potash used in the former Soviet Union. There's a big food demand situation. They've also done some things government-wise on the food side and you're going to see more of that used closer. You're already seeing it this year. Part of the reason why they're so stretched is more of their potash is going internally and we think there's a lot of growth within Russia, former Soviet Union in terms of grain production but they've got to start using fertilizer to get back to anything close to where they were in their supposed glory days. So what 'd tell you is that Canpotex is going to be the main supplier for offshore markets looking out five years from now.</p>
          <p>I don't think that we'll be short of competition but I do think that you're going to see Canpotex take the lion's share of the growth primarily because Potash Corp is going to be bringing all this new tonnage on. If you think, we're bringing a million tons more this year to the market than we brought last year, next year we'll add another million and you can just add a million a year for the next five years. There isn't anybody else in the world that can do that so we're going to take the lion's share of the growth through Canpotex and you're going to see a greater percentage of our product go overseas because the overseas market is going to grow faster. But at the same time, my hunch is that we will also grow in the domestic market just because there's going to be a stretch for some of our friends within the Canpotex organization to be able to keep up with offshore growth. It's just capacity constraints that we're now seeing globally within the potash supply demand picture.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, guys. Bill just on terms of the full-year guidance, it is a two-part question. First, I just want to confirm that, I know you talked about July 1st maybe looking a little soon for the $1,000 a ton but in the guidance, I just want to confirm you're not including $1,000 a ton for Q4, that would be first. The second part is in terms on the phosphate, are you able to share at all what you're expecting on the phosphate costing picture, at least for the rest of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to split that up, I'm going to let David take the phosphate side of it and I'll answer the guidance question on potash. The answer to your question is no. We don't have $1,000 in our guidance for fourth quarter. Dave, you want to take the phosphate part?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the cost side on the phosphate, we just had a $200 price increase in sulfur here for Q2 and we do have, we're projecting a further increase in Q3, Q4. I don't want to anticipate what that may be at this point. We're hoping that it doesn't go up a lot but we do know the international market's been fairly strong. And also we see ammonia prices the balance of the year probably bottoming out, pretty close to the bottom right now, at 5.50 in Tampa and likely going up in the fourth quarter.</p>

          <p>Yes, good afternoon. It looks like, if we look on a year-over-year basis for the March quarter in your potash businesses in North America, the volume's up around 8% and your off shore volumes were up around 24% year-over-year. You've obviously seen what's going on in April and I was just wondering any comments that you can make on, maybe, whatever basis you'd like, a comparison either sequentially or year-over-year. How you think volumes are going to work out for those two particular segments of the potash business, please?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, Mike. I would say that split that you gave, it's actually 23%, I think offshore, 8% domestic up. I think that's probably a fair split going forward. The offshore market continues to grow and our position in it because of competitor's being sold out around the world. We're going to take a bigger share of the gross. So, that's probably a fair number going forward.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Bill. We hear a lot about a new potash supply but I just want to ask you about the potential for depletion and whether there're any mines that could possibly be depleting and running out of supply sometime in the future? And also, I just want to ask about the $1000 per ton. I just want to make sure that that's conservative on your part that you're not reflecting on your guidances. Not because you don't think it's not going to happen. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll answer the first part, or the second part of that on the price side and then I'm going to ask Garth to come in about depletions around the world. In terms of the $1,000, it's conservative in our forecast. You know as I said we're going to get there &#x2013; we just put a $200 increase Fai, in for June so to go to $1000 that would be another 300 on top of that for July and we'd like them to drink out of the drinking fountain rather than a fire hose. So we're going to give them just a little bit of time to adjust here but as I said, I think we'll get there. We're conservative in the forecast on the $1000. Garth, do you want to comment on depletion of potash around the world?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Fai, I don't think there's anything &#x2013; none of the operations in Saskatchewan or any of the big operations around the world or in Russia, or Germany or anywhere else have any depletion problems over the foreseeable future. As you're probably aware, in Belarus they're sinking a couple new shafts into the new ore body</p>
          <p>to feed just ore to the existing number one operation they have there. But that's just replacement tons rather than increased tons. As well, there's no new production coming out, no new greenfield production coming on anywhere in the world within the next five years. So I think it's pretty stable as we go forward.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Got a question regarding elasticity demand with respect to grains. With grain prices being up as much as they are over the last couple of years, do you have any concerns that could possibly impact demand for grains particularly in developing countries and in particularly for those people that are still below the poverty line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, I'll tell you. Again having just come back from Asia, governments are going to make sure that people eat. The one thing that they're worried about is civil unrest and especially in these big population centers, India, China. They're going to make sure that their people get food and they will subsidize the food itself. I'm not so sure that, that's a good program because free food is proven to be a bane for increasing food yields around the world.</p>
          <p>I listened one night to a presentation from the governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka who said a very simple &#x2013; made a very simple statement when asked about food. And he said very simply, food is something which without we can not live, pretty profound statement but I just don't see people cutting back on food or cutting back on grains, even at high prices, and that's why the elasticity of demand for our products we have said for years and years and years that demand for potash is inelastic. If we double the price, which, you know, if you look at what's gone on here over the last year and some of the prognosis for the future, I mean you certainly could say that that has been accomplished. If you double, the price farmers don't use half as much. If you cut the price in half, they are not going to use twice as much, so just they are going to use what they need and again they haven't been doing it for scientific reasons.</p>
          <p>If you are looking for scientific reasons, they should be increasing their consumption but they haven't been doing it really because, I would say governments around the world have had cheap food policies and have not been supportive of farm incomes and farmers, boy, they are some of the best economists that I know because they get the risk-reward profile pretty quickly and they responds to higher grain prices and that's the answer, you got to let the market work. And as I said we have the technology to produce all the food we need but we've got to let the market signals work and give stimulus to increased yields and increased farm productivity around the world.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for letting me ask a question Bill. My question is to do with the press release, I think that in there you have indicated that Canpotex is sold out pretty much for the rest of the year. Is it fair to say that these are committed, but unpriced tons, which basically signals how tight the market is? And what do you think Potash Corp can ship this year in terms of potash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Brian, what I'd say is Canpotex is committed to tons. They are not committed to price throughout the year. They have obviously sold tonnage here through May and have actually sold some new tonnage at the &#x2013; at the higher levels, at the 725 level in Asia, so they are not committed for price for the rest of the year and we'll see what, where that takes us. And they are definitely committed, there's every trip, every stop we made on this most recent trip, there was a request for more tonnage. Not one customer wanted less and it's just a reflection of how tight this situation is around the world and the fact that other suppliers don't have it so we're filling in a big gap here now that exists because the market has grown so much. In terms of, what was the other half of the question? David do you have it?</p>

The question is I realize that Potash Corp. just completed a stock split in 2007, given the rise in the stock price above $200; will you consider another stock split in the immediate future? Really can't comment Evan, on if or when we might split the stock. We've done it a couple times and it's magic, it's a little bit of feel and timing and when you think the right time to do it, and if it's time, but I don't think you have to worry about it in the very near future.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, operator. The committee presentation, and some of the questions I think I want to get into the topic of the yields because yes, farmers got all the incentive to buy as much as possible because for the return per ton of per dollar of fertilizer, however, anyone makes the assumption that the farmers are successful this year, apply as much as they could to the field. The question really is, is it a comfort level that they could not apply all they could because of the allocation or bottlenecks as a result the yields will not be there and the tons will not be there as a result, there's more catch-up for next year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think Terry you hit a good point. Because it's been under applied, especially potash, under applied for so many years that they are moving ahead quickly. Of course this all science and the law of the limited which is the nutrient in least supply affects the efficacy of the other two primary nutrients. So in other words, if you have enough nitrogen in your NPK formula and phosphate and not enough potash, you're going to impact utilization of nitrogen and phosphate by the plant. So you've got to have the right balance to get nutrient utilization.</p>
          <p>So we're seeing a push because people realize now that potassium has been the limiting nutrient and, with very tight supply, I don't see all of these countries being able to catch up all at once. So it's something that's going to take years to correct and why we see the pressure continuing on potash supply going forward, we talked, Mark earlier asked about the five-year outlook. We see this increasing growth at a much higher rate than we've had historically for potash because of the catch up needed to be able to raise yields around the world. So that's a very good point.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. On the last Mosaic conference call the management talked about sulfur supply and demand and said that over the next, oh, I don't know, two years the price of sulfur might collapse because of new supply coming on stream. Is that something that you agree with? And how do you think the price of sulfur plays on the price of DAP over the next two years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to ask Tom Regan who's here, who heads up our phosphate operations, to talk about sulfur. Tom?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As far as like the direct correlation between sulfur and DAP, essentially sulfur price divided by two is how much money you have in DAP. Now as far as supply or collapse in price, I think everybody's of the opinion that the supply of sulfur will increase. I think maybe there's some disagreement as to how quickly that will happen. As Dave mentioned earlier in the conference here, sulfur went up $200 in the second quarter. We do expect that this will continue throughout the year and really the key is supply. And we feel very good about our supply situation throughout this year and that will be the key for the next two years. As heavy crude projects come on into the refineries, we do see the supply situation improve.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you. With the exception of the pop in international urea prices triggered recently by China's tariffs, nitrogen has really been very flat in the last few months quite unlike phosphate and potash. I found Dave Delaney's remarks interesting about his expectation that ammonia will go up in the fourth quarter. Can you just drill down into that a little bit more? What are your customers telling you about their interest in getting nitrogen once their storage tanks are depleted? Is this a case where the markets are truly balanced or is this just the channel is stuffed full and that we won't see a change until refilling starts and maybe there will be an increase in prices at that point? What are you looking for in nitrogen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right Steve, I'm going to have David follow-up on his earlier comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, the nitrogen market already was pretty tight. I think reason for the lull in the last 60 days mainly in North America, it's been cold and wet and we've been delayed. But I think with the China news and the appetite that India has, we know Brazil has a lot to buy. And I think we're going to empty out this North American system here by June. We've got to buy a lot of nitrogen, Europe's got to buy. We've already seen interest here in April for urea and UAN as well as ammonia and those prices are, from a UAN standpoint, are up to $150 ahead of last year's price. Transactions that have been completed, we see urea today at 510, the forward markets above 500, and as well as the forward markets on ammonia above $500. So natural gas prices are higher, over $10 for the summer months. You see high energy prices in Europe, former Soviet Union coupled with China not exporting. And these appetites I just think you've got a real huge demand for nitrogen and concern over supplies. So I see nitrogen remaining strong the balance of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, I'd add that the premium for producers who have low-cost gas is going to come to the fore again. Because you have extraordinarily high prices coming at us in North America, Europe, even former Soviet Union countries are going to see big ratchets up in their natural gas costs. We've had a little bit of a lull here with lower North American gas prices. But you keep your eye on that because the low hanging fruit's been picked and we're going to see some real differentiation in nitrogen producers with those who have low cost gas.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Just a couple of quick questions. Year-to-date and plus commitments, what has India taken on potash and the same for Brazil as far as we know?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Dave, do you have those numbers here today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On potash in Brazil, we have shipped from Canpotex 614,000 tons. Last year, they took 1.9. We are not committed on price past June. So, we think Brazil as a country will take 7.5 million tons of potash this year. India, the contract Canpotex signed was for 1.3 million tons. Year-to-date through March they've taken 384,000 tons. So, part of that was the old contracts, and most of that new contract is yet to ship.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The number on Brazil, of course, he gave you a year-to-date number and the 1.9 was a annual number for last year. This year, we think Brazil's going to be somewhere around 2.3 for us. Total Brazil this year could reach as high as 7.5, up from 6.7 last year. So, we don't see, if you look around the world, Charlie, there's not one country that's reducing or even staying stagnant. They're just pushing and pushing and pushing and it's all food-demand related.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Bill, I'll make it a big picture question. If hypothetically, of course this is pure hypothetics, that the world was using the ideal amount of NPK and balance, did any of your scientists or agronomists kind of kick around as to what food yields could be? And I guess in tandem with that, if the world did agree under the Doha Round in year 6 now to some massive reduction of subsidies and barriers and tariffs that you're suggesting, indirectly or directly on the planet, where would the efficiency of food growth and yield go to?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sam, I'm sorry about that. We'll have to put some new ones in there. If you look at yields, you have to really look at different examples from different countries. But if you think about China, think about corn yields in China. China is getting about half the corn yield right now per acre as the United States. The reason is because they have this tremendous imbalance so if you think about what the scientists say in terms of just look at the big three, Brazil, India and China. Current consumption in those three countries in terms of imports about 14 million tons last year going to 28 million tons is the folks, so more than double where we are right now. That's just those three countries.</p>
          <p>Then you throw in a country like, we'll just take maybe two together, the palm oil guys in Malaysia and Indonesia, that market this year is going to be somewhere 3.2 to 3.5 million tons between the two of them. Very rapid growth, 40% growth here over the last 18 months in those two markets and growing further so what I say is if you look by crop and start looking at the individual countries, I could give you, it's a long winded question so I'm not going to go through the detail on it but clearly there's a lot of room to grow literally, yields around the world and as I said, we have the technology to be able to answer this food, global food problem. Fertilizer is a crucial part of the solution; obviously we need...</p>

          <p>Stann, are you still on the line? All right if not, I guess everybody just got tired of that answer and we blew up the line here. But the answer is that we can grow a lot more grain, but we're going to need a lot more fertilizer to be able to do it. And we're going to be able to supply that. We're going to let the markets work and everyone will just be fine, but it's not something we can solve in the next couple years. It's a long term problem. Denita?</p>
