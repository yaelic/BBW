        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our Half-Year Conference. We posted very strong results for the first 6months. Sales ahead of the market, and we delivered a record operating profit for the first 6 months.</p>
          <p>We are, however, disappointed about the recent setback in our pipeline. We are disappointed about the delay of taspoglutide, and we are very disappointed about the ODAC's recommendation few days ago.</p>
          <p>So let me make 2 introductory comments in this respect. First of all, the market environment is getting more challenging, and we have had these setbacks in our pipeline. This is a reality. We cannot deny this reality. We have to proactively adapt to this reality. And that means an even more rigorous focus on operational excellence, on our cost structures, on further improving our operational productivity.</p>
          <p>And you see this already very much reflected in the first 6 months of this year. A tight management on all our cost lines across the organization. We are also fully on track to deliver our synergy target related to the Genentech transaction.</p>
          <p>Now, second, let me also point out, in spite of these setbacks, we do have one of the leading product pipelines in the industry. We have more than 10 new molecular entities in the late-stage pipeline. We have more than over 30 line extensions in the late-stage pipeline. And this is the basis of our long-term success. And I do believe that the filing of T-DM1, which we just did this month in July, it's an assessment and a testimony to the excellence in science we want to pursue.</p>
          <p>Now, let me go quickly through the figures, which you have already seen this morning. Pharma, 6 percentage points up in local currency, if you exclude Tamiflu; primarily driven as in the past by the oncology portfolio, up 9%, but also strong performance in Lucentis. And importantly, a very good start on the Actemra side in the U,S and outside of the US which is starting to have an impact on our top-line.</p>
          <p>Diagnostics, an excellent result for the first 6 months, 9% growth. This is twice the market growth which we estimate to grow at about 4 to 5%; which gives us 5% growth on the Group level including Tamiflu, and 6% excluding Tamiflu.</p>
          <p>We did have a record result on an operating profit level. You see this also reflected in the strong margin improvement, driven by both Divisions primarily on a Group level by the productivity improvements in the Pharma division. And here again, the synergies from the Genentech transaction and the various initiatives underway are starting to kick-in.</p>
          <p>This is also reflected in the core EPS which has grown in local currencies by 11% versus the previous year.</p>
          <p>And again, as I said in my introduction, the core for the long-term success of this company will be the quality of our pipeline. And in spite of the recent setbacks which we have, in spite of the delay with taspoglutide and in spite of the ODAC recommendation, I do believe and I'm convinced that we have a very, very strong pipeline, where it is worthwhile to invest into the pipeline which will drive the success in the future.</p>
          <p>We did announce to you that we will have a flat and slightly decreased development on the R&amp;D side. And you see this already coming through in the first 6 months. And we stick to our guidance in this regard.</p>
          <p>We also confirmed this morning our double-digit core EPS growth. We do face some stronger headwinds as we go into the second half of this year. Certainly, the effect from the US Healthcare Reform, the austerity measures in Europe, we are starting to feel them. But we have planned this into our guidance, and we stick to our guidance as we go forward for the full year.</p>
          <p>We stick our guidance in terms of core EPS growth. The same is true on the sales side, with a mid single-digit growth for Pharma and the Group. We expect to continue to significantly outgrow the market in Diagnostics.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, we are on track for our synergy targets.</p>
          <p>And on the balance sheet side, actually due to the strong cash flow over the last 12 months, we decided to recall US$2.5 billion bonds. Which actually means that by the end of this year, we will already have paid off a third of our debt related to the Genentech transaction. And we will maintain our dividend policy as announced.</p>
          <p>With this, I'd like to hand over to Pascal Soriot. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Severin. Good afternoon, everybody. It is a pleasure to be here today and report to you on very, very good first half of this year. Of course, unfortunately tend to negatively by the decision of the ODAC a few days ago, as Severin mentioned. And we'll come back to this in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>But if we start with our sales results at the end of June as you saw in the release that came out a little bit earlier, we experienced very good growth in constant currency, 6% excluding Tamiflu. So very much in line with our guidance for the year. A very strong first half. And I have to say what is very pleasing to see here is that the International region is actually the biggest contributor to growth in absolute value.</p>
          <p>In every region, we actually grew faster than the market. And as you can see International, where quite often people would ask us the question "are you able to grow in the emerging markets with the kind of prices you have, innovative drugs, yes, but expensive also and then maybe they are too expensive for those countries", here is the demonstration once more that we can succeed in those countries.</p>
          <p>You will see here out of the 6% for the first 6 months, we had 8% growth for the first quarter and 3% for the second quarter. In there is a reflection of the increasing impact of healthcare reform and price reductions in Europe in the second quarter. But also the fact that as we reported at the end of quarter one, we had the so called Easter's sales effect, in particular in Europe, where contrary to past years, the &#x2013; or because of the timing of Easter, we ended up having sales recorded at the end of March, which typically historically would have been recorded in April. And that balance is one &#x2013; from one quarter to another. And as I said, the impact of the healthcare reform around the world.</p>
          <p>From a profitability view point, we had a growth of profit of about 9%, thanks to, as Severin said a minute ago, very good cost control. And of course, some of it comes from the synergies that we generated out of the merger with Genentech. But I will be remiss if I didn't also mention the hard work of my colleagues around the world in the various regions, and also in the global functions managing those costs. Because we didn't make a big announcement like many of our colleagues or peers in the industry, big restructuring announcement. But believe me, we are hard &#x2013; we work very hard at those costs, and we've managed them. And we will keep managing them very, very carefully.</p>
          <p>As you can see here, our commercial investment is stable. Our R&amp;D investment is not growing much, and we had a substantial decrease in our G&amp;A expenses. All resulting into a &#x2013; in a 9% increase of operating profit at constant rate.</p>
          <p>Now even more striking here is the increase in margin that many of you, I know, have been requesting for some time. So I'm sure you're going to be pleased to see that this is happening. A very substantial increase from 39% last year to 41% of sales for the first 6 months of this year. So we certainly are driving those margins very diligently.</p>
          <p>Now if I spend a couple of minutes talking about the impact of healthcare reforms. I was saying a minute ago that the impact of that is increasing in the second quarter. And we expect an even greater impact, of course, in the second half of the year. Because the price reductions in Europe are really starting to kick-in in second quarter, and in fact, mostly in the second half, in particular in Germany.</p>
          <p>And in the US, the impact of healthcare reform is growing, and certainly will be even greater next year as the excise tax, as you know, starts kicking in.</p>
          <p>But the impact on the first half was a little bit less than 1% of our sales growth rate. We expect more, as I said, in the second half. And for the whole year, you could expect that the full impact on our global pharmaceutical sales would be in the range of 1.5 to 2% of our total sales for the whole year.</p>
          <p>Now I know that you are often interested in getting a sense for whether our products are still growing. And of course, as I said a minute ago from one quarter to the other, we have this effect of healthcare on prices and also the so-called Easter sales effect. So some of our products have flat growth from quarter-to-quarter.</p>
          <p>So I wanted to show you here, the in-market consumption, if you wondered. These are not perfect numbers, because they are, of course, a new market panel reflecting the usage for -- of our drugs. You can see here Avastin, Lucentis on the two top graphs. And you can see those two compounds, those two products are still growing. And very much so for Lucentis. Very strong growth for Lucentis.</p>
          <p>And you can also see here that both Herceptin and MabThera are showing slow growth very much inline with what we told you for the United States. Low single-digit growth rate for MabThera, Herceptin in the US, and also to some extent in Europe. And the growth on the global basis will be driven by the International region.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we expect that gastric will help us a bit both in the US and in Europe for Herceptin and certainly the maintenance indication should at some point in time help us drive those Rituxan sales in the US.</p>
          <p>Now the late-stage pipeline, of course, we are certainly very disappointed with the delay in the Taspoglutide filing, and we certainly can come back to this in more details during the Q&amp;A. I'm sure you'd like to do this.</p>
          <p>And also by the negative ODAC. I have to say we stand by the data and we stand by the -- our belief that Avastin is useful to patients in the treatment of first-line metastatic breast cancer. And we will be continuing the dialogue with the US FDA.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we are clearly focused on innovation. And we have to accept that as part of this focus, this strategic focus on innovation, we're not going to be successful 100% of the time. We have had a very high positive strike rate in the last year or two, where almost every single study, new product or indication worked. And from time-to-time we have to be ready to experience some setbacks.</p>
          <p>But when you look at the totality of the portfolio, we also have very strong news here. We filed for the prevention of structural joint damage for Actemra on the back of very strong data. We filed in the US and Japan for gastric cancer with Herceptin. Very importantly, we filed for maintenance Rituxan/MabThera in -- around the world. And this is an indication that would currently help us in Europe, in the US, but also around the world where we have a lot of potential with MabThera. I believe, in the emerging regions that we need to unlock on the strength of the clinical signal and the maintenance in this data is going to be helping us getting better access for MabThera.</p>
          <p>We filed T-DM1, as Severin mentioned a minute ago. This is clearly a very exciting development for us. First of all, this filing was certified as a BLA. And it's a very important decision because it means that T-DM1 will now benefit from the 12 years of data protection that goes with the BLA. That means that if the drug was approved in 2011, we would have data protection until 2023 in the United States, which is past the patent expiry of T-DM1. The other good news is that it has &#x2013; it is potentially a fast-track application, and we may get approval by the end of this year or early next year. And that reflects the strength of the clinical data we have submitted.</p>
          <p>And finally and very importantly -- very importantly because it is to some extent linked to the discussion around first-line metastatic breast cancer, we have filed for second-line metastatic breast cancer in the United States with RIBBON-2. As you may remember, this is already filed in Europe, and we are waiting to hear from the EMA about this indication.</p>
          <p>Now if I quickly look at the development of our sales from a franchise-by-franchise basis. First of all, Oncology, they grew by 9% in local currency, driven by Avastin. And you can see here 14%. MabThera at 15. And Avastin is still driven by colorectal cancer in many parts of the world, and breast cancer. MabThera, we have seen some early signs of growth driven by CLL in various parts of the world. But also rheumatoid arthritis is helping fuel the growth. So you can see here, growth rate very much in-line with what we told you before would happen.</p>
          <p>A couple of words on the impact of the emerging regions. As you can see here, the importance of those markets in the Oncology portfolio is growing. On an overall basis, they generate about 22% now of our global oncology sales.</p>
          <p>I just like to attract your attention to a couple of points. One is the growth that you can see here for Herceptin, the important &#x2013; the growing importance of the International region. But the second thing is that with MabThera/Rituxan, we don't experience exactly the same kind of growth. And I, in many ways, I personally believe that it is linked to the more difficult access we are experiencing with MabThera. The maintenance indication will help us convince payers around the world of the clinical value that MabThera offers, and will increase the growth rate.</p>
          <p>The Inflammation/Transplantation franchise is and was impacted by the decline of CellCept in the United States. This effect should now almost be washed out. The second half of the year should see a much less effect of negative growth of CellCept. We lost patent protection in the second quarter of last year. And then quarter three and four this year, the effect should be mostly washed out.</p>
          <p>The good news is we have had very, very good success with Actemra so far. Very good start in the United States. And also very good progress in Europe, in particular in France, and also some other countries around the world. As this graph shows you here, you can see we have a very rapid development of our quarterly sales. In Europe, we actually launched &#x2013; we really launched in Germany last year. But in the rest of Europe, at the beginning of this year because we only obtained reimbursement in France and Italy and Spain late last year or early this year. So these countries are only coming on-stream now and certainly, we should see growth accelerating. Some countries around the world, like Brazil and others, we are delayed with the reimbursement. And they will also come and add to this growth as we -- as time goes on.</p>
          <p>In the United States, 50% of rheumatologists are using the drug to-date. What is very encouraging in the US, I must say, is &#x2013; it's not represented here, but is the fact that the memorization of our messages by physicians is very good. We are very focused on patient profiles where Actemra can make a difference. In the treatment of monotherapy, for instance, in the treatment of the so-called hot patients, those patients who have high CRP levels to start with, and where Actemra brings a very strong clinical benefit. In those patient types, we are making some very good inroads, and the physicians are memorizing our messages very well.</p>
          <p>So, so far so good. And we have also started enrolling patients in our head-to-head study versus Humira.</p>
          <p>Lucentis is also growing very rapidly. As I mentioned a bit before, 27% growth. Essentially driven by an increased share in AMD so far. But we have approval now for RVO, and that should really help grow this product. And we expect data on DME the next year.</p>
          <p>If I move on to virology, we have a negative impact of Tamiflu, of course, here. And that negative impact will be even greater in the second half of the year, because last year we sold a lot in the second half of the year. And this year we don't expect much upturn. We have revisited our sales forecast of peak sales for this year, a little bit lower than the guidance we gave you early in the year because there is no seasonal flu business at all. But certainly Pegasys is doing very well in the emerging markets and on a global basis, growing by 5%. And Tamiflu is declining here.</p>
          <p>Yeah, the peak sales for this year. The sales for this year: 1 billion. We communicated 1.2 billion at the beginning of this year, but clearly there is no pandemic business to expect. And the seasonal flu is so far very limited. I just heard that we have an increasing incidence of flu in the South Hemisphere where it is wintertime now. But it is too early to judge what the autumn, the full flu season will look like.</p>
          <p>Now what news should you expect? And again, as I said a minute ago, we are going to from time to time experience setbacks. But when you look at the wealth of news that we are expecting and the strength of the portfolio, it is to be expected that nothing &#x2013; not 100% of those projects will be positive.</p>
          <p>So for the second half, let me just mention BRAF; T-DM1; Pertuzumab in combination with Herceptin, the NEOSPHERE, the neoadjuvant study. And also the Ocrelizumab data in MS should be published in &#x2013; should be presented in October. So still a relatively interesting second half of the year from the point of view of clinical news flow. And as you can see, quite a lot of news next year. Lucentis in DME, as I said, and a number of other studies will also read out in the course of 2011.</p>
          <p>So in closing, we're clearly facing a very different environment, whether it's us or the whole industry. Clearly, where we are today is very different from what we could have expected 6 to 7 months ago. And there's an increasing impact, of course, of the healthcare reform in the United States and the changes in the EU. And that impact, as I said a minute ago, will increase in the second half.</p>
          <p>We have to absorb the Tamiflu, that effect.</p>
          <p>On the plus side, for the rest of this year, as I said, the CellCept wash-out &#x2013; should wash-out in the second half. So we should not have the same negative impact as we had in the first half. And we are managing our costs, and we will keep doing this even more so as we move forward. We are firmly focused on improving our productivity and getting more mileage out of every dollar we spend.</p>
          <p>And finally, we are very focused on driving growth in the emerging markets, and so far I must say very successfully. We have focused quite a bit on the Asia-Pacific region, in particular China, because we were so far quite disappointed with the growth in China. We were growing 20%, and it was not good enough. I have to say 20% is pretty high already, but the market was growing more than that. And so we have changed many &#x2013; make a number of structural changes in our Chinese organization. I think it is going to take a few months before it pays off, but our goal really is to accelerate growth in China. And there are already signs that it is going to happen. So I am confident that the emerging markets will continue to deliver this very positive result.</p>
          <p>And on that, I will hand over to my friend, Dan. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Pascal. So good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. It's a great pleasure to present to you on the first half year results for Diagnostics for Roche. And I'm very pleased to report, as Severin has already mentioned, a 9% overall growth rate on the Diagnostics line. Just to put that into context, Roche is the world leader in in-vitro diagnostics with a 20% market share, and the next largest competitor being around 12%.</p>
          <p>I've been anxiously watching how the competitors have been reporting. I've seen two competitors come out. I was hesitant to use the world &#x2013; word 2 times the global &#x2013; the market rate, but in fact I feel much more confident to now say we're doubling actually the market growth rate from the competitors that I've seen coming out. And you can see that that growth rate is being driven across all of our business areas. And I'll talk a little bit about some of the dynamics that are driving that growth.</p>
          <p>Now I also said to you when I sat here at the end-year result last year, that we would increase our profitability in the division. And I'm very happy to come back to you and say we've had some major advances in our profitability line. You can see a 47% increase in profitability, up to 18% at the half year. That's being driven by, of course, the continued drive of our sales line. But also very close attention without in any way suffocating or strangling the business on our cost line to be able to demonstrate this type of profitability.</p>
          <p>What I'd like to do is put that into a little bit of perspective for the second half of the year, to make sure that I set expectations for the second half of the year. Those of you that have been astute followers of the P&amp;L on the Diagnostic side know that in principle we always have a deterioration of the profit line in the second half of the year. And I expect that to be also for the second half for this year as well.</p>
          <p>Now there are good reasons for why that's deteriorating. That's generally deteriorating because of higher instrument placements in the second half for the year, which means our installed base is going up, but it certainly affects our cost line.</p>
          <p>And what you see in the first half of this year, what's driving some of the increased profitability as well, is that our product mix is benefiting a great deal. So those products with higher gross profit margins in our line are the ones that are actually increasing disproportionately in our sales line. So that's driving our profit up.</p>
          <p>We'll have continued investment in instrument placements in the second half of the year, which will bring down our profit a little bit from the 18%. And we also have the Medingo acquisition that's closed completely in our Diabetes Care franchise. So will have an effect in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>But what I want you to understand is this underlying improvement in efficiency that's represented on the bottom of this graph is not a one-time event. That's something we'll continue to be focused on this year, next year, the year after to consistently see improvements in our profit margin over time. So we will see a significant improvement at the end of the year also on profitability in Diagnostics. We ended last year at 12.2%, and I'm expecting to see also a significant increase by year-end as well. So we have a very good first half year momentum in that regard.</p>
          <p>Now what's driving this significant above market growth? Well, Professional Diagnostics &#x2013; which is our largest business &#x2013; clinical chemistry, immunoassay business is growing very, very nicely at 11%. We've seen the United States return to growth there and contribute further. Our immunoassay business segment is growing in double-digits, and that's driving a significant continued market penetration in that business as well.</p>
          <p>Also, we've got access now to HCV as a critical immunoassay in that menu. And we've received approval in the United States, and are launching that. Actually, we just received approval in May, so we'll start to see also the impact of HCV in our Professional Diagnostics business as we go into the second half of the year. And we know that that HCV assay has a good standalone effect. But it also brings our entire immunoassay portfolio up as well. We've seen that in European countries.</p>
          <p>Diabetes Care, still growing faster than the marketplace. We see outside the United States where we have our new products launch, very strong growth in Europe and Asia-Pacific and Latin America. And we're still awaiting the approval of those products in the United States, which we expect in the second half of this year. But still growing in comparison to the pressures on that marketplace, and a very nice growth rate there as well.</p>
          <p>Molecular Diagnostics, very good news flow in the first half of the year, which I'll touch base on later in my presentation, specifically regarding HPV and MRSA.</p>
          <p>On the Applied Science side, we've seen growth in all of our business segments. And we've also recently launched our GS Junior, which is our smaller sequencing platform in the applied science business.</p>
          <p>And finally, Tissue Diagnostics continues to grow aggressively both in the United States and outside the United States. And we rolled out a new advance staining instrument that's suitable for smaller markets, called the BenchMark GX, in Asia-Pacific and in some of the Eastern European countries as we continue to drive that business in its ex-US franchise.</p>
          <p>Now what I'd like to do is just take 4 examples of news flow in the first half of this year that, in fact, didn't drive these results, but to give you some idea of how we're going to drive also continued sales in the future. These are approvals we've received recently that we're just in the process of rolling out.</p>
          <p>And the first one is on our largest business in Roche Professional Diagnostics. If you remember last year, we rolled out the beginning of our cobas 8000 system which is our immunoassay Clinical Chemistry system for the highest, ultra-high volume labs out there.</p>
          <p>If you remember last year, I said we have the largest installed base of any company in this field. We continue to, and we have the cobas 6000 that we've rolled out over the past couple of years. Now the cobas 8000 is in an early penetration phase into the marketplace.</p>
          <p>What we launched just 2 days ago, actually, is the immunoassay module of this system. So first we launched the Clinical Chemistry modules into more than 11 countries. Now we have the complete system, and can compete significantly in the highest volume labs in the world now outside the United States. And it's under regulatory review within the United States.</p>
          <p>The second piece of information I want give is that we recently announced the outcome of the largest clinical diagnostics trial that's ever been done. It's called the ATHENA trial. If you remember the HPV market in diagnostics is one of the most attractive markets in diagnostics. It's more than a US$300 million market in the United States alone, growing at 20%. And we knew that as a second entrant into this market, we had to have clearly differentiated advantages as we enter into this molecular diagnostics segment.</p>
          <p>Now I was personally at the IPV meeting where this data was rolled out 2 weeks ago to a group of more than 800 thought leaders, clinicians in the field of HPV, and it was a tremendous response to this data. I can tell you this is really game-changing data in HPV. Because for the first time in a prospective, randomized 47,000 women trial, we've demonstrated that you actually are missing 1 in 10 women if you just use the PAP smear. So what we have identified is that a negative PAP &#x2013; you can go for your normal PAP test, and 1 out of 10 women will be missed in terms of high grade pre-cancer cervical. And that's done by identifying HPV 16 and 18 in this setting.</p>
          <p>So just to walk through the data. What you see here first on this slide is the data relative to what exists today, and we've demonstrated that also in ATHENA. And that is an HPV positive or PAP positive and 14 genotype high risk positives, you have an absolute risk of above 10%. And above 10%, you're referred to colposcopy because you're in a risk category that defers that treatment. But you can see here, if you just look at the 14 high risk genotypes alone, your absolute risk is less than 10%. And today those women walk away with a very unsatisfactory, come back in a year and we'll test you again.</p>
          <p>So this is the data that we rolled out at IPV meeting. And that is if you look specifically at HPV 16 and 18 in this woman, you get an absolute risk of above 10%. And the thought leaders are now &#x2013; of course this takes some time to change algorithms, but they're convinced that because that's above 10%, those women should also be referred to colposcopy. And obviously in a country like the U.K. here, you're talking &#x2013; you just take the population dynamics, even with routine PAP screening, you'd be talking about missing thousands of women a year that have potential pre-cancerous lesions that are currently not sent on to screening.</p>
          <p>Now this is also a 3-year follow-up study, and we'll continue to look at the effectiveness of the test over a 3-year time period. But the pharmacoeconomic story here as well, and the healthcare story is that if you are HPV 16 negative, you can also be deferred for 3 years instead of an annual PAP smear. So there's also a total clinical and pharmacoeconomic story around this test.</p>
          <p>So what is our offering to the marketplace? Because I've said before, it's a competitive market. You have to enter with a significantly different market. First is, our trial has shown we're at least as good on sensitivity and specificity as the assay that's out there in the marketplace today, the Digene assay.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we've demonstrated significant clinical differentiated value with HPV 16 and 18. And we're the only test, because of our work flow, that allows you on one run with the sample to identify whether that sample is HPV 16 or 18 positive. All the other offerings on the marketplace today in an automated format only look at 14 high-risk genotypes together. We separate that out in our system, which means at a work flow of around 388 samples in a 12-hour period, you can immediately identify those women that are 16 or 18 positive with our test.</p>
          <p>So we feel very confident as we prepare now for the US launch of this product, because we filed the product. It was accepted in the FDA in June of this year. That as we enter into both the largest market in the world, the United States after approval some time next year, and also in talking with other countries around the world, European authorities, that this data will be very compelling in terms of screening in HPV and cervical cancer incident.</p>
          <p>The second major win that we had in the first half of this year &#x2013; or third major win that we had was the approval of our MRSA assay in the United States. So we now have an assay that is a very competitive assay, that by the way, will go out there on one of the largest installed instrument space in the United States. So even in this environment, where hospitals are strapped for capital purchases in some case, they don't need to buy a new piece of equipment. Every hospital in the United States has at least one LightCycler 2.0. And we're launching now a MRSA platform into what is a very attractive market in the United States, more than a 100 million, growing at a very tremendous rate as you can see up there.</p>
          <p>And the reason it's growing at such a strong rate is the encouragement of the management of hospital-acquired infections. Of course in many countries around the world, but within the US healthcare legislation, there is a specific mandate that says hospitals that are in the lowest 25% of healthcare-acquired infections will actually get Medicare &#x2013; will get a reduction in Medicare payments to their institution. So there is a tremendous, if you want to call it, negative motivation for hospitals to reduce their healthcare-acquired infections. And we believe that our MRSA assay will play a significant role in that.</p>
          <p>And the last key event of several others that I wanted to talk about today is the ability for us to take our sequencing technology, our long read 454 sequencing technology from what has predominantly been in large genomic research centers, and we launched what is the GS Junior product &#x2013; actually in May of this year &#x2013; which brings this down to an affordable level for every size lab. And of course, every lab around the world is interested in sequencing right now. And this brings it to an affordable level and a high quality long read level to be able to continue to penetrate that sequencing market.</p>
          <p>So in summary this is the commitment that, on behalf of Roche, I gave to all of you at the beginning of this year. This is our score card. We're on track relative to what we intend to deliver for this year.</p>
          <p>I'd be more than happy to also see many of your faces or people from your firms at a special investor event that we're going to have at the AACC Meeting next Monday. If any of you really want to get off to Los Angeles, you can still book a flight. We're going to have it on Monday evening at the AACC event, and we'll get into a lot more detail on our Diagnostics business at that time.</p>
          <p>So with that, I thank you very much. And I'll turn it over to Erich to cover the financials for the first half.</p>

      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. It's my pleasure to be here. And I just realized this is my ninth half year result I am honored to present for Roche, and I can definitely say it's the most solid, the best in these 9 years. And I would like in the next minutes to guide you a little bit through. I always know that at this time of the day, the raw figures have been digested by all of you in a perfect manner and interpreted. And I just would like to add some value even ahead of the Q&amp;A sessions now.</p>
          <p>So currency impact. I used this chart yesterday internally when we usually &#x2013; to our worldwide management community show it. And it's an interesting position for tiny Switzerland to be with the Swiss franc. And to see who has lost against the Swiss franc, but who has gained. And this year it's more or less the mirror of the economic strength of these various regions. I think &#x2013; sorry for our colleagues in the US, but I think they still have some problems, and also the European Union. Both struggling, at least some members. But on the other hand we should never forget that there are also areas in this world which have their economies under control and are growing, and are contributing to growth of this world economy. And it's actually quite nicely mirrored here.</p>
          <p>At the operating profit levels which my two colleagues have presented, I really can tell you this is solid. And I also understand usually this has been the moment where the question is "and what were the exceptional items more or less giving backwinds or headwinds to these results". And you &#x2013; what you can see here actually is that we &#x2013; yes, the only part where we have lost is royalties and other operating income. Because for those who have followed us closely, last year in the first half year 2009, we had 3 positive incomes; 2 contributions, one-time contributions, in our corporation: Boniva and around Xenical/Alli from Glaxo and 1 by our friends from Chugai. And there is nothing else. And what you can really see is that the measures we have taken, especially also in the United States, are showing fully through. And we can report that our time schedule to deliver another 800 million of the synergies in the &#x2013; out of the United States transactions are fully on track, and there is a substantial part to be delivered in the second half of this year. But we are totally convinced we have this process under control.</p>
          <p>If we now move below the operating profit level. Of course, one element is very clear: that the interest expenses, they had to go up from &#x2013; on a half year-on-half year basis. No surprise there. And &#x2013; but there are 2 other elements in here which definitely need some explanation, just for those who are not so close. You may recall that we had raised these bonds a little bit prior to closing the transaction on March 26 last year. But the financing cost of these bonds prior to the transaction, they actually showed up in the exceptional line. So year-on-year on a comparison, that's why you have this additional 310 on the interest expense.</p>
          <p>But the loss you have, the 144 here, what happened here? We were standing in front of you and we said we did the whole financing for the Genentech transaction without thinking of Tamiflu. And Tamiflu nicely, actually, was quite successful last year. So we had extra cash on our balance sheet. And you would agree with me in today's environment where cash on the balance sheet, risk-free invested generates a really, really meager return.</p>
          <p>Then, we, of course, remembered that our US bonds have a very clever component in the paragraphing that under certain conditions we can call them. So what we did, we called our 2012, 2.5 billion bond early. We called it by the end of June, and it will be repaid on September 9. And this, of course, gives out of the process. It gives the one-time charge, which was in the half year of this year because the call point is the accounting rights for the expert. The moment when you called this bond, that's the accounting point where you have to take the hit. But, of course, you can do an easy net present value. You have this one-time charge. You have some opportunity cost of not having the $2.5 billion until maturity, 2012. But we save all the interest expenses up to there. And this investment is actually quite profitable from this perspective.</p>
          <p>The other element, if you use the term Forex loss, it always turns tough, and somebody -- like somebody mixed &#x2013; makes something up, I can really also comfort you there. We had to really assess our operations in Venezuela. And for those a little bit familiar with this country, it has now, I think, 3 official exchange rates. And it's quite a jungle to find it &#x2013; the way through these official exchange rates. And it gave a one-time hit which we had in the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>And on the other hand, I have to respect, in this line we also report the hedging cost for currencies. And since the volatility of a lot of currencies has tremendously increased over the last 6 to 12 months, also the related hedging cost has just increased. And that's a certain reflection which you find here.</p>
          <p>Otherwise, I think everything is absolutely under control. That there is less interest in debt securities income, I think that's just the consequence that we actually don't held any &#x2013; much equities on our balance sheet any more.</p>
          <p>So this is the picture which Severin has already mentioned, about which we are very pleased. You see this dotted line in red, where we actually have now quite a nice advance against our roadmap to repay the Genentech debt. And we remain fully committed to be net cash positive 2015. And you also see that the liquidity challenge for the next 2 years are now quite low. And by the way, we also repaid this week, on Tuesday, a 500 million, an old bond which we took over with Genentech &#x2013; with the Genentech transaction. So fully on track. And one-third, I think it's not bad, one-third of the whole debt raised is &#x2013; will be paid back just actually 16 months after closing the transaction.</p>
          <p>The next chart is missing, and I realized it on the way over on the plane. I told Ian where is my tax chart? And &#x2013; but there is also &#x2013; the tax chart is &#x2013; they &#x2013; I think they thought it's so easy that it's not worth the chart. I had guided you that you are on the safe side with 23 to 24 percentage point. Now you may have been a little bit disappointed that it was to the higher end, but also this has a very, very clear explanation. In the US, we have so-called R&amp;D tax credit. And they usually, they actually hit the balance sheet, the P&amp;L positively in the first half. And this year it was really a timing effect that they will come in the second half. And this, if this would have been year-on-year, the tax rate would have been about 1.5 to 1.6% lower for the half year already.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, you also have to respect &#x2013; and this will absolutely not surprise you &#x2013; that government have become extremely aggressive at all fronts, not only on pricing product, but also on what they can grant in &#x2013; at the tax field. And I have to admit that there were never so many open ends at the tax side that suddenly governments have changed their attitude. And let's say they move into negotiations, which you always have, because in many countries, especially in Europe, you don't pay annual taxes. But you have this kind of tax review period which sometimes are quite in the past, and then it's quite a challenging process to come to a conclusion. And here we have just realized that the environment has changed. And you know what? In the one or the other case, we also then reassess how we saw the situation 6 months ago and how we see it now. And we -- I would say if you take the summary of tax provisions 6 months ago and now, we have increased them slightly, because the environment has become more difficult. So I would really confirm here that you don't have to worry around the tax rate.</p>
          <p>The other element, which especially if a company has substantive debt, it's important that this company goes on with a high free cash generation. And if you just use the figure and compare half year-on-half year or even the end of last year and this year, then you ask yourself immediately a question. And I think it's important that you understand that actually nothing is going in the wrong direction. If you compare the ongoing business, the free cash flow actually had increased. But then, and that's this -- if you have an ongoing business, these kind of things at the cash side never emerge. But you can imagine &#x2013; you know exactly we pay a significant royalty, for instance, to Gilead on Tamiflu. And last year's fourth quarter was a boom quarter with regards to Tamiflu. But we then have a mechanism since many years that then these royalties are calculated, and of course, accounting-wise they are charged to the right quarter. But cash-wise, they're actually paid out in January. So all together this has an effect where maybe last year's cash was too nice, and we had a charge of 600 million.</p>
          <p>The other element was actually good for our shareholders. You see half year-on-half year, we have increased the dividend by 900 million.</p>
          <p>And now come real effect of the Genentech transaction and here you have 2 elements which are absolutely one-time. The first one doesn't surprise you at all. I had warned you. For all these people where we had terminated the situation, like for instance for those of the Palo Alto research site or in certain manufacturing sites where we didn't find jobs for them, they had &#x2013; we took, of course, a charge last year, 2009, in the P&amp;L. This was also on the change of the company line but they received the cash only when they left the company now in the first half year. That's this element.</p>
          <p>And you know that upon closing of the Genentech transaction, March 26, all the stock options of all Genentech employees vested, and there was a positive tax &#x2013; cash effect on the tax benefit here.</p>
          <p>And you may also know that most of these bonds we have raised, they have a payout once a year, which is in February and March. So of course accounting-wise in the P&amp;L, you have seen all this interest expenses accumulating already and charged to last year's. But here, this was the first payout which was different. So I hope that you see, even if you just compare this 2.1 with this 1.6 and start to worry, there is also from my perspective nothing to worry on the cash side.</p>
          <p>Balance sheet. Yes, we have shortened the balance sheet And yes, as to be expected because the first half year of this company is always weak because the dividend is fully paid, not on a quarterly or half year basis, but just in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>What is also important for you to know, and of course there may be questions around this, you can be assured that collection of our sales is a top topic for the 3 of us, for Pascal, for Dan and myself. And we have for each region and for each country, we have a task force monitoring is it worth to do a sale? How do we really collect the money? And we can also tell you that we are prudent. Actually, the status has not worsened. And I know there is a lot of noise in the system, and certain countries have more difficulties to pay. But it is not a fundamental change what we experience. Certain countries have more difficulty to pay. And we are watching this really on a daily to weekly basis with a task force, which really is interested to bring this cash into Roche.</p>
          <p>And we have also taken &#x2013; there are some few cases where it is doubtful whether we can recover the full amount. And there we have taken provisions fully in line with industry standards and fully in line with what our auditors also have understood. But I also beg your understanding that we are, in certain countries, still in open negotiations, and I wouldn't want to give you the details here. I don't want to weaken our negotiations team with the argument "oh, we have heard you have written down our debt anyway". I think this would be a wrong starting position; to still go for 100% of our outstanding.</p>
          <p>And as Severin has said, we are happy to confirm the guidance for this year.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Who would like to start with the first question? We have one question here, if we could have the microphone please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Alexandra Hauber from JPMorgan. First question is of course about the consequences of the ODAC panel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can we do something with the mic? Switch it up a bit? It's very difficult to hear it on our side. Yes, cheers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The first question I have is about the consequences of the ODAC panel, assuming the FDA is sticking with the recommendation. What are the consequences for the organization? You basically said you're going to proactively adapt to the reality which &#x2013; could you be a bit &#x2013; provide a bit more color what's behind that? Is &#x2013; does that mean in terms of restructuring, but also potentially, how you changing decision making processes and thresholds in development?</p>
          <p>And the second question is, one thing which came clear during the panel on Tuesday is that there was obvious &#x2013; there seemed to be a threshold for clinical meaningfulness, which wasn't so clear at all before. And I was just wondering to what extent you actually had discussions with the FDA? How that threshold is set? Because I've always assumed if you power a study to show a certain benefit, that that roughly defines that threshold. And obviously that's important with regards to your next filing. But then 2 is already filed. We going to have a similar discussion, I know, ovarian, we're going to have the same discussion all over again. I have a bunch of other questions as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you for your questions. If I may take the first one, the more general one, how we respond to this more challenging environment. And then hand over to Pascal on your more specific question, what is meant by what is clinically meaningful in future, and what are the new FDA standards here.</p>
          <p>Now when I am talking about a more challenging environment, it is several elements. It's not only the ODAC recommendation which we experienced 2 days ago. We do see a much stronger price pressure. I would say finally the financial crisis has arrived with the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
          <p>Last year, we have been standing here and you asked, "Do you feel something of the financial crisis"? And we kept saying no. We don't feel anything. And the reason for that is that the bureaucracies around the world, it take a certain time until these machineries come into effect, and until price reductions are being implemented in law.</p>
          <p>And then of course we had the euro crisis on top of it at the beginning of this year. It accelerated the process in certain countries such as Greece, where we suddenly overnight experienced a 27% price decrease.</p>
          <p>So that is a different environment, and we did expect that the environment would get tougher. It would get more challenging. But it's probably accelerated, especially in the second quarter of this year. So that is one element.</p>
          <p>And if you have a price decrease, this falls through to the bottom-line. And there's only one way how you can compensate, and that is on the cost structure. As simple as that.</p>
          <p>Our pipeline is what it is. We won't suddenly have more products coming out of this pipeline just because the prices are coming down. Now we have always worked on our productivity, don't miss understand me. But I do believe that puts additional focus on us, and it puts a different dynamic on us in-line with the market dynamic, number one.</p>
          <p>Number two, was a big disappointment and that is the delay on the taspoglutide side. Now here we have different components. The one component is, do we have a product? And here we are analyzing the data. We are analyzing the root cause of the sensitivity issues, the allergic reactions we have observed. That will take some time. And that question will only be answered probably at the end of this year rather than now, because we have to take the time to take the right decision.</p>
          <p>But what we know already today is that at any rate, and we have given you an heads-up on that, our filing will be delayed by 12 to 18 months. And therefore it has an immediate impact for us in terms of our commercial structures. Because last year when I talked to my organization, we were talking about launch readiness of taspo. Now if the launch is being delayed, obviously this has an impact on how we set up our commercial structure. We cannot ramp-up the organization and do it if nothing has happened. So also in this respect, reality has changed.</p>
          <p>Now please do understand that I'm not going to make a public announcement today when we still have to implement country-by-country the respective measures, and have to announce the respective measures country-by-country as we go forward. Because the situation is very different from country-to-country, depending on what infrastructure is already there. How much have we gone in terms of preparing for taspo, etc.</p>
          <p>But the message I want to leave you with is that we are very, very alert of this situation. And this hasn't happened yesterday. This happened some time ago, and we are diligently working on that. And that process is ongoing. Perhaps it's a bit, how shall I say, that this company's style that we don't go out and tell everybody what big restructuring programs we have. But rather, show by actual effect what we deliver and how our costs are developing. And I do believe you see this reflected in the half year results.</p>
          <p>Now the third component, and that is certainly an additional element of change which we did not expect, the ODAC recommendation 2 days ago. And certainly this also has an impact on our business, and related to that, the cost structure.</p>
          <p>But let me put it a bit into perspective. We are all extremely disappointed, I can tell you. This was one of the bad days since I have taken over as CEO. I think we are at least as disappointed as all of you are. But then again, after this first disappointment, then you step back a bit and you start putting it into the picture.</p>
          <p>If you look into metastatic breast cancer in the US, this is today about 600 million Swiss francs sales. Now this is a lot. And I'm not &#x2013; I don't want to trivialize it. And of course there would have been additional growth in the US on that specific indication if the FDA indeed decides to withdraw the indication.</p>
          <p>But then put it into the context. On a Group level, this is 1 percentage point of sales. So I don't want to trivialize it, but I want to also put it into perspective. And I do believe we can mange this. And this is also the reason why we did confirm our guidance for the full year.</p>
          <p>But put all of this together: price pressure, taspo delay, the negative outcome of the ODAC recommendation, you can see why we take much more rigorous stand now when it comes to cost management. And I think as a management, we have a responsibility to adapt to such new realities. And communicate this in a clear way, not only to you, but also internally within the organization.</p>
          <p>Now with this, I'd like to hand over more specifically on the ODAC and the related questions you had in this respect.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Severin. Can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are two parts, I think in this question actually. And one is a general principle, and then another one maybe is more specific to Avastin in breast cancer. And we have here the &#x2013; Stefan Frings, who is the Franchise Director in charge of Avastin. So we can -- Stefan's concern is taken and add to my comments.</p>
          <p>Let me start with the general principle, and this is a very good question actually. And there are 2 parts in it for me. One is the relative value of median PFS and hazard ratio. And that's &#x2013; that debate, that is really one key part of the debate, and we have to have that discussion with the FDA. And we need certainly &#x2013; we'll raise it again in the ongoing discussion. We're going to have to &#x2013; with them between now and September 17 because this is a fundamental question. Do you stick to purely looking at the median PFS even if the curves &#x2013; the curves come together and separate again, or do you &#x2013; what value do you give to hazard ratio?</p>
          <p>And the second is, if you look at PFS, what is a relevant PFS? And again, this is a discussion we need to have with the FDA, because it will &#x2013; that is a relevant question for the entire industry and certainly for us for the whole portfolio. If we look at for instance our new drugs T-DM1, Pertuzumab and for most of them when we have a PFS we've powered them -- they're fully powered to support a 4 months PFS benefit.</p>
          <p>Now the question is, especially in second line you would say, this is large enough. But we still need to have the discussion with the FDA, and we will have it because we need to have a certainty in terms of how they're going to read those data. It seems to me that they are not challenging the PFS as an end point itself. But certainly what we need to understand is what is the magnitude that we are looking for?</p>
          <p>So I think on those 2 points, and those are general principles, we certainly will want to have further discussions with the FDA. We have our own view of course. But we need to clarify with them whether the way we are proceeding with our other programs is certainly &#x2013; we believe it's fine, but is it fine by them too? If you look at RIBBON-2 which we filed, it certainly will &#x2013; that will be the topic of a discussion. But this one, we have a PFS benefit that should be of a magnitude that hopefully the FDA considers appropriate. It's in second line. So you can imagine, second line, the expectations are not as high as they would be in first line.</p>
          <p>We also have an overall survival, hazard ratio that goes in the right direction. So the RIBBON-2 data set is certainly very &#x2013; I mean, a lot stronger, if you may call it that way, and it gives us a lot of confidence. But, all of the discussions we certainly need to have with the FDA in the few weeks that are coming up. In term of more specifically Avastin, Stefan, do you want to add to this discussion at the ODAC?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one &#x2013; maybe a few points. I think we acknowledge the ODAC vote. And certainly, the ODAC is not an expert committee on metastatic breast cancer. We certainly realize that FDA had stacked the deck against Avastin by choosing voting panel members who had been previously already negative on Avastin, by crafting a briefing booklet which reflected their view. Very peculiar. For example, like Pascal pointed out, more honing in on median and overall rather ignoring hazard ratios. Or for example, how the questions were crafted. There was a request during the meeting to vote separately on XELODA, fully powered cohort, and FDA denied this. And you heard maybe the sentiment in the room that for the XELODA cohort, good meaningful PFS benefit, hazard ratio for over survival, pointing in the right direction, very reasonable safety profile. FDA denied that this vote was taken separately.</p>
          <p>It is in ODAC vote. We have to wait what FDA will take action. We can fully confirm that based on efficacy and safety, we can stand behind the data that Avastin is a meaningful option for patients with such a negative breast cancer. And we're not alone. Immediately after the ODAC vote, we received unsolicited feedback from multiple thought leaders in the US in the field who were rather appalled what happened at the ODAC panel. So there will certainly be interactions, and we can't speculate on the ultimate outcome. But I think we all heard that FDA during the ODAC committee rather expressed strong views.</p>
          <p>Maybe one last point. This is not a Milotarg situation. So Pfizer withdrew Milotarg because there was excessive mortality with the drug. And we can clearly say, and we have presented the data last Tuesday, there is no increase in mortality and the risk factors always point in favor for Avastin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just add that -- I think it is important to -- for us to say that we totally recognized and respect the decision of the committee. The ODAC is a committee of experts, and we clearly do recognize. So their decision, we're not here saying it's unfair or whatever. It's just &#x2013; the point is we need to work with the FDA to understand what is the relevant importance of hazard ratio versus PFS, median PFS, what kind of PFS benefit should we shoot at for Avastin for future projects. And also I would have personally a third question which is why amalgamate everything and not engage in a discussion looking at, for instance, XELODA, a specific treatment time, when in fact we had a study that was partially designed to be able to analyze individual treatment groups, XELODA one side and anthracyclines and taxane on the other hand.</p>
          <p>So all those questions clearly we need to engage in a constructive discussion with the FDA in the weeks to come to try and resolve. The Avastin discussions are also very importantly to have a clear picture as to expectations and the rules of the game, if I may call them that, to a way moving forward for all projects that we engage in.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. We have one question here in the second row. Please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. It's Sachin Jain from Merrill Lynch. First is to just pick up on your comments Severin, when you talked about &#x2013; or you continue to talk about a delay for taspoglutide versus discontinuation. To comment I think you were leading to in terms of changes to your primary care sales force infrastructure. Are they a timing delay or a permanent change? And I'm thinking about that relative to your other primary care products in development in CETP and aleglitazar?</p>
          <p>Secondly, related to taspoglutide, I was just wondering if you could give us a feel of how you view the peak sales potential of this product, even if you resolve hypersensitivity? And how that frames your thoughts on incremental cost for cardiovascular study and nausea studies, which I guess would be substantial and those CV studies are still recruiting?</p>
          <p>Thirdly, just wonder if you could update us on your Avastin peak sales thoughts. They were 8 to 9 billion. Obviously we've had gastric, prostate, the ODAC, where do we sit now and how do you get to your new target?</p>
          <p>And my final question is on the CETP inhibitor. Three sets of Phase III data expected next year, 2 imaging and 1 potential interim analysis. It was excluded from your news release slide. Any particular de-emphasizing of that product? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If &#x2013; just as a starting point, let me emphasize we are by no means de-emphasizing the CETP inhibitor, whatever was on the slide. I didn't realize any point of that kind. So CETP inhibitor is a potential game changer for this company. It has its risks, but we are fully committed to the CETP inhibitor, to aleglitazar and to metabolism as a whole.</p>
          <p>Pascal, if you would like to make a comment on the infrastructure related to taspoglutide, and I think your question was how is this all timed in the context of aleglitazar and dalcetrapib. Did I understand this correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm just trying to understand your answer to Alexandra's question where you're talking about adapting the cost base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess you were alluding to primary care sales force. You talk about a delay of infrastructure? Or a...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, taspoglutide would have been the first product to be launched in the metabolism field. Now with the delay of the file, it is launched in a more similar timeframe than an aleglitazar, dalcetrapib. So instead of &#x2013; which has been the original plan getting fully ready for taspoglutide ahead of the rest of the portfolio coming in, now it's more of a question building up this infrastructure at a later point. And &#x2013; or also adapting the infrastructure to the degree it is already in place. Because we cannot bridge here for several years and keep those infrastructures in reserve if you like. This is just not good management. So that is what I was referring to. Does this answer your first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It does. But I just wanted a quick follow-up, if we ask others. I guess the spirit of the question was, are you going to do more than delaying infrastructure spend? Is there anything more you can do over and above that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the commercial infrastructure, if you look at the respective sales force structure, the back-office structure, which you need to support this sales force, of course, you take a holistic look. We're not just looking &#x2013; we are looking at here: we have so many sales reps, how many sales reps do we need. You look at it from a holistic point of view. And that's the approach which we take country-by-country as we go forward.</p>
          <p>You had a question on the taspo peak sales. Karl, do we communicate peak sales on taspo? Can we have a microphone here?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The question is, even if you resolve hypersensitivity, what do you view peak sales potential of the product? And I guess I can lead you a little bit further given when the nausea rates come out, injection site reactions, total discontinuation, and how you frame that in the context of the substantial R&amp;D costs that is still ongoing for the product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. As far as the R&amp;D costs are concerned, the trials are basically done. We have still very much 8 trials running, ongoing. We will certainly complete this trial as it is fully enrolled, fully going and costs you almost as much if you &#x2013; I mean for all reasons, you wouldn't stop it to start with. But I don't see any savings on that front. I wouldn't &#x2013; our focus is on the commercial infrastructure.</p>
          <p>As far as the peak sales is concerned I think we shouldn't fresh-up some numbers now while the analysis is on-going when we didn't even give a concrete number in the first place. Karl, did we communicate anything more specific?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't like to give you a more precise number than at that time, given the analysis which is on-going.</p>
          <p>You had the third question, and that was on Avastin peak sales. Original guidance which we gave you was 8 to 9 billion Swiss francs. Now certainly if the recommendation of ODAC was adapted by the FDA, if they take the decision to withdraw this indication, certainly we would be at the very low end of this guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just regarding to this taspo question, if I may, the &#x2013; there are &#x2013; Severin said there are two parts, right. One is the project itself, and two is the organization, and the impact of the delay. And so we can't give you an answer today because we are looking at scenarios that exists for us. And of course one scenario is a very substantial realignment of the organization. But we haven't made any decision, and we want to make that decision in the weeks to come. And as you can imagine in Europe, things don't get decided just like this. You have to talk to a fair number of people before you can make a decision and make an announcement.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; but maybe the only thought we could leave you with is we're not going to stay for several years with a substantial cost to infrastructure that is not needed. So we'll have to make some adjustment. The question is what kind of adjustment. And there we have actually 3 scenarios, and we haven't made a decision. So you need to give us a little bit more time. But just first that we will do the right thing, and we will certainly manage our cost based on the situation we are facing.</p>
          <p>Where we are is very different from where we were 6 or 8 months ago, for sure. Now we have a delay. We just have to adjust.</p>
          <p>The peak sales, we are working on updating the business case, and it's all part of this analysis we are doing. We need to understand, we need to explore further the cause &#x2013; the root cause of this hypersensitivities we have experienced. And we have a couple of hypothesis here, but we need to explore them further.</p>
          <p>And the second is we need to look at this GI tolerability issue and see what can we do to address that. And we also have a couple of hypothesis about what we can do. But we need to do additional technical and also clinical work, short term, very short clinical work to get a better sense for can we fix our problems or not. And it will take us until Q4 to understand that. And as part of it, we'll understand also the timeline, and therefore the impact on the competitive landscape by the time we launch and the business case. And that's roughly when we will be able to make a decision on the project itself, yeah. In the meantime, we're working on the &#x2013; what options we will implement for the organizational structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From my side of the CETP inhibitor, we didn't put anything into 2010 because it's interim analysis and not the final one. And therefore we took it out. So this is the guidance of the company. We only go for final data and not interim data.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you Karl. I would really not read too much in that. We, believe me, we are very committed to this project, and there is no signal at all, no new data. In fact, there's no reason to have no new data that would tell us that there is an issue and we are starting to back out of it. We are as committed as we were 3, 4 months ago and there's no new news. We have new news next year. Those will be limited new news of course, because the imaging study is a small study. But it will give us some indication of the effect of the drug. But so far, no new news that you're not aware of.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Luisa Hector from Credit Suisse. If we could just go back to Avastin in breast cancer, and is there any color you can give us on the attitude, say, from the European regulator? I think there were some documents last year suggesting a degree of concern from a few people around the magnitude of the PFS benefit, and a desire to see more on the overall survival. So I think you have both within 1 and 2 with the European regulators. So is there any more color you can give us from the regulatory side there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Stefan, perhaps you want to directly answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe to cover the document. It was the HIPPA report and as part of the approval we got for docetaxel which was just reviewed, two stage by ODAC as well. July last year we got approval for docetaxel in the European Union. and they requested that we submit formally an over survival update, which we had shown them just in output form. We submitted those data, and in the meantime we had amended the protocol and added further 10 month of follow-up. Those data were presented at the ODAC committee where even the hazard ratio is finally again pointing in the right direction for Avastin.</p>
          <p>RIBBON 1 is currently under review, both the A-plus anthracycline/taxane cohort and XELODA cohort. No decision has been made yet. Certainly regulatory authorities talk to each other. In Europe, according to guidelines, in first-line metastatic breast cancer PFS is an acceptable end point, and certainly a more holistic view hazard ratio and risk/benefit will play an important role.</p>
          <p>Pascal mentioned already, RIBBON 2, there, even for FDA, PFS has always been an acceptable end point without demonstrating over survival. More recent examples of approval were IXEMPRA, ixabepilone from Bristol-Myers Squibb; quite a bit of toxicity modest PFS gain of just six weeks. Similar <mark type="inaudible" /> was approved based on PFS only a handful of weeks and no over survival benefit. Therefore, I think we can be rather confident that RIBBON 2 pending health authority review would be &#x2013; could be a success in Europe. It was misrepresented. We have not filed yet RIBBON 2 in Europe. The file will go out later this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>just to add a little bit, we of course can never speak on behalf of a regulatory authority. They're going to have to make their own decision, their own assessment. But, I think the point that is important to keep in mind here is, as Stefan said, AVADO was already approved. You have to &#x2013; I'm sure you remember that in Europe we filed AVADO, the docetaxel, Taxotere study first and then we filed RIBBON 1. In the US, we filed the two together. And so AVADO has already been reviewed by the EMA.</p>
          <p>It is actually not like the ODAC has suddenly come up with some new information or new idea or whatever. The debate has already happened in Europe also about the PFS benefit and the hazard ratio and then in the end they have decided to approve the extension of the Avastin label to the combination with docetaxel. So the debate has happened already in Europe.</p>
          <p>Now a debate can always be reopened, of course, but it has happened. There's nothing new that has come up in this ODAC discussion. So now what they have on their table is RIBBON-1, which is the extension of label to include anthracycline combination and XELODA, capecitabine combination. That they have to make a decision on.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. You mentioned earlier -- this is Carri Duncan, Macquarie Securities Europe. You mentioned earlier that you're starting to feel the pinch of the austerity measures in Europe. And I guess we're all looking at pharma in Western Europe, and if you start there looking at Avastin or MabThera or Herceptin, we can see some lumpiness there compared to the previous quarters. Can you tell us or can you give us a little bit of guidance on what proportion was due to Easter timing, and what proportion is due to the austerity measures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pascal, if you want to take this question directly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're taking about Europe in particular, are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Specifically Europe, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, Europe, as I said, the impact I think we have &#x2013; I showed you a chart. The impact of the austerity measures in if we focus on Europe only, in the second quarter was less &#x2013; was a bit less, was less than 1% on sales. So then you have the impact of the Easter sales. That was quite substantial. And essentially the rest is what we've told you before. Herceptin and MabThera/Rituxan are going to experience single-digit growth rate unless we can &#x2013; until, sorry, we can get maintenance.</p>
          <p>I think we're going to see a little bit of an acceleration with MabThera in Europe on the back of the CLL indication. And we see some acceleration there. And we also will see, I think an acceleration in first financial relapse. We see a little bit of this. But it's really maintenance that will drive the sales.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, we will see single-digit growth rate and you'll see &#x2013; you will have some variations from one quarter to another. If you look back in the history we always had this. The thing is that when you grow by 10%, if you vary 2% from one quarter to another, nobody ask any questions. If you grow single-digit, of course, inventory valuation or end of quarter valuations have an impact.</p>
          <p>So mostly in Europe, it is the Easter impact.</p>
          <p>As far as Avastin, we're still growing. We're still growing in colorectal. We're still growing in the various indications. So there's no big change in underlying trend there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Uh-huh. Yeah. I guess I was just looking at -- because in Q1 we have 18%, and then in this quarter we have 9%. So it's, it is quite a difference if you look sequentially. And --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but the 18% was on the back of a Q4 before it was lower. So the 18% was overstated due to the end of first quarter sales that we communicated before. And therefore, Q2 was underestimated as a result, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what you should look at is our annual guidance. And our annual guidance is mid single-digits on the pharma side. And that should give you a feel of what growth rates you should expect for the second half of this year. Can I -- yes, you have a follow-up? Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. It's relating to the austerity measures. So in your guidance, it doesn't include the U.K. or France which hasn't, up to this point, really given any --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. This is the full guidance, including the expected measures which we see in Europe. So this is a all-inclusive guidance. There are no exceptions to that guidance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in fact for France in particular. I guess your question was going be France hasn't really implemented much yet in the way of price reductions. They haven't signaled yet that they will implement large price reductions to start with. But even if they did, nothing would impact 2010 right now. It will be an effect in 2011. And in our estimate, we think -- I told you a bit before in our presentation that the impact of US healthcare reform and the European scene will grow in the second half, and it will grow even more in 2011 because of the excise tax in the US. And also because we expect a little bit more &#x2013; a little bit of additional price reduction programs throughout Europe. But 2010, basically we are on track with our guidance.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Vincent Meunier from Exane BNP Paribas. The first question is for Pascal. You were reading the slide with the upcoming pipeline used for H2. And you did not mention the result for Avastin, the advanced study adjuvant colorectal. Does that mean that you have low expectations and the market should have low expectations?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on the dynamics on the margin. You said that you have already &#x2013; and you will pursue optimization of your cost line. At the same time, you say that the R&amp;D level should stay at the same level or slightly below for 2010. Can we expect in 2011, a drop in R&amp;D expenditure or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So as far as the guidance is concerned for 2011, we will update the guidance as usual at the beginning of 2011 when we present to you the full year results. For today, I have to leave you with the guidance for 2010. Now, Avastin AVANT, we have not given up on it, and we will look forward to receiving the data. But of course in view of the CO-8 study last year. It has a low probability to reach the end point, there's no doubt. And my understanding is that this is already reflected in the expectation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are a lot of mind readers in the room today. The truth of the matter is I was simply trying to stay on time and give &#x2013; keep time for the Q&amp;A. And in fact, it's quite funny because we were joking &#x2013; I was joking with Karl on the way in looking at this chart. I said, look, there are so many news, the pipeline is so rich, what do I do with this chart? I could speak 15 minutes about it. And then we agreed I would pick a few, but I knew that picking a few would create questions. We &#x2013; AVANT- there's nothing new. We've told you before, if CO-8 failed and therefore the probability of success is probably lower, but then we would have said before. But there's still a good chance. There's still chance it will work, and we are very keen to see the results, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Perhaps if we can switch back here in the first row, and then I'll start going back here. We still have another 10, 15 minutes to go.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. Amit Roy from Nomura. I think this whole issue about Avastin is one &#x2013; not in terms of magnitude, but actually of risk/benefit. That was really the question here, physician do no harm. And so, I &#x2013; in terms of the European approval, my question &#x2013; follow my line of thought here about whether new data has actually come to the European regulator or not. I just want you to explain something. So if you accept that a hazard ratio less than 1 is of &#x2013; comforting in this <mark type="inaudible" /> study or the RIBBON 1 study, which I agree it is. And therefore by the same logic a hazard ratio of greater than 1 would at least raise a signal about a problem. And then we look at the RIBBON 1 data, which has a 50% death rate in the Avastin numbers, and a 43% absolute death rate in the control one, which further confirms our signal which is of course the new information coming to the European regulator. And that that death rate is driven by the currently approved chemotherapies used today in Europe, namely docetaxel and paclitaxel. But in terms of new information for the regulator that, the RIBBON 1, may that contribute some sort of a thinking for the regulator regarding the currently approved therapies today? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>Second question is not on breast cancer. It's actually around lung cancer. You see the results, the US sales for Avastin are obviously flattish, 1% growth in local currencies. And I would have thought that you would have gained a growth there because I understand you've switched your lung cancer sales force into breast cancer perhaps to help push their indication. And the NRx numbers are, I think, about 65% growing there. So without &#x2013; having got no net to growth is there &#x2013; was there a problem in lung cancer indication? We know ALIMTA is approved. It's got very good data in the maintenance setting, 5 months of overall survival in maintenance which Avastin doesn't have <mark type="inaudible" />. Is there a negative drag on the lung side of things in the US which when breast cancer comes up if you update your PDUFA do we end up seeing a shrinking of the US franchise? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me perhaps give a very general answer to put things a bit into perspective before we get into the last detailed study on the specific indications. And that is Avastin has grown by 14% for the first 6 months. I've just a minute ago indicated to you the overall guidance even if the FDA decides to withdraw the first-line metastatic breast cancer indication in the US. And if you interpolate those 2 points, you see that this is a strong, growing brand. And it is a brand which covers a number of important indications that we have very good clinical data.</p>
          <p>With this, I'd like to hand over to Stefan, perhaps, on the very specific question. I think it was on the breast cancer side. And then Pascal, if you could comment on the specifics on lung cancer please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I take the liberty since Alexandra asked a question about ovarian cancer as well. And there are certainly further growth opportunities coming. And as a news flow at ESMO in October you will see the independent review data of our GOG 218 trial, and you will see the second positive trial of Avastin ovarian cancer.</p>
          <p>Coming back to Amit's point on the docetaxel subgroup of the HST cohort, this was a non-stratified subgroup, just 54 patients. And I think we highlighted on Tuesday that there was clearly an imbalance in prognostic factors, which drove the imbalance in the mortality rate. We can stand behind that the docetaxel indication is primarily based on the fully powered and dedicated trial, which was designed to investigate the effect of Avastin on docetaxel. Therefore, we believe we still have the ducks in a row, and the follow-up over surviving measure and as we did for AVADO certainly would help in this respect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On lung cancer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, first of all in term of the Avastin sales or any kind of sales by the way, going to be careful to look at these things quarter-by-quarter because you have variations. We also &#x2013; if you look at the last few quarters for us in the US, it's gone up, down, up, down. And again, when you have a lower growth rate, single-digits or low double-digit, then end of quarter's movements have an impact.</p>
          <p>Now it is very clear and it's nothing new that in colorectal cancer, Avastin has peaked, right. We have the market share that &#x2013; the patient share we can get. We're still growing in lung cancer. In fact if you look at the graph I showed you that it's capturing the so called OUTs, it is showing you that there is growth there. It is not the growth we experienced 2, 3 years ago. It's not 20, 30%, but there is growth there. So there is growth in units, and as you know we increased the price a little bit. Not a lot, but a little bit. And so we believe we are on track with our forecast.</p>
          <p>What we need to keep in mind is ovarian is at some point going to have an impact on sales as well. So there is another growth driver that is coming up for Avastin.</p>
          <p>So I haven't &#x2013; lung is on track and our sales are on track. It's just not the 20, 30% growth rate we've experienced in the past. But on track is what we've told you in terms of the overall peak sales guidance which we just &#x2013; Severin commented on, was 8 to 9. In there, there was $1 billion for breast cancer in the United States. Now if we lose the indication on September 17, then we have to lose again &#x2013; we also have to lose <mark type="inaudible" /> listing. And then individual insurance companies have to decide to not reimburse any more Avastin. So when those things have been gone through then the &#x2013; we will have &#x2013; we would be impacted, of course, to some extent in between this zero and one billion peak sales we had for breast cancer. So it's clear that our peak sales guidance has to be adjusted, and adjusted accordingly. And we certainly will be targeting closer to 8 than to the 9 we had before.</p>
          <p>Remember that all of this excludes ovarian, right. Those &#x2013; this peak sales was given excluding ovarian in the past. And so far we are on track with the kind of numbers I'm describing.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Fabian Wenner, UBS. Thanks for taking two quick questions. First one, sorry, you said on slide 27, we shouldn't read anything into &#x2013; omitting some of the trials, but I'm saw you didn't include the ICON7 study there. And because there were a lot of questions about Avastin and ovarian, could you give us some comfort that the GOG results were replicated. We know that the primary end point was reached, and just tell us whether any toxicities were seen that the FDA could take an issue with?</p>
          <p>And also you guide to 500 million incremental savings for this year. Are you tracking those at all? Do you &#x2013; can you tell us what number of savings you have reached in the first half, and how much we should look for in the second half of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may take the second question first, and then, on ICON7 perhaps Pascal.</p>
          <p>We are not communicating on a half year basis that we spend, in terms of our cost savings, We of course, tracking them internally, very diligently. And what I can confirm is that by the end of this year, we will reach the 800 million as we have guided you.</p>
          <p>On the second one, do you want to take this one, actually, Stefan. The coherence. And ICON7 doesn't totally duplicate GOG, but I would say the results are coherent with GOG. I don't know how far we can comment on those two studies, but certainly, Stefan, if want to add some color.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Before we get into trouble with the ESMO organizer that we disclose the results. I mentioned earlier we will see as well the independent review data of the GOG trial which I believe is very important as well. And I would like to remind you all that the primary analysis of the GOG investigators will not be the one which will end up in the US package insert, in case we get a positive review. But rather the centered one for the tumor mark-up where we had a 6-month data. And we are very confident with the independent review data of GOG. Overall GOG is more robust data set. It's the open -- sorry, it's a randomized, placebo-controlled blinded trial, whereas the ICON7 was an open label trial. But overall, I think big picture, we have to say they confirm it's a positive trial, and we believe will demonstrate that Avastin will play a major role in the treatment of ovarian cancer.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jill Walton at Credit Suisse. I'd like to try and move beyond this year and the guidance for this year, because I think most people try to invest in you for a longer period. And pharmaceutical companies are big ships and take a long time to turn around. A lot of other drug companies have seen a period coming up where their sales growth is not going to be as strong as it has been, because of patent expiries. Different reasons to you. And they responded by doing really serious cuts of their costs, so that they can try and sustain their earnings growth by a margin expansion if they can't do it in the short-term at the top-line?</p>
          <p>Now my guess is you're going into a period where your sales growth isn't going to be as strong as you might like it to have been, but yet &#x2013; Avastin not in as many indications, be it taspo delay, whatever it is. What I am trying to get at is get a feel for whether we can see you making good some of that shortfall with margin gains? Now I'm confused as to whether you've invested in a primary care sales force that you can then take cost out of. Or you were just going to invest in the future, so you've delayed a bit of cost? You are the only drug company on the planet where you've been growing R&amp;D. Maybe you now feel that you can absolutely reduce R&amp;D. I'm not interested in guidance for this year. Over the next 5 years, should we see a real opportunity for margins to rise in the pharma business?</p>
          <p>And then I'd also like to ask for Diagnostics, if I look back on my spreadsheet, you used to produce 20% operating margins in Diagnostics. Has the world changed sufficiently that that isn't an objective that you could get back to? Or is your dominance in the area and your investments in new products such that we could assume that you went back to that sort of long-term Diagnostics margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you touch on a very, very important principal question, and eventually it's this balance between short-term and long-term. And it eventually comes down to the confidence you have in your pipeline and the various projects which you are pursuing in the pipeline. And very often this discussions go like, do we invest into innovation or do we look into our cost structure? I don't think this is mutually exclusive. I think you can do both.</p>
          <p>And I don't think that necessarily excessive budgets drive innovation. What drives innovation is the quality of the science, the quality of the people behind it. And it is the passion of the people they put into their projects. And this is the balance we have to strike.</p>
          <p>As far as the shorter-term is concerned, we have given you a very concrete guidance for this year, including R&amp;D. If we look out 5 years, perhaps 10 years, our strategy does not change. Our strategy is a strategy which is focused on innovation. We have a basic belief that science will progress, and that we can pack into this progress of science, be it internally, be it in cooperation with other companies, be it in cooperation with institutions. And we want to leverage this progress in science. So we have to find the right balance. And we have to also deliver in the short-term, so that we have the flexibility to invest into innovation for the long-term.</p>
          <p>But fundamentally, our belief is in innovation, in medical differentiation. And fundamentally, we believe that science will progress. We also believe that we have the competitive and a sustainable advantage by having Diagnostics and Pharmaceuticals under one roof, because medicines will get more tailored. And because we can work more closely together between Pharma and Diagnostics, especially in the early phase, which is more difficult for other pharma companies. So we believe that we can be on top in science.</p>
          <p>So fundamentally, we will not cut the cost in a way that it endangers our long-term future. But it must not be an excuse for delivering on the short-term. And this must not be an excuse for operational excellence and constantly improving productivity across all functions.</p>
          <p>I hope this gives you a bit of the flavor without giving you a guidance for 2011 or the next 5 years, how we approach the business and how we see the industry moving on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a kind of a three-pronged approach, if you want. One is kind of the consequences, I may say, of the taspo delay and how do we adjust our organization. I know we haven't made a decision. As I said, there are a number of scenarios here, but how do we address this?</p>
          <p>The second is portfolio management. How do we prioritize our portfolio and importantly how do we raise the bar? How do we raise the bar for the projects we move into Phase III really make a difference for patients and are clearly differentiated. And it's easy to say, easy to talk about. Very difficult to implement because some projects are clearly no goes, some others are clearly goes and &#x2013; but a lot of them are in between, and you have to have very robust discussions around those. So clearly, a lot of our focus is organizing ourselves so that we have this robust debate. And we have raised the bar and we only progress projects that really will make a difference.</p>
          <p>And the third approach is operational excellence, as Severin was saying. And we are launching an additional program there to &#x2013; on top of everything we've been doing before to look for further improvement in productivity.</p>
          <p>So we will keep working on it, but don't expect a big announcement where someone says okay I'm going to save several hundred million, then re-invest so much of it. And in the end, you look at it, there's no saving. We commit that we will keep saving money, and hopefully we've shown you in the first 6 months that we are doing it. And we'll keep doing it in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's not either/or. I think that is the important message. It's not either/or. If it would be either/or, then rather get out of this industry. We can take the gentleman. Sorry, there was &#x2013; sorry, Dan --</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Andrew I know you've been waiting for this question the whole time, so my answer will be very short. But you know, of course, we don't give specific margin guidance in Diagnostics. So let me just weave a story for you. Yes, we were at 20%. We ended at 12% last year. There are a number of reasons for why that was, not the least of which was getting into Tissue Diagnostics in a big way, which is driving our top-line now. But I've also said without specific guidance, you can continue to expect margin improvement in the Diagnostics business excluding other major acquisitions. And I would say also that I -- your question was, have I seen drastic changes in the margins in the industry? No, I haven't. It's a little hard to do apples-to-apples comparisons in Diagnostics because all the major players are in different segments of Diagnostics. And many of those segments vary drastically in terms of the margins. But when we look at it, we certainly expect to get back to industry standard profitability, if not industry leading profitability over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dan, that was important. Now, Andrew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I have to sit near the front next time. It's Andrew Benson, Morgan Stanley. Three quick questions. Erich, you've told us how thin and productive Roche is. I have to say that when I think of the peers Roche isn't necessarily the first company that springs to mind as necessarily being thin. Could you remind us the size of your US primary care sales force? And also remind us how many people from Roche attended ASCO this last year? My point being that my perception is there is a very deep wedge indeed which Roche could address to mitigate some of the revenue pressure?</p>
          <p>Secondly, could you touch upon the incremental returns on adding to the existing Avastin field force? What I am trying to work out is, what is the relationship there? Have we reached a threshold? Or can you continue to grow the market and return to a positive by adding more men? Again, trying to address productivity.</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, obviously taspo has not been a pleasant experience for either you or investors. You've taken forwards your CETP inhibitor well ahead of Merck, especially given the light of what's occurred with <mark type="inaudible" /> and Pfizer and the safety signals from a first generation compound. So I guess, what I'm getting at is do you think you have sufficient competent and thought leaders internally in the field of cardiovascular and metabolism compared to your legacy businesses of oncology and then before that, neurology? Is there sufficient talent and how many &#x2013; is it time to actually add to the existing talent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Erich it's up for you, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, I think that's definitely for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question, the primary care team, we have about 750 people in the primary care team in the US. But we also have still a primary care team in Europe. We still have a primary care team in France, in Germany. We don't have one in Italy. We have one in Spain, in Greece. We have primary care teams in Europe, across Europe. 750 in the US. So I guess if your point is &#x2013; if your question is what are we going to do? I guess I can only give you the same answer as before and always, we are exactly looking at it now.</p>
          <p>And certainly one &#x2013; there's a number of scenarios that I cannot totally disclose unfortunately today. But we're looking at the scenarios, and then we'll make a decision in the next few weeks, couple of months or so. But it is clear that one of the scenarios is for a substantial resizing realignment of the sales force.</p>
          <p>As far as the comment on the ASCO, we certainly can reduce the number of people going to the ASCO. Actually, I reconsider that. I proposed that the other day. But joking apart, the ASCO is a very, very important event for accompany like ours.</p>
          <p>And I can tell you 100% of the &#x2013; or I hope at least, certainly all the people what I see going at the ASCO work for what, they come out of the ASCO, they are exhausted. Because they've gone from meeting to meeting with customers, with other firms, with internal meetings, because people have come from around the world. And people keep working the whole week, because it's a unique opportunity to spend greater time with your customers and make decisions et cetera. But it is clear, the message is clear. We -- there is potential for productivity improvements across the organization, and certainly we commit we will work on those and do it.</p>
          <p>The second question was -- the third question was the CETP. I think you have to make a difference between diabetes and cardiovascular to start with. Diabetes and cardiovascular are two -- you cannot put them together. I call them cardiovascular or cardio metabolism. But in fact, the thought leaders, if you want our different people both out there in the field, in hospitals, but also internally in the company. And on balance, we have a lot more cardiovascular -- cardiovascular expertise than we have on endocrinology or metabolic expertise inside the company.</p>
          <p>I'd like to start with the Head of Global Development, Hal Barron, who's a cardiologist by training. He doesn't show it too much, because he knows oncology very well. But he is a cardiologist. And we have a number of cardiologists that have joined us from different companies. Do we have enough expertise? You never have enough expertise, and certainly we have less expert in cardiovascular than we have in oncology for obvious reasons, size of the business. But I think in cardiovascular, yes, we do have quite a bit of expertise, clinical expertise. On dalcetrapib per se, we have a strong team. I have to say this is &#x2013; this clearly is a strong team as people come from other companies. And clinically we also have a very strong team.</p>
          <p>You have to realize that a lot of the data that has been published and presented lately about CETP inhibition, the dalcetrapib product -- our product, the nerve compound all this work has been done  at family at Roche, and has been led by people at Roche who really are expert in the field of lipid. So I think yes. Now it is still a very risky project, there's no question.</p>
          <p>You also had a question about Avastin sales force. To be honest we can always adjust an oncology sales force. But in the US which is the largest market, even in the US, sales force is 150 people. So it's never a huge size. So in oncology the cost is not in the cost of your sales force. It's in the cost of your clinical activity et cetera. But in primary care for sure we have large numbers of people.</p>

          <p>And maybe Andrew, still to add something, you know that since many years we are constantly benchmarking our sales not only to the pharma industry, but also to industries outside the healthcare business where cost pressure is even deeper. And one role model of how we cut step-by-step our base is definitely our production network. But you see -- I kindly invite you also to respect. We maybe have a special projects program where in many countries the governments are our main customers. And you may also understand in tense times that employment is a very sensitive issue. And we have just actually gotten rid of 2 more factories and you don't hear anything. Maybe the show effect of announcing new 300 more people are gone would have been nice and would have been gone -- maybe half of a stock market day. But on the other hand, we might have had the respective authorities knocking on the door and say, how can you actually layoff people in these difficult times and still demand prices. So I think we understood your message very well. And I think Pascal has given you very clear hints or commitments that this is not just something which is business as usual. And we are working extremely closely together with his team and my team to step-by-step convince you by facts and not by announcements.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Erich. Perhaps with this, we'll take one more question, because we then have to spread out to the various sessions. Here on that side, the gentleman please.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Severin. Mark Becker from Fidelity. This is a question once again on primary care. On your slide 53, where the NME submissions are, it's very clear taspo now moves over to post-2013. So I now have 3 drugs to be filed post-2013. And in 2013, the year itself, we have dalcetrapib. It's very clear if dalcetrapib is positive, you have an enormous ability to leverage in the primary care sales force. In the scenario that it doesn't exist, to carry the weight of the sales force, how many of the 3 diabetes drugs are required for you to justify a primary care sales force presence? It can't be 1, but is 2 enough?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean the answer is really to get full productivity out of a team &#x2013; out of one team in 2 products. But ideally having 3 hands because what happens especially in the United States &#x2013; in the US market, you need to reach &#x2013; meaning like, you need reach out to doctors, but you also need frequency. And you cannot have the same person going back and seeing the same doctor every week or so. And in some cases frequency in primary care in the United States can be up to 40 visits a year. That's the way the market is today. It might change in the future, but today it's still living with relatively high frequencies. So you need whole teams. So if you want to completely optimize 3 products is ideal, but certainly 2 is fine.</p>
          <p>But the point is that having &#x2013; you &#x2013; I think moving forward we have to, as an industry and certainly we are &#x2013; that's what we are looking at right now, is can you come up with another model and invent a &#x2013; come up with a different business model, where you do part of it yourself. You partner the rest to &#x2013; or you outsource your sales force. So there's a number of options in terms of how you can do this. You can totally scale up yourself, which is something I've done in the past personally and that's the way most companies would have done it in the past. Moving forward, we'll need to come up with maybe a model that's a little bit more flexible, so that we can adjust to how many products we have in our portfolio. But, the net-net the answer is 2 is the right number, 2 products.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Thank you for your interest. With this, we split out into various sessions. If I just could let you know that Erich and myself, we will remain here. Diagnostics will be in the Room Metal. Pascal, for Pharmaceuticals in the Room Green and we have an accounting session in Room [indiscernible (120:16). I would suggest that reconvene in 5 minutes. Thank you very much.</p>
