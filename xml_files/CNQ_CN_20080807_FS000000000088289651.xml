          <p>Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Canadian Natural Resources Second Quarter 2008 Conference Call. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. John Langille, Vice-Chairman of Canadian Natural Resources. Please go ahead Mr. Langille.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator and good morning everyone. Thank you for attending this conference call giving us the opportunity again to review our second quarter results for 2008 and a review of the development of our ongoing projects.</p>
          <p>Participating with me today are Allan Markin, our Chairman; Steve Laut, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Doug Proll, our Senior Vice President of Finance; and R&#xE9;al Doucet, our Senior Vice President of Oil Sands.</p>
          <p>Before we start, I would like to refer you to the forward-looking statements contained in our press release, and also note that all dollar amounts will be in Canadian dollars and production and reserves are both expressed before royalties unless otherwise stated.</p>
          <p>Before I turn the call over to Allan, Steve, R&#xE9;al, and Doug, I would like to make a couple of initial comments. Our operating results as you can see in the press release in the second quarter surpassed our budgeted expectations as we saw firstly our Canadian production volumes for both natural gas and crude oil exceeding the top end of our guidance range, while our international volumes were well within our guidance ranges.</p>
          <p>And secondly, strong realized prices for our commodities, especially in heavy oil where the strong demands for diesel product has continued to lower the discount from the benchmark WTI price for our heavy oil. These two factors contributed to Canadian Natural achieving very strong record quarter cash flow of over $1.8 billion, a 23% increase from the comparable quarter in 2007. On a barrel of oil equivalent basis, the cash flow amounted to $35.86 per BOE [Barrel of Oil Equivalent], which is a 31% increase over the comparable 2007 number. This shows we are also well in control of our cash costs.</p>
          <p>Our adjusted net earnings from operations increased to $960 million in the second quarter, a 61% increase over the second quarter of 2007. And of course this cash flow and earnings from our conventional operations will soon be augmented with results from our oil mining assets. Extreme volatility in the benchmark pricing for both natural gas and crude oil has being experienced in the past month, and we will, as always, continue to pursue focused capital discipline to ensure maximum returns are being realized from the development of our very expensive and strong asset base.</p>
          <p>With that Al, would you like to make a few comments before you turn it over to Steve.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You bet, John, thank you. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for this early conference call. And thank you especially, all the hard working craft and staff up at Horizon.</p>
          <p>These are exciting times for Canadian Natural. 2008 certainly has been the year of execution as all of our major projects proceed and near completion. Phase I of the Horizon project has entered final construction, commissioning, and start up. And we will soon begin to realize the benefits of the largest single capital project in Canadian Natural's history. The Primrose East expansion, which is targeted to add 40,000 barrels a day of capacity, is coming in ahead of schedule. First steam is targeted for this September, versus the previous target of Q4 '08. And first production is targeted for Q4 of this year versus the previous target of next year in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>The other major projects located in Offshore West Africa proceed, as restoration of shut-in production at Baobab in Offshore C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire continues, along with the Olowi project in Offshore Gabon. With first crude oil production there targeted for late 2008 to early 2009. As part of our defined marketing strategy for our heavy crude oil, Canadian Natural has committed to ship fixed volumes on the proposed Keystone pipeline U.S. Gulf Coast expansion, running from Hardisty, Alberta, to Port Arthur, Texas.</p>
          <p>We have simultaneously entered into a supply agreement with a major U.S. Gulf Coast refiner. These agreements represent a significant step in unlocking the value of Canadian Natural's vast heavy crude oil reserves. It is a simple and cost effective strategy to unlock the value of a barrel of heavy crude oil and reduce the volatility historically experienced in the heavy crude oil market.</p>
          <p>With the Keystone XL agreement, Canadian Natural will retain full ownership of the resource while gaining access to a very key market for Canadian heavy crude oil. We are at the threshold of the next step in our evolution as we await the production volumes of synthetic crude oil from Horizon, the volumes of heavy crude oil from Primrose East, and the light crude oil from Offshore West Africa, combined with the rest of our conventional assets, both crude oil and natural gas, we are on track and confident in our ability to deliver the future of the company to our shareholders. Thank you. Steve?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Al, and good morning everyone. As both Al and John have pointed out the second quarter was a strong quarter. Both oil and gas production exceeded the top end of our production guidance in Canada and at Horizon we are very near the end of construction and well into our phased startup of Horizon. Both R&#xE9;al and I will give you a more detailed description of the activities of Horizon in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Our cash flow for the year looks to be up significantly in the 7 to $7.5 billion range due to higher commodity prices than expected, particularly oil and heavy oil pricing. Costs in our conventional business are on track, but we do see cost pressures coming this quarter and in fourth quarter; however, the recent softening in gas prices may temper this somewhat. The additional cash flow we'll use to pay down debt, cover the additional costs we are projecting for Horizon construction and commissioning, as well as additional capital costs in Offshore West Africa.</p>
          <p>Now turning to each product, and I'll start with oil in Canada, and particularly heavy oil and thermal oil, as we believe our heavy oil assets are the most undervalued and underappreciated assets in our portfolio and are really the hidden gem in our portfolio.</p>
          <p>The Primrose East development, which has been schedule to inject first steam late 2008, and bring on 40,000 barrels a day of heavy oil in early 2009, is on cost and ahead of schedule. We now expect first steam in this September, and potentially we'll see oil coming back in November, and likely December, and our latest projections see an additional 15,000 barrels a day in December.</p>
          <p>At this point, from a cost schedule and reservoir point of view, Primrose East has been a top decile project execution. And from what we can tell, we expect production volumes to comfortably meet our expectations. Our ability to successfully execute Primrose East, the second phase of our defined plan to bring onstream 325,000 barrels a day of incremental oil from our vast heavy oil assets, enhances our confidence and bodes well for our future phases.</p>
          <p>At Kirby, our 45,000 barrel a day third phase, we are in the regulatory process, with approval expected in 2009. We are currently out to bid in our final stage of engineering for the Kirby facilities.</p>
          <p>At Pelican Lake, our world class pool with 2.8 billion barrels of oil in place, is a significant resource as we all know. With polymer flooding we can take recoveries from 5 up to 25%, or an incremental 560 million barrels of low cost incremental oil. Our polymer flood expansion continues on track and is delivering as expected, adding significant value for Canadian Natural shareholders.</p>
          <p>Primary oil drilling is on track and meeting our expectations, as we continue to high grade our inventory to capture the high oil prices we are experiencing today. And heavy oil pricing levels are extraordinary. In July, the heavy oil differential was 14% of WTI, and August looks like 13% of WTI. The diff now stands at about 13% and is less than half the 32% differential it averaged for 2007, with 120 to $130 oil price today, versus $72 in 2007. Truly extraordinary pricing levels for heavy oil.</p>
          <p>Now as you've read in our press release, Canadian Natural has committed 120,000 barrels a day of pipeline capacity on the Keystone XL project, which will transport Canadian heavy oil to the Gulf Coast. In addition, we have entered into a supply arrangement at Gulf Coast prices with a major Gulf Coast refiner for 100,000 barrels a day of Canadian heavy oil. This arrangement also allows Canadian Natural the option to acquire pipeline capacity or 10% equity. This pipeline is expected to be complete by Q4 2011 with initial capacity of about 400,000 barrels a day.</p>
          <p>Gaining access to new heavy oil markets, and in particularly the Gulf Coast markets, the largest refining market in world, is a significant step in Canadian Natural's achieving our second phase of our three-phase marketing plan. The pipeline arrangement allows Canadian Natural, and in fact the entire Canadian heavy oil industry, to increase heavy oil production without oversupplying the Midwest market, and severely widening heavy oil differentials.</p>
          <p>In effect, this pipeline agreement and our supply arrangement allows Canadian Natural to proceed ahead with increased confidence on our thermal heavy oil defined plan, that 325,000 barrels a day of incremental oil, unlock that vast potential of our heavy oil resources, and create tremendous value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Turning to gas in Canada, our gas assets are very strong and our production exceeded the top end of guidance. Our gas volumes have held up remarkably well considering we drilled only 175 gas wells in the first half of 2008. Our gas inventory is deep, and with our dominating infrastructure and very strong technical and operational teams, we can add significant value from our gas assets in a relatively quick and effective manner. However the relative economics of gas and oil need to move to more normal levels before we will choose to do so.</p>
          <p>Just commenting a little bit on gas, as one of largest landholders in BC, we are well positioned to capture the significant value from the emergent shale gas plays in the Montney, Muskwa and <mark type="inaudible" /> shales. In the Montney in particular, we have over 70,000 acres of prime shale gas lands. That being said, we have virtually no exposure to the Horn River Basin which has generated much of the recent excitement.</p>
          <p>Turning to our international operations, which provide light oil balance and some of the highest return on capital projects in our portfolio. North Sea production was down in Q2 as we stated in our Q1 call, as we successfully completed a major turnaround 23 days at Ninian South. In Q3 and Q4 turnarounds will happen in Ninian Central, Ninian North and Murchison, which will keep volumes flat in Q3 and Q4. Overall, we continue to implement our mature basin strategy by optimizing waterfloods, in-fill drilling, workovers and recompletions, to maintain production capacity, adding reserves, and extending field life.</p>
          <p>In Cote d'Ivoire, our deepwater rig has experienced some drilling issues that have added 15 days to our schedule. The first well is now complete; however, at a shorter length and the rig will now move to the second well. We have a one-year contract &#x2013; as you know &#x2013; for this rig, and depending on our effectiveness, we anticipate bringing on at least three of the five wells shut-in due to sanding. Obviously, we used up some of our float in the schedule with the first well, and currently we have about 8 to 10,000 barrels a day of oil shut-in.</p>
          <p>At Olowi, our development in Gabon is still on track. Our jack-up rig has completed the first of two delineation wells, both of which came in to our base plan as expected. We set the template for the first platform and now are driving piles to secure. The conductor supported platform being built in Sardinia is near completion; however, was scheduled to be completed before August to avoid the Holiday Season in Italy.</p>
          <p>The CSP [conductor supported platform] deck is now scheduled to sail September 20th, soon enough to meet our schedule; however, challenges exists in meeting that schedule, as you can imagine, in the Holiday season in Italy.</p>
          <p>The FPSO [Floating Production Storage And Offtake] is in dry docks in Dubai, and is scheduled to sail in the end of October. Everything is on track there, although the schedule again is pushed. We would expect to sail there in the 1st September but now we are pushed. Again, we are on track to deliver first oil in late 2008, early 2009, ramping up to 20,000 barrel a day. We have planned for some float in the schedule, and this allows us to meet the schedule even though we have some delays in the tower and the FPSO. Really you can see worldwide that construction activities are meeting with severe delays and we have done well on managing the delays for Olowi.</p>
          <p>Now Horizon and before I give you &#x2013; ask R&#xE9;al to give you an update on Horizon, our world-class oil sands project, I'll make a few comments. At Horizon, Canadian Natural has achieved a significant milestone as we finalize construction and bring on the staged startup of operations. We are now beginning to see the fruition of the largest capital project in Canadian Natural's history. This is a major step in our evolution from a very strong company to an even stronger more sustainable company.</p>
          <p>As you know, Horizon Phase 1 will deliver 110,000 barrels a day of light sweet, 34-degree API crude with no decline for 40 years, with virtually no reserve or replacement costs going forward. And as we begin a staged startup of Phase 1, it is important to point out that we have future phases planned to develop the 6 to 8 billion barrels of oil that we have on our lease, and that will ultimately bring production levels to just under 500,000 barrels a day, or 0.5 million barrels a day. Clearly, a world-class project that will create huge value for Canadian Natural shareholders.</p>
          <p>Our staged startup consists of seven stages.</p>
          <p>The first stage, mining, we're ready to go. We've been in operation since May, and continue to move overburden. We are just waiting the first call from the extraction team for oil sands delivery.</p>
          <p>On steam supply, our utility plants are all up and operational and the last high pressure steam was delivered in the third week of July.</p>
          <p>On a bitumen production side, we are ready to go with first bitumen production targeted for early September. We are in the final stages of commissioning now and expect early September for first crude oil production.</p>
          <p>The co-gen will deliver full electricity load in the second half of September. The sulphur plant is ready to go mid August, and will circulate amine awaiting the first delivery of sour gas.</p>
          <p>The delayed coker and diluent recovery units, which will provide partially upgraded oil production will be ready to go at the end of September and deliver our first partially upgraded oil to tanks at the end of September.</p>
          <p>As far as light sweet synthetic oil goes, our naphtha hydrotreating plant is completing loop checks and insulation concurrent with commissioning and is targeted for the end of October. Gas oil hydrotreating plant is just finishing the punch-lists, loop checks, and heat tracing and we are commissioning as well. We expect the first oil from those two upgraders to come in just outside the fourth quarter, and give us estimated capacity of 70,000 barrels a day, and this will allow us to meet our scheduled prerogative ramp up, although we are little late on the startup.</p>
          <p>Our distillate hydrotreating plant, Plant 42 was purposely pushed back in the schedule, so we can concentrate on Plants 41 and 43, the naphtha and gas oil. It is in final completion of the mechanical stage right now. We are doing heat tracing and installation and loop checks and it will be ready to go later in the fourth quarter and bring our capacity to 110,000 barrels a day of light sweet crude oil maintaining our previous product ramp-up schedule.</p>
          <p>As you can see, we have started up Horizon and we have done that successfully. We are pushed out because of the hydrotreater which is on the critical path. It's just outside of Q3 on the Plant 41 and Plant 43. Considering our target startup date of Q3 was set back in 2004 and a rapidly changing environment and in particularly the very challenging environment we've seen in last two years, it is a very solid achievement for our teams at Horizon to be starting up in Q3.</p>
          <p>As you will read in the press release, we had completed a thorough review in the last two weeks of July of our schedule and our cost forecast. We've seen at the level of mechanical completion, as construction complete stage has not been as high as we expected. This has resulted in longer than expected punch-lists or deficiency lists, and as you know the productivity in clearing these punch lists is low and has had a knock-on effect with instruments, loop checks, and insulation.</p>
          <p>The bottom line, it has pushed the startup of the hydrotreaters outside our Q3 startup target and resulted in an 8% cost increase from our last estimate of 8.7 billion to 9.27 billion.</p>
          <p>And lastly, before I turn it over to R&#xE9;al, I would like to thank all our teams working on Horizon for their dedication, innovation, perseverance and hard work. And without this tremendous effort we would not be starting the staged startup today. R&#xE9;al, can you give us a...?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve. First of all, before I start to go into the detail of each of these plants I would like also to tell you people that we have achieved a significant milestone in the oil sands here, by getting very close to 25 million man hours without a lost time accident, which means for our plant here, even though we have at one-time peaked here close to 10,000 people on site, we work for over a year, in fact, we worked over 15 months without losing a one day of lost time. This is quite an outstanding record in the oil sand actually when you compare to the standard achievement here so and we are very proud of this. In doing so, also we have accomplished what we were set out to do and I will start by bringing you through the process of this entire plan how we've commissioned these plants.</p>
          <p>So starting with the mining, we have commissioned also in the second quarter two more electric shovels, so now we have four shovels total running out of five. The last one is coming up here within the next two weeks. We have also 16 trucks already in operation out of 23 and the other 7 are on site already here and they are ready to go, it's just that we don't need them at this time.</p>
          <p>So, the mine also in terms of manpower and equipment and so on has been running now for a few months. We have been moving overburden, opening up the phase for the oil sand, and in fact we are ready to go. We have them in power and we have the equipment in the mining.</p>
          <p>The new step now is into the ore preparation plant. So, the ore preparation plant has been commissioned already. Everything has been turned up and so on. And as a matter of fact, here we will dump the first truck of tar sand here coming up this Saturday. We'll have a small ceremony about this. So, this is going quite well.</p>
          <p>The <mark type="inaudible" /> of the ore preparation plant has been run on water, and also is ready to roll. When we move on, the pipeline has been also commissioned on water. The extraction plant also has been circulating water and is pretty well already right now. We're still finalizing few of the control mechanism and so on. And very shortly, we will be also in a position to get the tar sand through the extraction plant.</p>
          <p>We are finalizing now the froth treatment plant. So, in the froth treatment plant we have the cyclone and we have the inclined plane settlers. We are starting in fact this weekend to run some water through, finalizing the punch list and so on. And this plan also will be ready here probably within a couple of weeks.</p>
          <p>So, by the end of August, beginning of September here, it looks like we're going to be in a good position to produce diluted bitumen. And to do this of course, we need a diluent. The diluent has been brought in, has been put in through the intermotive tankage. The tankage were ready.</p>
          <p>If you remember last time, we had a bit of a critical <mark type="inaudible" /> tankage. While we've done some strategic move there and the tankage are all ready to receive the diluted bitumen. The diluent is there. The diesel also to start the upgrader is on board here now. And we have all the tankage we need for intermediate and also for final product.</p>
          <p>So, continuing along with this, going into the primary upgrader, so the primary upgrader mechanically completed, electrically completed, instruments completed. We've done the hydro test. We've done the walkdown. We're completing right now a few loop tests on it and by the way, all this done also out of our main control room. So, we are in September here pretty well ready for all the functions and all the operability of that plant.</p>
          <p>Going into the sulphur plant and the hydrogen plant, those two plants also are ready. They have been commissioned. As a matter of fact, we have the flare going right now, so we do have a bit of flame up there. And the hydrogen plant also has been commissioned. So, it's within operation now, so hydrogen is ready to supply hydrogen, and the sulphur plant is ready also. We have a sulphur pad that we are finalizing. The pipeline has been completed. The pad itself is being completed now. The spreading tower that goes on these pads are coming up. One is built and the other one is going to be built here within the next two, three weeks. So, that's not an issue either. So that sulphur pad will be ready.</p>
          <p>Looking at the utility side, and I'll keep the hydrotreater for the end, because I have a bit of detail on that. On the utility side, the water has been circulated everywhere, all the pumps, pipes, fire water, process water, cooling water, and also the heat integration system, which is a whole bunch of exchangers and so on, all those have been commissioned now, and they are also in operation. We had water circulating all the way down to the pond and we had our siphon system, which is the return of the water to have our re-circulations and reuse of the water is also fully functional. So, all these areas are now in operation.</p>
          <p>The steam, same thing. All the borders are up and we have been producing low-low steam, low steam, medium steam, and high pressure steam for the commissioning. The pipe rack has been fully commissioned now on air, on water, on gas, nitrogens, and the nitrogen plant also, by the way, has been commissioned as well. So, we do have blanket area for the tanks, intermediate tankage and the final tankage and so on. So, that's also ready for operations.</p>
          <p>Now, talking about the hydrotreating. There are three plants in the hydrotreating. So, naphtha hydrotreaters, the diesel hydrotreater and the gas oil hydrotreater.</p>
          <p>So, starting with the naphtha hydrotreater, that plant is mechanically completed, electrically completed, and we have loop checks to complete, and within two weeks this plant will be mechanically all done, turning into operation. As a matter of fact, operations are already underway, the walkdown, and starting up next half of that plant, which is all the utilities going around and so on will be commissioned. So, this plant is well on its way right now for sometime in September, here being ready to accept the oil.</p>
          <p>Looking at the gas oil plant, which is the second one to come on stream. The mechanical completion is done. In other words, all the pipe, piping, spools, modules, all those kind of things, it's all welded in place and so on. We also have run just about every electrical cable too, there is few left, but very few, and we are now &#x2013; we've done also the hydrotesting, the air blows on this, and most of the walkdown, also with operation has been just about there. So, finalizing on that plant is the control loops and we are taking our time to do it very safely. We want to make sure that the plant, when we start, is going to run reliably and safely throughout. So, just to note here on this, as a matter of fact, we have taken more time to commission the plant that we were anticipating to start with.</p>
          <p>So, all our procedures are in place. We want to make sure that step by step these plants are commissioned the right way. If there is any deficiencies, any punch list to complete, we take our time to do them right, and eventually we have the plant running on a very safe manner. We have accomplished a very high safety record so far, we definitely don't want to lose that head start here for us.</p>
          <p>The third plant, which is the diesel hydrotreater. It's very close to mechanical completion. In fact, I think there is only a few spools left and within a couple of weeks they will be completed. We are also having a major ramp up now into completing the cabling, and the termination for it, and doing the loop check. This isn't the highest priority right now, Plant 43 and Plant 41 are the priority which is the naphtha and the gas oil.</p>
          <p>Now I want to explain something here in terms of our staged startup. We can run this plant with the naphtha and the gas oil plant and produce a 100% spec SCO, which is a 34 EPI, <mark type="inaudible" /> SCO. The main reason for this is because the gas oil plant that we have will run the diesel and the gas oil mixed in there.</p>
          <p>As you know, that the SCO is a mix of gas oil, diesel and naphtha. So, naphtha being a light end has to run through its own catalyst and its own reactor.</p>
          <p>However the diesel and the gas oil can run quite efficiently actually through the gas oil plant, and that's what we're going to do.</p>
          <p>So what we have in fact is when you run the gas oil to its capacity, we can produce combined with the naphtha plant about 50 to 70% of our total production or 60 to 70,000 barrel a day of synthetic crude oil. So the advantage of this of course for us was to &#x2013; let's focus on Plant 43 gas oil, and the naphtha, and get the production going. And then we can take the demobilized resources from these plants, then to Plant 42 which is the diesel.</p>
          <p>All three plants as a matter of fact, are planned to be done here sometimes before November. So if we've looked at this in terms of winter startup and we're quite comfortable with this. We do have expensive heat tracing in our plant and insulation. This plant is made to run in the winter. It is made to stop and start also in the winter. And by November, we will have all our heat tracing and insulation completed.</p>
          <p>We will also have already the naphtha and the gas oil plant running sometimes in September and October, each of them. And by having those, we have heat circulation, and you know that this plant is very well heat integrated throughout. So, we don't see a major issue for us here starting this plant in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The ramp up of the plant was originally set up to have 80% of the production by year end, 100% of the production at the end of the first quarter of '09. We will be very, very close to this. As a matter of fact, will have 60 to 70,000 barrel here in the fourth quarter. And there is also a good probability that we will have 100% of the production here before yearend, and we will have just the duty of stabilizing the plant here in the first quarter of '09 and to continue our production reliably.</p>
          <p>So, we are very well positioned right now to get these things rolling. The plant is rumbling right now. The people are very excited about it. We sure want to sometimes moderate the enthusiasm of the operators so that they are very enthusiastic about starting the plant early and so on. But we want to do it the right way, and we want to make sure that we are safe at the end of the day, and once the plant is started, we are reliable.</p>
          <p>So that's pretty well what the situation is right now in the upgrader. So, for you Steve.</p>

          <p>Thanks, R&#xE9;al. And I guess you can see why we are very confident in our abilities to hit our dates. We had given the ranges here. We expect to start, as R&#xE9;al said. We are also very cognizant of the fact that there are things that could happen that we don't expect. You can have a mechanical failure in some part &#x2013; long lead item, that we don't expect, could happen. So we have to give ourself a range on startup. That's why we're conservative with our times.</p>
          <p>As you know, the start up of Horizon is a major positive step for us in our ongoing evolution. It will shift, and Horizon will shift from a large consumer of conventional free cash flow to a large and sustainable contributor to Canadian Natural's cash flow. As a result, our balance sheet will strengthen quickly, cash flow available to allocate to capital projects will increase dramatically, allowing Canadian Natural not only to unlock the huge value associated with the future expansions at Horizon, but the significant value of our high-quality conventional assets.</p>
          <p>Overall, we're in great shape. Our conventional assets are delivering. We're in the startup stage of Horizon, our balance sheet is strong, and with our strong team and dedicated people, we are set to ramp up to the next level, much higher level, of value creation and delivery for Canadian shareholders. With that, I will turn it over to Doug to give you the highlights on our strong financial position.</p>

      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve, and good morning.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter of 2008, Canadian Natural generated over $1.85 billion of cash flow from operations or $3.44 a share, reflecting, in particular, strong commodity prices, narrower than budgeted heavy oil differentials, and our strong production base. For the first six months of the year, Canadian Natural generated nearly $3.6 billion in cash flow, which closely matched our capital expenditure program for the first half of 2008. The ability to match cash flow with our capital programs reflects our commitment to financial discipline and controlled capital spending.</p>
          <p>The second quarter's net loss of 347 million resulted from net un-realized after-tax expenses of 1.3 billion, which included the effects of our commodity price risk management program. Excluding these items, adjusted net earnings from operations for the second quarter increased to 960 million. As we have previously discussed, the opportunity cost which has arisen from the commodity price risk management program has been more than offset by the long-term value created in our asset base by allowing the conventional oil and natural gas business to continue to grow, while at the same time, allowing for the development of the Horizon project.</p>
          <p>As cash flow from our conventional operations continues to be strong, we will look forward to the addition of the Horizon project's cash flow, which will allow for a managed debt reduction program in 2009, and the development of our asset base. As announced and discussed earlier, we are experiencing additional cost pressure at Horizon. Even so, our goal is to manage through it and exit the year with a debt-to-EBITDA of less than 1.5 times, and a debt-to-book capitalization of between 40 and 45%, below or within our targeted ranges of 1.8 to 2.2 times, and 35 to 45% respectively.</p>
          <p>Our liquid resources remain strong with available unused bank lines of $2.7 billion at the end of the second quarter. This liquidity, combined with the plan to balance cash flow with capital expenditures, demonstrates our financial discipline in a year which will see us complete four major projects. Thank you, and I will return you to John for some closing comments.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. I joined a little late so I apologize if you discussed this earlier, but I was wondering when you think about next year and you think about the winter natural gas drilling program, how fluctuations that we've seen in natural gas prices affect your thoughts on the aggressiveness of drilling? And just some thoughts on interplay between spending for oil and Horizon stage II versus spending for natural gas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Brian; Steve, here. Obviously, we're looking at our capital allocation and we'll start our budget here for 2009 in September, but we're just sort of looking at it carefully now.</p>
          <p>I think it's pretty clear that the returns for oil are significantly better than gas, even at the higher gas price. With gas prices softening and what we see the gas rates in the U.S. lower 48 increasing, we are concerned that we will see further softening of gas prices. And if they do rebound, they may not rebound to levels that will be required to compete on a capital allocation basis with oil, particularly in 2009 in Alberta with the increased royalty regime. Alberta gas projects will have a very, very difficult time, and I think you will see the gas drilling in Alberta decline markedly in the industry in Canada.</p>
          <p>As far as allocating between further projects in Horizon and our oil projects in Canada and in international, I would say right now Pelican Lake has very much the best drilling. We've got a very disciplined defined program there that we'll continue to execute. We don't see the need to ramp that up or slow that down. We're just trying to keep our cost effectiveness where we are.</p>
          <p>Primary heavy oil drilling, very much we can dial that up and dial that down with our inventory, and I expect you'll see us more likely dial that up as we go forward.</p>
          <p>On Horizon, we are very disciplined. We have Tranche 2 that we are well under way, we didn't talk much about that at all today in the call. But, we are well on our way in Tranche 2. We'll look at approving Tranche 3 as we move forward.</p>
          <p>The one thing that we do see here in Fort McMurray, in particular area is the cost escalation of the availability of contractors, and I would say the lack of competition for people to bid on your projects has had a more significant impact on cost increases than even we would have anticipated.</p>
          <p>Internationally, we see &#x2013; again, see big cost pressures there worldwide. With high oil prices, there is a big demand for rigs and all the associated services. So, most likely the area you'll see us go, if we're going to increase capital going forward, increase drilling, would be in primarily heavy oil as well as thermal heavy oil, which is more on a disciplined program. So, primary heavy oil, where you see the flexibility.</p>
          <p>Very long answer to a short question.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. And I might follow-up with one more short question, which is do you see your gas rig count between &#x2013; I guess throughout Canada &#x2013; down year-on-year this winter, or how do you see that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now, I think it's in flux. I would have said probably a month ago that you'd see that the drilling go up, particularly in B.C. Now, I'm not totally sure we're going to see that happen with the softening of prices. I think B.C. will still be very strong, particularly the shale gas plays. Alberta, I don't believe will be.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning, guys. Just wanted to get your latest thoughts on hedging and whether you'd be inclined to do more natural gas hedging for next year, or oil hedging, or just let the position you have now basically run off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. With our hedging, as you know, we won't have the same capital requirements in 2009 as we have had in the past four years with the coming on-stream of cash flow from Horizon.</p>
          <p>And &#x2013; so, that will mitigate to a large degree the amount of hedging we will need to do. We will, however, continue to monitor the markets and look for opportunities to lock in prices. Right now, I think the positions you see will continue through. If we get better opportunities, particularly like you said on natural gas, we will take opportunities in that regard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say, Andrew, now it doesn't look good to hedge gas. It looks like a soft market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And, do you think you'll do any pilot well testing in your Montney acreage over the next year or so, or just basically hold that in inventory until we see some stronger gas prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We got two wells down now that look good, we'll probably drill two to three more wells here in the second half of '08. Depending on the success there, we'll &#x2013; these are all in B.C., by the way &#x2013; we'll likely drill more wells in 2009.</p>
          <p>Of course, that all depends on the capital allocation relative to economics, but we think we have some of the best prime lands for Montney shale development in B.C. And, so, we'll slowly and carefully make sure we got it right before we go to a full scale development.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from David Thomas of Highside Capital Management. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Steve. Two questions. First, on the new pipeline deal you guys announced, when I look at the schedule for the heavy oil assets ramping up, you got Kirby coming on in 2011 at 45,000 barrels a day. You were next scheduled for Birch Mountain, 60,000 barrels a day in 2013. Are you guys going to pull any of that forward given that now you've got the capacity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, we are as you know a very cost-focused company, and we believe that the best way to control costs is to be very disciplined in the project execution, and we're running all these projects through the gated process. We'll make sure we have our engineering complete and all the regulatory approvals obviously ahead of time so that we can essentially almost become like a cookie cutter operation going from one project to the next.</p>
          <p>So, for us to accelerate, I think there's a possibility we could do that, but it's something we won't do, because that's when you get into cost escalation when you try to go before you have all your engineering completed. So, we won't do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, then, just a follow-up on Brian's question. On your conventional asset base, you guys are spending around $2.5 billion. You've got that conventional asset base this year doing 7 billion in cash flow, which makes you quite different than the majority of the E&amp;Ps, which are pretty much spending all their cash flow; you're spending a small fraction of it. And that number with Horizon, let's just take consensus estimates, goes up to 10 or 11 billion next year at a $100 oil.</p>
          <p>I mean, at some point here &#x2013; I'm wondering how, from a CapEx point of view, you're going to be in a position where you're going to be significantly under-spending where you are on an operating cash flow basis and that's why I asked the question on thermal oil. What are the options for what to do there? How much can you &#x2013; where can you accelerate, and if you can't, I guess is the idea just to pay down debt and look for acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, David, we have a number of opportunities in our portfolio. The first opportunity really is to pay down debt. We're going to get our debt down to very strong levels. We will then look to do more oil drilling on the primary side. We have other projects in Offshore West Africa that we will look to go to. We also, as you know, have a very big exploration project, a biggie exploration project in South Africa. That's a very expensive shot to take.</p>
          <p>The gas program will &#x2013; obviously, we have a bunch that's economic at this point in time, because we have a dominant infrastructure, we have a very tight land base and we are low cost. So, we have &#x2013; a lot of the inventory in the gas side is economic, but just doesn't compete with oil. So, we will be able to allocate more to the gas program, particularly in B.C. as we move forward.</p>
          <p>We also can look at competing to buy back shares. And, as you know, we have always been an acquisitive company, and that's been about half our growth, and we have as is known bought Anadarko right during the Horizon construction phase. We are not adverse to looking at more acquisitions, particularly if it makes sense with our asset base, and we can see upside. So, you can't pound on those, but we always are looking particularly for asset acquisitions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And, then, last question, Steve. Order of magnitude, looking into 2009, I know you guys haven't done the budget, but what level of '09, 2010 CapEx will Horizon take?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now, what we have approved is for Tranche 2, which is about I would say in $700 million range. There is some sustaining capital and obviously operating cost. But, on the capital side, just the &#x2013; about 700 million on Tranche 2. We will look as we move into the last half of 2008, or last quarter of 2008 I should say, to approve Tranche 3, which would probably take another 700 [million] to $1 billion depending how quickly we move to allocate to Horizon for Tranche 3.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, just so I get the numbers right, you are spending 2.5 billion on your conventional asset base, we add another 750 or so for Horizon next year, so call it 3.3, and consensus numbers for cash flow are going to be 10 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are going to see us probably allocate probably an extra $1 billion to conventional assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Those are all preliminary numbers, we'll shake it all out here in the fall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, then we'll have &#x2013; so that would be another 5.5 or 6 billion left in operating cash flow or free cash flow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Steve, I was just wondering on the heavy oil side in the supply agreements that you've negotiated. What's changed here that I guess you being in one form or another trying to negotiate this kind of agreement for a number of years? So, I was wondering if you can give us some insight as to what's changed, what's brought the refiners to the table, and if can also give us some insight in terms of the pricing mechanism you'll receive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Brian, what's changed really and we've seen that over some time here is that there is obviously some concern or anxiety I would say in Gulf Coast refiners on the security and supply from Venezuela, and the drop in supply from national declines in Mexico. They can see that there is a large and secure supply in Canada that can be pipeline connected. So, I think there is a motivation for them to get supply and that has allowed us to get together.</p>
          <p>This is a strictly market deal. So, we will get paid essentially mine differential or whatever the heavy oil prices are in the Gulf Coast. So, there is no other mechanism at all. It is strictly market price sale &#x2013; buy and sell.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what's your transportation cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our transportation costs are not being disclosed at this point in time. Obviously, that's part of the arrangement we have with TransCanada.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, second question and circling back to the gas questions you're receiving. What kind of recycle ratios are you seeing now on natural gas in Western Canada versus primary heavy oil and thermal heavy oil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the gas recycle ratios are 2, maybe a little bit less. The softening in prices, which would be instantaneous, you'd be below 2. We see recycle ratios on heavy oil depending where you are and what field and what product or degree of heaviness, you're either 9 or 14 degree API, anywhere from sort of 5, up in some cases to 10.</p>
          <p>So, we get very, very quick pay-outs on heavy oil, particularly primary heavy oil in these prices. We're making in excess of $90 a barrel for heavy oil, which nobody would ever have dreamed of three or four years ago.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thanks. Couple questions. First, just on the hydrotreaters, is there anything specific about what's left to be done that should cause us some concern as we move closer towards winter? I know everything gets more difficult out there as the temperature drops. But, is there anything that is left to be done that is much more difficult in the winter months that could cause, if the schedule slips a little bit more, more significant delay into 2009?</p>
          <p>And, then, the second question is just on the debt. I know Doug you provided some color on your debt targets by the end of the year. Can you give us any sense for next year in terms of what you are looking at for debt reduction? You still have that sizeable term loan outstanding. Is the intention as of now to pay that down out of cash flow prior to its maturity in October 2009? And, if so, can you give us a sense for initially where you think debt-to-cap or debt-to-EBITDA might stand during 2009?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">

          <p>Hey, Harry. R&#xE9;al, I'll answer up this question about hydrotreaters and by the look of it you guys are trying to get the 2009 budget out of us before we even do it. So, I am not sure how much Doug can give you.</p>
          <p>But, on the hydrotreaters, really, it's Plant 42 or the diesel hydrotreater that's at risk for cause of cold weather issues. And, as R&#xE9;al said, most of the mechanical completion will be done. That's probably going to be the most effected by piping and electrical instrumentation, all the outside work will be &#x2013; that will be the most effected, but I think we'll have that mostly done. So, it would be really the loop checks and insulation. And, if we're running hot and we got heat tracing, insulation is not the highest priority. So, I don't see a big issue there. R&#xE9;al, you want to give a little bit more color and probably a much more definitive answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. First of all, yeah, you're right, Steve, it's Plant 42 because the other ones are going to be in operation in '08. So, in this plant, what could have been a critical one would have been the hydrotesting for example, because you do that with water or glycol.</p>
          <p>For example, last winter, we did a lot of hydrotesting on some of the plant already that we were starting to commission and we have done them quite successfully with glycol. So, there was no issue. However, in this plant, here in Plant 42 all the hydrotesting, the air blows and so on, to close-up the plant will be all done here well before December anyway. So, that should not be an issue.</p>
          <p>But providing if we have, for example, an early cold weather in October or November, we would use glycol and that would be an issue. What would be left at the end is the loop check, and so on, which are really electronic kinds of things. They're all done internally. In other words, in the heated environment. And, the termination which is also most of them, the external one like to the instrumentations are done, it's the one going into the control rooms and all those kind of things. So, we don't right now foresee any major issue.</p>
          <p>The plant itself will start first of all on nitrogen, and then it will start on hydrocarbon, which is already hot. So, we don't foresee a really major issue of starting up even if we have a few cold days here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Harry, I guess just to add to that, we are &#x2013; the only issue that could push a cost out for us here I would say is an unusual event which we can't predict. We've run all our pumps and motors in most of the hydrotreaters now. So, we don't expect to see issues there. But, you never know once you start to run it up that you could see an issue somewhere in the plant with a pump or motor that maybe a long-lead item and could cause us some delay and extra expense.</p>
          <p>So, with that, I'll let Doug give you the rest of the 2009 budget that we haven't done.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Steve. So, you are absolutely right, we have the $2.3 billion payment that's due in October of 2009, and we're looking at that number. I guess there's two ways I would answer that. Number one is, the numbers that was worked out of Steve previously, where we will have sufficient cash flow and we will be allocating a good portion of our cash flow for 2009 towards that payment.</p>
          <p>The other thing that I would mention is, I did say that we had $2.7 billion of unused lines. And, of course, if &#x2013; we could also use our existing lines to retire that debt. But, it would be our preference to retire it from cash flow.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I have a few questions related to Horizon. I just want to make sure I've got this right, because are you essentially saying you're a couple months behind, but hope to get caught up before winter and basically stay on track?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically, it's really &#x2013; as you heard R&#xE9;al describe it, most of the stuff is going to be done in the first part of the quarter, and most of the plant is running and starting up as a staged plant before we get close to winter. So, it's really just the hydrotreaters that we are a bit concerned about.</p>
          <p>Plant 41 and 43, the gas oil and naphtha shouldn't be an issue. Plant 42 will be the one that's at risk for winter startup, and we have a choice there, if we feel it's really too cold, to delay it even longer if we want, because we will be able to run close to 70,000 barrels a day with the two hydrotreaters that we'll have in operation.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Could you tell me &#x2013; I know that you might have discussed this before, but in terms of heavy oil and regular oil, at what prices is it profitable for heavy oil and regular oil to be at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a very good question. It's all depending on the cost. We you see cost escalation out there with rising oil prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>At today's prices, let's say.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At today's prices &#x2013; costs &#x2013; you mean?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say for heavy oil, I would think we are, particularly at these low differentials in that 50 to $60 range, for thermal oil, I'm going to say 60 to 70. Pelican Lake is probably lower than &#x2013; probably in the low end of the 50s. That's going forward for those types of oils.</p>
          <p>And our light oil drilling in Canada is not that much, so probably we wouldn't give you number there. I think you probably need to be in the $70 range to do North Sea drilling, and in that &#x2013; with our prospects probably about 60 to $70 oil range in Offshore West Africa.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>60 to 70. Okay. And do you foresee that oil, the heavy oil and the other oils that we're talking about that they will &#x2013; that the prices that we're seeing now, what price do you have in your model as to where oil is going to be going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, right now, we run our long-term price in the 70 to $80 range WTI.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; differentials a lot higher. Going forward here, I expect differentials will rise from the 17% we have seen in the second quarter and 13% we see today, probably up closer to that 30% level where it's been historically. So, that's what our long-term view is.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I had a question for you on the next tranches of expansion at Horizon, basically Tranches 1 through 4, I guess. When we think about Horizon Phase I costs coming in just north of $80,000 per flowing barrel, and the industry looking at costs for projects in 2010 to '12 between 100,000 to 150,000 per barrel &#x2013; and I recognize some of the next phases, your initial stage had some of the costs incorporated in that for the next phases &#x2013; what might be a reasonable expectation, you mentioned costs are higher than you previously expected. What might be a reasonable expectation for a range per flowing barrel for the next several tranches at Horizon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, we're doing this in tranches so we can get better cost control. But we are seeing our ability to control costs, to have an effect on the market, to be lessening. So, our range now, I think a reasonable range would be to use between 90,000 and maybe 120 or $130,000 per flowing barrel.</p>
          <p>I think when we got up to the 120 or 130,000 barrels a day we'd have to think very carefully if we'd proceed at that point. The only way some of these things are going to get more in line is either the capacity in the contracting side of the business or service side of the business and construction side increases, or activity decreases before you get more rationality in the cost side of the business in Fort McMurray.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Steve, if you'd say 120 to 130 might give you pause, is there an oil price at which you'd be comfortable going ahead at those price levels, or is it just the fact that those numbers are too inflated, too big?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The thing we'll have to think long and hard about at those costs levels is at what price, and these are 40-year projects, what is the long-term price? I would hate to build in a 120 or $140 WTI cost world, and then produce the product out at a $60 world for the next 40 years, when you can take your time and do it at a lower cost.</p>
          <p>So, that is the debate we'll have to have when we get to Tranche 3, Tranche 4, to get to the full Phase 2-3, build-out as well as Phases 4, 5, for Horizon to get us to just under 0.5 million barrels. I would expect at each decision point, we will have that debate as towards costs and what our future outlook for oil is and that's a very dynamic discussion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And it sounds like Tranche 1 and 2, because those are lower capital tranches, that those are a go-ahead and the decision point on that might be on Tranche 3 or 4. Is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tranche 1 is complete, Tranche 2 is under construction right now or is approved, Tranche 3 is coming up here shortly for approval. So, it will be for Tranche 3. I would expect Tranche 3 and 4, actually do have a cost advantage, because we pre-built in Phase 1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, maybe we'll look at it. We'll obviously look at it, but there is less risk on Tranche 3 and maybe more risk on Tranche 4, but it's going to be definitely there for Phases 4 and 5. But those are out some time period, so we'll have a better feel for further costs and for what we believe the prices will be going forward. It's a very difficult question to answer, to try to predict the future.</p>
