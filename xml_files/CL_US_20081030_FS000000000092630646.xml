          <p>Please stand by. We are about to begin. Welcome to today's Colgate-Palmolive Company third quarter 2008 conference call. Today's call is being recorded and will be simulcast live at www.colgate.com. Just a reminder, there will be a slight delay before the question and answer session begins due to the Web simulcast. Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Bina Thompson. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Duane and good morning everybody and welcome to our third quarter 2008 earnings release conference call. With me this morning are Ian Cook, President and CEO; Steve Patrick, CFO; Dennis Hickey, Corporate Controller; and Ed Filusch, Treasurer.</p>
          <p>We will discuss our results and expectations, excluding charges relating to the 2004 restructuring program and certain other items in the first nine months of 2007. In addition, we will also discuss organic sales growth, which is sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, and divestitures. A full reconciliation of these measures with their corresponding GAAP measures is included in the press release and the company's financial statements and is posted on the investor relations page of our website at www.colgate.com. So we will be glad to answer any questions you may have, including or excluding these items as you wish.</p>
          <p>We are very pleased to report a solid quarter, especially given the current uncertain external environment.  Market shares are healthy around the world. Business continues to be robust in the high-growth markets such as Latin America and Asia, which has helped to offset some of the slower growing economies in Western Europe and North America.</p>
          <p>Organic sales were strong across most divisions, up 9.5% worldwide. This is the best organic quarterly sales growth in over 10 years. As you know, we have taken meaningful price increases in the third quarter to offset the unprecedented increases in commodity costs we have seen throughout the year. This, as you would expect, has resulted in some temporary slowdowns in volume as consumers have worked down there pantries. Our experience is that this type of slowdown generally lasts for a quarter or so. Accordingly, we expect volume to be up some more in the fourth quarter than in the third, particularly at Hill's, where the biggest pricing was taken.</p>
          <p>Overall, organic sales are expected to grow at current levels for the balance of this year and into 2009. So while commodity cost pressure remained significant in the quarter and should abate only slightly in the fourth quarter, we are encouraged that the recent decline in oil and other commodity prices if sustained should provide a meaningful benefit starting in the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>As we said in the press release, this should fully offset the anticipated negatives from foreign exchange, and in addition, we continue to achieve good savings from our ongoing Funding the Growth programs as well as our restructuring and business building programs. Importantly, this should allow us to continue to support our business with strong levels of advertising while increasing profits as well and all these bode well for delivering continued strong results.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet and cash generation are strong. We've continued to issue commercial paper at attractive rates and have had no difficulties in this regard. Our pension plans are well funded, and our overall liquidity position is very sound. Again, this is most encouraging in the current macroeconomic environment. So let's turn to the divisions.</p>
          <p>Volume in North America grew slightly. We have witnessed some pantry destocking on the part of the consumer, particularly as our price increase in toothpaste was realized on the shelf. However, we are still seeing dollar growth in all our categories and in addition, private label levels for most of our categories still remain low at mid-single digits or less. Our market shares are level or up in 10 of 12 of our categories. And as you read in the press release, our toothpaste and toothbrush shares are doing well, fueled by new product activity as well as our continuous investment in multiple media &#x2013; TV, print, and online. On the new product front, we're very excited about Colgate MaxFresh with Mouthwash Beads, which shipped to customers in the third quarter. This, along with the Colgate MaxFresh toothbrush, provides consumers with a regimen approach to fresh breath.</p>
          <p>In fabric conditioners, our Suavitel brand achieved record <mark type="inaudible" /> in the market overall, 35.4 and 13% respectively. We told you last quarter about our launch of Palmolive Pure and Clear dish detergent. That along with our new eco+ automatic dish detergent and Murphy's Oil Soap provides a cross-category eco platform which we are supporting with an integrated PR program, shopper marketing activities, and joint displays in store. We'll be shipping some very exciting new products in the first quarter 2009 in toothpaste, toothbrushes, liquid hand soap, body wash, and deodorants.</p>
          <p>So looking ahead, volume in North America is expected to be up low single digit in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2009. Organic sales are anticipated to grow mid single digit for the same periods. Operating profit is expected to be up modestly in the fourth quarter and up mid to high single digit for the full year 2009.</p>
          <p>Europe. The macroeconomic situation in Western Europe remains challenging for us as well as for other consumer products companies. Despite this, our market shares are doing well, especially in the higher margin categories such as oral and personal care. We see some indication that our business in Germany is improving. Our toothpaste share is up almost one full point on a year-to-date basis, subsequent to a complete relaunch of our base business, which included price increases. Similarly in dishwashing liquid, we relaunched our Palmolive brand with a more premium price position, and our share is up 80 basis points year-to-date to 15.8%.  In bath and shower gels, our share is up nicely with good momentum in the most recent period.</p>
          <p>In the UK, we reached a record toothpaste share of over 50% in September, and in Australia our toothpaste share is now 70%. We told you last quarter that we had launched Magic Moments Fabric Conditioner in France, Greece, and Belgium, and as it has done in Mexico, this new product has met with good success in these European countries as well as with increased market shares in all countries.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, volume in Europe is expected to grow very modestly for the fourth quarter and for 2009, with organic sales growing low to mid single digit for the same periods. Operating profit is expected to be down in the fourth quarter, primarily due to negative exchange. For full-year 2009, operating profit is expected to be up low to mid single digits.</p>
          <p>Turning then to Latin America, markets in this region continued to be quite strong and we are still seeing good category growth. In fact, in Mexico and Brazil, we are seeing growth rates accelerating from 2007 levels in certain categories. Our market shares have increased in toothpaste, toothbrushes, mouthwash, bar soap, liquid soap, and hand dish across the region. Our toothpaste business is healthy across the region. Colgate Total is continuing to gain share behind strong support, a focus with the profession and constant innovation. The new sub-brand, Colgate Total Pro-Clean achieved a 2% share in the latest reading, adding incremental share to the Colgate Total franchise.</p>
          <p>In addition to the strong performance in toothpaste in Mexico, referenced in the press release, other countries enjoy a good share gains as well. In Brazil, our toothpaste share is up almost 2 points, reaching nearly 70% of the market. Venezuela reached the prestigious 90 club with a share of 90.4% in the most recent period, and in Colombia, our year-to-date share is up almost four points.</p>
          <p>In addition to good regional share gains in toothpaste and toothbrushes, we have had very good success in mouthwash with our year-to-date share up over five points, closing the gap with our nearest competitor by a full 10 points from two years ago. Our market shares have increased in virtually every country, driven by strong innovation supported by full media and in-store activities.</p>
          <p>Our regional bar soap share increase over a point year-to- date, climbing to a leadership position from almost an 8-point gap three years ago. In the most recent period, our share rose further to 27.3%. Both the Palmolive and Protex brands contributed to this success. As you know, Protex is a brand with an antibacterial positioning that we sell throughout the emerging markets. Protex had its outstanding results in many countries in the region, and in Brazil, achieved a record 10 share in the latest reading.</p>
          <p>So looking ahead, volume in Latin America is expected to increase at third quarter levels or slightly higher for the fourth quarter and for full year 2009 as well. Organic sales should be up mid-teens for the same periods. Operating profit is expected to be up high single digits and as a percent of sales in the fourth quarter, and is expected to be up double digits in 2009.</p>
          <p>Greater Asia Africa. This division delivered another strong quarter as markets throughout the region continue to show solid growth, despite economic difficulties in other parts of the world. The toothpaste markets in China, India, and Russia are all growing at double-digit rates. Our toothpaste shares are up across the region as referenced in the press release. In India, our share is even with the prior year on a year-to-date basis and is up in the most recent period. A new Colgate MaxFresh advertisement accompanied by an integrated marketing communications plan is helping to drive the positive recent MaxFresh shares. And we also continue our equity enhancing consumer engagement activities along with oral health months for the overall Colgate equity.</p>
          <p>In Russia, our Colgate toothpaste share is up 50 basis points on a year-to-date basis to 33.8 and is at a record 34% in the most recent period. In addition, the launch of our GABA products in the pharmacy channel, which we mentioned last quarter, is going well. That has been supported by promotional and market research activities.</p>
          <p>Our toothpaste shares are doing well also. In India, our year-to-date shares of 290 basis points over the prior year, approaching 40%. Much of the gain comes from our lower priced Colgate Super Flexible toothbrush, which is aimed at the large lower income population in both the rural and urban markets. In Russia, we continue to strengthen our leadership position, up 320 basis points on a year-to-date basis, reaching 50% of the toothbrush market in the most recent period. Other countries showing good toothbrush share gains are Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Turkey. Market shares are steady in our priority category of shower liquids, with particular focus on the Eurasian countries. In Russia, for example, our shower gel share is at its highest level ever, up 220 basis points year-over-year, to over 30% with further gains in the latest readings.</p>
          <p>So looking forward, volume in greater Asia Africa is expected to increase high single digits in the fourth quarter 2008 and for full-year 2009 as well. Organic sales should increase double digit for the same periods. Operating profit is expected to increase double digit, up absolutely and as a percent of sales for the fourth quarter and full-year 2009.</p>
          <p>Finally, Hill's. While Hill's overall sales growth was strong, volume itself was negative, primarily impacted by the timing of price increases. This year, we took selling price increases, effective July 1, which drew volume out of Q3 and into Q2, as our customers made forward purchases in advance of the announced FCIs. However, in 2007, we took price increases effective October 1, drawing volumes out of Q4 and into Q3. The net effect was an unusually high volume in the third quarter of last year and an unusually low volume in the third quarter this year. Volume in the fourth quarter is expected to increase low single digits.</p>
          <p>As we and other pet food manufacturers have taken quite significant price increases to offset the steep rise in commodity costs, we have instituted a new program in the U.S. and Europe to clearly communicate the value proposition of Hill's Science Diet to pet owners. The program, called Feeding is Believing, focuses on the power of precise nutrition and the actual low cost per day of the product. The integrated marketing plan reaches the consumer through pet magazines, online advertising, consumer brochures, and coupons, as well as a variety of point-of-purchase materials, including shelf talkers, shelf laminates, counter mats and sidewalk signs. Results so far have been very encouraging.</p>
          <p>As you know, one of our very successful prescription diet products is Prescription Diet j/d, which treats arthritis and joint problems in dogs. Based on consumer insight that showed about 50% of dog owners believe their dog has mobility problems and yet were unaware of any food solutions, Hill's Europe offered a trial program which would give consumers firsthand experience on how Prescription Diet could help improve their dog's mobility. The 21-day challenge provides consumers approximately one month of Prescription Diet j/d diet JD at no charge. Vets are provided with the trial bags as well as consumer information to help them discuss mobility problems and explain how Prescription Diet j/d could benefit their client's dog.</p>
          <p>As soon as a consumer enters the trial program, they receive e-mails every week during the trial period to reinforce the importance of compliance during the trial period. As a result of the program, year-to-date market share for Prescription Diet j/d is up 10 points, and volume has increased by 48.5%. So following successful European results, Hill's U.S. has also launched the program, expanding to 3500 additional vets in September.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, volume in the fourth quarter and for full-year 2009 is expected to increase low single digits. Organic sales should increase double digits for the same periods. Operating profit is expected to be up mid single digit for the fourth quarter and full year 2009.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we are pleased with our results for the third quarter, particularly in these challenging and uncertain times. We feel strongly that our strategic focus and geographic diversity positions us well for future growth. Our four strategic initiatives, with which you are all familiar &#x2013; getting closer to the consumer, the profession, and our customer; efficiency and effectiveness in everything we do; innovation everywhere; and most importantly, leadership at all levels of the organization; provide a clear direction for our 36,000 employees around the world. We have a strong senior team and a deep and broad bench of future leaders who will work together to continue to deliver solid results.</p>
          <p>So, Duane that is the end of my prepared remarks, and I would like to open it up now for questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>[Operator's Instructions]. We ask initially that you limit yourself to one question to allow everyone an opportunity to ask a question, and you are welcome to reprompt for additional questions. Our first question will come from Nik Modi with UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Nik.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question is on the pricing, given the magnitude of some of the price increases. How are you protecting your market share in your key markets? Are your competitors falling? Can you give us some perspective around that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me make a few comments, Nik. First of all, relative to competitive pricing moves, yes, these commodity cost impacts are, I think, and affecting all manufacturers in the categories in which we do business and we are seeing competitors take pricing at similar levels to us across the board. Obviously, there can be a little bit of a lead lag, 30, 60, 90 days in terms of the pricing getting to the shelf, competitor to competitor versus ourselves. But in the main, we are seeing everybody take price to similar levels, and we are seeing that pricing move to the shelf, and what we have experienced is that you do see some slight pantry destocking by the consumer as they wait for the pricing to settle on the shelf, and then they come back into the marketplace. That is the kind of flow we have been seeing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Ian, just a follow-up on that, I guess &#x2013; and correct me if I'm wrong, but are you guys pricing to offset some of the currency devaluations in your key emerging markets? In that environment, how does the competitive pricing look with your key competition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That has always been a factor for us in parts of the world where currency deval impacts. So that is a normal course of business, and that effect is felt by all people in those markets, so the answer is yes in both cases. But relative to our pricing so far this year, we have offset through pricing the dollar impact of the raw materials. It is our savings and other initiatives that have allowed us to limit the pressure on our gross profit through this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question will come from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You obviously have been through this a number of times in emerging markets, but can you just sort of talk about how the consumer environment differs from the commodity environment, stock market environment, and the currency environment down there, and how it relates to emerging middle class and people's consumption rates? I know it is a big question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is an economics question, Bill. I think the answer would be, it is always interesting to me, as I travel the world into those parts of the world, how attuned consumers are to marketplace events relative to currency and how that will affect pricing in the marketplace. You know we have very well-established processes in place, honed in Latin America in terms of how we respond to deval, in taking our prices up. How we have elevated list prices for many of our products so that we don't get caught in price freezes, if that is where governments end up going. We find consumers are very well attuned to managing in those environments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and how about the emerging middle class? Are you seeing a slowdown in people entering that consumption class, or not yet, or you don't expect to see it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We certainly don't see it yet, Bill, and we certainly don't see them stepping out of the trade-up strategy that we have been putting in place. So the Colgate Total's of this world continue to do well in Brazil. Our market share continues to do well in Brazil. So no signs at this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question is from Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, how are you? Question about SG&amp;A, down here 90 bips, it looks like. It looks like you probably were aggressive on overhead reduction; I know we had talked about that earlier. Could you help us disaggregate that 90 basis points, in terms of the overhead versus maybe not growing your advertising spend as quickly as your top line it looks like. Just flesh that out a little bit if you would please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we take the quarter, the SG&amp;A for the third versus prior year, as you say, down 90 basis points, we see the majority of that coming from advertising. Overhead was down about 20 of those, and the rest was advertising, which is a reflection of two things, Ali. What we have seen around the world is that if you break it into its geographic components, we're seeing traditional advertising spending weaken in Europe and the U.S., particularly if you take out the presidential spending. I think that would be intuitive to many. And we're seeing advertising spending, the traditional advertising spending continue to increase in the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America, although at a decelerating rate, while still quite healthy. And that's how our advertising spend has profiled so that we remain competitive in those markets in our categories.</p>
          <p>I think a second point that is important to make here &#x2013; and Bina mentioned it in part with Hill's &#x2013; there is no question, and we have talked about this several times, that we have increased our focus on in-store communication, which is the place where, depending on the category, 60 to 80% of final purchasing decisions are made, and in some cases, added a value message to that communication through these times. So spending consistent with what we're seeing in the market and a shift in communication focus to retail with a value message added, as Bina exampled.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful; in that context, just as a follow-up, if you zoom in a little bit on North America margins, looked down obviously year-on-year. And I guess I'd assume that it was from some of the new product launches that you mentioned in the press release, and certainly Bina kindly went through earlier on in the call. But is that not the case then? Is there something  going else in the margins in North America beyond increased advertising for the new products? Maybe it's just commodities, but I just want to get an understanding of that one in particular, please</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You captured it in your question, Ali. It's the commodities impact directly in the U.S. marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks very much guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll next go to Wendy Nicholson with Citi Investment Research</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Wendy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question has to do with the pullback in raw material prices as we go to 2009. I know you've reflected the outlook for gross margins to go up to reflect that, but are you expecting, particularly in something like the Hill's business, where commodities are a particularly important part of the cost, to have to either roll back pricing or simply increase promotional levels? And have you begun to do that or see that in any of the big categories?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To start with the last part of the question first, the answer is no. Working back from that, we are in the midst of our budgeting process right now, so we haven't fully finished. I think I have said before that if the commodities come back, and indeed the visibility we have says that they are, then we will certainly not be in a position of needing to take new pricing at the kind of levels we have seen this year, which if you go back three to four months, was still part of our planning, so I think that comes off the table.</p>
          <p>The question then, Wendy, is what will be a compelling value communication at retail, and how will you continue to keep the categories that are still growing in the United States growing at healthy rates? And I think that will be a combination of promotion and other in-store communication techniques.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>And your confidence in putting out the target for double-digit EPS growth in 2009, even though commodities &#x2013; excuse me, foreign exchange has moved as quickly as it has in so many of your big countries, I assume comes from that expectation of being able to drop those gross margin savings to the bottom line?</p>

          <p>It' all a balance, Wendy. Obviously, as we think about foreign exchange for next year, we're thinking about it through the lens of what we've seen over the last week or so, and today, we're thinking about oil in that 70 to $80 range for next year, but, yes, I think we feel we will capture the benefit, and we will manage our promotional activity as we see fit across the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, my question is about pricing in Latin America. If you look at history where there have been big devaluations, the local currency pricing accelerates, but that doesn't seem to be in your guidance, because you guided to organic sales up in the mid-teens in the fourth quarter and '09, and you actually have a little acceleration in volume. So could you comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We talked about organic growth holding at about the same levels as we saw this quarter for the balance of this year and into next. As we look at pricing in Latin America, our current look at next year for all of the Colgate divisions has the Latin pricing higher than all of the other divisions. So I think we are reflecting it. We will finalize it when we complete our budget process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So your local currency &#x2013; your organic sales growth in Latin America should be accelerating, right? To offset the worsening year-over-year currency hits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have seen some of that in the pricing that is already in this year that will roll over, and it will be again a balance between volume and pricing in Latin America, probably not unlike this year's level, maybe a little bit ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then my other question is about the destocking in North America. Are you seeing it by consumers and retailers? And then also, does there come a point next year when that is kind of done with and we face comparisons against quarters in 2008 when that was happening, so we get a little volume acceleration in North America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Alice, relative to retailer destocking, as we have said many times before, that is an ongoing aspect of business, obviously heightened during these kind of times, but worked through in partnership, and there is nothing we have yet seen that is a significant dislocation in that regard. In the consumer case, what you see is &#x2013; and we have seen it both with Hill's and in some of our other consumer categories &#x2013; is consumers work down pantry inventory until the pricing stabilizes at shelf and then comes back into the category, and I think that is what we will see going into next year.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, can you talk about what your actual currency assumptions are? Because I mean, obviously it looks like your top line impact for '09 can hit you by anywhere as much as 8 to 9 to 10%. I'm just trying to understand what the bottom line impact of what that currency might be, given that you don't really hedge a lot on currency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have got a spread looking at next year, Chris, of about 6 to 8 on currency. And we are seeing volume in the 3 to 4 range, as we have said. The difference will be price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, but is there a way to &#x2013; given you are a U.S. company, your costs are probably more balanced or more exposed to the U.S. dollar than your revenues are, and maybe that is wrong and maybe you can clear that up, but I would have expected the EPS or the earnings impact from currency to be a greater percentage than the top line impact. Is that right?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to follow-up on the Hill's pricing and the volumes in the current quarter, do you have a sense or is there any way to gauge market share changes? Is there any worry about pricing consumers out of the category or out of your products with some of the recent price increases you put through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, market shares have been okay. And we have seen consistent with what we saw in the fourth quarter last year the beginnings of a dollar comeback in terms of consumption at shelf. I think the additional step we have taken, giving all of the pricing that we and others in this segment have put into the marketplace, is the communication program at retail and direct-to-consumer that talks about the clinical nutrition of Hill's and the real value of that for consumers' pets on a relatively low day-to-day outlay basis. So that's I guess the answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess with that, it sounds like the price gaps are not that different than they were before the price increases were put through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On a relative basis. Although as a leader, we lead in pricing, and as I have said before, you sometimes get a little bit of a lead lag before all competitors are fully moved their pricing as well. But ultimately, relative levels stay about the same.</p>

          <p>First thing was on this value message advertising for Hill's. I was curious if you were doing anything similar with any of your other brands in any markets at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sometimes at retail levels, but not in the same way, given the relative cash outlay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and the more real question was about Europe. I just thought it was interesting, volume down in France, Italy, UK, and for GABA. If you could talk a little bit about category trends, is it more personal care, home care, or oral care? Is it the category or just Colgate who's gaining share? At some point, one would think Europeans would start buying this stuff again. And talk a little bit about the outlook there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure. Let's do a little bit of a world roundup but come back to Europe. As I said earlier, still seeing categories, and this is specifically the profile of the categories in which we do business, so not the overall market. Growing on a dollar basis in that 2.5 to 3.5% range, which is probably half a percentage down on a dollar basis year-on-year. In Europe, and this is the combined Western and Central or Eastern Europe, we are seeing categories continue to grow, down a little bit on prior year, and it is more helpful to go into the breakdown.</p>
          <p>From a Western European point of view, we are seeing in constant currency, we are seeing category growth rates across the businesses in which we do business in halved. So against a prevailing 3% growth rate, running at about 1.5%. Interesting, the profile is more favorable to oral care, which continues to run in a 2 to 3% range. Personal care, which is in a 1.5 to 2% range, and household care, more flat.</p>
          <p>In Eastern Europe, we are continuing to see double-digit growth rates, again favoring more oral care and personal care. So the consumer is staying with us, although at a more muted level, and I think going forward, they will continue to stay with us, and hopefully, we can stimulate the market enough to see that growth rate pick up a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then so in the markets where you said your volume was down in the press release &#x2013; so I guess that's Italy, UK, etc. &#x2013; who is it then that's gaining share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and would you expect category growth to resume? Because it looks like you are now getting some pricing, so one would think volume &#x2013; I mean, at some point, there has to be more toothpaste being sold or household cleaning or you know.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think quite well. We talked about the organic growth continuing to be in the same range that we have seen in the third quarter, and you are right, Connie, you don't get the full benefit of the commodity given inventory, etc., but we will see a little bit of improvement. And obviously, we are very focused on our overhead area as we go forward into the fourth quarter. And our advertising spending will be competitive with what we are seeing in the marketplace, but continuing to see a strengthening shift to the in-store and keeping our consumer advertising competitive with what we're seeing in the markets in which we do business. But the focus is a little bit of benefit on the gross profit and a continued sharp focus on overhead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the mid-teens sales growth that you have seen on a year-to-date basis, does it slow to something sort of low to mid-single digits in the fourth quarter? That is on a reported basis, not organic.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>That probably is the one area obviously we're sharply focused on, because as we all see at the pump, that scenario that is translating through more quickly than other commodity prices, and we have seen a bit of a pickup. The ratio to sales of that is 10 basis points down versus prior year at 7.7% of sales. It's been coming down every quarter, and we obviously will be hoping to continue that trend into the fourth and certainly into next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Just a follow-up on a couple of questions we've seen before; given the focus on the material piece as an offset to currency, can you talk a little bit about how the rest of your commodities are trending? Procter mentioned some commodities were still up dramatically year-over-year. Most of the companies seem to be saying that it's taking a little bit longer than at least I think Wall Street expected for the lower prices to flow through. Can you give us just a little bit of commentary on both of those issues? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we're seeing obviously the impact in the third quarter was a little bit more than we were expecting, but I think we had talked about that the third quarter would probably be the toughest quarter. I must say, as we look at the most recent pricing on our key raw materials, we're seeing it pretty generally across the board down on quarter three levels. Whether it's fats and oils, whether it's resins, or of course the input to energy costs. So what we're looking at is down from the third quarter. Now what you say is right, John, obviously, there is a lead/lag between the spot and what we can negotiate at and when you will see that in the income statement. But as we've been looking at it, we think we're going to start seeing that benefit in the first quarter of next year given the work through.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. I'm looking back at your earnings growth in the early part of the decade when there was some turmoil in Latin America, you actually had really strong earnings growth. It was in the mid-teens I think. But when you look at how you achieved that, there was a steady decline in your advertising and promo spending ratio over that period of time. So you managed to have earnings growth, but the decline in A&amp;P spending some would argue ended up in not a good situation five years later. So can you just comment on that and your current thoughts about &#x2013; will a decline in A&amp;P ratio contribute to the earnings growth in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the way we are thinking about the earnings growth next year is obviously double-digit growth. We haven't suggested mid-teens growth. Secondly, our current look at 2009 shows an increase in advertising behind the business, both in absolute dollars and in &#x2013; and on a ratio basis. We will have to be attentive to what is happening in the various categories in which we do business around the world, but our thinking and planning assumption is that that will go up. So our planning intention is to deliver good quality, double-digit earnings growth through times that we have managed through before, with advertising spending up.</p>

          <p>Our next question is from Jason Gere, Wachovia.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning. I was just wondering if you can give us an update on CBP, just in terms of the outlook for these savings in '09, where we stand in terms of completion. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Going along very well, continues to roll out around the world. We expect as we leave this year to have about 70% of our global net sales covered by CBP, and we have again a myriad of new examples, learning examples from new markets that we have gone into that we are transferring to benefit to other markets in our go to market approaches and strategies. We still have a savings goal in place for 2008 of $100 million pre-tax, and are looking at delivering 150 &#x2013; north of 150 in 2009. And in the first quarter of 2009, we will actually bring two important markets live. They are China and Brazil, along with Malaysia and some others. But China and Brazil will go live in the first quarter of next year. So continued progress in terms of the kind of shared learnings that can drive the business, and a 150 goal for next year.</p>

          <p>We return to Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein for a follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the follow-up. Two questions; one more specific and one just a little bit kind of strategic thinking about the overall business. Again on advertising spend, you mentioned that you expect it to be going up, or that's kind of what you are thinking in terms of planning for '09. Can you talk a little bit about the &#x2013; I guess ratio between in-store or trade spend versus advertising spend? Do you see that shifting back and forth a little bit going forward? How are you imagining that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is really something, Ali, I can't answer at this stage. We literally start our budget review processes here. Next year, I will know about a month from now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess, do you expect the total of those two to go up? Can you even help answer that question, or is that still yet to be determined?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the way we are looking at the advertising for next year, we see total advertising going up. Some of the in-store stuff is captured between gross and net, so it is not improbable, but both could go up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you can't say right now gross to net expanding or contracting at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cannot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then my other question is, over the years and certainly more recently, there is still an idea among your distribution &#x2013; or among your kind of manufacturing network of bigger scale, more localized plants &#x2013; sorry more kind of consolidated, big scale plants to improve some of your scale leverage. Does that change at all in what you foresee or in this current environment right now, where currency is a little bit different, so you have a little bit of a friction there, or oil prices may not go down to where they used to be? How do you think about that going forward? Because it has really been one of the big drivers of your success over the past several years, is a lot of that consolidation and getting more scale. Does it change at all going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think so, Ali. We obviously revisit it, and we will revisit it again during our budget cycle, but we did a lot of sensitivity planning before we made those decisions, and while you say that in the broader sense, the answer is yes for oral care and personal care businesses. Indeed, there is efficiency, and it has a lot of sensitivity around it to take advantage of these highly efficient, state-of-the-art, environmentally-friendly facilities in providing our product wide world &#x2013; worldwide, although it is a wild world &#x2013; worldwide, based on the likeness of the product. For our home care businesses, we continue to have local facilities servicing regions of geography, because obviously, the shipping and transportation aspects of those kinds of home care businesses demand that kind of supply chain network. So maybe our business profiles a little bit differently than some others that would force an evaluation &#x2013; a re-evaluation, but in our case, we did a lot of sensitivity analysis around it, and we are quite comfortable with that strategy going forward.</p>

          <p>Ian, just to clarify on '09, the tax rate is expected to be roughly the same, around 33?</p>
