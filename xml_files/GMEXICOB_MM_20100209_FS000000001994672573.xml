        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Grupo M&#xE9;xico's fourth quarter and full year 2009 earnings conference call. I am joined in this conference by Enrique Nava, Chief Financial Officer of Grupo Ferroviario Mexicana; Jorge Pulido, our Head of Investor Relations; and other executives of the Company. On today's conference call, I will briefly comment on the environment of this quarter and the main issues impacting the company's profitability for 2009. Then I will comment on our Mining division most relevant results to then pass on the call to Enrique Nava, who will address the financial results of our transportation division. And finally give you an update on our infrastructure initiatives and other relevant matters.</p>
          <p>For the fourth straight quarter, most commodities continued their price recovery which started at the beginning of 2009 to finish the years strongly supported by a significant influx of investment into the sector. This resulted in average price increases of 25% zinc, 90% in silver, 50% in gold and all in quarter-on-quarter basis. The LME 2009 fourth quarter average copper price was $3.02 per pound, 70% higher than the $1.77 for the same quarter 2008, and 14% higher than the third quarter 2009. After a surprisingly strong start of 2010, we have recently seen price corrections across the base metals and other commodities, mainly based on worries about how the Chinese government's monetary tightening will impact the countries' demand for raw materials going forward.</p>
          <p>Fortunately, we have confidence that China's copper consumption will remain strong in 2010 and onwards, at the same time, the demand recovers in the U.S. and other regions of the world. These two factors should reverse the trend of double inventories and give support to copper prices for 2010.</p>
          <p>With respect to molybdenum, our main by-product, which represented about 12% of our mining division sales in 2009, price averaged $11.29 per pound in the fourth quarter '09, 23% lower year-over-year. However, we have seen a substantial recovery in prices in the last six weeks. The current price is a little bit north of $15.</p>
          <p>As you probably remember, molybdenum is mainly used for the production of special alloys of stainless steel, so its performance is benefiting from the recovery of the automotive sector and infrastructure investments worldwide. As was mentioned in Southern Copper's Conference Call, molybdenum will start trading at the LME before the end of February. We believe that should improve the market expansion and liquidity in this metal.</p>
          <p>In addition to price increases compared to the fourth quarter '08, copper production increased 9.2% and molybdenum production 25.5% quarter-on-quarter. Our mining division continued its reductions in cash cost, 163.3 cents per pound of copper excluding by-products to 134.5 cents in 2009. The cash cost including by-products was $0.35 in 2009. This improvement is a result of the previously mentioned increases in production, several cost control initiatives, and higher prices for our byproducts.</p>
          <p>We are certainly pleased to comment that the restructuring of Asarco was successfully concluded on December 9, incorporating the company as a subsidiary of Grupo M&#xE9;xico, totally free and clear of environmental contingencies and liabilities from past operations. With the addition of Asarco, Grupo M&#xE9;xico positions itself as a company with the largest copper reserves in the world and one of the main copper producers. For the reorg of Asarco, Grupo contributed 700 million in cash, and secured financing for 1.5 billion to make a total contribution to Asarco for 2.2 billion. In addition, a 1-year promissory note was delivered to the asbestos creditors for $280 million.</p>
          <p>Of this note I'm glad to report that Asarco prepaid 140 million last year so now the only debt that Asarco has is a 140 million that will be fully paid before the end of this year. The total investment of Grupo M&#xE9;xico in Asarco recovery generated a tax benefit of 1 billion to be realized in the coming quarters. Estimating an annual copper production of three, I apologize, estimating an annual copper price of 325, Asarco will generate an EBITDA of 550 million for 2010 implying for the transaction a very attractive valuation, and two times EBITDA, and significant value for Grupo M&#xE9;xico investors going forward.</p>
          <p>It is important to mention that Asarco operations started consolidating Grupo M&#xE9;xico financial results on December 10. In contributing only to our results was 22 days of operations. Now that we have again control of Asarco, we are reengineering its operations to secure all synergies and reduce its production costs. Asarco's assets are very attractive and we will do everything necessary to generate as much value from them as possible for the shareholders.</p>
          <p>We are looking at expansion targets, improved mineral recovery and a lot of things that I will discuss briefly. We are very excited about all the positive prospects related to Asarco and its future contribution to our financial results.</p>
          <p>In the transportation division, although 2009 was a very tough year, characterized by lower industrial production and consumption, Ferromex's volume only decreased 2.4%. A positive result when compared to the other Class 1 railroads in Canada, M&#xE9;xico, and the U.S., which suffered decreases of between 16 and 21%. Despite this shortfall in volume, we saw an increase in the transportation of national and North America in grain, iron ore, and services related to the energy sector. The railroad division expects to transport approximately 45.5 million net tons kilometers in 2010 with the continued increase in transported volume being the division's main focus for the year. Enrique Nava will comment on this in more detail.</p>
          <p>With regards to M&#xE9;xico's financial highlights we are happy to report that in fourth quarter 2009 our total consolidated revenues were nearly 1.5 billion, an increase of 100% year-over-year; our cumulative revenues for the year were 4.8 billion, a decrease of 20% year-over-year. This reduction is mainly attributable to lower yearly average metal prices and a drop of revenues in dollar terms in the railroad business.</p>
          <p>As copper fundamentals remained one of the most solid in the entire commodity sector, we anticipate that the good results will continue in 2010 and beyond. Copper sales for the fourth quarter was 750 million, an increase of nearly 8% on a year-over-year basis. The 2% <mark type="inaudible" /> at the third quarter '09 copper sales for full 2009 was 2.5 billion a decrease of 14% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>The accumulated cost reduction of 414 million is nearly explained by favorable inventory variances, greater productivity and lower cost of power and fuel. Also in the exchange rating factor impact our local currencies expenses.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in the fourth quarter was 693 million with an EBITDA margin of 47%. This year represents a significant improvement of 18 times the EBITDA of the fourth quarter of '08. The year's accumulated EBITDA reached 2.1 billion compared to 2.9 billion in 2008. Net income in the fourth quarter was 342 million an increase of 298% year-over-year and an also an increase of 20% quarter-over-quarter. The year's accumulated net income was 887 million, a decrease of 18% year-over-year. For the full year 2009, CapEx amounted to 617 million. 443 were spent in the mining division and 124 in the transportation division. It represents some 30% decrease of our total expenditures in 2008.</p>
          <p>Southern Copper will re-focus on its organic growth to take advantage of its ample reserve base, therefore the Board has approved a $2.8 billion CapEx program to be invested over the next three years to develop incremental production capacity. This three year program is expected to increase annual production by 342,000 tons of copper and 6,600 tons of moly along with improving the company's cost competitiveness and overall efficiencies, as the power plant generator is comprised of this budget. For 2010, CapEx investments are estimated at 1 billion, 850 for the Mining division, 146 for transportation and 26 for our infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Now, turning into debt and cash management. Total consolidated debt closed 2009 on 3.4 billion and a cash balance of 1.3 so that we have a net debt of 2.1 billion.</p>
          <p>American Mining Company, the holding company for Mining division secured a financing for 1.5 billion that was allocated in its entirety to the reorg of Asarco even though Grupo M&#xE9;xico closed 2009 with a net debt of 2.1 as a result of Asarco recovery. The company maintains a comfortable long-term debt amortization schedule and ample financing flexibility going forward.</p>
          <p>In 2010, all debt amortization payments will only be 478 million, so our current cash position was our cash generation capability <mark type="inaudible" /> still leaving room to explore potential value generating opportunities as they arise.</p>
          <p>With respect to dividends, on November 25 2009 we paid a quarterly dividend payment of $0.17 of peso per share outstanding that was roughly $100 million. For the fourth quarter of '09 the Company's Board approved a quarterly dividend payment of 14 peso cents per share outstanding that will be paid in cash on March 12, and represents a disbursement of approximately 84 million.</p>
          <p>I will now give you a quick overview of Asarco. Asarco is currently the third largest copper producer in the United States and has reserves of approximately of 5 million tons of copper content, this represents approximately 30 years of mine life. Asarco has significant mining assets which include Ray, Mission and Silver, Silver Bell mines in Arizona and we also have refining and smelting plants in Amarillo, Texas and Hayden in Arizona.</p>
          <p>As mentioned before the company is working diligently to obtain greater synergies and operating improvements. Asarco continues to reduce its cash costs, passing from $1.70 per pound of copper in 2008 to $1.74 in 2009 and we're expecting and budgeting $1.50 for 2010. We are expecting to invest 50 million during 2010 in Asarco with the aim to improve the cost competitiveness and efficiency. As an example of the type of potential improvements that will generate substantial value to our shareholders is the potential to start recovering molybdenum which is currently being discarded. Another clear example is the potential to increase FX/EW production at Silver Bell and other development we'll communicate as time goes on. These are the types of relevant opportunities available in Asarco that makes us very excited and the market is not currently valuing in our stock price.</p>
          <p>With regards to the collective bargaining agreement, we can mention that in principle we have reached an agreement with the union to extend one year the existing collective bargaining agreement under the same conditions.</p>
          <p>I will now turn to the main developments of Southern Copper. I will try to keep this brief as Southern Copper had its conference call already. In the fourth quarter '09, Southern Copper's net sales were 1.1 billion, cost of sales was 499 million, EBITDA was 616 million while this brings us back to the important EBITDA margin of 54%. And net income was 363 million for the quarter that is 16% higher quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2009, Southern Copper sales were 3.7 billion, EBITDA reached 1.8 billion and net income reached 929 million. In the fourth quarter 2009 also, Southern Copper's mine production yielded an increase across this metal complex base. Copper was up 1% year-over-year, somewhat flat. Molybdenum increased 26% year-over-year, also important to note is that 2009's full year production was 14% higher year-over-year. Silver was 12% higher year-over-year and gold was up 8% year-over-year basis.</p>
          <p>Total Grupo M&#xE9;xico copper production for 2010, that is including Asarco, is estimated to be approximately 720,000 tons, this comprised of 700 of Southern Copper and 220 of Asarco. This guidance does not include any production of Cananea whatsoever, which will definitely be a windfall when resolved.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call to Enrique Nava who will discuss the main financial highlights of the transportation division. Enrique?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much Daniel. Good morning everyone. I will now turn to the main remarks of the fourth quarter and full year 2009 results of the Transportation division represented by the subsidiary Infraestructura y Transportes M&#xE9;xico ITM, its principal subsidiaries being Grupo Ferroviario Mexicano, GFM and Ferrocarril Mexicano, Ferromex. Low volumes transported during the fourth quarter of 2009 measured in net tons kilometer was 10.3 billion compared to 9.5 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year, but 3% higher and also 3% higher quarter-over-quarter.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2009, the load volumes was 39.2 billion compared with 40.1 billion in the same period of 2008. For 2010, we estimate the load volumes measured in net tons-kilometer to move 38.7 billion representing a decrease of 1% year-over-year. However, we estimate that through a combination of tariff increases and a mixture of traffics, revenues will increase in the year by 11%.</p>
          <p>Net sales for the fourth quarter was 252 million, a decrease of 3% year-over-year but 6% higher than the third quarter 2009. For the full year 2009, net sales amounted to 920 million, an increase of 15% year-over-year. However, as Daniel mentioned sales in peso terms increased 3% compared to 2008.</p>
          <p>Cost of sales for the fourth quarter was 160 million, a decrease of 8% year-over-year. Cost of sales for the full 2009 was 609 million a decrease of 12%. This reduction was mainly attributable to the peso devaluation, higher cost, increasing activity and price, increasing diesel prices which was partially mitigated by better performance from our locomotives.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in the fourth quarter 2009 was 80 million, an increase of 10% year-over-year with an EBITDA margin of 32%. EBITDA for the year 2009 totaled 273 million, a decrease of 23% year-over-year and was equivalent to a 30% margin of net sales.</p>
          <p>Net income during the fourth quarter of 2009 reached 33 million an increase of 29% year-over-year. Net income in 2009 amounted to 121 million, an increase of 22% year-over-year. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter '09 amounted nearly 48 million a reduction of 22% year-over-year. Capital expenditures for the full year 2009 reached 124 million, an increase of 29% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>CapEx was mainly used for the rehabilitation of rail tracks, enlargements and new sidings, and the acquisition of railroad machinery, which have increased train velocity, improved operating safety and produced savings in diesel consumption. We estimate CapEx investments to be approximately 122 million for the year 2010 principally in infrastructure, renewal and the development of rail yard at Rio Escondido, Coahuila which will aid the international transportation of cars at the border point of Piedras Negras Eagle Pass.</p>
          <p>I will now briefly discuss the results of our subsidiary, Ferrosur, which currently does not consolidate in ITM. Ferrosur's total revenues in fourth quarter '09 were 58 million, an increase of 10% year-over-year. Load volumes transported in the fourth quarter 2009 measured in net tons-kilometer was 1.7 billion compared to 1.6 billion an increase of 6% year-over-year, but 2% lower quarter-over- quarter. For the full year 2009 the load volumes was 6.8 billion compared to 6.7 billion year-over-year.</p>
          <p>EBITDA during the fourth quarter '09 was 18 million, a significant increase of 67% year-over-year with an EBITDA margin of 31%. EBITDA for the year 2009 totaled 62 million, a decrease of nearly 4% year-over-year with an EBITDA margin of 28%. Net income during the fourth quarter was nearly 2 million, a decrease of 77% year-over-year, and net income for the full year 2009 reached 19 million, a decrease of 27% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>I will now return the call to Daniel.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Enrique. To conclude I will just give you a brief update on the Infrastructure division and our initiative there emphasizing what we disclosed in our earnings report. We continue to actively innovate projects that will generate synergies and create strategic value for the Group. In a move closely aligned for that strategy we acquired Perforadora M&#xE9;xico, this acquisition was completed on December 30, 2009, and we paid for it 240 million. This company has factors for both land and sea among its key assets. It has provided drilling services to Pemex for over 49 years and offers several high value added services in the industry, such as sedimentation engineering and directional drilling for both oil and water. I can also report that M&#xE9;xico Constructora Industrial is efficiently progressing in this project to build the two deviation tunnels on the Grijalva river, which started January 2009 and which is on schedule and will be completed on September 15, 2010 as anticipated.</p>
          <p>With this we conclude our remarks for this quarter, and would like to hear your questions, and operator, would you please open the forum for questions?</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Your first question comes from the line of Felipe Hirai with Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, hi, good afternoon everyone. So I have two questions, the first one is related to Asarco. Could you give us some more color on what you expect the company to have in terms of cost and production over the next few years. In other words are these investments that you are making the company going to, are you going to increase productivity or anything like that, that's my first question? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Felipe. Yes certainly, I mean first of all, the cash cost that we are projecting for 2010 is $1.50. As you know, Asarco has at this moment no real byproducts so that is the cash cost we're anticipating for this year. Obviously we're working on a plan, on a full plan in order to obtain synergies with Asarco and in order to be able to see what production increases there are. The $50 million that we've outlined as the CapEx plan for 2010, it mainly includes additions and replacements of equipment. No expansion projects at this moment.</p>
          <p>When I was referring to Silver Bell expansion it will be areas of opportunities that we have. As you know Silver Bell it's more mine that currently we have 75% and Mitsui has 25% of it. We believe there is a lot of potential for that mine, that it could double its production with an additional XCW platform. However, we are still concluding the possibility starting in order to implement that plan, so that's all there Felipe.</p>
          <p>I'll be happy to report once we have a full plan on investments and expansions there, but really what we're trying to work on is capturing the synergies and try to reduce costs. As you know, Asarco being in Chapter 11 since 2005, there were a lot of litigation expenses that were draining the company's cash. So that is no longer needed and we are working towards achieving all those synergies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and then just to confirm. Did you say that the cash cost you were expecting for Asarco is $1.50.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You also said that you expect an EBITDA of $550 million. So we were expecting an EBITDA cost of $2 a pound. Is that correct? So can you just reconcile this difference, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are doing that around 200,000 tons in order to be conservative and not at about 220. If you do a result of 220 that would be lower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so but the cash cost should be working is 1.50 then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the second question if I may Daniel is related to PEMSA, could you just help us understand a little bit more of the rationale of why you're investing in this company? What kind of synergies would you have, and if you could give us some guidance of what kind of returns and results you expect to have in this company going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well certainly, absolutely Felipe. The rationales we've been commenting is we want to beef up our infrastructure division. The Group started as an infrastructure development company many, many years ago. We've tapped the construction which has been devoted to pretty much internal projects so far, and we've been inclined to capitalize projects, we have been bidding for projects in large scale, sometimes alone sometimes in partnership with other groups. As you know we're interested in participating in Punta Colonet, Ayesca, Manzanillo. These are the kind of projects that we think that have a lot of synergies and that could create value with the current operations.</p>
          <p>Perforadora, it's also in the exploration and exploitation of natural resources. We believe that this sector will be very active in the years to come and that there is lot of potential for this company once it is under the Grupo Mexico umbrella and that's why we acquired this company. And I mean going forward we again this actually was closed December 30.</p>
          <p>This company invested last year a little bit south of $50 million in equipment for the Chicotepeq, our area, so that's what we're looking at. We currently have for this company we have the contract for a jack up platform, which is called the Sonora platform. This is a platform that has capability at 280 feet of drilling. It currently has an agreement with Pemex at around $100,000 per day, and it also has five platforms for land drilling which we are currently drilling 144, I means wells, in the Chapultepec area. That's pretty much what we will be working on next year, apart from building up the segmentation and directional drilling, which we recently acquired our own equipment, and that gives you more flexibility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, now this is helpful, Daniel. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Victoria Santaella with Santander.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Daniel. Good afternoon. I would like to get an update on Cananea and also if you can give us some color on how you are seeing this first quarter, or first half of the year from economic activity point of view, both from the railroad division and also from copper demand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, thank you Victoria, thank you for your question. I mean Cananea, and as we explained on some conference call, we are still waiting. We believe that we're in the final stages of the decision from the collegiate court, that is a three judge court, will be issued very, very soon.</p>
          <p>We feel very positive about the outcome and as you know this is the final decision regarding the force majeure that is just to remember everyone, that labor board and the court decided that because of the damages that the mine suffered, the collective labor bargaining agreement, and the individual labor agreements were terminated, and essentially we could, I mean the company could retain a different union employees that they like, whether new or old depending on company will.</p>
          <p>So that has been in several courts and we are expecting that decision to be issued very, very soon. I mean timing is very hard to predict on these issues, as you know. But we're expecting that to be, the decision to be in this first quarter.</p>
          <p>In turning to the economic circumstances, I mean I think we've have been seeing a lot of issue regarding Europe, Greece, Portugal, Spain, the dollar has been strengthening with that as you know impacts commodity sector basically because they're denominated in dollars of course. We've been seeing unemployment, although the last unemployment rate in U.S. was a big surprise for everybody I think, below 10% as you know.</p>
          <p>So, we are thinking that in terms of copper the fundamentals are there, that really we see a lack of supply, and the demand's still there, I mean Chinese are going to the New Year's break. We believe that they will restock after they come back. We think fundamentals are very strong in terms of copper and that it should be recovering from this past two weeks that the reseller price dropped. Other than that I don't know if you Enrique want to comments something regarding...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>In the &#x2013; Hi Victoria, in the transportation division we are, we feel comfortable with the prospects for 2010 very much in line with the budget that contemplated an increase in revenues of 11% even though volumes are slightly lower than prior year, than 2009. What we have seen in these seven weeks or six weeks of <mark type="inaudible" /> is a recovery in the auto industry in Mexico that has allowed us to improve our volume in that sector, although you already know that we are less than 10% in that segment.</p>
          <p>The other segments look fine. We had for the first month, for the month of January an increase of 19% in U.S. dollars 19% in revenues. We do not think that, that trend will continue but we feel very comfortable to reach, to meet the goal of 11% in the budget. One element that will help us is that as a good portion of our, about 70% of our volumes are denominated in pesos, as we convert those into U.S. dollars we will be converting at a rate that will be if we take like 13.5 will be very similar to the prior year, or if it strengthens a little bit that will bring us more dollars into our P&amp;L.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much gentlemen. I just wanted to ask Enrique, if he could just highlight again, or tell us again, the guidance in terms of volumes for the transportation division for this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The elements of volume is a slight decrease in terms of our mid-tons kilometer from 45, it is almost marginal from 46 billion to 45.4, less than 1%. So, it's 1%, around 1%. Nevertheless, we are taking advantage of price increases without jeopardizing volume and we will take opportunities of new traffic. So, in terms of volume, we feel comfortable with the numbers. In terms of capacity, we do have the horsepower ready. We're in good shape without need for additional investment in 2010, and as well as the condition of the tracks, and all the installations. So....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of Ferrosur, what is your expectation for volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The total, the number, the number that I just gave you, the number that I just gave you is considering both Ferromex and Ferrosur, but taking Ferrosur separately it has a slight increase, a slight increase from 6.8 to 6.9 billion, a 1% increase. So, Ferromex has a 1.4 decrease and Ferrosur has a 1.0 increase but as the volumes of GFM are significantly higher, that, the total number, is around little bit south, 1% approximately.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Ferrosur is also well positioned to take advantage of a slight recovery in the Mexican economy as well as traffics to the north.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And any updates on where the disputes or the legal situation on the consolidation of Ferrosur and Ferromex stand at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Unfortunately the situation stays the same. We have presented to the judge all the elements disputing the position of the Comisi&#xF3;n Federal de Competencia, a fair trade commission. We feel that we have legal arguments why our position does not jeopardize the adequate trade without any monopolistic action.</p>
          <p>So we will be waiting for that resolution, in the mean time we are taking care of Ferrosur as unique. That is very important for us and we are looking for the best to have the best indexes in terms of productivity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And what, could you comment what are the options going forward with this transportation division? In case you don't get the approval to consolidate do you plan to continue operating as is, or would you sell Ferrosur given that is the smallest of the two railways?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it will depend on the final outcome. We will obviously weigh the final outcome. If it comes from a high court, so at that moment we will define what. That's why we're keeping Ferrosur working with the standard of Ferromex because you never know what will happen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>No, I think we are definitely over the Asarco situation and I mean the enhancement fee and all those initiatives that you've been seeing in the court. I mean to us it's not real merit, and not real outcomes to be destined there. We have lawyers working on it, but we definitely are working and believe that the Asarco Chapter 11 and the saga one of your colleagues outlined yesterday in their analyst reports are over, and we are targeting and operating, cash reductions, cash cost reductions and operating synergies.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Jordi. I mean we've been definitely as all years analyzing the strategies and looking at what makes sense. As you know the paths we've normally gone are ops or cross collars. We've been analyzing those, as well as any other strategies. We've had, I mean we're looking at it. We have not hedged at all any part of our production for this year. We believe as I just said that the price has reached a support, and that it should based on the fundamentals and what we're seeing out there in terms of demand from the clients and supply restrictions, ore grades decreasing, that copper should be higher than what we are looking at. But we're definitely looking at it closely and believe we will take opportunities at the time that we believe it's appropriate.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Daniel. Thank you for taking my call. My question is on the organization of Asarco. Are you considering to integrate these operations back into selling copper to create a single mining entity, or would you even consider a separate stock market listing? And what will be a timeframe for making that kind of decision? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, thank you Alex. Well I think first things first, and what we are working on now is really taking control of the company. And this again was in a way a second takeover without diligence and pretty much a host of environments, if you like, I mean that was no news to anyone. So we are working on building a new plant, trying to make Asarco as operating efficient as possible. Reorganizing all the areas of it. We are trying to build a company more lean and mean, if you will. The last one we operated as company years ago we had many, many sites, and many many claims coming against us, and most of them, effort and time of management was devoted to dealing with this.</p>
          <p>Now we have a company that only have the sites that I have mentioned previously, we said we would leave our great assets. I mean as you know we paid $2.2 billion without the tax break, and this company produces 220,000 tons. I mean that is great if you look at it, and you look at all the projects even ours which is you do a re-creation, you have no risk of doubling, you have not to build infrastructure, this company is up and running. So at this moment Alex, we are concentrating on doing this and definitely analyze all options going forward, whether it be the kind of transactions that we are referring to requires the minority shareholders of Southern Copper to agree to this transaction.</p>
          <p>So I mean I think we'll take it one step at a time, and definitely all alternatives for Asarco are in our mind. One important thing for us was the prepayment of the 140 million that I just mentioned, that was 280 million, so Asarco no debt, I mean debt free if you like, just 140 which is easy to pay this year, and we are working on it, looking at what alternatives are.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a brief follow-up on Felipe's question earlier. Obviously you said you'd bought this asset to bulk up your infrastructure division. Do you think it requires further bulking up? If so, are you looking at buying other assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Jim. Obviously, we are &#x2013; it's just pretty much the same thing that I have described in Asarco. I mean we just acquired this asset. It needs a lot of reorganization, a lot of planning, a lot of careful analysis and making it aligned with our Group strategies. But definitely there are a lot of projects out there in terms of for this company and for other companies.</p>
          <p>We definitely think that one of the alternatives, one of the reasons that we acquired the company is that although the Grupo Mexico umbrella if you like has lot more potential than the way it was working on its own, in terms of we are basically operate the concessions, the railroad's a concession, the mining's a concession, and all those contracts with the government might be easier, feasible and obtained within the Grupo Mexico umbrella and that's what we are working on now.</p>
          <p>There is a lot of projects that are out there that this company bid for, and I am talking more on projects for this company that we just acquired, than different acquisitions as you set out. So again just as Asarco, I think we will take it one step at a time, and try to make this company lean and mean, if you will, and very profitable before looking into other acquisitions. However, we'll keep an eye on the market once we are participating in it.</p>

My questions are regarding your EBITDA estimates per division, mainly well, carbon, copper, Asarco, the trains and infrastructure, and more specifically the revenue and EBITDA numbers for the drilling business please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Claudia we are still concluding these, I mean our budget for this year. I mean I can tell you that the revenues we anticipate will be in the neighborhood of $7 billion EBITDA, a little bit north of $3 billion that is as a Group consolidating. We're looking at our budgets now, but that's pretty much what we're looking at &#x2013; we've said that, I mean. Sorry?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>7 billion and EBITDA of 3 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, we're working on the numbers and that's pretty much roughly, we hope that it could go higher. That obviously assumes $3.25 for copper, $13 per moly, basically that's the main assumptions we're taking there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And regarding the drilling business, is there any specific figure that we could learn please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, regarding that business we, I mean the company had let me just &#x2013; we're looking at a $23 billion budget for that. I mean as I just said before, last company that we acquired invested a little bit south of 50 million in equipment for the Chicontepec  contracts that we have been awarded with. So, a lot of the equipment CapEx has been expended at the end of 2009, or mid 2009. So, we're looking at more CapEx for the next year.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA was, so we are in terms of CapEx we are only including that. In terms of EBITDA there was 30 million for 2009 and 90 million for 2010, and this is going to be first year that we operate that company. We have a lot of contracts.</p>
          <p>As you know these companies are based on obtaining several contracts from Pemex and other providers. So, really it depends on that. I mean given the current contracts that we have the numbers should be pretty much the same as we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very well. And finally, any other update regarding Colonet, please?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Colonet, we think definitely &#x2013; regarding Colonet, we definitely think that it was a great project. We think the crisis didn't benefit at all. I think it's going to take some time for that project. Capacity is not a fully saturated in Long Beach and Los Angeles anymore.</p>
          <p>Our studies in terms of demand for this cargo and the cargo in this area show that it's not a feasible project, at least in the larger scale of things in the way they were thought by the government years ago. I mean I think that project should have been done at different time. And it was proportionately for us and for Mexico and now I don't think it's a feasible project for years to come. I think the Manzanillo project it is a good project we participated on it. As you know we are clearing those issue, we thought it was not fairly awarded, and we are looking at it, but definitely keep an eye on Punta Colonet. I don't think that's a feasible project for the near future.</p>

For the copper we estimate 500,000 tons of copper for this year, Asarco 220,000 tons, molybdenum 18,500 tons, zinc 110,000 tons and silver 60 million ounces. That is the guidance that was provided in Southern Copper.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. The last one. In the report there is a kind of forecast regarding the EBITDA that could Aferco could generate. If I take 228,000 tons with a copper price of $3.25 and if I compare these two figures with an estimate of $550,000, sorry million dollars of EBITDA that would imply a kind of EBITDA margin of 77%. I don't know if I'm missing something here or if it's wrong in this calculation but it's pretty difficult to reach that EBITDA margin. I don't know if I'm missing something here?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rodrigo, basically, if I understood the question, you're asking that estimation of the $550 million EBITDA for this year. Basically, what Daniel mentioned before was that we were assuming for that specific amount we estimated 200,000 tons of production. Now, if we would use 220,000 tons of production at 325, that's the number quote over that and it's more in the $650 million, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I took the 220 on the price of $3.25 that the total sales will be something around 715, and then if I take the figures of $550 million...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rodrigo, I would like to clarify something about this. The 3.1 is delivered and the total production is 220 metric tons, and for this reason the total revenues that we state for Asarco is $1.5 billion and the net EBITDA will be 550 million of EBITDA.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. I just wanted to check, is there any update as to how much will cost to restart Cananea? And providing that the machine comes in the first quarter, when you expect you could be ramping up production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Carlos, we think still our estimate is the same. As you know we have no control of the mine so our estimate is still the same, between 15 to $16 million, and we believe the FSTW facilities will be very easy to ramp up. As you know the concentrating facilities are harder to ramp up so that you know we have already the leaching pads there, it's a matter of start putting the solution and the acid on to the leach pads and obtaining as fast as possible production. I mean production and PLS for the FSTW facility.</p>
          <p>So that should be ramping up very quick. If we assume our first quarter position by the second quarter should be up and running, and probably full steam will take an additional couple of months.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I just wanted to understand the movement in Asarco margins from 2008 through 2009. We saw about 25% decline in copper prices but EBITDA margins increased to 31% from 26%. Could you please throw some light on what drove such margin expansion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, first of all Mandeep, it's important to note that, this numbers that we have for the years previous to our acquisition have been impacted. First of all because of for all the re-org expenses of the company. The company had been incurring a lot of re-org expenses that concentrated very heavily from quarter-to-quarter from month-to-month. The other issue that is important to note is that 2008 we were still looking at $1 and $150, I apologize, oil prices, so oil cost were high, they were in 2009 as you know, much, much lower, so that that should explain the difference.</p>
          <p>Also one of the other things that is very relevant for Asarco was Unicredit, the way the numbers were built before our acquisition, that concentrate purchases. Asarco is a company that purchases a lot of concentrate from third parties and that ultimately created important deviations. I mean for years to come we would like to present the information in different manner so that it is very easily understandable by the market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Is it possible for you to tell what were the amount of concentrate purchases in 2009?</p>
