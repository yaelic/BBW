          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the JPMorgan Chase's Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; Chief Financial Officer, Doug Braunstein; and Mike Cavanagh, CEO of Treasury and Security Services. Mr. Dimon, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you very much. And folks, thank you for getting up this early hour to spend a little time with us.</p>
          <p>I just wanted to open real quickly to tell you that this is Mike Cavanagh's last turn doing the Investor Relations call, so it's kind of his swan song. But I want you all to know what a great job we think he has done in a large financial company in a very tough time: earning respect, getting the numbers, making sure we try to do things right, accurately disclosing things, maintaining good relations with all of you. So Mike, congratulations out to Mike. I'm excited about his new challenge. And you will still be hearing from him in the future, just not on this call.</p>
          <p>And also to welcome Doug Braunstein. I don't know how many of you know him, but you'll have plenty of time to get to know him in the future. Previously he has been running the Investment Banking USA division, including the bankers and equity debt derivative capital markets, and extraordinarily talented individual. And he's obviously been through this process with us the last two weeks so he's sitting here to listen to how it goes. But I know he looks forward to seeing you and I know he will be a great CFO of JPMorgan Chase.</p>
          <p>So I'm going to hand the call back over to Mike and when he's done we'll be taking some questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jamie, and I just want to say thanks to the entire finance team at JPMorgan Chase. They did great for me and they're going to do a great job for Doug, and welcome Doug and congrats from me as well.</p>
          <p>So I'm going to start and go through the usual slide deck that we've got here. So if you start on page 1 here, second quarter highlights. As you've seen, we earned 4.8 billion after tax, earnings per share of $1.09 on revenues of about $26 billion in the quarter. We flagged for you the two big significant items and most of the rest of the stuff we'll get into washes itself out throughout the rest of the numbers.</p>
          <p>But two big items: reduction to loan loss allowance of about 1.5 billion or $0.36 after tax. I'll cover this up front once. It's really coming in three places throughout the firm. First is in the investment bank where we had about $350 million pre-tax reserve release. That's really just the same reason as last quarter, loan pay downs and loan sales freeing up reserves.</p>
          <p>In the credit card business then you'll see the lower current losses leading to lower estimates for future losses and that leads to a reduction in reserves of about 1.5 billion there. And then finally, in our commercial bank, about 400 million pre-tax of reserve release, which is just related to the periodic, but normal, refinements to our credit loss estimates in that business. So those three places are what's driving the reduction to loan loss allowance.</p>
          <p>We still ended the quarter with $37 billion of loan loss reserves and more than 5% loan loss coverage. So feel very good in very good shape on that score. The other items, the U.K. bonus tax, we booked about $550 million after tax, mostly running through the comp line &#x2013; all running through the compensation line, mostly in our investment bank. So those two items together, about $0.22 worth of net positive earnings so about $0.87 away from that.</p>
          <p>Broad characterization of those results is that most of our businesses performed pretty solidly, as you'll see when we go through the numbers. And of particular note is the decline in levels of actual charge-off losses in our Consumer businesses, both retail and credit card from prior quarters. Capital strength continued to be very strong. Strong balance sheet continues and we'll get to that towards the end.</p>
          <p>So now flipping on slide 2, I'm just going to skip. It's everything I just said. And now let's go to the investment bank on slide 3. So there you see a circled number, profits of $1.4 billion in the investment bank. I've already commented on the credit cost line, which was driven by the reserve release. So it's starting with revenues, you see total revenues of $6.3 billion in the quarter for the investment bank. So starting with investment banking fees, as you can see and read for yourself, we continue to be number one ranked year-to-date in investment banking fee revenue. And that amounts to $1.4 billion for the quarter, which is down from a very strong and capital issuance heavy quarter in the prior year.</p>
          <p>Move into the markets businesses, I'd say generally speaking that we are back to a sort of pre-crisis levels for spreads. And that combined with lower levels of client activities, as a general matter throughout the quarter on average is the broad backdrop. But specifically, fixed income markets, you see we had revenues of $3.6 billion, down from last quarter and last year. And that's the main areas for those declines from prior periods. It was in credit markets, businesses, rates and commodities areas. Included in the fixed income revenues of $3.6 billion is about 400 million positive of benefit from DVA or credit spread tightening on structured notes.</p>
          <p>Next in equity markets, $1 billion of revenue and that included $200 million of DVA. Not much more to really highlight there nor in credit portfolio revenues. Just on expenses, $4.5 billion, remember that includes the U.K. bonus tax. When you back that out, the comp-to-revenue ratio in the quarter was about 37%. So that's it for the investment bank.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to retail. Page 4 gives you what drives the P&amp;L that we're going to see on the next slide. I'll just say retail banking top half of the &#x2013; top portion of the page, the deposit taking business, retail branches, you can read these for yourself, but you continue to see healthy underlying trends in the growth of the business, whether it's stabilization in growth in deposits. Remember we've been running off high cost deposits so the net growth here we feel good about and continued growth in underlying &#x2013; other underlying trends.</p>
          <p>Middle of the page, other consumer lending and mortgage banking originations; total of about $38 billion worth of loan originations in the quarter. That's part of 156 billion of loan originations across the whole business, including middle market, small business in the broader company. So we continue to be originating credit for our clients at very good levels.</p>
          <p>And I'll talk about real estate portfolios at the bottom in a second. If you flip to slide 5, you have the P&amp;L for the retail business. I'll walk you down the circled numbers on the left. So in total retail, the sum of all of this division, made 1.042 billion of net income in the quarter. Moving down to the next circled box you see the retail banking side, which I just commented on in the prior page, earned $914 million in the quarter. I'll let you read the commentary in the press release and to the right here. It's pretty straightforward what's going on in the business, and healthy trends there.</p>
          <p>The next piece is the ongoing production origination of mortgage loans and other consumer lending including auto. And there you see we had profits circled of $364 million. Again, I'll let you read what's going on there and just point out that the $2 billion of revenues in that space continued to have a drag on it of loan repurchase reserve level &#x2013; expense and reserving that's a contra revenue there. That's a little higher than it was last quarter, flattish to where we were in the fourth quarter of last year, but continues to be in our level of expectations. But obviously continued uncertainty as to how that continues to progress.</p>
          <p>And then finally, at the bottom you have the real estate portfolio balances. Obviously this is driven heavily by our actual credit costs and prior period reserving. No reserving at all in this quarter to the positive or negative, just lower credit costs that I'll cover.</p>
          <p>And so let's go to that. That was a loss in aggregate of $236 million. So if you flip the slide to slide 6, you pick up the circled numbers on the left and the commentary then in the upper right is that you see the decline, substantial decline, in the second quarter versus last quarter and a year ago in actual current quarter charge-offs. And that's on the back of the improved delinquency, early bucket delinquencies, that we've been commenting on for the past several quarters continuing to roll through, as well as moderating levels of losses when &#x2013; where we do have default, so lesser levels of &#x2013; or moderating levels of loss severity.</p>
          <p>What we would say is that those trends appear to be stable from beginning of quarter to end of quarter so it's not clear that we can count on continued improvement from these levels. But in terms of our outlook, at these levels of delinquency and loss severity, if we hold where we are, we expect to see our quarterly losses run at the kind of levels that you see in the outlook box on the &#x2013; in the middle of the right-hand side. So at or below $1 billion for home equity, 400 million for prime mortgage and 400 million or so per quarter for sub-prime mortgage.</p>
          <p>And so that's obviously a change from the outlook we've previously had given, which you could think of. We used to guide towards where we could see losses progressing upward towards in prior quarters as we talked about this guidance. Now we're sort of giving you more of an outlook based upon a static level of delinquencies and loss severities running at these kind of numbers from here, so clearly an improved underlying loss picture here. But still cautious and still, again, no changes in our reserve levels in that business.</p>
          <p>Moving on to card services on slide 7. So here you see we had profits, circled number on the left, profits of $343 million. Credit costs being the big story. So I've already mentioned the 1.5 billion pre-tax reduction in loan loss reserves. So let's just focus on the actual charge-offs in the quarter, which you see circled number on the left. Again, the 9.02% charge-off rate in the quarter for the Chase portfolio, that's ex-WaMu, an improvement from last quarter. You see the printed number last quarter was 10.54%, but recall that was inflated due to a payment holiday that I won't go into.</p>
          <p>But on a real basis, we dropped about 90 basis points in losses quarter-over quarter. And as you'll see when we get to the outlook, we could see that improving again by maybe another 50 basis points to 8.5% charge-off rate plus or minus for the Chase portfolios as we look into next quarter would be our best guess given the level of trends we're seeing.</p>
          <p>On the revenue side, $4.2 billion of revenue. That's down year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter and very similar trends to what we &#x2013; dynamics that we've talked about in the past. So you've got lower outstandings on lower sales, higher level of the level of charge-offs we've experienced, less balance transfer activity as well as us running off the Washington Mutual portfolio. And now we're starting to get some impact of the Card Act legislation, which is probably about 25% of it in our run rate in this quarter on the revenue side.</p>
          <p>The next three businesses, the Commercial Bank, TSS and Asset Management, I'll cover pretty quickly. They are &#x2013; the dynamics of these businesses is very similar to what they've been in the past so I'll just flip through these quickly but hit a few items. So on the commercial bank it's $693 million. That includes the $400 million reserve release. Ex that, it's about 450 million or so after tax. That's based upon the 1.5 billion level of revenues you see here, which continues to be strong.</p>
          <p>The dynamic I guess I'd point out, if you look at the key statistics, you see end of period loans and leases, the circled number $96 billion of loans and leases, flattish to where we were last quarter and down from a year ago. So we continue to see maybe some signs of activity on the horizon but not yet translating into actual increase in loan demand and continued low level of utilization in the low 30%, 30, 32% utilization rates against the committed lines we have to our clients in this space.</p>
          <p>Next business, Treasury and Security Services, profits of $292 million in the quarter. Again, general environment of low rates putting pressure on revenues here, but in the second quarter we actually get a seasonal benefit embedded in it and you can see it in the security services side from securities lending particularly coming out of Europe in the second quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>Finally, on the business side, asset management on slide 10, $391 million of net income. Strong assets under management and revenues related to that on continued strong investment performance, which you can read on the right-hand side. The one thing I'd point out is you can see from the commentary on flows in the middle of the right-hand side that we're seeing outflows in sort of low &#x2013; low spread, low risk, low return liquidity products, 29 billion and 126 billion for the last quarter and last year. And that's partially offset on the flow side with flows back into longer-term bond and equity-type of funds.</p>
          <p>Slide 11; corporate and private equity. You see private equity very modest &#x2013; modest activity in the quarter, 75 million of revenues translating into $11 million of after-tax profits. So the big item being the Corporate segment itself. You see $642 million of profits in the quarter. I'll just jump to where I think that's going. That &#x2013; for a host of reasons, think of that as a number that in future quarters &#x2013; coming quarters could trend towards more like $300 million plus or minus but obviously there's lumpy items that occur any one quarter to the next.</p>
          <p>So in this particular quarter, we had a level of securities gains coming out of our investment portfolio of about $900 million. And then in the expense side, we had some higher litigation expenses booked in the quarter. So those numbers are washing through together with just the &#x2013; over the quarter a higher level than normal of &#x2013; than what we'll see on an ongoing basis of portfolio size throwing off net interest income.</p>
          <p>So moving to capital on slide 12 you see Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common capital grew in the quarter 131 to 137 and 104 to 108 helping drive with flattish risk weighted assets and total assets a little bit of a decline. You see Tier 1 capital ratios and Tier 1 common very, very, very strong at 12.1% and 9.6%.</p>
          <p>I already commented on the very strong level of credit reserves and I will just point out that at the tail end of last quarter carrying through yesterday we bought back about $500 million worth of stock in the past several weeks.</p>
          <p>So finally, on the quarter outlook looking ahead on page 13, I think I covered well everything related to the home lending guidance on the left-hand side so I'll skip that. I will just give you an update in terms of where we are on the overdraft fees in retail. You see that we are just updating our estimates there of the net income impact previously on an after-tax basis; 500 million plus or minus. Now a little bit higher, 700 million plus or minus, as our best current estimate of what the full impact when it ramps in will be. Only about half of that is currently running through our numbers.</p>
          <p>On the Credit Card side, I commented on the declining balances for a host of reasons and you can see and read for yourself that we expect that to continue for the same reasons that we're currently seeing including the runoff of the WaMu portfolio and some legacy low yield balances in our outstandings. Credit losses, already commented on the 8.5% plus or minus charge-off rate for Chase. And then on the Card Act side, the total impact that we're expecting to see would be about 750 million plus or minus.</p>
          <p>Now that now includes the &#x2013; our view of what the final piece of legislation, which was around what defines reasonable and proportionate fees is a new item, but all in, we're at 750 plus or minus. We used to be at 500 to 750 without that item but now with that in, think about it as being at 750 million plus or minus. And I already commented on the level of expected profits in corporate.</p>
          <p>So I guess the final thing I'll comment on is the regulatory reform on slide 14. We're not going to say too much about this today, other than these comments given that we're getting a vote today and there's still even past day's voting a lot to be defined by regulators and many uncertainties that makes it difficult to talk about this with precision. But let me just run through what's on this page which is that we do recognize and we've talked a lot about the many positive aspects that are going to be coming as part of the pending regulation.</p>
          <p>It's &#x2013; we're happy to see and always ran ourselves this way; higher capital and liquidity requirements across the financial sector is a good thing. A resolution authority; we've lived through Bear Stearns and ourselves saw the problems of not having power to resolve institutions more broadly than just the traditional powers over commercial banks so we welcome that. And we think it's a very good idea to have system wide risk oversight. So those are clearly some pluses that we look forward to benefiting from on the other side of regulation.</p>
          <p>Definitely have to point out though that there are some challenges that come along with where we sit, which is obviously what I already said, that there's many uncertainties remain. So while we expect to get this legislation today, there remain hundreds of rules to be written and ongoing interpretations that will really define what this looks like. There's a need to get global coordination obviously for this to be well executed and that's still to be done. And then of course with anything of this kind of magnitude with the ongoing interpretations that are going to come, none of us really know what unknown consequences are going to come for our business activities and our clients so that's on the challenges side.</p>
          <p>But I would sum up that it's going to have a significant impact on many of our businesses. We're spending a lot of time thinking about this and particularly about how it's going to affect our clients because as you know, we're a very client focused set of businesses. So a lot of energy is going into making sure we understand clearly what it's going to mean for those clients. And going back to my first point, very hard here to &#x2013; with any kind of real certainty speak to you about what the impact could be here. Because the first point is that this is all going to phase in over time so it's not like the &#x2013; the potential financial impacts are going to be here tomorrow.</p>
          <p>This will gradually affect our results to whatever degree it does. What affect it does have is clearly going to be a result of how clients respond in terms of what they choose to &#x2013; what services they avail themselves of and what at volume levels. So that's a little bit of guess work at this stage. And of course, whatever impact there are going to be is going to be in part mitigated at least through adjustments to business models or pricing of products and services. And in many cases in our businesses, the benefit that our shareholders will get back by having capital released as a result of some of the changes in these &#x2013; in this legislation.</p>
          <p>So more to come. As we understand more, we'll be as clear as we can be. I'd just remind everybody that for JPMorgan Chase in particular we've always thought about running ourselves as a client-focused business, not heavily dependent on proprietary activities, which is the main thrust of the ideas behind the legislation we are not at all disturbed by. In our Client businesses, for investing for our clients, we've always had a clear separation between what we do as a fiduciary for our clients and where we run risk with the firm's own capital so that's another thought in the legislation that we're very comfortable with.</p>
          <p>Clearly you all know us as being highly-focused on running a strong balance sheet with extremely strong liquidity and strong capital base. And again, finally, the strength of the fundamentals of the various businesses we choose to compete in and the diversified earnings power and margins that we get out of the businesses by running them well is part of what allowed us to really run our way through the crisis and never have a losing quarter.</p>
          <p>So that's how we think about it is from here we're just going to continue to do what we've always done, which is commit ourselves to implementing this regulation in a way that protects our clients and protects the competitiveness of the U.S. financial system and JPMorgan Chase in doing that. And I will speak for us that we've got hundreds of &#x2013; hundreds of work streams around this place already engaged deeply in understanding and looking to implement this legislation in a thoughtful way that I just described. So not to say &#x2013; we will have plenty more to discuss as time goes by on legislation once we have finer points and better details to provide, but these are our thoughts for today on that score.</p>
          <p>So with that, why don't we go to questions?</p>

          <p>Your first question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Guy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I just wanted to say, Mike, obviously Jamie said it all, but you've done such a terrific job for all of us. I just want to thank you for that over the many years at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Guy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The &#x2013; there's no doubt that the decline in losses and delinquencies and the much lower expected loss guidance on the home mortgage side are a really big positive. But we know also that foreclosures have been slowed by various modification programs and forbearance programs, and anecdotally we still hear about people who are pretty delinquent who have yet to receive a foreclosure notice. Is this not something that you're worried about given the decline in that mortgage loss guidance? How should we think about all that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say, Guy, as we've talked about before, we do worry about those thoughts but make sure that when we &#x2013; when we actually take account of our current period charge-offs and our expectations for future losses, we are trying to be very cognizant of delays in courtroom filings and backlogs in courts and so forth to make sure that we're keeping current in our losses and our forecasted losses the best we can. So we're conscious of the concern and try to reflect it in what we do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just reiterate, we take the charge-offs on things that are delayed in foreclosure and we do believe there's a little bit of a backlog due to foreclosures. We don't think it's a weight &#x2013; that it's a mountain. We think it's already been a high level; it came down a little bit. We do believe that it's going to go up a little bit. But it's not going to be two times what we've been experiencing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for that. Can I just ask on the rest of warranties issue, you did talk about repurchases as affecting the quarter a little bit. Can I just ask if you received a subpoena from FHFA and if you can give us a sense for your stance at this point on these issues? I remember that last quarter you added over $2 billion to a reserve. Can we assume that that was built on an already-significant reserve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So we &#x2013; we did get a subpoena for information, which I believe went to all the major broker dealers. But we're not going to be regularly reporting on subpoenas and stuff like that. And we do try to take account and repurchase reserves. They're still running kind of high so we have reserve, we have expenses and we think &#x2013; but there are reasons to think it might start coming down by early next year. Because if you look at the vintages and the ages and the timing, this may be a little bit of a lag too, but they could very well come down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the final question I have for you is regarding the revised guidance on the Card Act and OD stuff, the overdraft/NSF. Obviously the changes in the regulation mean that the few are no longer subsidizing a lot of products like free checking and the like for everybody else. And you've given us a &#x2013; an assessment of the impact, but should we assume that those are still static analyses and that you haven't factored in there some of the re-pricing that you might do to kind of spread the cost of services more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Good morning.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you guys have been more up front than some banks about the net interest income pressure out there from running off loans, reducing the carry trade, but I think it's fair to say the Q2 NIM came in a little bit lower than expected, at least lower than what I had. So I was wondering if you could talk a bit about what drove this decline and what you think the outlook is on the net interest income dollars?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, Matt, it's in part &#x2013; I've got to hold aside what goes on in the Trading businesses, so holding that aside, the level of spread was down just a touch and probably comes down a touch again. So it's really the volume declines across the consumer portfolios that will put a little bit of continued downward pressure on NIM dollars looking ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But much more modest than the billion dollar decline we saw this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think some of that was changes in the investment portfolio as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's largely behind you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, that's going to continue in the corporate line that Mike said was going to come down to 300 million. That's coming &#x2013; a big chunk of that is NIM coming down a bit as we reposition the portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. The run rate at the end of the quarter is lower as a result of those sales that generated the billion or so &#x2013; 900 million of gains. Think of that as just pulling forward some of that NIM.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the corporate net II down, obviously the investment bank's always dependent on what is driving trading and then ex those areas, more modest pressure than what we saw this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well, credit card balances have come down and there is still runoff, mostly in the mortgage-related areas in WaMu and JPMorgan Chase. And we'd give you those numbers before. You can just build them right into your calculations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But remember, that also frees up capital so there's a flip side to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. That's actually where I was going to go next. I mean with the balance sheet coming down and the revenue environment up, you've already got a lot of capital; it's going to build. You bought back some stock. I think on a net basis the shares were unchanged. Is there opportunity to bring down the share count on a net basis? Or is it more...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, listen. I think it's more significant that we started to buy back some stock, which means that we are a value investor. So think of us that we're making a couple of statements here and obviously it's one way to manage the capital base and reinvest money on behalf of our shareholders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. There's no like regulatory &#x2013; you bought back stock, but the net share count there's a climb...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you guys have the ability to actually net buyback stock?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we might. We like the discipline of buy back what we issue. Remember, a lot of what we issue is restricted stock to employees, which vests over time so every quarter more of it shows up in share count. So a lot of things affect share count, but we as a discipline like to buy back at least what we issue.</p>

          <p>Hi. Mike, wondering if you could give any color on what changed on the NSF/OD impact of your estimate there?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really just refinement as we're getting further down the road of opt-in levels is the main driver. A little bit less than we had originally forecast opting in and that's driving the numbers for impact a little higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just a follow up on the NIM. In the Card business the NIM was down. Are the changes from the Card Act already reflected in the card NIM like the lack of ability to re-price, is that in there? Or could there be more NIM pressure in card from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There will be more pressure in aggregate on the results in card because we're only about 25% of the way. I've got to come back to you on how much that will be through NIM versus other portions of revenue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Probably more to come, but the split of where it will sit NIM versus other revenues we can come back and give you better clarity.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Seeing activities, again, same as last quarter, strengthen what's going on in small business lending, double the level that we originated last year. Middle market and commercial is in a flat &#x2013; I'd say it's similar to what we said before. Plenty of dialogue going on between our clients and our bankers as folks get themselves ready to take some actions, but just not yet really manifesting itself in draw downs on lines or loans going up just yet. Hopefully we'll get some...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Here's something that's probably significant, so wholesale loans actually showed fairly healthy credit. I mean 23 basis points of loss in investment bank and 73 basis points of charge-offs in middle market. That's a sign of healthy companies. And middle market loans, let's just take the middle market section, I mean, for the first time in years, stopped going down. I look at that as a good sign too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Last quick question on reserves. In cards you've been releasing reserves for a quarter or two now. In RFS you didn't add or release reserves. If the current delinquencies continue and your new loss outlook plays out, would you start to release reserves in RFS this year, if that plays out the way you think it is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so the first thing I'd say about loan loss reserves is you should assume that we don't like to release loan loss reserves. So it isn't like we should be saying well this company wants to do it to report as earnings. We don't consider that earnings. I've always called that ink on paper. It means nothing, okay? And we like to protect ourselves. And credit card we have some pretty good insight into the quarter forward and even two quarters forward. But as you all pointed out, there's far more uncertainty in mortgage lending and we are extremely cautious and careful on it. If we have to take down reserves &#x2013; put it this way, we'll take them down only if we have to.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Hi. Good morning. A couple of questions. One is just on how some of the concerns are around the industry overall and this weighs on your stock as well from time to time. The market's concerned about credit, you seem to be showing significant improvement in credit this quarter. Capital management, and frankly I walked in this morning not thinking we were going to get anything and was positively surprised by the buyback so you seem to be saying that that can happen. Two questions that I have. One is on FinReg. In the past you've indicated on the derivative side that if certain things happened and you did nothing, the hit to derivatives revenues could be in the 2 to $3 billion range. Are you changing that assessment at this stage, given what we know about FinReg at this point in time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nope. We're comparing apples to oranges. A while back when we were talking about derivatives, we were talking about if it all went to an exchange, what could that mean? That's what that number was. This is completely different than that and has far more complexities to clients, global competition, and it will phase in over time and we don't really know the effect. But I guess what we really look at is we're going to be able &#x2013; we want to make sure we can service our clients. And we think we'll be able to. And that's probably the most important thing. Will it have some affect on revenues and margins and volumes? Yeah, probably.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Mike talked about capital release.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so obviously when we talked about the revenue impact if derivatives go to exchanges in the extreme case, as, Jamie said, we never then really tried to quantify, just pointed out that, that's a capital reducing event as well. So that's the point. And some of these activities there will be capital freed up as the business models adjust. So that is what also makes it just very hard to put numbers on the totality of the effects when you take into account timing, first blush issues of change and then capital release and business model change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As your estimates kind of firm up you'll be sharing them with us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The last kind of big concern over the group is deflation. Could you just give us your thoughts as to how you're thinking about that and how you're trying to manage in an environment which obviously clearly is slower growth, but could have some potential deflationary elements to it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sitting here terrified over deflation, to tell you the truth. What we see in the economy is that maybe growth slowed down a little bit in June, but you still have fairly good underlying numbers in manufacturing, servicing, confidence, China, India and so we try to protect our company and we really do. We look at exposure to kind of all the fat tails. So that's kind of one of the fat tails that I think we worry about. But we're not going to run the business guessing that there might be deflation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then lastly on capital, you did the buyback to eliminate the pressure that you would have had from issuance. Can you share with us what your thoughts are on capital levels that you think you would be able to manage to going forward? Or is it too early to say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would just make the statement I think we have tons of capital and tons of liquidity. But we don't determine regulatory requirements and as you know, Basel III's out there. And we think either under any reasonable type of Basel III we will be fine and we would adjust the balance sheet in a way that made sense, a lot of things in Basel III, which would probably dramatically change your business models and we would obviously adjust to that. So we think we're in great shape. We'd like to see a little more certainty around Basel III, and we think there will be guidance coming out in September and then November on how Basel III will be applied.</p>

          <p>Oh, sorry. I was on mute. Sorry. Good morning. I have three quick questions. One is on the general impact of wholesale sales to &#x2013; wholesale loan sales &#x2013; whole loan sales to third party servicers and how that impacted results on a relative basis last quarter, last year, and your outlook on that on a go-forward basis?

        <plist>
          <p>Wholesale mortgage loans &#x2013; whole loan mortgage loans. Packages of mortgage loans. Because if I just sort of try to strip out the charge-offs from the loan balance declines and runoff, it looks like there were some loan sales in the quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>They basically said that they wanted to make sure &#x2013; I mean I'm absolutely paraphrasing here, that when banks did re-implement dividends, there would be no risk of them cutting dividends again. So it just seemed like they were pushing out the whole dialogue on reinstating dividends to the banks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I guess I'm not clear where you guys stand on the dividend. I know there was some articles saying you're not going to increase the dividend this year yet now you're buying back stock. How do you think about the dividend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just before I start I just want to say I think our business units are much closer to being best in class than you obviously think. The dividend, we have said three things, okay? We want to see the economy get better in terms of employment getting better, we want to see a significant improvement not for a month or two or even a quarter in charge-offs and delinquencies, and we need more capital certainty. The first two seem to be getting better. The third it doesn't.</p>
          <p>This capital certainty Basel, etcetera, they're all starting to come in sight and formation. Hopefully, we'll have all of that fairly understood by the end of the year. We would like to reinstate a dividend. We think our shareholders want it. We just want to check off all those boxes so that we don't have to cut the dividend again. And so buying back stock is just another way of, in my opinion, both capital management and doing very smart things for shareholders. In fact, if I had a &#x2013; our preference now would be the stock buy back and a lot of the stock was bought back at slightly lower prices than 40 and so that is I think a very good thing to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what was the average price of the buyback?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't remember. I'm going to say 37 or 38.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, second question, I guess you're not quantifying the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the Derivatives business, but can you just say how it could impact the revenues, margins, volumes and capital just so we can try to size it a little bit better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess &#x2013; I think one of the issues first of all is timing so you say size it better. I don't think a lot of you do forecasts that go out three years. So, you're talking about several years before it phases in. And as Mike said, there are capital effects, there are margin effects, there are volume effects and when you put them altogether, we don't really know. So it would be &#x2013; it would be less accurate of us to take a guess at that than to tell you we don't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean your guess is better than ours. Is it 1, 5, 10, 20%? Some people have estimates 25, 30%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let them estimate whatever they want.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's fine. And then the last question I guess does go to best in class. This is the first conference call since you made some big management changes talking about the need for more non-U.S. expansion. Where do you see the end game in terms of the non-U.S. franchise of JPMorgan and now that you have so much more management and resources targeted for that? What are some of the milestones?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think our investment banking and emerging markets platform is just as good as Goldman Sachs for example. But first of all, remember that &#x2013; investment banking, asset management, TSS are very global businesses. They've been global for a long time. So we're talking about augmenting and accelerating some of that. And if you think about it in terms of locations for TSS, we've been adding locations to serve clients in custody and cash management. When you think in terms of Asset Management, we're always adding product and we're adding bankers. And if you think in terms of investment banking, more bankers, more countries, more coverage, more research, that's not just in the BRICs, it's also going to be in other countries around the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And just the last follow-up since we're bringing up peer analysis, I mean the Investment Bank division this quarter had a decline of almost one-half in EMEA and I was wondering if there was any noise related to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So in the Investment &#x2013; first, I think the Investment Bank had a great performance but it is true we lost a little bit of share in a couple of areas. I think I told you last time that I thought we had a little artificial increase in share because we were still strong and doing business when other people had pulled back a lot so the competition is back. I think that's a good thing. We're going to have to fight for it inch by inch, foot by foot, yard by yard, mile by mile. And in any number in any quarter it can easily jump a point or two or three, as you know. So the way we look at it is more bankers, better bankers, more products, more services, more coverage of clients. And we will earn share. So over years I expect the share to go up but not in any one quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Mike &#x2013; I'm sorry, from Jason Goldberg with Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just maybe just a follow up on that. Could you just maybe expand a bit what you saw in fixed income trading during the quarter, maybe a bit more granular than the release? And just, I know it's hard to predict but kind of what your expectations are, at least the first couple of weeks you've seen for Q3?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So I think Mike said it, credit wasn't as good this quarter; rates wasn't as good this quarter.  And there's an article in the Wall Street Journal about commodities so we lost a little bit of money in call, so there's nothing mystical. Spreads and volumes are still good. Spreads are back to where they were before the crisis and volumes are still pretty healthy in our mind. And I don't know what the whole quarter is going to look like any better than you do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. And then, you noted in the release in the commercial bank, all your losses tied to commercial real estate. Can you maybe kind of give us an update in terms of what you're seeing in that segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so that 73 basis points includes commercial real estate. And when we say that, it's &#x2013; we have &#x2013; it's not &#x2013; these are not bad numbers. We have very little &#x2013; we don't have a lot of commercial real estate that's risky. Actually, we make disclosures -- I think they're still in the back of this presentation, that show you by category. It's just that 60 or 70% of the losses are coming out of the total real estate category. That's all it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's between true commercial real estate and the multi-family lending we do. Both of those running higher than that average. And so, middle market commercial &#x2013; commercial and industrial ex that would be a little lower than the 75-ish basis points, which goes back to Jamie's point about the health of corporate America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, standing back and looking big picture, I guess given the revenue environment, the total revenues came in right about where we were looking for, but expenses were about &#x2013; if you back out the U.K. bonus tax and back out the $2.3 billion charge last quarter, I mean, it was the expenses where it was off a bit. And if I look at it, again, sort of linked quarter revenues are down 9% but excluding those two special items, linked quarter expenses are up about 2%. So I'm curious, do you have a &#x2013; is there a reason for that? Is that investing in future growth? Is that the drag of higher credit costs currently or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Mike mentioned it was higher litigation costs this quarter. We're in a litigious society and a litigious time so that would be one number. I think expenses are generally in some of the businesses as we're adding some people and adding branches and things like that. And then of course we've continued to run higher costs in default and higher costs in foreclosed asset. I don't know the year-over-year in that, managing foreclosed assets, so it's a variety of factors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and any outlook or just we should &#x2013; this is the level of expense we should expect for a while?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we kind of give it business by business so go to Corporate, that $300 million after tax is kind of NII in corporate overhead unallocated and allocated. That's probably the best &#x2013; I think that's probably the number that is affecting it the most.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the capital management/return to shareholders question, I mean I guess I understand the political sensitivities, it's an election year, no one likes bankers and all that. But even with the 500 million in repurchase, I mean, you had close to 5 billion in earnings and your tangible common ratio is building up to a tune of about 50 basis points a quarter. I mean is there some point at which the regulators just say uncle and just go ahead and do what you need to do?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we bought back some stock &#x2013; I mean buying back stock it just started so that doesn't have to necessarily end. As you know, we don't tell you what we're going to do with buying back the stock but we agree with you. We just think &#x2013; I think we're trying to be clear. There are a lot of uncertainties around capital. As those uncertainties are resolved, which I think when they do we'll have plenty of capital. And that capital number is going to grow even faster over time, not slower, as reserves come down, et cetera. We agree with you. We're getting capital heavy. We're buying back a little bit of stock. When we start the dividend we want it to be permanent. If &#x2013; I've said and I'll say it again, if we're lucky sometime by the end of this year and hopefully sometime &#x2013; if not that, hopefully early next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, I guess just going back to Guy's question a little bit, I mean, when the &#x2013; as the Card Act was making its way through Congress we could kind of see the revenue &#x2013; the offsetting revenues come into the income statement for most of the card issuers and the revenue margins started going up. And I'm just curious with the NSF fees and the potential limits on interchange fees and all of that, can you give us an idea of what kind of tests and experiments on the revenue offset side you're doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In retail banking, I mean I guess the big issue with both of those things is how much of that will eventually be re-priced into the business. You know, if you're a restaurant and you can't charge for the soda, you're going to charge more for the burger. And so, I just &#x2013; and my guess is over time it will all be re-priced into the business. It may change the model a little bit, may change the pricing a little bit, it may change how many customers you can serve, it may change the products you roll out but eventually it will all be re-priced in the business. In retail banking it will probably be &#x2013; and you've seen a bunch of banks do it already, adding monthly fees or something like that. And in credit card it will be possibly adding higher fees on credit card and a slightly higher going-in rates.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>Hi, Jim.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Mike. One quick question on &#x2013; was there any material DVA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mentioned it, thought I mentioned it anyway, sorry. In fixed income, we had about 400 million of DVA and in equity markets we had about $200 million of DVA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then maybe more broadly in the credit side again, sorry to keep hammering away on the mortgage side but your guidance on the home mortgage side is higher than &#x2013; materially higher I guess than the run rate we saw this quarter. Is that just conservatism on your part? Are you building in some expectation of higher losses? Was there something unusual this quarter or as home mods come in is that expected to kind of drive those losses a little higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we are extremely cautious on mortgage. And we're going to be cautious until this is done, okay? There are a lot of factors at play here. There's a lot more uncertainty in it because of higher foreclosures, home prices and we just are by nature going to be cautious about it. And that is more of a kind of a static look about what it could be like the next couple of quarters; obviously, hope it improves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Mike mentioned that the early indicators, like front-end delinquencies and a bunch of other things, kind of leveled off a little bit in June.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's supposed to continue to get better. So we're just &#x2013; we're just trying to be cautious here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Any more &#x2013; any specific comments on Home Equity? There's been a lot of discussion about what the impact would be if there's some principal reduction on the first mortgage and what that could do to loss rates. I know we've talked about this before, Mike, but...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And we did a lot of work on this too, okay? First of all, remember some of those mortgages are first liens.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Some of them are second liens with low LTV, okay? A lot of them are fine. But if you were in a HAMP program, we generally take a big hit like the first mortgage does. Think of it that way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When a first mortgage defaults on a high LTV, eventually the home equity is written off. That is already in the ongoing charge-off numbers, though I do believe it delays the loss a little bit. We try &#x2013; but we try to recognize that in our reserving. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And as they go...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The hit is being taken. In fact, the first is written down. That's what happens.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And after 150 days past due, right, you mark to realizable value anyway and that's included in that assumption, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. But I just think the whole thing gets a little delayed because what happens in the seconds, they are current later than the first are current. There's a delayed effect in the seconds, which we acknowledge and we try to account for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it was a shocking number. I don't remember it exactly but something like half of all &#x2013; in half of the cases where the first is not &#x2013; is in default, the home equity is still paying. Remember the home equity is a loan secured by real estate, they're supposed to pay. Not supposed to walk away from a loan because the collateral is worth less. And a lot of people want to meet their obligations we think is a good thing in life, not a bad thing.</p>

          <p>Morning. A couple of quick questions. One, thanks for giving the DVA number, but I was wondering given the widening credit spreads in Europe if there's a CVA adjustment in the trading line?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In those numbers it's pretty much a wash. Our credit portfolio revenue line has a whole bunch of things going on in it, but not worth &#x2013; they wash themselves out. In fixed income and equity markets DVA/CVAs pretty much the numbers I just gave, 400 and 200.</p>

          <p>Second question; another risk in the market is kind of perceived financial stability of the local markets.

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so think of it as is &#x2013; we think we're fine. We do think there's some exposures in I think some of the municipalities more than some of the states. We do provide credit and will continue to provide credit to states, municipalities, hospitals, state plants, state utilities and that's part of our job. We just try to be cautious in terms of credit. We're not worried about it any more than other stuff. I think we've always been very tight on it.</p>

          <p>Good morning. I think most of my questions have been answered, but I just had two quick ones. First, in terms of reserve recapture, I know you probably don't want to make too much &#x2013; too many definitive statements on the home mortgage side but when we think about it ongoing on the Credit Card side is there any way to think about the magnitude of reserve recapture relative to the improvement in the charge-off ratio or the delinquency trends? You talked about sort of the charge-off ratio potentially going down another 50 basis points in 3Q, potentially delinquencies continuing to get better. Is there any way to sort of equate that pace with the magnitude of reserve recapture in the Card business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I'll give you a really simplistic way to do it. If you think your 12-month-old charge-off is going to be 8%, you're going to have 8% reserves. If you think the normalized rate is going to be 5%, eventually your reserves will come down to 5% of outstandings. That is what will happen. It just will happen over time. We don't know exactly what quarter but eventually &#x2013; and that's true for a lot of these reserves, by the way. And that's why a lot &#x2013; those are about &#x2013; reserving is a very pro cyclical thing. You put them up in the worst of times and then you take them down when things are getting better. So &#x2013; but of the $36 billion that Mike mentioned, a lot of that will eventually come back into income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But that's another place where we look to see the accounting rules get away from that pro cyclicality before this cycle is fully over.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then could you make any comments on the Investment Banking pipeline or your view in terms of when and if Investment Banking revenue will start to pick up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Investment banking is doing fine. And the pipeline is fine. But I always point out to you all that the pipeline is a &#x2013; notoriously can bounce up or down based on the environment and animal spirits and a whole bunch of things. But we see a lot of activity in the corporate world. When they start &#x2013; when people start doing more M&amp;A or something &#x2013; I saw a couple deals were announced this morning, so we'll see.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I was wondering if you could kind of maybe think &#x2013; describe a little bit how much capital you've allocated to the stock buy-back program? How should we think about &#x2013; obviously $500 million is probably less than where you would have thought the dividend might go on a quarterly basis? How much is left there, if any?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You got a couple of billion dollars. Think of there's a couple billion dollars worth of buy-back in a yearly period just to keep net shares flat, going back to an earlier question. So I would have that in mind over a full year's time window, 2, $3 billion is the kind of level for that. Whether we push through that is a separate issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Think of it as a base line. If the stock goes down and we have &#x2013; regulators don't mind, we could buy back a lot more than that. If stock goes up, we may not buy back any.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Okay. And as far as kind of a separate question, you know, there were a couple of questions relating to, you know, checking account pricing related to kind of overdraft fees and debit card fees. Why do you think it is that, you know, we had the Card Act related re-pricings in the industry kind of happen so much faster than checking accounts? We've kind of seen very few announcements of changes in checking account pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just want to comment on the stock buy-back because it's really important. We don't believe that buying back stock is returning cash to shareholders. So we buy back stock when we think it's a great deal for the ongoing shareholders, not the shareholders we bought the stock back from. So it's just a little different than other people look at stock buy-back.</p>
          <p>I think that people are still estimating the effect of all the fees and how it's going to function. And I think that some banks have announced changes in products and platforms and some banks have made changes in deposit rates and some of that. So it's just it's a little bit lagged. And remember in Credit Card, in general the credit card companies were already losing lot of money when some of the stuff got put in.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Last question is, it's been suggested that you wouldn't really see corporate loan demand return until corporations had started reducing some of the cash they have on deposit at banks and you referred &#x2013; you kind of referenced the decline of deposits primarily being WaMu related high-cost deposits. Was there any kind of runoff of corporate liquidity that might be kind of a precursor to loan growth on the corporate side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No. You're looking at businesses there. You'll see pretty stable wholesale deposits, liability balances.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But no, I think a lot of corporations have pre-funded more than normal their future needs in the bond markets when the bond markets opened up. So most people, economists, look at all the cash on corporate balance sheets and say there's a lot and they're waiting for them to start spending it. And you'll see &#x2013; when you start to see plants being built and M&amp;A deals then you'll see more real corporate lending.</p>

          <p>Even middle market, look at our middle market business, I forget the numbers exactly, but 18 months ago we had 100 billion of loans and 100 billion of deposits. Now we have like 90 billion of loans or something and 130 billion of deposits for middle-market clients. So you could say that starts to show they're pretty flush too, and huge unused lines.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks. Two questions, one is in regard to the repurchase program. If I'm reading this right it looks about two thirds of it or one third of it was actually in the quarter and then the other two thirds of the $500 million was in the current quarter since the end of June.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. That's right. It started toward tail end and continued through yesterday.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So the average &#x2013; so it seems like the average shares could actually decline this quarter and if you continue the program decline going forward compared to the average in the second quarter because so much of the repurchase program has been loaded into this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. But going back to what Jamie said, the pace will depend on where the price is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. And then separately, I have a question about the loan loss provision, and the provision relative to average loans was about 190 basis points and your normal charge-off level is hard to say what it was. It was just over 100 basis points in '06 and '07, 200 in '08, and then of course went way higher in the crisis. I guess I would be looking for the provisions to be matching normal charge-offs at some point and with this 190 and normal who knows what, maybe 125 or 150 it seems like we're pretty far there getting the provision back to normal if the provision is going to match charge-offs in some normalized world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're making two points. One is we would agree that in the businesses, particularly the consumer side, charge-offs are running still even though they've improved, at historically high levels. And versus what I showed you at investor day back in February, there is still room to go for charge-off levels to get back to what we would consider to be the appropriate level for the risk we're taking and the way we're building our business models. So that's fair enough. Then reserving, we've spent plenty of time talking about, Ron. You get that side of it as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. But I'm really separating the reserve releases. Eventually the reserve is going to reflect the actual level of charge-offs, but the provision &#x2013; then you'll get there with a provision that is based on normal charge-offs. And I guess I think the question I'm asking is, that we're probably not actually &#x2013; the actual level of provision in the current quarter is not that far from what a normal provision might be.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean when you look in aggregates it's really hard. If you do it by business I understand your point and you may actually be right in total sometime down the road.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess my question is based on this provision you're not that far away from some level of normal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. But we do it the other way. We look at what normal charge-offs would be with no provisioning down the road and what would that mean for total provision. So you may be right. We just haven't done that calculation like that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just a specific question on the Card Services business, there's been some recent media attention focused on the growing level of solicitations across the credit card industry. JPMorgan has been named in a number of those articles as being among the more aggressive in terms of the amount of solicitations. I'm just wondering if you could provide a little bit of color surrounding what your thoughts are in terms of growing the loan portfolio balances perhaps in 2011 with the solicitations you're doing now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Solicitations, so remember, we rolled out three new products, Ink, small business cards, a whole bunch of those, Sapphire, more upscale, actually four products, and then Blueprint, which is how people can manage their finances. We put a lot of marketing muscle behind it because that's what we're here to do with stuff like that. Mike meant, put that aside from the balances. I think we mentioned the balance is going to run off more, like you said...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And that will continue into mid &#x2013; probably mid 2011. The reason for that is we've got &#x2013; we have good spend but we are running off the WaMu portfolio, we're running off some sub-prime, we're running off some &#x2013; we don't do many of these teaser rates anymore and things like that. There's a whole bunch of that we're just kind of running off. That runoff will end by 2011. You'll start to see better underlying growth. And maybe we should break out in the future a little bit of those numbers for you. You can see what business is growing and what business is running off.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Carole Berger with Soleil Group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. My question is &#x2013; well, I have two questions. Firstly, the mark-to-market accounting proposals also have a proposal to let &#x2013; make loan loss reserving less pro-cyclical. Is there a risk that in changing from &#x2013; once these rules change that you will have recaptured too much reserves and will have to then build them again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We're not worried about that. We're not worried about the fair value of carrying it all. We'll figure it out. We'll continue to grow our client businesses. And we try to be very conservative on reserves and it will be what it is. And usually those accounting adjustments are made prospectively, not &#x2013; and maybe one-time adjustments, which people understand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on &#x2013; my other question, Jamie, was you were quite sanguine about being able to pass through fees and other charges to offset whatever the impact of the new legislation is, and my question is, if you were in the Consumer Protection Agency what are the issues that you would deal with by raising fees? Is the industry waving a red flag at the Consumer Protection Agency?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what I said is that all of these things will eventually get priced into the business, okay? And that it's not that we're raising fees. You try to price your product to make a fair profit and treat the customer great. That's the goal of any business. I'm a great believer in treating the customer great. My example was if you can't charge for the soda you're going to charge more for the burger. That's not raising the fee. That's just adjusting your business model a little bit to do something like that. We are deeply in favor of good consumer products. We actually acknowledge that some of the changes we made were good changes.</p>
          <p>The overdraft stuff in certain businesses had gotten to be too much and was too punitive and so we believe in that. So we hope the Consumer Protection Agency does a good job of doing things. But you can't run a business if you can't earn a fair profit. The important thing you have to remember -take banking: to offer a checking account it costs us $300 a year. For that you get ATMs, branches, debit cards, access to cash, you get anti-money laundering which you may not care about, but we have to do, you get Bank Secrecy Act, you get online alerts, you get online bill pay, you get a checkbook, you get all these things. And you've got to charge for this somehow for that.</p>
          <p>Right now you charge at some NII and some fees. It's just a balance of how that works out. The winners in the marketplace are the people who give the best products, the best services at the best cost to the clients. That's business. That's how business has always been. That's not going to change. And if someone is doing something wrong or inappropriate, we think the CPA should go after them.</p>

          <p>Can you guys share with us what you're seeing in the loan underwriting standards? It seems like the senior loan officers' survey is showing on the C&amp;I side that standards are easing.

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, you say weakening the standards. I'd say this is normal competition that you want. It may not be great for us, but the world should want is that lending standards are being competitive like anything else. It's a little &#x2013; in corporate banking, large corporate, it's in the underwriting standard too, warrants, reps, all that kind of stuff, covenants. In middle market I think it's probably maybe a little more pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you seeing it in other lines of business? There was a story I think in yesterday's Wall Street Journal talking about credit cards being issued to people that had filed bankruptcy recently, and I was wondering if there's more sub-prime-type lending going on. Are you guys seeing any of that in the other lines of business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't say sub-prime, but I think in general in small business, our traditional small business loans are up 100%. I think that some people have loosened up a little bit year-over-year in small business, and in credit card and possibly in auto. The auto charge-offs are down this quarter to 49 basis points. When that kind of thing happens you tend to see competition step up and try to compete for business. I think you're going to see more of that. That's what you want. And so you will see standards. And obviously a good bank has to try to maintain standards that give it a reasonable return. We saw what happens when they don't.</p>
