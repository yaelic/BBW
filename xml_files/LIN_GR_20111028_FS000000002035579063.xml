          <p>Yeah, thank you, Dominik and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Also from my side, a warm welcome to our nine months results conference call. I'll open my presentation with a quick overview of our performance in the first nine months of this year on page three of the presentation.</p>
          <p>The positive performance trend you have seen in the first six months of this year has continued, despite the recent more volatile macroeconomic environment... <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:27)</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>So we're back, the line was cut. So I didn't exactly know, where we moved out of the conference call, so I say hello again to our nine months call year and I started just with the highlights of &#x2013; for the nine months period on page three of the presentation.</p>
          <p>And as I mentioned, we have seen a strong performance and continuation of our performance of the six months period against the more volatile macroeconomic background and the crisis at the capital markets since beginning of August.</p>
          <p>With &#x20AC;10.2 billion, our Group sales increased by 8.5%, while the operating profit grew with 10.2% at a stronger pace and achieved the level of &#x20AC;2.4 billion. This performance resulted in an increase of earnings per share of 21.5% to &#x20AC;5.02, adjusted for the allocation of the purchase price, the earnings per share increased by 16.4% to &#x20AC;5.68.</p>
          <p>The operating cash flow further increased by 10.8% to &#x20AC;1.7 billion. Growth in all regions contributed to this performance. We have seen an ongoing strong development in the growth markets and a solid growth in the mature markets. The operating margin in the Gases Division remained at a solid level of 27.3% in the reporting period.</p>
          <p>Based on the performance, we reinforced our outlook of growth in sales and operating profit compared to the record year of 2010, and of course we also reconfirm our full commitments to our HPO program, which will result in &#x20AC;650 million to &#x20AC;800 million gross costs savings for the years 2009 to 2010.</p>
          <p>And I now start with a detail outlook of the performance with Group sales on slide four of the presentation. Gases sales increased by 9% to &#x20AC;8.3 billion. On the comparable basis, sales grew by 8.1%, which shows the continued strong underlying growth. To give you a point of orientation, the comparable sales growth in the record year 2010 was at 5.7%.</p>
          <p>The Engineering Division contributed with a growth in sales of 6.1% compared to the prior year period. The order intake was well balanced across growth market and mature markets.</p>
          <p>For the full year, we expect sales to be around the level of last year and therewith confirm our guidance. The order backlog remains strong with around &#x20AC;3.8 billion and gives a good visibility for the next 18 months to 24 months period. The increase in Group sales was accompanied by a stronger growth in the Group operating profit as you will see now on slide five.</p>
          <p>As already mentioned, the Group operating profit grew by 10.2% in the reporting period. Both divisions contributed to this positive development. The Gases Division achieved an increase in operating profit of 9.7% in the first nine months. The operating margin stayed with 27.3% on a solid level, despite the negative impact of the natural gas price.</p>
          <p>The Engineering Division contributed again with a strong operating profit. We saw an increase of 16.3%. In our last conference call, we have raised the guidance for 2011 to a level of at least 10%. With 12% in this reporting period, the margin is in the Engineering Division well ahead of this target.</p>
          <p>This strong profitability was driven in particular by successful execution of a number of individual projects, as well as appreciation payments of customers for exceptional project execution.</p>
          <p>I would now like to go in more details of our Gases Division and move on to the next page, page six. The underlying price and volume effect in the sales bridge excluding acquisitions for the reporting period was 8.1%. With the negative impacts in the second quarter as well as in the third quarter, the contribution of currency effect tuned slightly negative minus 0.1%. The sales impact from the pass-through of higher natural gas prices, as well as from consolidation was slightly positive.</p>
          <p>To dive a bit deeper into the development in the operating segment, please move on to the next slide, slide seven. And I will start within EMEA, the largest of our operating segments. In this operating segment, Linde achieved sales growth of 7% in the first nine months and the sales number is &#x20AC;4.3 billion. On a comparable basis, the growth in sales was 5.6%. The economy in the EMEA region developed as expected and was characterized by a slight decrease in the growth rates. In this economic environment, we were able to achieve growth in all market segments in this region as well as in all product areas.</p>
          <p>During the reporting period, we brought on-stream the two large air separation plants in the Coastal Town of Mirfa in Abu Dhabi. The plants are operated by the joint-venture of Linde and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, which is called Elixir.</p>
          <p>The new plant produces 670,000 standard cubic meters of nitrogen per hour. The gas is transported inland to Habshan via a 50 kilometer pipeline where it is injected into a gas field for enhanced gas recovery. This major project involves total investment of around US $800 million by the joint-venture.</p>
          <p>Please be reminded that due to the joint-venture structure, as a foreigner, you are not allowed to own majority, the resulting sales will not be visible in the top line.</p>
          <p>In August 2011, Linde commenced production of a new hydrogen plant, to supply Wacker Chemie at N&#xFC;nchritz site in Germany. The plant is remotely controlled and operated out of our European remote operating center in Leuna in East Germany.</p>
          <p>During the reporting period, our healthcare division also scored a major success in Europe. The European Commission granted us a new indication for its INOmax Therapy for use during cardiac surgery as a treatment for peri and post-operative pulmonary hypertension in adults and children of all ages.</p>
          <p>I move on to Asia/Pacific. The economic dynamism in Asia continues. Against this background and based on our leading position in these markets, we achieved double-digit growth rates. In the reporting period, sales in this region rose by 16.2% to &#x20AC;2.3 billion on a comparable basis. The increase in sales was 10.8%. We achieved our fastest business expansion in Greater China and South and East Asia.</p>
          <p>In the reporting period we also achieved double digit growth rates in South-Pacific. With our integrated approach, we have benefited in China from our strong growth in tonnage and the further leverage of our investments from the ever rising demand in the market for liquefied and cylinder gases in industrial zones. In tonnage, we continue to boost business by making very targeted investments.</p>
          <p>To give you three new examples, I would like to mention the new long-term onsite contract with a Chinese steel company, FFS Steel, which is Fujian Fuxin Special Steel Company. We will build an air separation plant on the Zhangzhou site in the Fujian province. Around &#x20AC;25 million is to be invested in the new plant which will produce 10,000 standard cubic meters of oxygen per hour. The plant is expected to come on stream in the second half of 2012.</p>
          <p>In the reporting period, the last two out of a total of four steam reformers to be used in production by GCL-Poly Energy Holdings in Xuzhou, China came on-stream. The plant is now working at full capacity and we are currently supplying the customer with 12,000 standard cubic meters of hydrogen power.</p>
          <p>In Thailand, we will have built the largest air separation plant in the country by September 2013. The new plant is being constructed right next to the existing plant in Map Ta Phut. The investment is worth around &#x20AC;80 million.</p>
          <p>I'll move on to the operating segment, America. U.S. sales in the first nine months rose by 4.6% to &#x20AC;1.8 billion on a comparable basis the increase of cost was more pronounced because of the currency impact, sales was up 10.5%. Also in North America the economic development was characterized by a slight decrease of the growth rates as expected. We were able to achieve growth in all product areas in this region.</p>
          <p>In September, we brought a new plant on stream at the Hillsboro site in Oregon, for the production of high purity nitrogen and oxygen. This will enable us to meet the rising demand from our customers in the electronics industry in the Northwestern United Sates.</p>
          <p>In South America, the economy again grew at a faster rate than in North America. In the reporting period, we achieved double-digit growth here as a result of the positive economic trend. All the product areas constituted to this growth.</p>
          <p>On page eight, the profitability of our operating segments is outlined. In the EMEA region, we have increased by 7.9% to &#x20AC;1.2 billion. This resulted in an operating margin of 28.5%, which is 20 basis points above the high-level of last year. EMEA has continued its positive margin track record, despite the impact of the ramp up of our LNG terminal in Northern Europe and despite the natural gas price impact.</p>
          <p>In Asia/Pacific, the operating profit rose by 14.9% to &#x20AC;634 million. The margin in this segment for the reporting period was 27.8%. The margin was influenced by the pass-through of increased natural gas prices and the preliminary investments for infrastructure expansion, and employment of new staff in the rapidly expanding Asian and in particular Chinese market. Despite these effects, the margin has started to recover compared with the first six months of this year. We expect that on a full-year basis, the margin will be around last year's level.</p>
          <p>In the operating segment Americas, the operating profit improved by 7.4% to &#x20AC;405 million. At 22.8%, the margin exceeded the figure for the prior year period by 60 basis points.</p>
          <p>In general, for all the regions, I would like to point out that the standardization and productivity improvement within our HPO program contributed to the margin development in all the segments.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, you can see the comparable growth by product area. As you know, comparable growth excludes currency effect, natural gas price and consolidation effect and all M&amp;A activities. The performance of the individual product areas confirms the overall positive trends in the Gases Division.</p>
          <p>The Healthcare product area again saw steady growth achieving sales of &#x20AC;880 million on a comparable basis, the figure was 5% higher compared to the last year period. The highest growth rate was again achieved in tonnage. On a comparable basis sales rose by 9.7% to &#x20AC;2 billion in the reporting period. This is not only the result of a steady recovery in the utilization of existing plant capacity, but also from the startup of new plants.</p>
          <p>Significant growth was also achieved in Bulk and Cylinder. In Bulk sales, we have achieved &#x20AC;2 billion, on a comparable basis the figure was 9% above the previous year period. Cylinder gas sales increased to &#x20AC;3.4 billion, which is a 7.4% growth against the first nine months period of 2010.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, we will see the development of the product areas over the last quarters. With comparable growth in the Healthcare business of 5.8% in the first, 5% in the second and now 4.2% in the third quarter of 2011 we see our Healthcare business within the guided range of 5% to 6%, comparable growth for the full year.</p>
          <p>Tonnage has seen double-digit growth rates in the first two quarters of 2011. Despite a very strong prior year basis, the segment grew by 6.5% on a comparable basis in the third quarter. As already mentioned the enhanced gas recovery joint venture Elixir, does not have a top line visibility and therefore cannot to be included in this growth figure.</p>
          <p>In the Bulk business, we have seen solid comparable growth in the first two quarters and a very strong comparable growth of 11.4% in the third quarter of this year. Also in the cylinder business, we had an acceleration of growth rates in the previous six quarters. With 6.4% comparable growth in the third quarter and 7.4% in the first nine months of this year, we are on track for our guidance of around 7% for the full year 2011.</p>
          <p>Let me turn now to the project pipeline in the Gases Division on page 11. Here you can see the total project amount of plants above &#x20AC;10 million, which will go on-stream in the respective year.</p>
          <p>The total investment amount of our project pipeline for the years 2009 to 2013 is &#x20AC;3.3 billion, of which around 70% are allocated to growth markets. In the first six months of this year, we have been able to increase the project pipeline to &#x20AC;700 million for 2012. As you can see, our promising project pipeline from today's point of view is for 2013 at least &#x20AC;500 million worth of investments.</p>
          <p>In respect to the amount of project opportunities with &#x20AC;4 billion, we have provided already an indication with the presentation of our full-year results of 2010. We can reconfirm our positive view on that opportunity pipeline.</p>
          <p>As mentioned in previous calls, we do not publish this figure on a quarterly basis. However, please be assured that if we had seen a relevant change in the pipeline, we would communicate this to you. It is worth mentioning that the project opportunities portfolio has a high number of projects in the growth markets, but also includes major projects in the area of the mega-trend energy and environmental.</p>
          <p>I would like to use the opportunity to give you a short update on the progress in this mega-trend within the year. Please turn to the next slide, page 12. An already important element in the energy environment mega-trend is enhanced oil and gas recovery and as already mentioned earlier the large-scale enhanced gas recovery for Abu Dhabi came on stream this year in July.</p>
          <p>Large amounts of nitrogen are injected into the field, the gas field to increase the exploitation rate of the gas field. Natural gas is also becoming more important in the liquefied form as LNG. Taking this trend into account, we have invested in an LNG terminal in Sweden for merchant LNG, which came on-stream in the second quarter of this year. Precondition for this project was the high market share in the industrial segment in the region and the region without a pipeline grid.</p>
          <p>Also, in the field of floating LNG, we have made an important step this year. Together with our project partner SBM Offshore, we signed an agreement with the Thai oil group, PTT to develop a floating natural gas liquefaction plant. The project will involve the conversion of natural gas into LNG. The feasibility studies for this project started beginning of this year.</p>
          <p>If the targeted gas reserves meet expectation, the project will move into the front-end engineering and design phases by the end of 2011, beginning of next year. The final investment decision would be made then a year later, end of 2012. Commercial production would be expected to commence at the end of 2016 because of the significant size of this project.</p>
          <p>Another element in this mega-trend is clean coal which includes carbon capture and storage. Here Linde is recognized as leader in advanced CO2 capture for power plants. A milestone proving our competence in this area is the award of $15 million by the U.S. Department of Energy for a new pilot plan in Wilsonville in Alabama. This facility will test novel CO2 scrubbing solutions to reduce the energy consumption and costs of advanced carbon capture and separation systems for the coal-fired power plants.</p>
          <p>Once the CO2 is captured, it needs to be handled, which brings me to the handling of CO2. Together with Sapphire Energy, we work on a CO2 Management System for Algae Fuel Production. Sapphire Energy has developed technologies along entire the algae-to-energy value chain resulting in a renewable substitute for fossil-based oil.</p>
          <p>Producing fuel by algae using CO2 from large emitters like power stations and chemical plants is a very promising way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
          <p>Greenhouse gas emissions of cars can be reduced of course with hydrogen fuel cell technology, which is a step on the way to emission-free mobility. The practicability of this technology has been proven this year in the Daimler World Tour. Each of the fuel cell vehicles involved covered over 30,000 kilometers in four continents and 14 countries. The successful introduction of fuel cell vehicles depends on the development of hydrogen supply infrastructure. Therefore, Daimler and Linde agreed to construct an additional 20 hydrogen filling stations in Germany.</p>
          <p>To put it in a nutshell, with the progress in this year, we have proven our position in that mega-trend energy environment and see growth potential in this area. An important driver in this field is the technology developed by our Engineering Division.</p>
          <p>And on the next slide you see the latest figure of our Engineering Division. This is slide 13. In the nine months period, the market environment for international large-scale plant construction appeared stable. Sales in the Engineering Division in the first nine-months increased by 6.1% to &#x20AC;1.8 billion. The continuing successful execution of a number of individual projects meant that operating profit grew at a faster rate than sales, rising 16.3% to &#x20AC;214 million. And as I mentioned earlier, for 2011, we expect a margin of at least 10%. For the first nine months, we have now seen a margin of 12%.</p>
          <p>The order intake in the first nine months was &#x20AC;1.7 billion, which is 9% above the prior-year figure. In the third quarter, order intake was influenced by two major orders from China and Thailand for our Gases Division.</p>
          <p>In general, the order intake was characterized by a number of medium sized new orders as in the previous quarters. The order intake was well balanced between growth markets and mature markets.</p>
          <p>Over half of the new orders related to the natural gas and air separation plant product areas while the remainder were evenly distributed across the other plant types. The order backlog in Linde's Engineering Division remains with &#x20AC;3.8 billion on a high level.</p>
          <p>In North America, we continued to position ourselves favorably during the reporting period in the promising market for the efficient exploitation of share gas reserves. I want to round up my presentation with a look at our cash flow development on the next slide.</p>
          <p>We have the continuous positive development of the operating profit, and based on that, cash flow from operating activities rose by 10.8% to &#x20AC;1.7 billion. The payments for the investment in tangible and intangible assets, significantly increased by 16.9% to close to &#x20AC;900 million.</p>
          <p>For the full year, we confirm our guidance of investments in the Gases Division to be around &#x20AC;1.5 billion. The payments for the acquisition and financial investments of &#x20AC;55 million, mainly includes the acquisition of a 51% share in the joint-venture of Eastern Oxygen Industries in Malaysia where we will have in the future then 100% ownership.</p>
          <p>The majority of the free cash flow before financing of &#x20AC;867 million was used for the full-year dividend payment of around &#x20AC;400 million and for the debt reduction. For a better comparability, the figures do not include the payment for our strategic liquidity reserve of &#x20AC;600 million in quarter three, 2011, which is invested in German bonds with a maximum maturity of up to two years. This reflects our strong focus on safeguarding our liquidity. The reserve can be converted into cash on short notice.</p>
          <p>In this volatile environment, it is important to see how our net debt has decreased, which you now see on page 15. Our previous and current credit ratings are A minus in Standard &amp; Poor's terms and A3 by Moody's. This assessment reflects, among others, our stable cash-flow generation ability and significant de-leveraging over the course of the last year.</p>
          <p>Both ratings were confirmed by the agencies just recently. The net debt figure decreased in the reporting period by &#x20AC;265 million, down to &#x20AC;5.2 billion. The dynamic indebtedness factor net debt to EBITDA ratio fall from 1.9 times at the end of 2010 to 1.7 times end of September.</p>
          <p>Let me move now on to the outlook on the final page of the presentation. On Group level, we expect in 2011 further growth of sales and operating profit. Furthermore, we reconfirm the target range of &#x20AC;650 million to &#x20AC;800 million gross costs savings of our HPO initiatives in the years 2009 to 2012.</p>
          <p>In the Gases Division, we expect an increase in sales and we aimed to achieve an over proportionate operating profit increase. In the Engineering Division, we expect 2011 sales to reach the same level as in 2010 and an operating margin of at least 10%.</p>
          <p>Please let me also highlight our mid-term target which we have published together with the Annual Report in March. For the Gases Division, the average CapEx sales ratios should be 13% plus. As you know the plus stands for large-scale mega project in the energy/environmental mega-trend area.</p>
          <p>In 2014, we want to achieve on a group level, an operating profit of at least &#x20AC;4 billion and we want to further grow the return on capital employed to 14% or higher.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. We will be happy to take your questions now. Catherine, please.</p>

          <p>[Operator Instruction] The first question comes from the line of Peter Clark from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, thank you. Two questions actually, the EBIT margin underlying adjusted for natural gas looks like it's about flat now at Q3, having been down in Q2, obviously with price and efficiencies coming through against cost. Just &#x2013; I presume I'm right in thinking you are confident that moves ahead as we go forward into Q4 and into next year. And then, on the other side, on the merchant bulk, that was accelerating in Q3 year-on-year, the cylinder slowed slightly year-on-year and I would have thought that's despite some price inflation coming through as well. So, I'm just wondering on the cylinder side, there must be larger volume effect. And is there is a simple explanation for the acceleration of merchant against the slower growth in cylinder? Is it like Asia on the bulk merchant against Europe dragging back cylinders or something like that? Just trying to get a feel for the moving parts within the bulk merchant and the cylinders? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you for your questions, Peter, I start with the merchant bulk question, I think we have seen a two trends as you pointed out rightly. We saw a strong growth in Asian markets. And we also include the ramp-up of our merchant LNG business into that bulk area. This is also a further acceleration, which is of course Western Europe and is not Asia.</p>
          <p>From the perspective of the cylinder area, I think the cylinder business is with our 7% guidance on the right level, I think you have to understand parallel trends in the first half year, we have seen a significant acceleration supported by a strong cylinder business in the Eastern European markets.</p>
          <p>And of course, we are continuing developing our footprint in the Asian markets. Some of these markets are already cylinder markets, as you know. For example, Malaysia is a significant cylinder market for us, Bangladesh, Pakistan also India has a long standing cylinder business, but mainly in China, we are developing the cylinder business further in our industrial clusters and respective area also against our specialty gases offer on the cylinder end. And I think this is all supporting this trend.</p>
          <p>And from the perspective of the margin development, I think we do not given guidance now for the next quarter but against the development of our plan, as we pointed it out from a development, in HPO for example, we have a plan for further grow margins in the respective businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just ask a follow up then on the pricing? Presumably the price momentum &#x2013; certainly your peers were indicating price momentum, particularly in Europe, is moving ahead. I presume you are still seeing that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as we had it in the last conference call, it seems to me that we do have, from a European perspective a little bit the better footprint. We have seen some pricing deterioration in the electronics business, mainly and we have seen in the healthcare business against the tender pressure in the different markets also a slight decline from a pricing perspective. But this is &#x2013; at that point in time not significant, when we go into our core business in Europe, we really have seen in the LPG business, and in the PGP business an okay price performance at that point in time.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for taking the question. Can you give us a little color in the engineering environment? The growth or the momentum for project planning is &#x2013; has not changed so much. When do you expect this to happen? When there should be more projects in the market and then higher growth for intake &#x2013; order intake? This is the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is, in contrast to your other gas peers, your growth in America and the Americas is lower. Can you give us a flavor on this as well?</p>

          <p>Markus, I handover regarding the first question related to engineering to my colleague, Aldo.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon from my side as well. You're right, I mean there is a very full pipeline of projects, but comparatively too few awards as of lately. The reason for that is obviously that due to financial constraints, the hurdle rate, big projects has been raised by the owners and they go through financial and due diligence product plans than usual. I can tell you however that there are a number of projects with very high maturity also big ones and actually we expect that Q1 next year will be a very busy one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perfect, thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question on North America, I think you have to see the structural differences between the footprints against especially the peers from &#x2013; with the North American background. The footprint from the pipeline network in the sunbelt of the U.S., as you know and the growth in the hydrogen business is to that extent not at the same size visible in the Linde footprint. And I think this is one of the reasons, so it's a structural part, it's not and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the low growth is not coming then from cylinder business in U.S. as you have only a small portion of <mark type="ph" /> very small than our regional reason (41:07) in the U.S. business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I don't know if I really got your question, but you know that our cylinder business in North America is focused on the specialty gases.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Andrew Benson from Citi. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. Just two questions, it may be that I was perhaps a bit distracted, Peter Clark may have already asked this. I don't want to &#x2013; I apologize if I do. The acceleration of the bulk sales, am I right that was the Swedish LNG plant, it does seem odd in the current environment that you have seen a progressive acceleration through the second and third quarter in the growth of your bulk business, whether there is anything else sort of special in there?</p>
          <p>And then on slide 11, you say project amount for 2013 already $500 million. So, presumably that is a good number to have that in there. So, I was wondering if you could sort of frame that &#x2013; that if current trends continue, would that mean you are going to end up over $800 for the full year and $900 for the full year, just to give some sort of dimension to that and what it says about the growth opportunities in the medium term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you for your questions Andrew. I think on bulk, as you said, it's Sweden, it is Scandinavia, it is against our decision to invest into an LNG terminal in south of Stockholm. This is in three years business case from a ramp-up perspective, so that is just starting and then that is something which we will include in the bulk business and this will support growth in the bulk area.</p>
          <p>Related to the pipeline on page 11 of the presentation of $500 million, I think you have to see it in context. First of all, it is, when we take into consideration that joint ventures are included, this is a very small number of joint venture activity in 2013. So we talk about a consolidated figure, which will be more significant compared to 2011 where half of the $800 million was joint venture activity, as you know.</p>
          <p>So from this perspective, this is something from a top line impact, is something which we have to take into consideration. And from an overall perspective to grow that number, this depends on the projects we will additionally win in the next periods and depends on the construction period, which is linked to these projects.</p>
          <p>So normal construction period for mid-sized projects is 18 to 24 months, but when it is a bigger project, it's about 24 months. So I cannot give you a number here where we end up, especially when the electronics area would grow faster than we would have active solution for our electronics business customers for example in China, which was filling up the pipeline for 2012 significantly still end of 2010 and even within 2011 at the beginning of 2011.</p>
          <p>So, I don't want to talk about the number, I only can give you the number, which is today &#x20AC;500 million, which we evaluate also in context of historical performance as a very strong number already.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I just a little clarification on the bulk thing, had the LNG distribution not started up, i.e., on a kind of like-for-like basis, was there a discernible slowdown in growth? Because it's not that apparent from your numbers that you are seeing much in the way of slowdown, so in other words, the underlying market conditions that you are seeing are still pretty good, if I can interpret that way or am I being optimistic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said it's just starting, it's a ramp-up impact. It's not so significant against the 11.4%. I haven't the number in detail with me, but it is still above, let's say it that way, excluding LNG, the number is above Q2. So we have seen an acceleration also in the Asian markets of the bulk business excluding the LNG impact in Scandinavia.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And the next question comes from the line of Stephan Kippe from Commerzbank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Two questions, one with regards to the cash flow, the operating cash flow, which was obviously very good at this quarter. You had quite a significant turnaround in working capital. Perhaps you could shed more light, what &#x2013; basically what the reasons for that were and how do you think that working capital is going to move forward?</p>
          <p>And in connection with that, you had some quite impact in the second quarter from others that kind of slowed it down again towards 140 million negative in the third quarter? Maybe you could give us an example of what was in these other changes in Q2 and to how often these one-time effects come in?</p>
          <p>And the second question it is actually, in terms of the sales bridge, you provided us with currency and natural gas over nine months. I did my own calculations for the third quarter, I calculated slightly above 1% increase year-over-year in natural gas prices and minus two in terms of currency, maybe you could tell me if I'm far off that with my calculations?</p>
          <p>And oh, yeah another &#x2013; a third one, Air Liquide two days ago said that they were seeing in terms of demand from end markets, slowing demand in steel but also a more negative outlook in manufacturing and automotive. Do you see similar things or is the situation there better for you? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First of all, thank you Stephan for making a compliment on the cash flow development, I see it exactly the same way, you also should see that this is against a strong performance on our working capital management in detail, so receivable development is very strong. We were working very hard on that performance and I think this is really the main reason.</p>
          <p>As you know on the other changes, we do have seen changes in provisions, which is mainly, for example, related to the engineering business, but also to the situation that in quarter two you have the payout of bonuses, for example, from a performance perspective of the previous years. This is a normal pattern, so it's not unusual. If you compare that with the previous year development, you will see a similar pattern normally versus Q2 and then you also have related to tax issues normally and front-loading into the first half year of the quarter one, quarter two period compared to Q3 and Q4.</p>
          <p>But the main reason for the outperformance here is the better performance in receivables and days outstanding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may interject quickly is that &#x2013; the current thing? Is that a status that you think you can hold onto, you want to further improve. So where is from a working capital perspective where is this going?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's of course a mix as you know in the markets where you have a significant debt crisis from a state perspective of course it's already a very good number. Our intention is always to improve, but I &#x2013; you have to see it realistic. It is a good performance level, if you can keep that you will see additional cash flows flowing in the period to come, but I wouldn't say that you have significant opportunity to further increase.</p>
          <p>You also should take into consideration that we have in the third quarter the payout of $35 million of what we booked for engineering in the second quarter. Therefore, the cash flow normally would be a little bit better if you compare that year-on-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the sales bridge, honestly, I think I cannot solve that in the call. I propose that Dominik will give you a call later to check out what your calculation is and what ours is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the third question related to automotive development the comments of Air Liquide, of course, you have to qualify here that the different automotive customers we have, have different performance levels. You know, of course that the German auto industry is at that moment in time very strong in all of the markets. That can be related to the question and comment of Air Liquide, I think. From an automotive perspective, I think this is answered.</p>
          <p>From a steel perspective, I think it's more a relocation pattern, which you see in these days. You see some customers switching off capacity in Europe and go into other places, where they are switching on capacity. So I wouldn't say that this is a trend, it's a kind of consolidation against the better cost position from a customer perspective. So I wouldn't say this is already a trend of lowering capacity, it's more an optimization of performance.</p>
