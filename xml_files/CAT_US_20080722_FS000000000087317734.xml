          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Caterpillar Second Quarter Earnings 2008 Conference Call. At this time, all lines have been placed on a listen-only mode and we will open the floor for your questions and comments following the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mike DeWalt. Sir, the floor is yours.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. And good morning everyone, and welcome to Caterpillar's Second Quarter Earnings Call. I'm Mike DeWalt, the Director of Investor Relations, and I'm very pleased today to have our Chairman and CEO, Jim Owens; our Group President, Ed Rapp; and our CFO, Dave Burritt on the call with me today. This call is copyrighted by Caterpillar, Inc. and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of this call without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you would like a copy of today's call transcript, you can go to the SEC filings area of the investor section of our cat.com website. Or you can go to the SEC's website. Where it will be filed as an 8-K. In addition, certain information relating to projections of our results that we'll be discussing today is forward looking, and involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause the actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of the factors that individually, or in the aggregate, we believe could make our actual results differ materially from our projections can be found in our cautionary statements under items 1A, which is business risk factors, of our Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 2nd of 2008.</p>
          <p>Okay, earlier this morning, we reported results for the second quarter of 2008. And in addition to our normal quarterly release, we also filed an 8-K with the SEC this morning outlining our 2009 price increase for Machinery and Engines.</p>
          <p>First, the quarter. Without a doubt, it was a very, very good second quarter. Our all-time best quarter ever for sales and revenues, for profit, and for profit per share. And I'll spend a few minutes reviewing the key points from the quarter, the outlook for 2008, and the 2009 price increase announcement. Let me start with second quarter results, and the headline numbers were sales and revenues of 13.6 billion, and that was up 20% from the second quarter last year. And profit per share at $1.74, and that was up 40% from last year. If we look at the top line, sales and revenues were up 2.268 billion. And the elements were Machinery volume, up 787 million, or about 11%. Engine volume was up 615 million, and that's an increase of about 18%. Price realization added 398 million, and about 207 million of that was related to Engines and 191 million related to Machinery.</p>
          <p>Currency impacts increased sales by 384 million. And that means that sales that were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar translated into more dollars because the dollar was weaker on average than the second quarter last year.</p>
          <p>And finally, Financial Products revenues were up 84 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, if we take the 2.3 billion increase in sales and revenues by region, we see a continuing trend. Relative weakness in North America more than offset by strong growth outside North America. In fact, sales and revenues were up 52% in Asia-Pacific. Latin America was up 27%. And EAME, our Europe, Africa and Middle East region, which includes the CIS, was up 22%. And even in North America, we were up 7%. The strength outside North America is clear from those numbers, particularly in the developing world, Latin America, Asia, excluding Japan, and the CIS, Africa, and Middle East regions of EAME. Many of these regions have been major beneficiaries of rising commodity prices. Their economies are growing faster than in the more developed world, and they are spending on infrastructure, mining, and energy.</p>
          <p>This quarter, 60% of our sales and revenues were outside North America. A year ago in the second quarter, that number was 55%. But I think to really appreciate the magnitude of the shift in geographic mix, we need to go back and look at what happened over the past two years when North America was coming off of its peak. Compared with the second quarter of 2006, Asia-Pacific is up 84%, Europe, Africa, Middle East is up 60%, and Latin America is up 55%. And during that same period, sales and revenues in North America were down 3%, and actually closer to 13 if you adjust for Progress Rail, which we acquired at the end of the second quarter of 2006.</p>
          <p>Now, I don't really want to get too involved in a two-year retrospective, but I think the magnitude of that change is important. And remember, for Machinery, we've historically had higher margins in North America, and over the past two years, sales are down in North America. At the same time, we've seen those dramatic increases in sales to the developing world. And that has been a headwind to our Machinery margin rate.</p>
          <p>Okay, that's enough on the two-year retrospective. Let's get back to the comparison with the second quarter of 2007. And in that comparison, I mentioned that North America was up 7% at the top line. And that might be a surprise to you. You may be particularly surprised to see Machinery sales up 8%. Please remember, though, that end user demand for new machines is continuing to decline in North America, and we are definitely still in a severe trough in the United States.</p>
          <p>There are several factors that you need to keep in mind that are helping our North American sales despite depressed end makets for construction equipment. First, North American dealers reduced inventories in last year's second quarter by about $800 million. That means that dealers satisfied about 800 million of end user demand from inventory. And that had a negative impact on our sales last year. This year, dealers also reduced inventories in the second quarter, but only by about 200 million. So the negative impact on our sales was much less than last year. Second, mining is doing well, particularly for coal. Coal prices are up substantially from last year, and U.S. exports of coal are rising. Sales to coal customers were well up from the same period a year ago. In addition, sales from Engines were up in the quarter, on highway, petroleum, marine, and industrial engine sales were all up. Also remember that our Machinery and Engine sales include a wide array of services, including after-market parts, Progress Rail, CAT Remanufacturing and CAT Logistics. And these businesses are generally not as cyclical as the new machine sales.</p>
          <p>Okay, we had a record top line, up 20% in the face of extreme softness in North America, and weakening in Europe. Let's turn for a moment to profit. Our second quarter again was the best ever for profit at a 1.106 million, and $1.74 a share, profit dollars were up 34%, and per share was up 40%. We did have a discrete tax benefit in the quarter of $47 million. Without that tax adjustment, profit would have been up 29%, rather than 34, and profit per share would have been up 35 rather than 40%. The tax adjustment was a positive in the quarter, but it still would have been an all-time record for profit and profit per share even without it. Our improvement in profit versus a year ago was the result of 398 million of improved price realization, the higher physical sales volume, and the $47 million tax benefit. Those positive impacts were partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, particularly for material. And about 80 million of negative product mix, essentially all related to Machinery. Overall, manufacturing costs were up 143 million. And essentially, all of that increase was material and freight. Material costs were about two-thirds of that total, and freight and expediting the other third.</p>
          <p>Now, supply chain-related operating inefficiencies and tight capacity in many of our facilities continues to be a problem. We had those issues this quarter, and we had them a year ago. That said, the situation is stabilized, and we expect continued improvement as the year progresses. Our manufacturing cost increase in the quarter was virtually all related to material and freight costs, everything else, including the impact of inflation, was about flat. Machinery and Engines SG&amp;A and R&amp;D expenses combined were up about 113 million. But declined slightly as a percent of sales. And the increase in operating cost was mitigated somewhat by the absence of a $44 million pre-tax pension charge from the second quarter of last year. And finally, the impact of currency on operating profit was a negative again this quarter, by about 62 million.</p>
          <p>I'm going to switch gears for a minute and talk about our operating profit rate. For Machinery and Engines, operating profit was 1.430 billion or 11.2% of sales. And that compares with operating profit of 1.120 million a year ago, or 10.6% of sales, in the second quarter last year. All of that operating profit improvement was related to Engines. The Machinery operating profit was little changed from last year. Without a doubt, our Engine businesses had an outstanding quarter. And I'll hit a few key points to help put the Machinery and Engine margins into perspective.</p>
          <p>First, Machinery is about two thirds of total sales, and Engines are about a third. And more than half of this quarter's improvement in price realization was related to Engines, and that really helped Engines operating profit. Of our total material cost increase, it was virtually all machines. Engine-related material costs were about flat with last year. All of the negative currency impact was related to machines. And sales mix was about 80 million negative for Machinery, while engine mix was very slightly favorable. Okay, that's a summary of the quarter.</p>
          <p>I'm going to move for a minute to the full-year outlook. We adjusted the outlook slightly. We expect sales and revenues to be about 50 billion for 2008, and profit per share to be about $6.00. Our previous outlook was a range of 47.2 to 49.5 billion at the top line, and that was up 5 to 10% from 2007. Our prior profit outlook was a range of 5.64 to 6.18, or up 5 to 15%. And the midpoint of the outlook was 48.4 billion at the top line, and 5.91 per share. I know we didn't increase the numbers much, but a few of the elements of the outlook did change. In terms of sales, we're a little more bullish overall, particularly in the developing world. Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and our EAME region excluding Europe. However, we continue to pessimistic about new machine sales in the U.S., and have lowered our already negative full-year machine industry expectations a bit more. That said, overall we are slightly more positive on our full year 2008 North American sales in total.</p>
          <p>We had a good second quarter, engine sales are up, and our integrated service businesses are not as cyclical as new machine sales. We have, however, lowered our expectations for European machine sales. Like other companies you've heard from, we have seen declines in Europe. We expect those declines to continue through 2008. We've adjusted our outlook accordingly, and we expect to lower production schedules somewhat in Europe, particularly for smaller machines. In terms of profit, our prior forecast had a midpoint of $5.91 per share, and our current outlook is about $6.00 a share, up slightly. The positives are higher sales volume, better price realization, and that second quarter tax adjustment, which was not in our prior outlook. Two negatives to the outlook are higher material costs and freight costs. Higher steel and fuel are the principle drivers. In terms of material costs, we now expect 2008 to be up 2.5 to 3% versus 2007.</p>
          <p>Okay, let me put that outlook for full year material costs and price realization in context. First, we expect that for the full year 2008, and actually for the second half of 2008, that price realization will exceed material cost increases. In fact, for the full year, we expect that price realization in dollars will be more than double our material cost increase. So that's a positive. However, if you look at price realization and material costs compared with the outlook that we issued in April with our first quarter release, our previous outlook, we're seeing a bit more of an increase in material costs than we are in price realization. And that's a bit of a drag on the full-year outlook. And it's offsetting much of the profit improvement related to our increase in the outlook sales volume. That said, our new outlook is better at the top line and better at the bottom line than the midpoint of our previous outlook. And that considers a weaker Europe and that considers more of a drag for material costs than we previously expected.</p>
          <p>Six key points here just to summarize. First, we had a good quarter, our best ever for sales and revenues and profit. Despite severe weakness in the U.S., a weaker Europe, a negative product mix, and a negative impact related to currency. Second, our costs are up from last year. But when you consider overall inflation, we're doing fairly well. In fact, manufacturing costs in the second quarter were only up 1.4%, and that includes labor, overhead and material costs. And considering where inflation has been, particularly for material costs, that's not too bad. That said, we still have a lot of room to improve, and we think we're doing the right things to drive that improvement. Okay, third, in terms of the outlook, we do see a weakening picture in North America, Western Europe, and Japan. And they are all included in our full-year outlook. Fourth point, our order backlog continues to be very strong. Commodity-related end markets are doing very well, and from a geographic standpoint, the developing world continues with good growth. Point five, sales of many of our products are production constrained. For most large machines and engines, we are selling as much as we can make. And finally, we have a diverse business in terms of products, services, end markets, and geographies. We have some that are doing very well and that are helping to offset very negative impacts from others.</p>
          <p>Okay, one more thing before we move to the Q&amp;A. We did announce our 2009 price increase this morning, and that was a range of -- an increase of 5 to 7% on machines and engines effective January of 2009. That's more than we did early this year and it's more than we did last year. The announcement is about six weeks earlier than our price announcement last year, but given order backlogs and the material cost environment, we decided to announce the increases a little earlier this year.</p>
          <p>Okay, that's it. We're ready to move to the Q&amp;A portion of the call. And again, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so we can get as many people in as we can. Operator, we're ready for our first call, please.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Citigroup. The question I have, you just commented that price would be twice as much as your increase in material costs. If you look at the guidance for material costs, you said 2.5 to 3%. So if I take the midpoint of that, it's saying your costs will be up around 900 million. For a price to be 1800 or 1.8 billion, that means you need a back half of the year price realization of over 1.1 billion, 1.2 billion. Just to make sure I'm reading that correctly, you're saying price realization is going to accelerate to well over 5% each of the next two quarters after you just did 3.3 in the first half. I know you did a mid-year price increase, but is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not quite correct. I think your material cost number is a little high. You want to base it on something more like 22 billion.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It shows up in material cost increase. It's not your total operating cost.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that was for the second half &#x2013; that was for this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was for the full year, for '08.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the price increase is for '09.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct, I'm just trying to think through the second half of the year. It still seems that you're baking in a little more price realization than the first half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, David, that's correct. We had the mid year price increase, remember. So it's -- price realization in the second half of the year we think will be a little better than the first half. But material costs are going to be higher in the second half, and probably up a little more second half to first half than price realization is up. Again, price realization will be up more than material costs, but not as much more than the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And for the price increase for '09, obviously that level of price increase that the question was raised about demand destruction. Can you take us through where you think you'll get obviously mining, oil and gas, you would think, but can you take us through a little more detail where you think you can get that kind of pricing and not have a demand response?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, Jim Owens. We -- as Mike said, we indicated our price plans a little earlier this year for '09 because of our concern about cost pressures that are out there in the marketplace, basically stemming from higher steel prices. There's a lot of pressure to take steel prices up, and up significantly, in the second half of this year. And energy costs and transportation costs, of course. We're doing -- and steel is in a lot of the things we buy. So it's not just direct steel purchases, but components that include steel. Our global purchasing group, working very closely with our product managers, is working very hard with key strategic suppliers to hold back those price increases. But if the overall economy, you know, in the OECD world begins to bottom and  accelerate and pick up a little bit in '09 and '10, we think those cost pressures are real and will be there. So we're trying to protect ourselves in being sure that we can fully cover material costs with a price out in the '09 timeframe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And by announcing the price increase this early, Jim, which is a good two, three, sometimes four months earlier than you normally do, can we expect January 1, a large majority of your shipments will be going out with the price increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, for some of our products, yes, I think -- we'll still have some price protection probably that spills over into '09, but not a lot. And that's why we announced it early, so we wouldn't have that price protection issue. But I want to stress one other point. I mean, we're going to obviously be very attentive to what the market will bear. The question you had is can we get that. Certainly in mining, in oil and gas, and in a lot of places where commodity prices are very strong and demand for our products is very strong, we would expect those will happen. In some cases, we're indexed. Our prices are indexed to producer price indexes (sic) [indices]. So as these steel and energy costs work their way through, we get it automatically. But in all cases, we're going to be looking very carefully at the marketplace, the value that we provide to customers, and being sure we're competitive and holding our market position. So it depends on what the market will allow us to do.</p>

          <p>Thanks, David. Next question, please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Daniel Dowd [Sanford Bernstein]. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Bernstein. Let me actually touch base on guidance, because as I look at your guidance for North America, you said that you've taken it up, but it only reflects the earlier part, better strength in the earlier part of the year. I think that implies that you're not seeing a weaker second half in North America, and while you're also seeing weakening in Europe, you've also indicated that Europe, Africa, Middle East as a region is actually, net, going up, compared to your previous expectations. And your guidance seems to imply if you end up hitting 6, that your EPS in the second half of the year is actually probably lower than it is in the second half of last year. Can you just talk through, you know, if you view that as conservative? Or if you think that actually the weakening is such that your EPS growth year on year is likely to be minimal in the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that was -- Dan, that was one question and nine follow-ups all wrapped  in one. But I'll try and take them all. First off, on North America, we did have a pretty good second quarter. When you look at our guidance for North America, one thing you do need to remember is that much of the dealer inventory came out in the first half last year. So the second quarter of last year. So when we're looking at our sales quarter over quarter, there's probably a bigger impact from the dealer inventory change in the first half than the second half. Second thing is if you just look at sales to end users of new machines, that has continued to decline, and I think the second half without a doubt is probably going to be weaker than the first half, because that's continuing to decline. But engine sales are doing pretty good, mining is doing very well, coal mining is up a lot. Energy, machines into the energy sector, are doing very well. So there's still good pieces of North America as well.</p>
          <p>With respect to Europe, or EAME, Europe, Africa, Middle East. That's right, overall, we took our guidance for EAME up just a little bit, like a few percentage points. I think it was 7 to 12% a range last time, and now I think we're talking 10 to 15. And we've seen really good growth, continued good growth, in EAME outside of Western Europe, and we've seen declines in Western Europe without a doubt. But again, when you think about our products, many of them being -- we're selling as much as we can produce, you know, to some degree to the extent that EAME is -- or Europe is down, we can divert a little bit more production to some of the other areas. So that's a help there in some of the other areas.</p>
          <p>In terms of first half, second half profit, I think the observation that you and I think others have made, our second half profit expectation is lower than first half, is absolutely true. Let me kind of put that in some context. First, we have sales declining a bit in the second half. We had I think 25.6 million in the -- 25.6 billion in the first half, and we're looking at about 25.4 billion in the second half. So a decline at 50 billion even of about 800 million. And I said a minute ago that our price realization for the second half was going to be a little bit better. So that means that volume in the second half is actually down a little bit from the first half. And so that will be a bit negative to profit overall. The relationship between price realization and material costs, we're going to get more of a material cost increase in the second half than we're going to get increased price realization. And we're going to have more price realization than material costs, but relative to the first half, it's not going to be quite as net-net favorable. So that'll be a little bit of a drag on second half profit versus first half.</p>
          <p>And then don't forget, we had two things in the first half that aren't going to repeat in the second half. Remember we sold our interest in ASV to Terex in the first quarter, and we had about a $60 million gain related to that. Secondly, in the second quarter of this year, we had the tax adjustment, $47 million after tax. So those two items certainly aren't going to repeat in the second half, and so those helped improve first half profit.</p>
          <p>So I think that's a reasonable summary of first half, second half, a little bit of a tighter comparison on price versus material costs. Volume going down a little bit, second half versus first half. And remember, first half is normally the kind of the selling season. Normally second half is the big strong quarter for sales -- or second quarter is the strongest quarter for sales. So you would normally expect, particularly in the third quarter, sales to go down a bit. So that's sort of at a high level, I think, the summary of first half, second half, and an update of the regions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Ann, JPMorgan, good morning, guys. I guess I'll focus on something slightly different. Well first, Mike, could you just confirm, my analysis suggests that your input costs will be up somewhere around, a little bit north of 600 million. Is that kind of directionally, where  you're thinking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now when you say input costs, you mean material costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Direct costs, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean we said sort of 2.5 to 3%, and our purchase volume is, order of magnitude, 22 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, yeah, okay. I just wanted to make sure I was calculating it correctly. My question is on the financial services business. Past dues were up to 3.35 in the second quarter. I know that that's below your last cycle's peak, but given the environment out there, you know, could you just give us a little bit more color on what's going on in financial services? And just, you know, how bad could it get for that part of the business? I mean, one would think that the cycle is worse than the last downturn and could be more prolonged. So things could deteriorate quickly on the finance side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ann, this is Ed Rapp. I'll cover that one. Yeah, you know, needless to say we're watching it very close, as you pointed out, you know, past dues did grow to about 3.35%, and that's up from the 2.09 last year. But, you know, if you look at the write-offs net of recoveries, just 19 million for the quarter versus 12 million for last year, so that shows you from a write-off perspective, very much I'd say under control. If you look at our allowance to loss ratios, I think being well managed, and I think we're in a good position in that regard, so I think we're well below the last downturn. If you go back to 2002 and kind of look at those numbers, the past dues then peaked at about 4.78 versus that 3.35 we're having now.</p>
          <p>Another critical one is that the &#x2013; if the write-offs at that point in time reached &#x2013; peaked at about a 0.69% of the average retail portfolio, and that's kind of more than double the annualized rate we saw in the second quarter of this year. So, yeah, there is the softening in North America and probably some risk there, but I think it's being well managed and it is well below the kind of peaks that we saw from the pressure on the financial side in the 2002 period.</p>
          <p>I think the other thing on CAT Financial that's important to note is that in terms of new retail business, they had a record second quarter, $4.6 billion globally of new retail business. And I think it just shows the benefit of the global expansion of CAT Finance, where they're benefiting from  some of the growth globally that we're seeing in other parts of the business. Access to funding continues to be good, you know, the recent issuance on medium term notes have been oversubscribed into 3 to 4 to 1 type ratios, so we still have good access to funds. And I think overall Cat Finance is doing what we expect them to do, is just deliver good sustainable earnings through the peaks and valleys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd add just a little bit to that Ed, our spreads, too, spreads in the market are a little higher, but we've been able to take that to the marketplace. So we're not being penalized by a little tighter spreads, and they needed to be there just to manage risk. But the other thing I think gives me a lot of encouragement about CAT Financial, we've been through some very difficult times. I remember most prominently the Asian crisis in '97, where we really had a cataclysmically negative situation across a lot of areas that CAT Financial had a lot of exposure. And we managed that at the end of the day with very little write-offs. We had a lot of late payments, and we moved a lot of product around. But keep in mind, again, we get good down payments, we know the customers, we know the product. When we have to repossess it, we can repossess it, and remarket it. So that has been a real strength for CAT Financial, the highly integrated nature of how it works with our dealers and with the Caterpillar organization.</p>

          <p>Are you confident at this point, then, that even if the downturn in the United States or North America is as bad or worse than 2002, that the diversification can support the business? Is that where your confidence is coming from?</p>

          <p>You know, the thing that gives me a lot of encouragement is our last half of the year outlook is for continuation of what I would describe as significant recessionary conditions in essentially the old OECD world, United States, Western Europe, and Japan. All down between 30 and 40%, and sliding. And with that outlook, that being an integral part of our outlook, we're still confident enough to say that we think we'll be around $6 a share.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, Credit Suisse, and congratulations, my question, just a follow-up on the guidance. I mean, you grew the first half 19% and the back half implies 4%. And I'm trying to get a feel for, to ask Daniel's question differently, if I look at what you grew EAME in the first half and what's implied for the second half, it seems like a quite a dramatic falloff. So can you just comment more what you're seeing in Western Europe, and from Ann's question, did you say you expect that to be down 30 to 40%? And then also on the Asia-Pacific side too, just your implied guidance in the back half of the year just seems, you know, that the growth is going to be much lower. Is that all Japan or are you seeing any weakness in China and India?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of things, Jamie. One, I think, remember, for a lot of product we are supply constrained. If we had an unconstrained forecast, our sales number would be higher than it is. So I think that's one factor, particularly for our large machines and large engines. That's a bit of a limiting factor on our top line for the second half of the year. And we're doing a lot of little things to add capacity, CPS is helping. We announced investment in North America, and Asia, India and China in particular. But in the short-term, first half to second half year, our ability to produce is a bit of a dampening factor. We do think that -- we didn't quantify it, but we do believe that Western Europe or Europe is, other than the CIS, is going to be down, but the region overall for the year anyway, is up a little bit. But if you look at first half to second half, we had pretty good increase last year. But I think, again, our -- we're a little bit constrained on our ability to supply second half. We do see Europe weakening, and we do see demand in North America weakening, no doubt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When you see Western Europe weakening, are you expecting it to the magnitude that you see North America? Because I think you said peak to trough, you're off 40%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, peak to trough-- that's going back to Q1 2006. I think historically, Europe's peak to trough has not been quite as dramatic as North America historically. But we don't really disclose the regions of EAME separately.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just a follow-up question, on your peak earnings of 8 to 10 bucks per share, I think I asked last quarter how you felt about that. And you said one of your biggest concerns is North America takes a little longer to recover, which is happening. And now we have Western Europe falling off. So, I mean, how comfortable are you with the 8 to 10? And are there any offsets that you're seeing, whether it's through CPS or pricing, that give you confidence that you can achieve that number in what seems like a weaker macro environment.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim Owens, just a comment on that. The 8 to 10 wasn't a peak, by the way.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The range that we anticipated with the strategy we're working hard to deploy that we would be able to achieve in 2010, and my answer is we're still quite comfortable with that. The United States will eventually begin to recover. Housing starts this year are going to be below a million starts. I think the country needs somewhere between 1.6 and 1.8 million. We will eventually work through this credit crisis and will burn off the excess inventory. And I think we're demonstrating we can function pretty well and deliver pretty good results in the face of pretty severe recessionary conditions in the U.S. Housing market certainly, and in -- again, with some recessionary conditions in many of the markets we serve in Europe and Japan. So I think there's a high probability that we'll start to see recovery in those areas by 2010. And a lot of the other capacity expansion work, CAT production systems work, et cetera, give us confidence in the range that we've provided you for 2010.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess my biggest question is on pricing in North America. I think you had up 3, which I thought was extremely strong, especially given your comments on where at least the construction side of the end market is going. So I wonder if you can maybe give any granularity on what mining is versus construction? Or whether you're positive in construction and how you manage to do that in such a steep downturn.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and we're talking about second quarter here, just to clarify for everybody.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, a couple of points, Rob. Jim made a comment earlier that mining, for example, a good piece of that was formulaic based on partnership agreements or alliance agreements that we have with mining customers. So certainly, there's pricing in industries like that. The second thing to remember is if you go back and look at what happened, because we're comparing second quarter to second quarter. If you go back and you look at the second quarter last year, pricing was very weak, in fact, it was down versus the prior year, actually negative. And it was a year where we were working with dealers to really help get inventory out. And that was negative to price realization, and the second quarter this year -- or last year, I'm sorry. So I think that -- I guess the way I would describe price realization in North America is Q2 last year was particularly weak and this year we still have a pretty tough environment. But we didn't take $800 million worth -- help dealers take $800 million worth of inventory out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fair. Let me follow up on the inventory question, then. The North American dealer inventories were up you said in dollars and months year over year. Is that because the dealers are more optimistic than you are going forward? Or do you think they just missed their sales forecasts and that's why they ended up with a little bit more inventory?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good question, Rob. First off, I'll just sort of clarify. Both of those numbers, both in months of supply and in dollars, are up slightly versus a year ago. It's not a stampede of inventory. And I think, in fact, if you were to poll most dealers, my guess is they would tell you that they would like more inventory. And it goes back to the point that particularly for, you know, core and large machines and large engines, you know, we're selling what we can get produced. They see a tight supply. Normally at this part of -- at this stage of a North American or U.S. machinery cycle, there's plenty of availability of product. We're not seeing that today, and my guess is they would like to see better delivery performance than they're getting right now. It's a lot tighter because of the strength outside the U.S. Again, we're a big net exporter from the U.S., particularly for the large machines and engines. So I would say tight supply driven by the rest of the world is a factor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe, Mike, just a little bit of color on that. Our marketing companies are working hand and glove with our dealers to manage their inventory positions. They know we're moving through with the CAT production system, a process to deliver more just in time to their needs, more standard configurations, and to really pull that inventory back out of the dealer channel. So we are managing pretty carefully orders, so we don't have excess pockets of inventory build up anywhere in the system. And that's a global phenomenon that's &#x2013; we're increasingly aggressive on, trying to manage dealer levels to appropriate levels to get the business, but not have excess inventory.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Mike, given your comments about capacity constraints on the big machines and big engines, can you give us some idea of what percentage of new capacity you will be adding and when that will roll in, so we can start to think about '09 revenue growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've talked about it in a couple of ways. You know, one, just the continued implementation of CPS should improve throughput. So that's a positive, and that's ongoing. We've seen some benefits of that this year, and that should continue on to '09 and '10. And then, let's see. In June, I think mid-June, we announced capacity increases for the big Illinois facilities, which produce a lot of the large machines. And that's this year, next year, we announced essentially I think a three-year program of a billion dollar capacity increase. So that will come on over the next few years. So I think that's -- I think that's the most we've said so far on kind of the details of how it's coming in. But I mean last year, right now, you know, we were tight on supply and we're up versus a year ago. So without a lot of new bricks and mortar, we have been able to get production schedules up. And, you know, we expect to get them up some more next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe, Mike, just a little more. I mean, the Lafayette capacity is coming on as we speak, and that's helping us on the big engine side, and that's about a $400 million investment that's by the end of this year will be fully deployed. And that's a significant capacity increase there. But it's ramping up as we speak this year. We also have four new plants under construction in China as we speak, two announced just recently that will be under construction in India. So our footprint in the emerging markets, and that would be supported by a lot of supplier development work, will be adding significantly to our capacity. And we bought SEM in China. We're looking now to brownfield expansion around that facility, and lifting capacity there. So we're not about to give you a 2009 outlook yet, but certainly we're working on a lot of things that will over the next, as Mike said, three years, begin to bear fruit in the way of new capacity available to us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think in fact I just looked at that this morning. At the conclusion of this call, we'll post up the retail numbers.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Goldman Sachs. Thanks. Mike, trying to think about the price/raw material balance as you move into 2009. And I guess in particular the $600 million material cost inflation number, which I think you'd indicated two thirds of which is material and a third was freight, but maybe that whole piece is materials. But in either case, I guess in this context, I think you disclosed earlier that 10% or so of your materials is steel, so that's 2.5 billion with a spot market up 60 to 100%. I know you have got a lot of protection this year. I'm wondering if in this context you can help us think about that price/raw material tradeoff as you go into '09, obviously, you're aggressively raising price. And so we would assume that those material costs will ramp up aggressively as well from 600 million in '09. But if we just assume steel prices sort of stayed flat through the end of '09 from here, so let's say a very theoretical exercise, how much of those raw materials go up on you in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Terry, I'm going to be very careful. We don't have any '09 guidance, so I'm going to be very careful in answering it. But I think Jim alluded to this earlier, our Purchasing Group has done a pretty darn good job of holding back price increases, working on the timing, working on offsets. Trying to work with these steel suppliers to find things that we can do to mitigate the increase. And we've done a decent job of that. I think you see that in our second quarter numbers. And I think all things considered, you see that in the guidance that we have for the full year. And that number that you were talking about did not include freight. That was just material costs. So I think, in context, we've done a darn good job of managing in this material cost environment this year. But your point is a good one, and it's, I'd say, directionally correct. You know, if things don't change, 2009 is going to be quite a bit more challenging on material cost than 2008.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then we're a quarter further down the journey here on CPS, and it's good to see that you're not seeing sort of the friction costs from manufacturing inefficiencies that we were. I guess we're all hoping to see that turn from neutral to something positive. I'm wondering if we're far enough down the path here where we might be able to talk a little more specifically about what you think that number could look like in 2009.</p>

          <p>Let me just add a brief thought on the CAT production system. And we've talked about this as a journey. And quite frankly, with 300 manufacturing facilities around the world, it is a big change management process. But a lot of metrics, but my sense is we're beginning to get a lot of traction, we talked about this before, but certainly our safety numbers and quality numbers have improved, and improved steadily and in some cases dramatically. But across the board on the how metrics now, things like product availability, our on-time shipments, percent of the material coming through on <mark type="inaudible" /> inventory record accuracy, et cetera, et cetera. Almost across the board, those metrics continue to get steadily better every month. I'm impatient also to see pull-through on cost and on velocity, but I think these are things you're going to see steadily over the latter half of '08, '09, '10. Our target was to have this thing at kind of world class performance level by '10. I wish it could happen overnight. It's not going to. But our teams are working very hard on it across the organization, and you can see discernible traction. And for those of you that have visited our facilities, it's there. It's going to yield a dramatic improvement, I think, certainly in inventory turns between here and 2010, and stay tuned.</p>

          <p>China has been very good growth. I'd say I don't see any signs of declining demand in China. It looks pretty good. Now, again, you know, our sales to a degree are limited by production. But the Asia region in total, China looked pretty good.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, they were, particularly because of the tax change. That was not a part of our outlook.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Excluding the tax change was my question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>-- we don't do quarterly guidance. So I'm going to, other than that, I'm going to let that question go.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and in terms of the large machine products in particular, that -- where your capacity constrained, sold out for some period of time, and in turbines, are these products where over the last quarter you've seen your delivery lead times remain relatively static? Or have they actually increased?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in general -- I won't say necessarily over the last quarter, but compared to a year ago, without any new -- any new factories producing these things, our volume is up. So I think compared to a year ago, we're doing more. Yes, particularly large engines, as Jim said, Lafayette's production is up. Solar had a good quarter. And mining as a percent of our total sales, actually rose in the quarter versus a year ago. And that's an indicator of big machines. So yeah, I think we're doing better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, I don't mean to be dense, but so you're saying that you think delivery lead times have actually come down somewhat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, delivery lead times are a function of what the order board looks like, not just what you're able to produce. What lead times, particularly for big products, are still pretty long, but our shipment performance, our volume, have both improved.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, but my question was whether lead times have been relatively unchanged or have extended.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Alexander Blanton [Ingalls &amp; Snyder]. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Ingalls &amp; Snyder. I've got sort of a broader question, although I have the same concerns as most people. The fact that your second half guidance of 2.82 is below 2.90 earned a year ago, and well below the 3.04 that had been expected by the Street. But I think you've gone over a lot of the reasons for that already. But it seems to me that you've got a problem coming up in 2009, and I'd like to get Jim's view on this as an economist, because you've announced 5 to 7% price increases for 2009 to overcome inflationary cost increases. Inflation in this country, including food and energy is about 5% now, compensation is up 3%, a little better -- 3.2%. Clearly, if everybody increased prices 5 to 7%, the Fed would have to step in and do something. Now, you've said that the efforts to reduce inflation in these developing countries with interest -- the increases in interest that have been announced, have not been very effective. So if they're not effective, and this inflation of commodities continues, it would seem to me that that's going to make the economic situation in the U.S. considerably worse. The Fed will have to do something to prevent inflation from becoming embedded in -- or if it does become embedded, well, that's an even worse situation. So don't we have a dilemma here? Is there a way out, Jim? What do you think is going to happen in the inflation environment worldwide, globally, in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's a pretty big sweeping question, and I guess I should call Bernanke and see if he can help us here. But I don't see us going into any kind of '70s style high inflation, stagflation. I think the emerging markets of the world are being prudently conservative now in beginning to tighten their monetary policies and raise interest rates and try to slow growth and slow inflation somewhat, and hopefully they'll do that well. Commodity prices, as we've indicated several times, could drop fairly significantly, I'm talking 30 percentish. And still be at levels that would be attractive to drive investment in the mining and oil and gas industries because there has been such a prolonged area of underinvestment.</p>
          <p>I'm a little concerned very specifically about the steel industry because there's more concentration globally in the steel industry. Material &#x2013; their energy costs are clearly up quite a bit. Iron ore pellet prices are up quite a bit, and they have a pretty strong position to push a lot of that through to the market. I hope we're being prudently conservative, but we wanted to position ourselves to be sure we could cover material cost increases that might work themselves through in the latter half of '08 as we go into '09. That would be the best way I know to say that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you're benefiting as usual from the increases in inflation rate that have occurred in worldwide economies. This always happens with Caterpillar in every cycle. But as those inflation rates come down, as commodity prices come down, you -- the other side of it works and you get hurt. So -- but you're saying that you think you could see a substantial decline in commodity prices, and still not see a big decline in demand. Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. I think if there's a significant decline in commodity prices, from current levels, then you'll still see pretty strong demand because of the, again, very prolonged underinvestment that occurred in global mining and global energy, and that would be coal, oil, gas, power distribution, et cetera. Those things play to our strengths. And I think even with the commodity price decline, which is likely in my view, we'll see continued strong demand in those sectors.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Asking Alex's question a little bit differently. When you look out to 2010, the 8 to 10 goal, which you just kind of reaffirmed that you have a high comfort level with, do you have to have a recovery in North America and Europe to achieve that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think if we're in severe recessionary conditions in the U.S. and Europe, we probably won't be there. But I think if we are anywhere near trend levels of activity, which I would expect to be, then we have a very high probability -- that's why we have a range, by the way, a very high probability of being in that range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it would be extraordinarily unusual for the U.S. not to be in a fairly significant recovery by 2010, in my view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is Mike. I think there's frequently this glass half-empty view that North America, the U.S., is declining and going to get worse. I mean, it has been going down now for over two years. It's way off the peak. It's down, order of magnitude, new machine sales to users, 40%. So it has already seen quite a fall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It has dropped as much as it did in the last two recessions, the '91-'92 and the 2001-2002, recession already. It will probably get a little worse, then I think it will begin to recover. I don't know when that recovery is going to start. As we get out to '09, we'll give you the '09 outlook. But whether it's early '09, mid '09, late '09, we'll see. But I would be very surprised if it isn't under way before we get to 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just a follow-up if I could. If we do see a recovery, it likely will be prefaced a little bit by some accommodative measure from the central financial institutions in each region. What sort of timing would you kind of throw out there that that would have to occur to see that 2010?</p>
