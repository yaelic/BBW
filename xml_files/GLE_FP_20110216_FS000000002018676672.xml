          <p>Okay, good evening everybody and the people on the line. Welcome for this yearly results presentation. We will make a short presentation, and then we will have a Q&amp;A session. I just would like to say a few words, and then we will go through the results briefly. For us, 2010 was an important year. If you remember, at the beginning of 2010, we said that we would see a rebound of our financial performances, and we committed to a certain number of objectives, and I think we effectively delivered this rebound.</p>
          <p>And secondly, maybe more importantly, we launched a major transformation program because I am really &#x2013; I do believe that banks will have to conform, in a world where the economy is changing and in a world where regulatory changes will also have an impact. And we decided to launch a major project with 50 initiatives.</p>
          <p>And to a certain extent, maybe what is even more important for me is that these 50 projects have been launched with a lot of energy, a lot of dynamism, and I'm very happy in the way it is going forward. If I just stick to these projects, have in mind that one of the pillars of this strategy is the client satisfaction. I consider it will make the difference going forward if you look in the next 3 years or 4 years' time, with what happened in the crisis it is of the utmost importance, and we are delivering, and I will give you examples which we spoke with individual clients as well as with corporates.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I'm convinced that banks need to industrialize their models, reduce their costs, gain efficiencies. So, we have again launched a series of projects regarding our IT systems and Lean management of our processes. Thirdly, human resource is also very important. I think personally that banks need to look at the long term in terms of talent management. We need to be able to recruit. We need to be able to train to keep our people to think long-term about career development, that's what we are doing, as well as having a responsible policy in terms of remuneration. So, that's all these projects. It's just year one of the transformation. We will carry on, of course.</p>
          <p>The second element is the rebound of financial performances. Beginning of 2010, we had said at least &#x20AC;3 billion. We are at &#x20AC;3.9 billion of net profit. Also very important, we financed the economy, and we developed the loans. We had a responsible also policy in that context. As we said, we had positive results in Russia at the end of 2010. There is a positive contribution in Russia, and again I can elaborate if you wish, there are a lot of things which are being implemented, and I was in Russia just three days ago, and it's very positive.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, we reduced our risks and we improved our risk profile on generally speaking credit and market risk, as well with legacy assets, which have as you've seen an impact, which is lower, slightly lower than the lower figure of the range we gave at the beginning of 2010. And all that I think shows that we are really moving in the right direction. The financial structure is strong at 8.5% of core Tier 1.</p>
          <p>We &#x2013; the Board has decided to propose to the General Assembly a dividend of &#x20AC;1.75 per share. It means a 35% payout ratio like as we committed, and with a scrip option for the shareholders, again, like we said in fourth quarter in order to manage our capital in the next three years. That's what I wanted to say as an introduction, and Didier will now go through briefly our different businesses.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric, good evening. If I look at slide 4, just to comment quickly the main headlines of the P&amp;L. So you can see that for the full-year 2010 net banking income rose by 20% to &#x20AC;26.4 billion. Operating expenses increased slightly by 4.3%, reflecting on one-time measures to transform the group operating model, and also the new hires and recruitment that we made to strengthen our commercial franchises serving our customers.</p>
          <p>As a result of these positive <mark type="inaudible" />, the group cost income ratio improved by 2 percentage points to 63.4%. And with the fall of the cost of it by more than 30%, we obtained this &#x20AC;3.9 billion for the group, for the full year of 2010.</p>
          <p>If I go to slide 6, and I dig into the cost of risk, we can say that the cost of risk has decreased in line with our expectation in 2010. You can see that cost of risk for the full-year 2010 went down by 23 basis points to 83 bps. If I look for each division, starting with the French Networks at 50 bps, there is a 8% decrease compared to last year, in line with our expectation, and we continue to see a loss rate, which is low for the housing loans and also for the large corporates.</p>
          <p>The cost of risk for the international retail banking division remains stable in 2010 at 196 basis points, and this is marked by mixed trends with on one hand, housing of this cost of risk both in Russia and Czech Republic, while on the other side, we continued &#x2013; we continue to see a high level of cost of risk in Greece and to a less extent in Romania, where the risk grows significantly from the second quarter of last year due to the deteriorated macroeconomic environment.</p>
          <p>In CIB, excluding the legacy assets, the cost of risk is at 5 bps, so extremely low reflecting the good quality of our corporate portfolio, both for structured finance and traditional commercial banking. And I already commented on the legacy assets, where net of the revenues, which is positive, the impact was below the low end of the range that we indicated during the year.</p>
          <p>Lastly, over the course of fiscal year, specialized financial services add 221 basis points. There was a full circle compared to last year, which started early into the year of 2010 for the equipment finance and started to materialize consumer finance, especially in Poland as for midyear. Why do we continue to face a high cost of risk in our Italian consumer finance subsidiary. Altogether, <mark type="inaudible" /> the cautious provisioning policy that we are putting into place in 2010. You can see that the doubtful loan coverage ratio for the group as a whole has increased by 4 percentage points during 2010 and stands at 72% by end of 2010.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, a very brief comment on the capital position of the group, which remained sounds at 8.5% Core Tier 1, and 10.6% total Tier 1 ratio. You can see on that the provision for dividend which currently is cash-weighted, 39 basis points in the calculation of the ratio. So, if we have a 60% success rate in the scrip dividend, which will be proposed in late May, this means that we will recoup 24 basis points positive and boost Core Tier 1 and Tier 1 by end of the second quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, regarding the structure of our balance sheet, you can see that the focus of the group in 2010 has been on gathering new deposits. We have increased deposit base by a little bit more than &#x20AC;39 billion, of which almost &#x20AC;17 billion for the <mark type="inaudible" /> French networks. These show that we were able to improve the loan-to-deposit ratio of the group as a whole. In term of spending program, we have executed easily the 2010 program with &#x20AC;29 billion long-term funding rate above let's say initial guidance, and we intend to raise &#x20AC;26 billion of senior debt in 2011, &#x20AC;5.6 billion have been already raised as of end of last week.</p>
          <p>If I turn to the French networks on slide 9, just to comment that the momentum was a very strong both at the commercial level than the financial level. I will not comment all the details for the growth of outstanding and increase of the customer base, just to mention that from a financial standpoint, we have been able to increase our revenues by 4.5%, so above our guidance, and this was ex-<mark type="inaudible" /> and ex-<mark type="inaudible" />, which we have consolidate for three months in 2010. And thanks to this strong dynamic increase of revenues, cost to income ratio improved by 1.5%, and group net income increased by 22.4% compared to last year.</p>
          <p>If I go to page 11, regarding international retail banking definitely it is an area where we have a key attention looking at current events that took place in North Africa and Ivory Coast, but before commenting that during the Q&amp;A, just to remind you that these divisions have been able to deliver a contribution to net profit last year, a bit short of &#x20AC;500 million, up 7.5% compared to last year, and when we look at these three regions where we are active, we were able in Russia as Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric mentioned in his introduction to confirm this is a break even with &#x20AC;30 million of net profits for the retail banking business in Russia in the Q4.</p>
          <p>In CEE, we have seen a proactive management of our positions, with the closure of 51 branches in the regions which are facing the economic difficulties, especially Greece, and we have opened 30 branches in areas we have cause to believe we can gain market share and benefit from growth. Last but not least, in the Mediterranean Basin, Africa, and the French Territories, we have gained more than 10% of new individual clients, increased our loans outstanding by almost 10%, and you can see it's where we have focused most of our branch opening last year.</p>
          <p>Slide 12 is just to comment a detailing our ambition in Russia, where we are creating today the first private network in Russia in terms of branches and loans to individuals. 2010 has been the year to confirm as the financial upturn to create a single management structure and also to launch the first phase of the consolidation from a legal standpoint of our organization. In 2011, we would also rollout our universal banking model, both for individual customers, business customer, and finalize the merger of the information systems of <mark type="inaudible" /> and Rosbank.</p>
          <p>Slide 13, just to comment briefly on the strong rebound we've seen in Czech Republic, with the net income increasing by 28% to &#x20AC;250 million. This is typically the type of country you make sure where we want to intensify commercial relationship with our clients. We are also willing to develop our market share in Southeast Europe. We have registered strong gain in market share in both Serbia and Bulgaria in 2010. And you can see that Romania was profitable, &#x20AC;77 million of profit for the full year thanks to its low cost to income ratio and the measures that we have put into place in 2010 to face the difficult economic situation. And in Greece, we intend to continue the restructuring of Geniki.</p>
          <p>Lastly, regarding Mediterranean Basin and Sub-Saharan Africa and French Territories, I will leave maybe the news flow to be commented during the Q&amp;A. But just to mention that last year, <mark type="inaudible" />investment contributed &#x20AC;253 million bottom line. Our banks in this region are extremely liquid, especially Egypt you can see that the loan to deposit ratio is at 67%. Just for Egypt, NPLs stood at a little bit more than 3% and the covered ratio of the NPLs stood at 94%, so the bank is extremely strongly reserved. In Sub-Saharan Africa we intend to deploy innovative solution in 2011 and going forward, and we are confirming our medium and long-term strategy for this region.</p>
          <p>On page 15, a brief word on the CIB where you know that in 2010 we have implemented a transformation of the franchise based on three priorities: first, supporting our customers, second developing a more balanced model drawing increasingly on our <mark type="inaudible" /> and advisory capacity, and lastly the optimizing our operating model and risk profile.</p>
          <p>You have more detail on the side that will not determine that precisely, but just to mention that we have made 400 net new hires to strengthen the franchise in 2010, and you can see that in terms of optimization of the risk profile, we are in the process to roll out our resolution program which aims to invest &#x20AC;600 million over three years to improve the efficiency of the platform. We have reduced our operational risk and also deleverage the legacy assets with &#x20AC;8.6 billion of disposals and amortizations.</p>
          <p>If I turn directly to slide 17, just to comment on the financial performance, we have reduced &#x2013; recorded a &#x20AC;7.8 billion of revenues in 2010. If I start with the financing and advisory, you can see they have achieved very good results with &#x20AC;2.7 billion of revenues, up almost 4% and supported by a strong performance in structured financing.</p>
          <p>On market activity the performance was satisfactory in the volatile environment with revenues at &#x20AC;5 billion evenly split between equities and fixed income. In equities, we have benefited from demand in structured products, while <mark type="inaudible" /> products that expand both in volumes and margins compared to '09. And in fixed income, we have also been able to extract as presented during our investor day, to extract synergies in structured products from the equity derivatives <mark type="inaudible" />. And on the flow side, I'd say despite market share gain in currencies, which were illustrated in the previous slides, the commercial activity has a certain pressure on margins like our peers.</p>
          <p>Altogether, so as I said, revenues for the core activities stood at &#x20AC;7.8 billion. Thanks to a strict cost management and despite the large investment that we have conducted in 2010, the cost to income ratio is one of the lowest of the industry at less than 60% for the group bank, and on the compensation ratio at 36%, so one of the lowest of the industry.</p>
          <p>If I turn to slide 18, to make comments on the specialized financial services and insurance, we can say that we've seen last year an excellent performance of the insurance business both in life and non-life, and both in France and overseas leading to a 13% increase in revenues. On the corporate financing side, we've seen a rebound. We announced that a year ago, benefiting from good growth for the fleet management business, improvement of the second-hand vehicle markets, and also in pure equipment finance, we've seen an acceleration in rebound of the new business as from midyear and a good resilience of the loan margins.</p>
          <p>On the consumer finance, we've seen a start of the recovery of this division with new business stable ex-<mark type="inaudible" /> this in 2010 compared to 2009, with strong performance in Russia <mark type="inaudible" />, because of new debt to revenue ratio, which is a common subject for the whole industry, and a slight growth in Germany and in France. And we continue to grow the franchise towards a more important exposure to cap financing, especially in Russia. So altogether we're seeing a strong rebound of the contribution to &#x20AC;343 million.</p>
          <p>Lastly, on the private banking, global investment management, and services, page 20. Just to mention that the private banking has confirmed its ability to maintain a satisfactory inflow rate at &#x20AC;4.3 billion, a little bit short of 6% of start of the year assets under management. Margins were slightly down compared to 2009 because of spreads which have narrowed a little bit of interest rates, so essentially the treasury activities which have been hurt by this more difficult interest rate environment.</p>
          <p>On the custody side, we grew the franchise by 9.4% to &#x20AC;3,352 billion of assets under custody. And we have also continued to deliver operational efficiencies; you can see that operational expenses decreased by more than 10% over a 2 years period of time.</p>
          <p>For NewHedge, we have consolidated our leadership positioning. We have also there reduced the cost to income ratio by 4% point. And we grew the result by more than 60% compared to 2009. And last, but not least, on the asset management, we can say that as the integration between PCW and MetWest is now successful and finalized, after let's say outflows in the first three quarters of last year, Q4 has confirmed stabilization and recovery of the franchise with a positive inflow of &#x20AC;0.8 billion.</p>
          <p>We have also strong performance in our funds, and you can see that those MetWest and PCW altogether have 7 funds ranked 5 stars with Morningstar. The contribution of these division increased to &#x20AC;289 million last year compared to a little bit more than &#x20AC;200 million in 2009. That's it for the performance, and now I leave the floor to Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric for the conclusion.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Didier for this quick panorama of 2010. So as you can see, we've done a lot in the different businesses, and again we enter 2011, I think we will left off positive moment in our businesses, a lot of energy in our teams. Now there's still a lot to be done and to a certain extent, we open a second phase 2011, 2012.</p>
          <p>First of all, let me comment in what kind of environment and what has in mind for this new period. In economic terms, let me say that on one hand we see positive things on the ground with our clients. At the end of the day the level of activity, the economic trends are pretty positive, and at the same time, I consider that there are still a lot of unbalances in the world economy and that can change in 2 months' time.</p>
          <p>So I keep in mind something which might remain volatile, a lot of these imbalances need to be tackled, addressed, and it will take time. So we should keep that in mind. And so we will remain prudent, I would say in our risk management. Secondly, clearly in regulatory terms, we are still in a transition period. On the capital side, decision has been made with Basel III, and we are implementing the adequate capital management policy to meet our objectives in 2013.</p>
          <p>On the liquidity side, there are proposals which are under observation, and we will carry on saying that while it makes of course sense to be stricter in terms of liquidity, and we have not waited for the regulators to do that, but at the same time, there are certain parameters which in our view, makes no sense and should be amended, and with all the banking participants we will carry on maintaining the dialogue with the regulator on that.</p>
          <p>And then third, of course, still remaining, this question of the systemic financial institution, the resolution mechanism. At the end of the day what we say when we look at all these layers of regulation is that it makes sense to make the system more resilient, but at the same time, it needs to work. And at a certain point, there will be too much that the system cannot absorb.</p>
          <p>So, that's the environment, an environment which requires a lot of discipline and more than ever, I must say the beginning of this year I can say that the strategy we've proposed to our shareholders- the transformation program is well suited for the changes which will take probably the next 3 years to 4 years, and we want to carry on implementing the changes. So if I look at 2011, we've just make the list of I would say not all but some of the key targets for us, which is to a certain extent, in 12 months' time, will make us say it is a successful year, in noting this transformation phase.</p>
          <p>First thing in the French retail, I consider that the capacity to move forward in our &#x2013; in the mutualization of our IT system is important, very important. In our 2011 which will have on the &#x2013; we have in mind a growth of the revenues of the MBI but to a lower extent than last year in 2010 because you know the <mark type="inaudible" /> will have the impact of the increases of the remuneration plus a decrease of the commissions just to collect the money so that will have an impact. So again cost &#x2013; productivity gains will be key in the French retail. Secondly, regarding Russia, clearly the achievements of this legal consolidation, and again I can elaborate further on that, I clearly see the positive outcome of the merger.</p>
          <p>Regarding the CIB business, get the first results of all the investments we've commented &#x2013; we have recruited people, some of them have joined just 2 months ago, 3 months ago, they will deliver revenues this year. So we had in mind the growth of our MBI in 2011 versus 2010, and we are confident about that. The start of the year, as I said this morning is pretty good. Now 6 weeks, 6 months, a year, and as I said, the environment might remain volatile, so I remain prudent, but nevertheless, the start of the year is very encouraging.</p>
          <p>Regarding the businesses which are really improving, like Specialized Financing and Global Investment Management, I have &#x2013; the main focus, I would say, on the consumer credit side to ensure that 2011 is this last year of turnaround, in particular in Italy, and so that in 2012, this business can deliver a performance in line with what we should expect. Across the group, ensure that we are able to finance our investments and 2011, 2012 will be two years of investment. We will get the benefit in 2013, and beyond, but we are able to finance these investments without deteriorating our cost to income ratio.</p>
          <p>We want to continue to improve the group risk profile, what I mean by that, maintain as I said this conservative policy in terms of risk, while carrying on also reducing progressively our legacy assets I think we really have the right strategy and the 2010 results I think illustrate that and you have &#x2013; we can again also elaborate on that, there's an update of the valuation by BlackRock of this book, which is confirming the results of June, and then it's something which is also important, the launch of the new brand platform, which will accompany this transformation in the next five &#x2013; four to five years there will be a &#x2013; we will keep the logo, we will keep our name, nevertheless, there will be a new brand platform which I think will be also positive and in line with what we wanted to achieve.</p>
          <p>So as you can see 2011 will be a year of hard work again for Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale staff, but there is clearly a very strong alignment today, a very strong commitment of everyone to our objective and I think it will be a new stage, which will confirm our targets for 2012 in particular &#x20AC;6 billion net income and net profit for the group. That's what I wanted to say, now I will open the floor to questions. Okay, so we have five hands raised at the same moment, so we will start by the lady <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I have a few questions if I may. First of all, is it possible to get an update of the Basel III capital and where do you stand, this is the guidance you provided at the Q3 results? Secondly, on your discussions on regulate &#x2013; with regulators, maybe could you share with us, kind of what are the key issues you're looking at and what's priority, is it more liquidity coverage ratio, or are you more lobbying for not having anything on the capital buffer for systemic important banks, or what kind of hurdles or dates that we should be looking for and also maybe also just on &#x2013; for the insurance, the EU financial conglomerates, is that something we should expect soon, you know clarity on at least or confirmation? And thirdly, just on the provisions if you could have maybe some granularity on color on <mark type="inaudible" />, the quality trend &#x2013; asset quality trends for the different countries, especially Romania and Greece.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will let perhaps Didier comment on the Basel III guidance. That has not changed basically, but Didier will give you again the figures and perhaps on the provisions, let me just say few words on regulation. They are I you wish two major fields. On the liquidity side, the regulators have proposed as you know ratios with assumptions. I think everybody again agrees with the idea of having the capacity to model stress test in particular for short period of time and to ensure the banks are able to resist.</p>
          <p>What we think is not meaningful is the assumptions, detailed assumptions behind the stress tests and let me just give you a few examples. First of all, the eligible assets for the buffers, I mean just in terms of risk monitoring, management and diversification. The idea that you will concentrate in government bonds for me does not make sense. We should of course have government bonds, but we should have generally speaking eligible assets, which are eligible to &#x2013; assets which are eligible to refinancing of the central bank and for example covered bonds as well as I must say regarding equity because at the end of the day, in this crisis, when you look at it, equity has remained the most liquid asset of all. You can take a haircut, it makes absolutely sense if you wish, but the most liquid asset has remained equity. And that's one topic we think we should have the capacity to maintain more diversification over it.</p>
          <p>Secondly, when you look at the assumption, more detailed assumptions on the deposit, there is for example, in <mark type="inaudible" /> compared again we work with experienced, the assumptions on the corporate deposits, which makes no sense. We suppose that few quarters of the deposits of the corporate disappear in one month, except if you have a kind of contract of cash management with the company. Again it's certainly not what we've experienced in the crisis, we think it's much too harsh.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, everyone will <mark type="inaudible" /> that if you take just one example, the backup lines to banks. In the way it is designed, there will be no backup lines for banks &#x2013; in any banks, because they are basically supposed to be drawn day one. So how can <mark type="inaudible" /> in the balance between inflows and outflows hence to mobilize long-term resources fundamentally or let's say stable resources. I mean deposits.</p>
          <p>How can you finance today backup lines at a cheap price when you have to in front of that pay deposits? It makes no sense. So we are saying again we experience of the crisis in the last three years which was the worst in the last 100 years. It did not show there was a particular problem of that. So these are a few topics, you see some of them being very technical where we feel really the system should be adjusted. That's one element, and it's with the Basel III &#x2013; the Basel committee.</p>
          <p>Then there is another discussion, another topic which is more in the FSB and then also with certain government like in U.K about the systemic financial institution, the shape of the banking industry or what about again splitting banks et cetera? What we are seeing here fundamentally is that, first of all we do not think you can reduce the systemic risk element to first of all the banking sector. And then to just a question of size or simple criteria. When you look at the crisis, certain &#x2013; you look at the list and I don't want to give names that some of the banks which disappeared and created the worst losses were very simple and single, not diversified models and which some of them would not probably be considered as systemic. And so the first thing that we are saying is that we don't think it is that easy to define a list of names and what could be the impact of the names which are not considered as systemic for their own business. We don't think it makes sense to increase further the capital if the problem is really such an issue that it creates more or less, it is very close to the bankruptcy.</p>
          <p>We don't think anyway, it's just a question of capital or at least what kind of amounts and what would it mean for the system and that we should put more attention to the way to again ensure the resolution of the crisis, maybe create, look at this contingent capital, but again not have such a simple answer issuing and adding capital. So this &#x2013; the timeframe for that should be around mid-2011 apparently, and the banking industry as a whole is carrying on discussing with the different regulators, the members of the FSB to ensure an outcome which would make sense.</p>
          <p>At the end of the day, what we have to consider is again, security that makes sense. Now the best way to have 100% security is to stop doing anything. It's as simple as that and the need to have a banking sector which can work and so there is a need to balance all these ingredients. Basel III is already enhancing very significantly the profile of banks in terms of capital as well as liquidity even if there are changes of the parameters <mark type="inaudible" /> scale and we feel that fundamentally the regulator should stick to that.</p>
          <p>Consider again the cross-border resolution mechanisms can surely be more harmonization but again fundamentally avoid adding too much layer of additional capital. That's all for the regulation. Perhaps, Didier, on Basel III and the different provisioning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, on Basel III of our guidance and it mean the same is we have these objectives so to be at 1st of Jan. 2013 7.5% under Basel III with 40 bps of I would say management level that we would have to activate and also thanks to the strong earnings momentum in 2013 dividend payment again in scrip of the deferred tax asset will be at 8.5% by 2016 for the 50 of the target. And that three year that we will confirm and that we presented in third quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>On the provisioning quality, it was specifically to Romania and <mark type="inaudible" />. So in Romania in terms of the cost of risk for the quarter we were in and cannot give that <mark type="inaudible" /> 365 compared to 320 in third quarter and 300 in Q2. NPL in BRD increased to 10.5% at the end of the fourth quarter that were at 9.1% at the end of the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Regarding Geniki, the cost of risk stand at 900 bps in the fourth quarter. It was at 840 in the third quarter and NPLs increased from 25.9% at end of September to 27.6%, to 27.9% at end of the third quarter to 27.6% end of the fourth quarter. The coverage for Geniki was 63% as of end of Q4.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> it is top of my mind, as have a lot of corporates within that, we think that it's at 34% and altogether if you look at retail outside France, we have a coverage of 80%, with NPLs which are altogether for international network at 8.6%. <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good evening. Personal question actually to Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric because Bob Diamond said basically the right Basel III Core tier 1 ratio for a bank is 9%, <mark type="inaudible" /> said yesterday it's 7%, Peter <mark type="inaudible" /> to the despair of everybody said God knows how much last week. What is Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric, the <mark type="inaudible" /> view about what the right level of capital, regardless of your target I mean in total?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> there is no right answer or that is related I mean to a certain extent the answer is that we think for our business model, our target is the right answer, after that depending on the model of everyone. Again, what I would just like to say the residence of our bank in my view is made of &#x2013; the absolute financial structure at some point, question of capital, but also the capacity to generate revenues.</p>
          <p>And now we feel that we forget this capacity of generating revenues, which helps to absorb also losses as we see in this crisis. With Basel III, fundamentally between the &#x2013; before the crisis in mid-June 2007, and let's say 2013, we have more than doubled our capital for the same amount of risk and we have a balance sheet, which is fundamentally cleaner. I think it's already a lot which is being requested. And after that, I would like just to point out that on the debate, which is related to a certain extent also on profitability. I don't see why fundamentally in what circumstances the banking industry would and could in the long-term deliver return on capital which should be lower than any other industry or corporate.</p>
          <p>I looked at the CAC 40 just from my own interest and fundamentally, it can vary depending on the sector and depending on the year, but if you look, not at margins, again we cannot effectively the capital. It's again, between 10% and 20% on an average it's roughly 15% which I think the normal return, any shareholder, equity holder expects. And I don't see why the banking system should be fundamentally different.</p>
          <p>So, you can put &#x2013; again more capital, but then what are the consequences in terms of the price of the service? And, really, I think that the whole thing should be considered globally. Again you need the car to be able to move forward and when I say the car, the banking industry to finance the economy, clearly with a stronger resilience than in the past, we all accept that. It is in place with Basel III. I don't see the reason with a resilient business model to increase the capital. Clearly, and, we would stick to that, and wait for the final decisions of &#x2013; over this topic. But we're just saying be careful, because I don't see a sustainable system with a single digit ROE, I don't see a sustainable system working.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon. I have three quick questions, please. The first one would be on funding, was looking at your program for &#x2013; the realized for 2010, looks like covered bond is about 19% of the total? Just wondering, how you saw that proportion going forward? My sense is, maybe wrongly so by the way. But that must have quite a lot of free collateral there. Some other countries employ that type of funding a lot more. It seems to me that to spread between that and long-term unsecured is quite significant. So just, could you elaborate a bit on that?</p>
          <p>So my second is on Basel, on capital in general. If you &#x2013; would you say that, banks with lower risk rate to have higher core capital ratios for example you should look at the Swiss and the Nordic they have very low risk rate and they keep very high ratios in the sense so i.e. do you take off leverage? And the third question, you were talking about your portfolio of brands and some reshuffle there and I was thinking are those other brands going to disappear? When you are talking about your portfolio reshuffle, the update or change in outlook there on the outlook for disposals or things like that. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The reshuffle of brand was more communication issue than the strategic one. I mean on the capital you are certainly right, anyway the discussion on just the ratio should be considered more globally. It's applied to what and the capital is the result of a ratio applied to risk-weighted assets and I agree with you, depending also on the way they are calculated at the end of the day. The whole thing should be considered, and I still believe that applying ratios on certain model, which are not lending model, there's also a difference, I mean the same figure might not make sense for very different models with more lending.</p>
          <p>Regarding the evolution of the portfolio, there is no change of mind. We said that we would again maintain the capital in absolute term allocated to Global Investment Management and Financial Services. It is actually the case. We are in no hurry, and we will stick to what we said. I will not comment, as I've said previously because the best way to destabilize a business and make more room for competitors is to comment ahead of what we're thinking about, but clearly we're working, particularly if you look at, as I said previously, consumer credit, I think it's one of the business which is fundamentally going forward under pressure.</p>
          <p>For different reasons, social acceptance, regulation in certain country, there is a funding then requirement, capital requirement and probably less synergy in certain countries so, we will look at that. We are like also, did we mention we can focus the business model without disposing of certain businesses, focusing for example, on the cap finance and reducing considerably the revolving credit. There is more risk and probably less acceptance today in Europe. So, again we will remain agile and stick to this flexible policy. Regarding covered bond?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jean-Francois, regarding covered bonds it's true that we are only 19% of covered bond usage in 2010 issues then it is <mark type="inaudible" /> and the one which is the to your right which is the marketplace the <mark type="inaudible" /> French banks and the rest is done through our <mark type="inaudible" />. It's true that as from this year we will be able to issue soon what is called obligations <mark type="inaudible" /> which is a new vehicle that will allow to us to mobilize our mortgages, which currently run and use, let's say apart from the <mark type="inaudible" /> soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; fonci&#xE8;re which was entirely a local lending to local authorities, but definitely we have now important task on the balance sheet that we will be able to be used through this new vehicle.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, I'd say, we need to keep in mind that in terms of structure and balance of our I'll say issuance let's say we need to get a good balance between <mark type="inaudible" />, that definitely we are not a big user, French banks in general compared to some Nordic banks or some Southern European banks. But nevertheless <mark type="inaudible" /> is still important because <mark type="inaudible" /> you put your name and you take the real appetite from the market and I remind you that also we have these extremely efficient and well diversified source of funding, which is coming from the structured product placements, which are done by our CIB business, and you've seeing that it did represent more than a third of our total issuance last year.</p>
          <p>Covered also is important in terms of being able to raise long-term funding, because also you have on the vehicle which are issuing asset-liability management constraints and lending <mark type="inaudible" /> utilities and mortgages, of course, long-term lending, and thus it usually, it's a way for us to take more than five, seven, 10, or 12 years maturity. For example, we did issue a late Jan, a 12-years covered bonds using the lending to <mark type="inaudible" /> and export finance underlying. Next question, we will go like this, like, you know order.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Rob Down from HSBC. I had two areas of questions. The first is on the cost in CIBM. I was quite surprised by the Q4 uplift. And I was just wondering if you give us just a feel of how much of that was driven by investment or whether it's something going on that? Just more generally on cost, I think you, you're talking about for 2011, improving operating efficiency within the group, which I be taking in for the name and term that we call measure will come down.</p>
          <p>So that will supply to the CIBM business, specifically. And then secondary is on the legacy assets. I was listening to this conference call this morning, but some of it may have gotten &#x2013; get lost in translation. So, I think the suggestion on that was might selling some of those assets this year may be like in small gains and that maybe there is some scope for resecuritization within the obvious <mark type="inaudible" /> book. I was just wondering if you could give us a bit more color on that and perhaps I could invite you to what's the range of potential loss for this year on the legacy asset book, if any.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and just take care we will be commenting on the <mark type="inaudible" /> first on the look you just have the fourth quarter you need to understand the comparisons of last year. Last year we had the bonus we had to &#x2013; the we were a bit strong and the reduction of the bonus. This year we're able to us something more stable and at the same time we have the three different amortization rhythm so it's is one of the explanation and it's the key event, we had the recruitments some the recruitment we're made in the set in the fourth quarter, next time we also to increase fundamentally we have cost and commercial which below 60 we'll keep discuss income below 16.</p>
          <p>But major gain in terms of <mark type="inaudible" /> is going to be beyond this year but investment as I said again 2011, 2012 on the one hand that we invest, on the other we already capture some gains we made &#x20AC;120 million productivity gains this year in 2010 despite the investments but there'll be no, it should be pretty natural. Going beyond 2012 and 2013, we expect that this to be a progressive even more improvement, but on the legacy assets, so what I've said is one in which we do that was <mark type="inaudible" />  safety unless to a little bit was on twice and so first to come back on what we sold in 2010.</p>
          <p>So we sold &#x20AC;5.6 billion, predominantly a U.S. asset and what I said is that we're also a revenue line before this legacy assets was pretty pleased for that if we active in &#x20AC;1 million, it's been better trying carry plus sales and sales led to a positive revenues shrink that also the <mark type="inaudible" /> overall appropriate on this &#x2013; on this legacy asset, which is also confirm and say by here, what's revenue dependency update but we've produced on the BlackRock credit evaluation. So this is not a trading in mark-to-market, this is a credit evaluation, which confirmed that all assets that CDO for RMBS. The credit value is above &#x2013; is above the year book value that we do have both in terms of long-term receivable and available system.</p>
          <p>And on the CDO for RMBS that is the decrease in the gap between the book value, the credit value and the credit valuation of BlackRock, corresponding timing to the &#x20AC;400 million that we take as side in some cost of risk during the year. There is no &#x2013; no change in the &#x2013; assessments of the interest in value of these assets compared to last June.</p>
          <p>When we look at 2011, what we have said that on certain of these assets, especially on the CMBS and CLOs, like &#x2013; let's say it will kind of capital market practice to recognize that these assets are many groups, when you are in the high trenches, so whether with AAA <mark type="inaudible" /> for with attachment point at 30%. People know that on the factor, in that case I would converge to par and thus the arbitrage that we need to consider is to sell with a gain. But <mark type="inaudible" /> part of that carries to the market or to carry this asset little bit more and then to sell within 6, 12, 18 months to assess benefit from the higher capturing, that's higher capture of this the revenues link to this of the year linked to this assets in our P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>But nevertheless, we will continue to remain enrolling some of deleverage of this portfolio. And again, the resituation, it's not resituation that we continues more. These resituation let's say, I can say, which conducts a, I'll touch a little bit of this subject during the third quarter results. In certain structure like CDOs, currently, it's very penalizing from a regulating point of view, we've seen that the output at zero from a credential point of view in Basel III. So these regard of what your acquisition for these assets has taking any change and they are fully rated, the re put is zero from the regulatory standpoint.</p>
          <p>And in certain cases, we added to the majority of the structure and so we can go to the trustee and ask for the unwinding of the structure, then there is an option on generating assets. We the natural acquirer of all these assets. And then we go to a resecuritization of a CDO, which is a resecuritization of a securitization, you come back and you come down to the underlying ABS, which on average a little bit better quality.</p>
          <p>On average a little bit better rated so you have been gaining kind of capital consumption and also these assets are usually more liquid from the market standpoint and those you could &#x2013; you could accelerate <mark type="inaudible" />. So we already launched the first, I would say, de-securitization in the fourth quarter and we will continue to carry on developing to optimize the capital position lean to this fully weighted assets.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our first question is by Mr. Kinner Lakhani from Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi good afternoon. So, just following on from this deleveraging topic actually, I just wanted to clarify how much mitigation, in basis points that you had assumed any above of free guidance? How much you could get if say you did not own this portfolio on let's say at the end of 2013 actually? And second question, was just on Greece, I just heard on the news why is that you know you may have guided that the provision charge in 2011, might be equivalent to that in 2010.</p>
          <p>The reserve on the Greece land portfolio which looks like 17% to me, seems pretty high and your guidance suggest this goes up to 22%. So a little bit surprised by that maybe you can comment on the quality of your back book for that? Fairly, just a small clarification in terms of numbers actually; on the private bank, I just wanted to check if there were any further impairments in the fourth quarter around some of the equity investments that you might have seen in previous quarters and also what's the benefit from secondhand call market recoveries have been in 2010, in your SFS business, just to help model better for next year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I can take &#x2013; maybe I can take on the private banking side, there was no additional impairment, it was a compliment to the provisioning related to a provision we made in the first quarter for an operational risk in Asia. Regarding Greece, again we have in mind more or less a stability of the customers in a country which is still suffering and with a local legislation which protects the borrowers. I have in mind in particular for example that there was a new legislation which was forbidding the banks to capture the housing for mortgage below &#x20AC;200,000 which was supposed to end at the end of December and which was renewed till June end of June 2011. So as you can see, this kind of a legislation &#x2013; of course at sometimes it's difficult to recover your money, we've checked the valuation of the underlying assets that guaranteed, but nevertheless, at this stage it may be difficult to see the assets and sell, so that's why we have more or less a stable cost of risk in minds or high cost of risk with more or less stable compared with 2010, that's on the legacy assets, it seems that there will be the weight in terms of capital and litigation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the in the 40 bps, let's say we did not disclose what will be or what was the feel between, let's say, between components and litigation &#x2013; see the litigation and also our market risk with better collateralization, and lastly, eventual asset arbitrage, nevertheless what I can tell you is that in the slide that you had at the time of the third quarter results, you were able to see that the respected effective dividends of these legacy effects was in the region of &#x20AC;50 billion dividends.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we took about &#x20AC;4 billion <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which means that, yeah, I think this is &#x2013; this is that we have a lot of margins of maneuver the amortization of this portfolio. And the 40 basis points, we've taken into calculation is a very small part of that. So that's clearly gave us comfort into those capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's see on the second-hand car markets, so <mark type="inaudible" /> that's how the pre-year results, we've said that this item had an impact of a little bit more than &#x20AC;200 million into 2009, it was a little bit below to &#x20AC;30 million. This year it was minus &#x20AC;14, but this year also part of the leverage that we have identified a year ago and that was confirmed, because the improvement was even better than expected, and in the fourth quarter that's flat, but we're sure that the situation has almost come to a kind of a normal level in the fourth quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Virginia Martin from Evolution. Just on the revenues from the global markets, because I remember in 2009 you gave a split in equities of the revenues coming from derivates and the revenues coming from everything else let's say. So I wonder if you could give us some information and also and the revenues coming from fixed income, or if you could give a split of what is coming from rates, what is coming from commodities? Then in Russia, I was wondering if you have any intention of buying the 25% of Rosbank you don't yet own?</p>
          <p>And also coming back to the mitigation targets, I was actually wondering because you have a &#x20AC;58 billion of securitization and if for whatever reason you are required to hold more capital than the regulatory minimum, 7% because of safety or because of whatever reason, how much of those securitizations could you realistically sell from now to 2012? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will take the Russian thing and you will comment on the split. I just would like to sound CIB, I am really happy with the performance in 2010, the resilience of the revenue generation. If you look at each quarter except the second quarter we made very particular environment where we decided to hedge the position because we &#x2013; on the equity <mark type="inaudible" />, it was very difficult to know where the markets would go, <mark type="inaudible" /> it was not very far from the end of the world at least you could <mark type="inaudible" />, but the rest was remarkably resilient and remarkably balanced with a low level of risk. And really, that gives me a lot of comfort if you wish going forward. Regarding Russia, we don't have the intention to buy the minority stake, the idea is to keep partners, minority states or whatever that there is no priority which is given to this acquisitions of minority. Would you like to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah regarding the &#x2013; your two questions, first on the split of the CIB revenues, <mark type="inaudible" /> you referred to the Investor Day where we split let's say global markets between float-trading equity, float-trading fixed-income and in between structured products so I'd say currently you have just the structure product which is partly in equities and partly in fixed income. Having <mark type="inaudible" /> compared to the &#x20AC;1.5 billion that we generated in the normalized environment last year, we've seen a slight increase in 2010.</p>
          <p>I would remain qualitative because they're kind of secret sauce, and we have been able and this is something important to re-balance the share are coming from the fixed income, which was one of our strategic aim so to cross-sell and to fertilize the fixed income business with de novo equity derivatives. So a slight increase altogether of structure products, with the shift into favor of the fixed income business compared to last year. So something like almost 60%/40%, so 60% equity, 40% fixed income.</p>
          <p>Your last point was on the securitization, so sell the legacy assets what we could reasonably envisage as sale. Let's say we put that in the 40 bps, so it's seen that we are extremely conservative, we will see whether we will do better, but usually we tend to be on the safe side. Secondly, you say if we have to put 7% capital in front of that. That's the de facto as they are in the risk-weighted assets. In our capital planning, we are putting 8% or 8.5% of capital and follow that because...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the question was if we had to be even higher if you will than 7.5% with the fees, could we release more on that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we need to test this capacity to de-securitize, I would say, so far that is going smoothly and as expected. If we have the capacity to continue carry on that, we could eventually do a little bit better, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the revenues within the equities actually, I was wondering, because in 2009, you gave of course the split and it came out that 90% of your revenues in equities were coming from equity derivatives and the rest will be cash or &#x2013; so I wonder whether that is still the case? Whether equity derivatives have such a big weight in the equities business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is no structural shift and bear in mind, for us on the equity side which everything which was included into equity capital markets is more in the financing and advisory parts so let's say de facto, yes, equity derivatives continue to be the biggest contributor to the equity division.</p>

          <p>Also in the fixed income revenues, but I was actually wondering, if you could give, just within the fixed income line, a split of rates &#x2013; and how much is coming from rates and how much will be coming from commodities? I don't think you have ever given that split before?</p>

      <speaker type="a">

          <p>Right, yeah, and then <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just wondering if we could come back to the funding and tied into the regulatory you spoke very eloquently about Basel III, but we also have on the funding side this sort of proposal for bail-ins and I was wondering if you could comment on that? I mean, and obviously that has an impact -the uncertainty has an impact on everyone's funding costs, and you talked a little bit about a 15% ROE across the <mark type="inaudible" /> and what not, but if we assume that funding costs are going to be elevated because of the uncertainty, it's logical to assume that you'd be passing that on in the asset side of the balance sheet and that certainly has happened since the crisis started, but not so much recently. I was wondering if you can talk about that development a little bit.</p>
          <p>And then one last question if I might ,and very simplistically, you talk about 2011 setting the stage, I think for the delivery in 2012, that's very eloquent. On a sort of quantitative guide, if we did $4 billion in 2010, we're doing $6 billion in 2012. Can I just say is the stage set if you do $5 billion or do you have to be a little bit better than that or maybe you could help me a little bit there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I will not, but again to come to your first point I think to your first question, we tend to believe that, we should be able to find a system where the senior debt is protected except if there is a bankruptcy of the bank. But in the case, as you know, the pre-bankruptcy situation, you know, when the regulator would like then to intervene; we think in order for the system to work efficiently, we think we should have the senior debt protected. Regarding the issue of increase of pricing, I agree with you, at this stage, there has been some improvement but it's very marginal.</p>
          <p>And I still do not think that the banks have fully drawn the lessons of the changes. And again, when I look and it depends also on the return on equity that you have in mind. It goes back to this question. Will your shareholders accept, depending on the business model, a return on the equity which would have to absorb on one hand additional capital progressively in the next three years and on top of that potentially additional or increased cost of funding, depending on how it goes and say I'm happy with that? Personally, I have my doubts.</p>
          <p>But it might take some time, because bankers from that perspective are not necessarily that disciplined. You need to have internally the systems and discipline to charge the cost of funding, to charge the cost of capital and it's a question of to what extent you anticipate the changes, when do you start, knowing that also I think it's fair to try to do that progressively because again at the end of the day who will be impacted? It is the clients, so it'll be probably a progressive trend on that and no one is hurrying that much at this stage.</p>
          <p>So I think it will be a progressive shift but I do not see how it could work, without this re-pricing if there is again more capital and on top of that a relatively significant increase of the price of corporate funding in the mid-term. I don't see the profitability, the balance in terms of profitability to be acceptable for shareholders. Maybe I'm wrong. I still feel the market is &#x2013; the shareholders themselves trying to think about that. But personally, I think it will not be acceptable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just a follow-up, your solution on the senior debt, I think we'd probably <mark type="inaudible" /> in this room, but do you have any sense of where the regulators are in terms of, you know?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the debate is a bit confused to be frank and there is a dialogue which is taking place, but I would not be able to tell you where really the regulator, I don't think they have really made their mind and this discussion is pretty complex, I must say it's pretty complex, but I would say again there could be a phase before the major catastrophe where again they &#x2013; again it might be a resolution element or cocos or whatever to protect the senior debt and then of course if you go to into bankruptcy, it could be probably acceptable for everyone to consider senior debt to be impacted, the whole purpose would be precisely to avoid bankruptcy with this resolution mechanism.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think that if you look at the bankruptcy that took place in the crisis, if you pile up the amount of losses that took place in these companies, these banks, compared to the side of their equity plus sub debt in almost all cases, equity plus sub debt was sufficient to absorb the losses relating the bankruptcy. So having in mind that Basel III will increase the amount of capital compared to pre-crisis levels, that potentially we would have this additional cocos, in a way or another.</p>
          <p>We think that the senior debt will be relatively well protected, even in deep stress. And in that case, I would say to put <mark type="inaudible" /> in the senior debts into what you get <mark type="inaudible" /> suspended &#x2013; for the thing that you will have, so importantly increase the first two layers to protect against before the point of non-viability of a bank. But I say to put that in a contract is just a way to frighten I would say senior investors, while the probability for them to be called in before the non-viability is extremely remote. Omar?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Omar Fall from UBS. Just three questions. I think you illustrated it on slide 8, just looking at the notional balance sheet and forgetting about regulatory capital for a moment, but you've clearly done a lot in terms of reducing the short-term part of your balance sheet. how comfortable are you with the shape of your balance sheet currently? Is there more to come in terms of perhaps cutting on the repo side or trading assets? That's number one.</p>
          <p>A second question would be on French Retail, clearly there'll be an impact from the <mark type="inaudible" /> however, if you look at both sides of the balance sheet there is very healthy volume growth particularly in sight deposits which are obviously more profitable for you. So and actually commissions this year are somewhat underearning given that market driven commissions are quite low. So I'm still quite surprised by how cautious you are in terms of your revenue growth expectation, so is there something else like your hedging policy on deposits that's delaying the impact of the low rates or something like that? I'd be interested in some color there.</p>
          <p>And then lastly, there's a big debate going on in the market over whether fixed-income ROEs can ever be above cost of capital ROEs. Now, there isn't that debate going on in equity derivatives. So, can you give us an idea of what you think the steady state ROE is for your equity derivatives business, which is something you didn't touch on at the Investor Day? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will take the first two and Didier can complete. And indeed, my comments comments on the balance sheet. On the French Retail, again keep in mind, I have a figure for the total impact of the <mark type="inaudible" />, plus the decrease of the commission, minus &#x20AC;185 million for the full year. Secondly on the commission, we have also factored the impact of all the new regulation on the payment side, the <mark type="inaudible" /> and things like that.</p>
          <p>So, if you take that into account and you know we've said, an increase of the revenues between plus 1% and plus 2% that is without factoring the impact, the positive impact of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; Marseillaise de Cr&#xE9;dit, which has just been consolidated for one quarter in 2010 and which will be consolidated for fourth quarter. It is something which I think is pretty reasonable in an economy which will grow, in our view, by 1.5%. We have also a slightly lower figure than the French government, and it's not related to hedging, we have not changed our hedging policy but it's again based on the <mark type="inaudible" /> 1.85%, it's around 2% total growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, 1.85%, a bit more than 2% of revenues. SNC will be roughly 150, additional I'd say 200 a year so will be 150 next year, so it's a &#x2013; it will mitigate but it's always like for like <mark type="inaudible" /> for us will be between 1% to 2% and as Jean-Francois was mentioning that this morning, also on the <mark type="inaudible" /> the major reason of the increase at this stage is more coming from inflation than from short-term interest rates, so the thing also, we have another capacity to recoup that through a re-pricing of the short-term part on the balance sheet so that's also the point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding your question on return on equity, first of all I must say, I'm always doubtful that an industry can in the long-term, like it will exist, but have again an activity with the return on equity below the cost of capital at some point again shareholders should react, I am always pleasant to see an acceptance to have an equity below cost of capital. On the equity varieties, what I would like to say, again we have a very wide range of activity then I think overall that they should remain profitable even if for some of the activity that will be impact of Basel 2.5 et cetera.</p>
          <p>Again we have activities which are as diversified as the <mark type="inaudible" /> business and the benefit of the sale of structured products through retail activities that remains something which we'd carry on developing, I am not sure that the risk aversion will disappear that much in the coming quarters, again I still have in mind the environment which might remain volatile. We have activities which are flow business, which remains reasonably profitable. We have tailor-made solutions and again I'm very happy with the organization of our capital market activities having put &#x2013; we have put together all the engineering capacities that cover the full categories of assets. That's in my view very efficient because we can provide to our clients the <mark type="inaudible" /> solution and you know it's bit like Herm&#xE9;s. Herm&#xE9;s can price reasonably its product because it's a high quality product. Then what else in terms of activities...</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. So I mean overall I remain positive on the return on equity we should get from equity activity which overall should be less impacted by all the regulation. A lot of the business is in MTM, not OTC. A lot is already on this listed activities. I remain positive regarding these activity.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>I know that you are making 34% ROEs when <mark type="inaudible" /> goes down there is obviously much higher than what everybody is talking about in fixed income for example.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, compared to the pure commodity business I would say yes and of course now you need to factor the increase of this core Tier 1 ratio plus the impact of Basel 2.5 compared with <mark type="inaudible" />. But nevertheless, I think it's going to remain profitable. A word on the balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A word on the balance sheet regarding the retail business where it's something that has led to slightly increased compared to 2007 but we know that we are extremely nimble let's say on this activity &#x2013; with business if there is a <mark type="inaudible" /> asset and liability and second, you can react relatively quickly on this activity. Interbank deposits, you can see that we have reduced a bit our reliance on that because of the effort that we make to increase the long-term part of the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>And also we have reduced the short term issues. I would say going forward what will be more the difference is that the red part is likely to continue to grow, while the grey parts, without being further reduced in relative <mark type="inaudible" /> we're situating, diminishing because of the constrain that we put on the activities not to increase this part of the balance sheet. Have in mind also that, we think this grey, which seems to be a roughly pari passu, we have also taken measures to extend let's say the length of the short-term part of the balance sheet to be more at FCR compliance <mark type="inaudible" /> et cetera, which is more stable?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Two very quick questions please, both of them on your 2012 targets. The first one is in international retail, you targeted a net profit of &#x20AC;900 million to &#x20AC;1.1 billion. Do you still feel comfortable with that range? Are you looking for example countries like Russia to outperform and make up for potential weakness in countries like Egypt and Greece?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on the CNIB division targets. I think you outlined the cost of risk of 55 to 65 basis points in that division, and with the extra legacy assets, you're pretty close to zero. Do you think you'll get anywhere near that? In other words, do you expect in either the regular business or the legacy asset losses to potentially rise again or is that number looking highly conservative? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding the retail activities, we are not changing &#x2013; we will have to wait and see the evolution of the different countries, so, no change of the views. Regarding I must say the cost of risk of CNIB we are in a fascinating period, where effectively in practice, there is not a single file of a large corporate that we have to look at. The situation of the large corporate is obviously good, liquidity is there and even if you look at the evolution of what we call the watch list and &#x2013; it's also going in the right direction. So I mean we've taken this figure as a kind of normative assumption but it's tough to say...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, regarding the 55 to 65 it is thought that &#x2013; let's says to calibrate this over the cycle, we have taken a sale on one year expected loss and on average looking at the rating of the portfolio, looking at the historical let's say a loss of that 15 it's something in that range but definitely as Philippe was mentioning into '10 and so far into '11 I'd say there is no signs of any deterioration on that portfolio which continue to be an extremely safe.</p>
          <p>And regarding your first question that's &#x2013; well in Greece we knew when we presented investor day that it will continue to be a challenging environment into '11 and into '12 so this was part of discontinuing the range that we provided to the market. And in Egypt don't over react it did, as I said during my presentation, was &#x2013; is very well reserved, it's a little bit more than <mark type="inaudible" /> 94% coverage and I would say Egypt also in the past hasn't really seen that trouble that led to a temporary <mark type="inaudible" /> a reduction <mark type="inaudible" /> and as recovered. And we're there for a long period of time and we <mark type="inaudible" /> react to that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'm Jeremy Sigee, Barclays Capital. I just want to back on Robin's questing on the costs spike in CIB. In your slides, you talked about the &#x20AC;600 million investment program over the three years, how much of that &#x20AC;600 million came in, in Q4? And related question is, is Q4 a new run rate of cost in CIB or should we view it as truing up for the year? Is it a new quarterly run rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not a quarterly run rate and again we will have in mind that cost income bill of 64 for 2011 for CIB in terms of the amount of the investments, I don't know if we have the figure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No but as said the investments let's say was &#x2013; I would say its almost 200 a year, but let's say it will be a little bit &#x2013; it was a little bit <mark type="inaudible" /> it's likely to be a little above 200 next year. And that around 200 or slightly below in 2012, so that was a kind of ramping up phase. Nevertheless I'd say there is always a slight seasonality in our costs in Q4, and you should not let say multiply that by 4 to have the run rate of the 2011 figure. As we said, let's say we are confident that in 2011 let's say, I think you might be talking what we said for 2012. We will have to see an increase of the revenues in the CIB, while maintaining the cost income ratio in the below 60% area.</p>
