          <p>Good morning. My name is Deshanta and I will be your conference Operator today.  At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator instructions.] Mr. Stavros, you may begin your conference.</p>

          <p>Thank you DeShanta, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to Occidental's Third Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us on the call from Los Angeles are Dr. Ray Irani, Oxy's Chairman and CEO, and Steve Chazen, our President and CFO. In just a moment, I will be passing the call over to Steve, who will spend some time discussing our balance sheet and cash flows, and also review our third quarter and nine months financial results.</p>
          <p>Our third quarter earnings press release, investor relations supplemental schedules, and the conference call presentation slides which refer to Steve's remarks, can be downloaded off of our website at www.oxy.com.  I'll now turn the call over to Steve Chazen. Steve, please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Chris. We will discuss earnings in details in a few minutes. However, we would like to start with cash flows and our balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for the nine months of 2008 was $8.1 billion. We used 3.2 billion of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures, 3.3 billion for acquisitions and $680 million to pay dividends.  We also spent $1.5 billion to repurchase 19.4 million common shares.  These and other net cash outflows decreased our $2 billion cash balance at the end of last year by 550 million to 1.45 billion at September 30.  That was 1.8 billion at the end of September, which was unchanged from December 31 2007.</p>
          <p>Our debt-to-capitalization ratio is 6%. Next year we have maturities totaling $714 million. After that, we have maturities of 239 million in 2010 and 368 million in 2012. We ended the quarter with 1.45 billion of cash on the balance sheet. W recently borrowed another $1 billion, which could be used to cover debt maturities. And we will pay $1.25 billion for the Plains transaction. We have available unused lines of committed bank credit of $1.5 billion. A pro forma debt-to-total capitalization with the recent debt issue was 9%, or about $0.98 per BOE of proved reserves.</p>
          <p>Occidental generates significant cash flows over a wide range of prices. As noted in the cash flow available for capital and other uses slide included in the Investor Relations package. For example, in 2005, when the WTI price were [sic] (was) $57 a barrel, and production from continuing operations was 466,000 BOE a day, we had free cash flow of $2 billion after spending 2.3 billion for capital expenditures and $500 million for dividends. Cash flow from continuing operations is after interest and income taxes. Continuing operations excludes Russia, Horn Mountain, Equador, and Pakistan. If you adjust for the 2005 dividends of 483 million and 131 million net interest expense and current 2008 annualized amounts of 912 million for dividends and interest expense, we would have cash flow available for capital expending in excess of $3.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Additionally, production has increased to 594,000 BOE per day in 2008 compared to 466,000 BOE a day for 2005. This is after removing Horn Mountain, Equador, Russia and Pakistan from the 2005 numbers. The increase in production is primarily from Dolphin, Argentina, and domestic additions. These new programs on average generate more cash flow than the programs they replace. The difference between the first nine months run rate of 594,000 BOE a day and 466,000 BOE a day of 2005 is about 45 million BOE per year. Using the production outlook we gave you for next year in the last quarter's report of about 650,000 BOE a day, the difference is about 200,000 BOE a day or about 70 million barrels per year. Therefore, we would have well over 3.9 billion in cash available for capital expenditures in the 2005 $57 per barrel WTI price.</p>
          <p>Let me now begin discussion of third quarter's results. Net income for the quarter was 2.3 billion or $2.78 per diluted share compared to 1.3 billion or $1.58 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2007 when prices were $75 per barrel.</p>
          <p>Here's the segment breakdown for the quarter. Oil and gas third quarter segment earnings were 3.618 billion compared to 1.955 billion for the third quarter of 2007. Oil and gas core results for third quarter of 2007 were 1.914 billion after excluding gains from the sale of oil and gas interests in exploration properties. The following accounted for the increase in oil and gas earnings between these quarters. Higher worldwide oil and gas realizations resulted in an increase of 1.8 billion of earnings over the comparable period last year. Occidental's average realized crude oil price in 2008 third quarter was $104.15 per barrel, an increase of 54% for the comparable period last year. Oxy's domestic average realized gas price for the quarter was $9.35 per MCF compared to 5.90 for the third quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Worldwide oil and gas production in the third quarter of 2008 averaged 588,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 3% compared with the 570,000 BOE a day production in the third quarter of last year. The bulk of the production improvement was a result of 31,000 BOE per day of higher production from the Dolphin project, which began production last year at this time. Partially offsetting these increases were 5,000 BOE per day of lower volumes attributable to Hurricane Ike, resulted from pipeline curtailments due to the third party NGL fractionators along the Gulf Coast being shut in, and 13,000 BOE a day in lower volumes from our Libya operations due to the new contract which I discussed in last quarter's conference call.</p>
          <p>Exploration expense was $61 million in the quarter, below our guidance of 90 million to 110 million. Oil and gas cash production costs for the nine months of 2008 were $14.80 a barrel compared to last year's costs of $12.33 a barrel. Approximately 38% of the increase related to increased energy costs. The increase reflected higher production taxes and ad valorem tax, workovers, and field operating costs.</p>
          <p>Chemical segment earnings for the third quarter of 2008 were $219 million, which was higher than our guidance of 135 to $150 million. The higher earnings were attributable primarily to higher caustic soda prices. Chemicals earned $212 million in last year's third quarter.</p>
          <p>Midstream earnings for third quarter of 2008 were 66 million, a decrease of $20 million from last year's results. The decline in earnings was due to lower crude oil marketing margins partially offset by higher pipeline income from Dolphin, higher NGL margins in the gas processing business, and improved margins on the power generation side. The worldwide effective tax rate was 40% for the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn briefly to our performance for the first nine months. Net income was 6.414 billion or $7.79 per diluted share for the first nine months of 2008, compared to 3.948 billion or $4.69 per diluted share for the same period last year. The nine months 2008 reported net income was another record and was 62% higher than the first nine months of 2007 net income. Income for the first nine months of 2007 included a $1 billion benefit, net of tax, the item is noted on the schedule attached.</p>
          <p>Capital spending was 1.2 billion for the quarter and 3.2 billion for the first nine months. We expect our total capital spending for the year to be about 4.5 to $4.7 billion. Our preliminary estimate is that next year's capital spending will be no greater than this years.</p>
          <p>The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the nine months were 820.1 million, and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 823.8 million. At September 30, there were 810.1 million basic shares outstanding, and the diluted share amount was approximately 813.8 million.</p>
          <p>Oxy's 2008 annualized return on equity was 34% with annualized return on capital employed of 32%.</p>
          <p>As we look ahead, in the current quarter, we expect oil and gas production to be in the range of  610 to 625,000 BOE a day during the fourth quarter at approximately current oil prices. We expect fourth quarter production increases in the Middle East and North Africa, reflecting lower product prices on our production sharing contract, higher domestic production and production increases from Argentina.</p>
          <p>With regard to prices, a $40 per barrel decrease in WTI prices from the third quarter would reduce oil and gas fourth quarter earnings before income taxes by about $1.5 billion. Further changes of $5 per barrel in oil prices will impact oil and gas quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $190 million.</p>
          <p>A $3 per million BTU decline in domestic gas prices from the third quarter would decrease oil and gas quarterly earnings before income taxes by $140 million. Additionally, we expect exploration expense to be about 150 million for seismic and drilling for our exploration programs. We expect chemical segment earnings for the fourth quarter to be about $150 million. High caustic soda prices are expected to continue through the period, offset by weakness to construction and housing markets impacting domestic demand. Despite the difficult economic conditions, a seasonally weak fourth quarter, and concerns over export opportunities over the balance of the year, we believe this approximate earnings is likely.</p>
          <p>We expect our combined worldwide tax rate for the fourth quarter to be about 44%. We expect the rate to increase due to proportionally higher foreign source income and the higher anticipated  currently non-deductible foreign exploration. Our third quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in the Investor Relations supplement. Copies of the press release announcing our results and the schedules are available on our website or through the Edgar system.  We're now ready to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, if I can ask about the CapEx a little further, you mentioned that in '09 you don't expect it to be any greater than '08. I'm really trying to get a sense as to what the mix could look like though. I know you have good bit of discretionary spend in there, particularly with respect to workovers. And that workover was a big portion of your volume guidance last quarter for '09 and 2010? Can you talk about how that might change, and what impact that might have on volumes next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, most of the workover was sort of late this year in the back half of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so the &#x2013; I don't you will see much change in 2009 from this change.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From workovers that may have worked at $90 obviously have been stopped. And because some of it was intended to just generate a quick hit. So at this point, we probably wouldn't fool with the guidance for next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Either on CapEx or volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the volumes.</p>

          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>CapEx, we are still working on the CapEx. We expect that the costs will decline this year, this coming year, as demand for oil field services declines, certainly in the United States. So it's pretty hard for us to guess what the impact will be. But right now, we are working on a program that is somewhat less than the current run rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We would be more specific if we knew, you understand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, understood, understood. Well, that's good color. On the billion dollar debt issuance, that price around 7%, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>7%, right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I think about priorities for use of cash, you mentioned the 714 due in '09. 7% is not bad, particularly in this market. I mean what &#x2013; how would you think about sort of reloading again to take out the 714 in order to keep powder dry for acquisitions or other opportunities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know. I just don't know. It just depends on where we are then. So I just really don't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If a change &#x2013; right now, there is, I'm told, BBB issuers. We're a middle A issuer. But at BBB issuers, there is about $100 billion of them waiting in the queue for rates into the single digits I guess. So, I think it's going to be a very difficult year next year for people to refinance. And so we will see more likely than not, I wouldn't bet my life on it, but more likely than not, we'll have enough free cash flow that we won't need to worry about the 714 of maturities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it certainly looks that way now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then lastly for me, on Argentina, up volumes a little bit in 4Q. So no real impact yet of what's going on down there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; if you look at the map, it's a long way between Buenos Aires and Antarctica. And so the noise really doesn't have any effect. We continue to be optimistic about improving results in Argentina.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just going back to CapEx, and thinking about how do overlay your comments on '09 CapEx with your high graded assets that generate more cash flow per barrel production today than similar assets generated in '05. When we think about that cash flow and compare it to capital spending from '05 to '06 when oil averaged roughly $60 a barrel. If oil prices averaged $60 a barrel in'09, should we infer that Oxy would spend somewhere between 2.25 and 3 billion in capital? Or how high could that number go up because of your...</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you should expect that we'll spend about the same next year that we spent this year, which is 4.5 or so. So, what we just show you here on this table of what we actually spent that year. But we've got a significantly bigger company...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And some commitments to stuff. So we'll probably spend closer to the 4, 4.5 area. But at that price, there is still a lot of room I think.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you're stuck with the current environment, which is &#x2013; I don't know that means exactly, but let's say if it were to freeze for a nanosecond before it changed. Your gas drilling at $6 an MCF is probably something we would defer. Our leases are long life, so we're not really doing anything to our inventory. We're just slowing that up a little bit some workovers or re-completions that might have worked in an 80 or $90 environment, you'd probably slow that up. We expect also that the oil field service costs are going to come down nicely here, and we hope to contribute to that decline.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, and just a final question. We would appreciate hearing your thoughts on what oil price you think the Middle East needs to maintain its social programs? And whether your outlook for securing additional development projects has become more positive in light of the rapid drop in oil prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Ray Irani. I just read that the Prime Minister of Qatar, which is one of the richest country in the region, that they needed $55 million to balance their budget for spending plans. And he thought that the current oil prices were too low. So that's what he says. Clearly, they are suffering also. As you have probably read, the stock market in Saudi Arabia is down 50% this year-to-date. Others in the region are down 20% or so. Some of their banks are struggling, which proves again, when the U.S. has a flu, the rest of the world can struggle without having pneumonia.</p>
          <p>So the economy of the world is being affected, including the Middle East. How bad this recession is deep worldwide will affect clearly demand, and the technology of the market. But as Steve said, we feel quite comfortable that at $57 a barrel, we'll still have free cash flow going through the numbers he just did. So from there, you can draw any conclusions you want.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, Steve. Steve, could you help us a little bit with OpEx, and how that will be affected by the downturn. I guess DD&amp;A is going to be sticky. But then obviously the cash issues, I wondered if you could just walk us through some of those &#x2013; how those will change. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, DD&amp;A is going to be sticky, although it remains to be seen when we redo year-end reserves, how that turns out. But it &#x2013; that's not &#x2013; that's money already spent. So, I mean, that's part of the cash flow. Operating costs, obviously production taxes are going to fall sharply. And electricity costs and Co2 costs for the third party Co2, which is tied directly to oil prices. And I would guess our workover &#x2013; I know our workover costs are probably going to decline sizably in &#x2013; you'll start to see that in the fourth quarter. So, I would guess there would be a fairly sizable reduction over the next two quarters in operating costs, even if we do nothing. I'd like to remind you that about a year ago, we engaged on a G&amp;A reduction program, which we're starting to see some of the positive effects of that in some other things that we've done, in anticipation of some kind of downturn.

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's around a couple of bucks a barrel equivalent, I would guess. The other part that's a little tricky, in our production sharing contracts, we pay all of the operating costs and recover it through cost recovery. And so as the volume goes up as the production sharing contracts generate more barrels, the cost per barrel will decline from that too because you have more barrels to spread your operating costs over. And that may be a little hard to see, but &#x2013; and that maybe added $0.30 in the last year to our operating cost per barrel. Because that changed from last year's average price of 72 to this year's 113. You get about $0.30 just from that fooling around with the production sharing contracts. So, I mean, there's a lot of moving parts and it's hard for us to get at an exact number.</p>

          <p>Yes, if I could ask you, Dr. Irani, what was your perspective on the OPEC meeting? I thought some of the language was interesting from the Saudis particularly, what was your interpretation of what happened?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the Saudis have a difficult decision to make. We're between Presidents, and they don't want to appear to be contributing to the economic downturn in the United States. So they were very careful in agreeing to the production cut. Because the last thing they needed was to announce the production cut, and the price of oil jumps up to high numbers, and then people start throwing stones again. My interpretation is 1.5 million barrels a day was announced. Clearly, for that to happen, the bulk of that reduction has to come from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and UAE because the other countries which were looking for much higher cuts at this point in time probably won't contribute to that cut materially. So, looking at the end result, the announced cut did not raise prices significantly. As a matter of fact, prices went down. So specific to my interpretation, the Saudis feel that what was announced was appropriate in today's political environment, international political environment.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I just had a quick question on the 2009 debt maturities, first of all. My understanding was that the bulk of those maturities are actually consolidated subsidiary debt. So is there an actual cash outflow for Oxy when that debt actually becomes due?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is, it depends. The debt is Dolphin debt. And it'll either be refinanced by Dolphin, in which case, there would be no outflow. Or we would pay our share, which is what we've currently planned for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, excellent. So the 714 is not necessarily a full cash outflow. I just wanted to check on the liquidity portion there. And then one more if I could, please. In the second quarter, you had announced a plan with SandRidge to go forward with a Co2 extraction plant in the Permian Basin, where you would be the off taker of the Co2 for EOR purposes. SandRidge has since announced some pretty significant cuts to their capital budget. Would you be willing to actually fund the Century plant in order to open up the incremental EOR activity that would represent or would you just defer those EOR projects until such time as you could get another source of Co2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the Century, we are funding the Century plant. It's all Oxy money. There's no SandRidge money at all. So the plant itself is being built with Oxy money. SandRidge is building it, but they're building it with our money. So I don't think there's any real risk to the plant. I think your question really is about their well drilling program. They have a deliver or pay commitment for the gas. They have to deliver the gas when it's ready, to the plant. If you don't deliver, bad things happen, so...</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, could you guys give us a quick update on the level of CapEx you anticipate in Libya next year? And similarly, what oil price you think supports continued activity in your properties there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't know. It's subject to approval of the Libyan Government for the capital level. And so it's a negotiation. Remember, the Libyan's have to put up half the money. And so it's a little more complicated than just what we want to do. Libyan production is fairly low cost. And so I don't really know what the number would be, but $25, $20 somewhere, it might be lower than that because the lifting cost is quite low. And so, and the capital is really for growth rather than maintenance. So I just don't, you know, I mean it's really hard for us to come up with a firm number.</p>
          <p>All of these estimates about what something might be economical at some oil price or gas price. You have to make some assumption about oilfield service and steel costs, and that sort of thing. You can't really make the assumption that oil is going to be, or gas is going to be $5 an MCF and oil is going to be $25 a barrel, and steel is going to be $2,200 a ton. Those numbers just don't go together. And so it's very difficult for people to come to grips, companies to come to grips with what the breakeven price of anything is with radically changed product prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the accurate thing is what Steve said earlier, at current oil prices or $57 even a barrel, Oxy will have free cash flow next year. Our capital spending will be at or below what we're going to spend this year, which is about $4.5 billion. And we'll have significant growth in volume, which we estimate currently at 650,000 barrels a day in 2009. I think those numbers are much more accurate than if you start digging into the pieces. We've been looking at the pieces, and we will be giving you our best estimates for the overall picture.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, that helps, just a quick follow-up on Libya. If the numbers that you will propose to the Libyan Government, are they going to be for same level of spending or increased or decreased level of spending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are meeting in Libya, our people are meeting in Libya to look at these things. And as far as what we are going to put together with them, it's the plan we had before. But as we said, it's not a one-man show here, they are partners of ours. And so they have to approve those programs.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A lot of people are in last place. But can you kind of give us your perspective on &#x2013; I don't want to vary too far on this, but on the Government's efforts to try to free up the banking system here. What implications that may have for the willingness of the commercial banks to lend to kind of the middle to smaller size E&amp;P companies? And whether or not the problems they may be having in the banking system could be opportunities for you guys to pick off assets at a lot cheaper price than you could have absent this decline in oil and gas prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have, in the last month or two, we've made offers, people have come to say would you buy these small assets. And we've made offers. And the offers have been rejected, by the way. But we were the only bidder, because there's no cash. And right now, the sellers are looking at six months ago prices, and the buyers are looking at a lot lower than that, shall we say. And so there's really not much going on now. I think there's a lack of reality. And the small producers I think are going to have a very difficult time with the banks of getting more capital at this point. And as I talked about earlier, there is an enormous backlog in the BBB space for bond deals. And never mind the BB space. So it's hard for me to envision banks being enthusiastic lenders to companies that, in my view, are over leveraged already.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we could see some forced selling of some of these assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think it was a tough year. I think once the reality comes, I think that they believe somehow on December 31 or January 1, there's going to be this incredible change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know what it is, some change that the world is going to get better, and once again, happy days will be here again. And I think the damage to the banking system is so much greater than it's been in my lifetime that I don't believe that. And a lot of the buyers who competed for properties. I don't mean just the companies, but the whatever they're called, leveraged buyers &#x2013; just are going to be out of the business. So I think it's going to be a very tough environment for someone who is &#x2013; got too much debt. The right amount of debt for this industry, I have always felt, is about zero.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think we will see some of these bank lines being reduced to the point where some of these overleveraged companies will be forced to sell assets by the banks to get down to their borrowing base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, unfortunately for the banks, most of these people re-upped their lines within the last few years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's really hard to reduce it. So I think their lines will be there. But with the cash, even with the reduced capital spending plans that some of these people have, I don't see where the free cash flow comes from to do what they are saying. So, I mean, they are relying some of them are relying on asset sales to stupid buyers. And I am sure there are some stupid buyers, but probably not an infinite number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, one follow up if you don't mind. Your preference has been, I believe you communicated to me. Your preference has been for North American oil, and you see more opportunities, and have seen more opportunities in North America as opposed to the Middle East for people to maybe bid down their rates of return on some of those big projects. Given what's going on in the worldwide financial system, I know you said earlier you don't know about some of these projects in the Middle East. But is your preference still for North America, is it still for oil? Or could we see you be more aggressive on the gas side given some opportunities that might come up from weak sellers who have maybe assets in or emerging and conventional resource plays where returns could be quite good once the gas price recovers? Is that something that might be of interest to you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I tell people all the time, it's really not about oil and gas, but it's about money. So, if we see better returns in gas, that's where we will spend what we have, and where we don't, we won't. We are interested in building inventory of drilling locations over the &#x2013; that we can do, we can harvest over the next decade. So that probably says maybe more gas. But we have to manage what we know how to do. We can't do something that's out of character because the learning curve is too steep.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I would like just to stay with the theme of the earlier caller on potential for asset deals or indeed corporate transactions. Are you surprised that we haven't seen corporate deals in these markets?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, again, I think you have a &#x2013; let's say you're a small producer, or medium size producer, whatever you want to call them. And your stock is $20 today. And six months ago, it was 80. I think it's very difficult to go to the Board, and say, I would like to take $20 of Joe Blow stock, or $20 in cash, or $25 whatever is. And I think until the reality comes that this is sort of the way it is, I don't think you will see much, I could be wrong of course. I'm likely to be wrong. But I really wouldn't expect to see much until next year.</p>
          <p>I think almost all of the medium, small, whatever you want to call them, producers, think things are going to be back to something like normal in the first and second quarter of next year. And so they're stretching themselves to make it through then. At which time, things will be better they believe, maybe they will, I certainly hope they are better. But they might be, they might not be. And I think that's when the rubber will hit the road, and that's when they'll be looking for deals.</p>

          <p>Okay, so almost a distressed seller scenario.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, a distressed seller scenario, and I don't think you'll see, what, until some time next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And given the earlier discussion, do you have an update on Dolphin and the long-term growth plans there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dolphin is doing very, very well. It continues to produce above desired capacity. And because of our production sharing contract there, volume would be increasing next year, because today's oil prices are lower than they were last year.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the additions go, that's really a negotiation between Governments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you &#x2013; the current environment is not conducive for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't know, it's a negotiation between Governments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
