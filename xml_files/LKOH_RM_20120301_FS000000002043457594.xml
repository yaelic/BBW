          <p>...LukOil 2011 Financial Results Presentation. The presentation will be delivered by Mr. Leonid Fedun who is Vice President on Strategy of LukOil. We also have as part of the team, we have Deputy Chief Accountant of LukOil, Mr. Igor Kozyrev, and Head of U.S. GAAP Reporting, Mr. Epifanov. These are the most knowledgeable people that know how much money we'll make more than we do. And we also have two members of the IR team and these are Gennady Krasovsky and Maxim Madzhlisov, Co-Heads of Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>My name is Andrey Gaidamaka and I'm Deputy Vice President in charge of Strategy and Investments and I will be conducting this meeting. Also a couple householding issues, you see we have translation. You have the channels just in case you forget which channels are there. You have them on the box. We will also have questions coming through Internet and telephone connection, but we'll definitely give preference to questions coming from people that came here. But I would really appreciate that every time when you ask the question, please state your name and your company name.</p>
          <p>Thank you. With this, without further ado, I will pass the stage to Mr. Fedun for the results presentation. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your visit to our presentation. We appreciate your attention. For our company, I will speak Russian because it's more comfortable.</p>
          <p>2011 was a very successful year for the company. It was a successful year for the majority of oil companies as growth trends in the hydrocarbon markets, especially outside of the U.S. markets, persistent throughout the year. The companies, oil companies, managed to overcome issues that accumulated in 2008 and 2009. And just like most of our colleagues, we can say that 2011 was one of the most outstanding and record-breaking years in the history of our development.</p>
          <p>The key 2011 financial highlights, we posted a record high free cash flow, which exceeded $7 billion. We rank fifth and sixth now in terms of this indicator and on the global majors. We also posted a record high net income exceeding $10 billion even though this income has been adjusted for significant financial write-offs and impairment. We have also posted record high earnings per share and very strong recurring EBITDA of approximately $20 billion. In addition, we have significantly reduced our net debt by approximately 30%.</p>
          <p>Overall, the company, like I said, managed to overcome the crisis which we've all witnessed several years ago in terms of all indicators, both in terms of revenue, free cash flow and net income. I will come back to this later during my presentation, but I've already mentioned that our income has been adjusted for write-offs. Those write-offs was due to a not particularly successful operations in Timan-Pechora and in Titov field.</p>
          <p>Key positive events in the company's life in 2011. First and foremost, we've managed to stabilize our production in Western Siberia. During approximately six years, we saw our production decline in this area. We've managed to increase our resource base. We've acquired a 21% stake in the Trebs and Titov oil fields in Nenets Autonomous District. We fought for the stake, and it's extremely important to us that we've managed to acquire the stake. We have launched production of gas at the Gissar project in Uzbekistan. Our refineries launched production of high-octane gasolines in Russia which is in strong demand. We continue to develop our operations in the electricity generation and distribution segment.</p>
          <p>A few words about the macroeconomic environment. The positive factors include a significant growth in prices for oil and oil products, both in the global markets and the domestic markets. As you can see, price growth in the domestic market has been limited as the government has been taking measures to control price growth, especially in the run-up to the elections. Negative factors include an increased tax burden. Taxes increased by approximately 50%, specifically in energy tax and crude oil export duties.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, 2011 was perhaps one of the most unsuccessful years in the history of the company in terms of hydrocarbons volumes, production volumes. As you know, throughout our history, we've never seen a decline in oil production and this is the first time in history that a concurrence of certain circumstances led to a decline in oil production. At the same time, the company's management believes that 2011 was a favorable year, a year where the company &#x2013; was a year where we reached the &#x2013; where we hit the bottom, and we can only grow from now on.</p>
          <p>Reduction in refinery throughputs was due to low margins and instability of the European market for oil products. Therefore, we shut down the production at the Odessa refinery and reduced production at our European refineries.</p>
          <p>As I've already said, a positive signal is the fact that 2011 saw stabilization of oil production in Western Siberia, which we saw both in terms of daily production volumes, and in general, on a month-to-month basis, starting from the middle of last year. We've been seeing sustained growth across a number of oil fields and then a reduction of production decline on other fields. The presentation which we will hold on the 14th of March will discuss in greater detail all the specific measures we made to stabilize production. The Chief of Production in Western Siberia will be present during that presentation as well.</p>
          <p>What I want to discuss here is our operations based on new technologies. The company tries to use the newest technologies in the area of hydrocarbons productions available in the world. We're capitalizing both of our &#x2013; on our own experience, our engineers and geologists, as well as through bringing in technology from outside drilling and engineering companies. Specifically, our company was the first in the country to launch multi-zone hydrofracturing in Western Siberia. And our experience so far in Tevlinsko-Russkinskoye, Uryevskoye, Vat-Yeganskoye fields show that horizontal drilling with multi-zone hydrofracturing produces exceptionally good or encouraging results.</p>
          <p>Our international resources experience and technology was extremely efficient to increase slow rates at the wells in our country, especially in Western Siberia. As a result and as you can see on this chart, flow rates increased significantly, which translates into higher efficiency and reduction of cost of production and reduction of water cuts and an increased oil recovery rate.</p>
          <p>Like I said, in two weeks, we're going to discuss Western Siberia and new technologies used in Western Siberia in greater detail. One of the most important facts is the access. The company got to Trebs and Titov oilfields which remained to be one of the most &#x2013; one of the &#x2013; to be the last undistributed or unallocated resources in the country. As you can see, they are located in the area of the company's operations. And the revenue LukOil expects to receive from Trebs and Titov fields will be in part due to the fact that we are going to use our own infrastructure now and our own transport infrastructure at these fields, as well as our auxiliary services transportation by existing roads and other infrastructure.</p>
          <p>A few months ago, we competed with Shell and won a few areas in Timan-Pechora which have significant promising resources. They still need to be confirmed. But once again, they are located in the area where our infrastructure is available. We've won a number of license areas. We will cooperate with Bashneft and we hope we will be able to further increase our production and productivity in our Timan-Pechora province. Overall, we believe that the Yamalo-Nenetsky Autonomous Region will be one of the platforms for increasing production at the company.</p>
          <p>Last year, the company made a number of significant discoveries, specifically, one of those was the East-Lambeyshorskoe field. 3P oil reserves here are 167 million barrels. However, we expect actual results to exceed 300 million barrels the field. We just drilled a limited number of wells, and we are going to drill more wells this year. This is high quality oil and well flow rates are very strong in the area, exceeding 300 barrels to 400 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>Another company success was achieved in exploration drilling the Caspian specifically. We confirmed our reserves on the Sarmatskoye field with approximately 1 billion barrels. And after drilling, we've managed to increase our gas and gas condensate reserves by approximately 45%. If you look at the chart, you will see that our Sarmatskoye field is located next to our other fields. And so, this is basically one &#x2013; there is a strong degree of likelihood that this is one single productive structure. And, therefore, we believe that next year, we will be able to further increase reserves here by 30% to 40%. Therefore, our reserves in the Caspian have been steadily growing. And we are confident that this region, going forward, will be again &#x2013; will be also playing a very important factor in our &#x2013; will be a very important factor in our development.</p>
          <p>One more success, albeit relative, was a discovery at the Independence-X1 well which discovered a promising net pay. Well one showed availability of certain play and Independence-X1 well confirmed high level of productivity of this field even though we need to drill further to confirm this.</p>
          <p>Western Africa, in our field here are part of the global trend where 30% or more than 30% of wells are relatively successful. And when it is the case, generally, the companies believe that this is a success. So out of two &#x2013; out of four wells, two showed availability of certain resources. So, we will see. We believe that this is already a certain success. Most certainly, we don't think that this is a failure. However, to confirm the reserves discovered by the Independence well, we'll need to do a further drilling, as I've already mentioned.</p>
          <p>We will continue drilling in Cote d'Ivoire currently and based on the information we have at hand now, we are interpreting the data in 2012. We will finalize this data. 3D seismic analysis is at a new and very advanced level now, and we will use this technology. And we believe that in 2013, we will be able to transfer part of these resources from the resource category into the reserve category. But like I said once again, we will need to do some additional drilling there in order to be able to do that. In general, we are not pessimistic with regard our &#x2013; to the opportunities in Africa.</p>
          <p>And another important event of the 2011 was beginning of production at the Gissar gas field. This is one of our key fields. Why Uzbek gas is so important for us? You can see the netback from the sales of gas in Uzbekistan, and you can compare it our Western Siberia oil sales. As you can see, supplies of gas through the government of Uzbekistan to China is a very profitable business for the company. Overall, Uzbekistan will be and is already one of the sources for further production, hydrocarbons production growth.</p>
          <p>Production of gas outside of the Russian Federation is more efficient to the company than production of oil in Western Siberia. This is due to specifics of the tax regime in Russia. Our 2P reserves are approximately 1 billion barrels. At the same time, we continue exploration work and we expect this to grow further, the reserves to increase further.</p>
          <p>The Russian market remains to be a high-margin market from the point of view of hydrocarbons production. And if you look at our refining, you will see that approximately 30% of all EBITDA of the company are generated by refining. Last year, LukOil increased by 12% its production of high-octane gasoline production in Russia. The Russian market has been growing at a very fast rate.</p>
          <p>Several years ago, we said that the sales, of course, in gasoline in Russia will be in the area of 1.5 million per annum. Now, we expect approximately 3 million, of course, to be sold in Russia next year. This is the fastest-growing core markets in Russia and the second fastest-growing after China. Due to this efficiency of our projects, refining projects in Russia was very high. Therefore, our presentation to be held on the 14th of March will show and prove that our investments in refining, especially in Russia, are highly efficient.</p>
          <p>At the same time, recently, we saw emergence of a very important factor. Refining margins in Europe are expected to improve. This factor is the announcement of Petroplus bankruptcy. Petroplus used to be a benchmark. And we see that the shutdown of excess production capacity in Europe is reaching its final stages. So, we believe that refining industry has hit the bottom. And going forward, they will operate more efficiently. Therefore, we expect 2012 and 2013 show signs of strong recovery in refining operations in Europe.</p>
          <p>Financial results, I believe we've already seen them on our website as they would have been published already. I just wanted to note here that our indicators were impacted significantly by the write-off of approximately $1 billion on the project in Timan-Pechora Yuzhnoye Khylchuyu and which basically led to a reduction of approximately $1 billion for our EBITDA. These are significant write-offs. However, we believe that these write-offs were justified in the economic situation we're in right now.</p>
          <p>The key reason for the write-offs, $1.3 billion approximately, these are write-offs on the Yuzhnoye Khylchuyu fields. This was due to a <mark type="ph" /> couple of mistakes (22:37) by our geologist and American geologist of our partner, ConocoPhillips, who from the outset, he's estimated the potential of the Yuzhnoye Khylchuyu field. Actual results were significantly lower than the estimates. Reservoirs here turned out to be very special. And reserves were approximately &#x2013; the actual reserves turned to be approximately 30% below the estimates. Therefore, we have decreased oil recovery rate here from 38% to 34%, and geological reserves were reviewed and decreased here by 150 million approximately.</p>
          <p>Everybody can make a mistake. However, we just need to learn lessons from our mistakes. Our president will discuss this in mid-March as well. We made significant efforts here. We've restructured our project management. We now need to spend more on additional surveys, specifically a delay in the survey of <mark type="ph" /> Vat-Yeganskoye (24:04) field was due to the needs for additional drilling. As Russians say, once you drink hot milk, you will always blow on cold water in the future. And this exactly what we're doing now. And therefore, we believe that the mistakes made in Yuzhnoye Khylchuyu field will never be repeated going forward, and though today, this has &#x2013; and this will impact our efficiency and return on capital.</p>
          <p>Our CapEx breakdown. I wanted to draw your attention to the fact that our CapEx in exploration and production has increased significantly. Overall, we expect CapEx to increase further in the coming four years in order to achieve our strategy targets. CapEx in refining and marketing remained virtually unchanged as we placed focus on exploration and production. There's been an insignificant increase in CapEx in petrochemicals due to commissioning of new capacity, small capacity in petrochemicals in Ukraine. At the same time, you see an increase in power generation CapEx. This was due to the fact that we already build all the capacity that was envisaged by the Russian government.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses. In 2011, we managed to &#x2013; our leasing cost increased insignificantly in 2011. Refining costs was mainly due to commissioning of new technologies, new capacity &#x2013; production capacity. All other items remained virtually at the level of inflation, most likely above inflation in the Russian Federation and the company continues to exercise control over these expenses.</p>
          <p>Our next slide shows, as you can see, lifting cost in Q4 was at the level of Q1. Significant fluctuations you see throughout the year was due to exchange rates fluctuations. The key driver of OpEx was refining cost but this was due to commissioning of new capacity. Overall, we believe that the company has been controlling its expenses efficiently. And going forward, cost control will remain to be one of the most important tasks of the company's management.</p>
          <p>Transportation costs. Transportation expenses in 2011 increased in line with transportation monopoly rate growth. And as for SG&amp;A, they remained within budget. And we believe that our SG&amp;A expenses are one of the best in the Russian industry. In Q4, our SG&amp;A expenses declined, even though we saw an opposite trend in previous years.</p>
          <p>Net income. Key drivers of net income, as you can see, the write-offs had the most negative impact on net income. The total amount of write-offs was approximately $1.3 billion in 2011. Overall, taking account &#x2013; without taking into account those one-off effects, we believe that the company showed a record high net income.</p>
          <p>Cash flow and cash flow utilization. There was a modest increase in our free cash flow which was due to the fact that the company continued to buy back shares. We bought back shares for $400 million approximately. We reduced our debt significantly, reduced our debt by approximately $2 billion using our free cash.</p>
          <p>In addition, we increased our stake in Tengiz, CPC, British Petroleum, and we've made a number of additional payments for acquisition of assets. Overall, our cash flow is one of the highest in the industry. And based on 2011 results, our cash flow exceeded $2.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Sources and uses of cash. As you can see and as opposed to 2010, we reduced &#x2013; we have reduced our net debt. And as you can see as well, we continued to increase dividends. As for our dividends, the company's shares are profitable in terms of dividend payments, which are in the area of 3.5%, 3.6%. At the same time, the dividends in absolute terms continued to grow.</p>
          <p>I can tell you that on March 14, during our Capital Day, we expect the President, or the President is likely to announce a new dividend policy of LukOil. So, I'm just announcing this event. And I would like to invite you to attend this presentation. I believe that the new policy will be different from the previous policy. In that, we will state that we are going to further increase dividends and intend to further increase dividends and dividend yields. LukOil maintains strong positions across all indicators, industry indicators in terms of lifting costs.</p>
          <p>In terms of earnings per share, we rank fourth in the industry now in terms of net cash flow. We have a strong financial position which is particularly relevant in the turbulent financial markets. As you can see, we significantly reduced our net debt. Debt to capital is also one of the best in the industry. And our net debt to EBITDA is also at one of the best levels in the industry, which creates potential opportunities for &#x2013; which create opportunities for the company going forward.</p>
          <p>And a few words about the event we're going to hold on March 14. We're going to hold an extensive presentation which will discuss our strategy. President of LukOil will deliver a keynote speech. He will discuss the strategy for the coming decades and the key stages of our strategy implementation, key changes we've made to the strategy, those that had been already approved by the board. Four operating managers will &#x2013; senior managers will discuss specifics of our operations. They will discuss how we're going to create additional value and further increase value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Specifically, Azat Shamsuarov will discuss development of our operations in Western Siberia. Mr. Muliak, who is in charge of our upstream operations, will discuss exploration and production, and will discuss our key projects and key innovations we're going to use in our production operations.</p>
          <p>Mr. Mueller will discuss challenges and targets in the refining and marketing segments, about our projects, modernization projects in the Russian refining segments, as well as our foreign refining project developments. Mr. Kuzyaev, specifically, who is in charge of our overseas upstream projects, will discuss this.</p>
          <p>And now, we'll be delighted to take your questions. Thank you.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do we have any questions, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for the presentation. Two questions, if I may. The first one is on downstream. Could you please give us an estimate of what the EBITDA contribution would be of the delayed coking unit which you brought online in December of last year at your Volgograd refinery?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on upstream. What change in lifting cost per barrel do you expect to see in 2012 as a result of both the industry-wide cost pressures and your own greater reliance on horizontal drilling, in particular, in combination with multi-stage fracking? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The first question concerns our Volgograd project. Well, first of all, I would not like to discuss this extensively now before the 14th of March because we will discuss this in detail on the 14th of March. I can tell that all our projects, all projects we are &#x2013; all modernization, refinery modernization projects all deliver approximately 20% rate of return. So, they are high margin. And as for new &#x2013; and as we implement new innovations, new technologies, we expect the rate of return to increase even further.</p>
          <p>As for the second question, clearly, the lifting cost have increased somewhat. And this is due to the fact that our operations became more complex. Horizontal wells are more complex than usual wells and especially since we use multi-zone hydrofracturing, the costs have increased. However, this significantly increased our flow rates and overall, we believe that our, today's lifting costs are competitive and our exploration segments will make all efforts to remain within budget in terms of lifting costs. And therefore, I can say that we do not expect lifting cost to increase significantly as we apply new technologies. Because new technologies are used not only to increase flow rates, but also to reduce costs. And going forward, we expect it to happen and we will do our best to control lifting costs.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Tatiana Boroditskaya, UBS. A few questions. How do you see your production in 2012? How do you see your CapEx in 2012 and do you have any plans to issue Eurobonds in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I believe you're asking about the increase in production volumes and CapEx. Well, as for production, as we've already said, we expect 2012 production volumes to remain flat. We don't expect any growth or decline in production. And if you look at our daily volumes, in the first two months of this year, you will see that this is already the case. There may be some increase due to a number of technical factors.</p>
          <p>As for CapEx, we do not plan &#x2013; well, I've already mentioned &#x2013; first of all, I've already mentioned that on the 14th of March, we will discuss in greater detail our CapEx as it should be discussed together with a detailed analysis of all our projects. As for Eurobonds, it would be strange to issue Euro bonds when our cash flow is so strong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> (40:56) Two questions, please. One, if you could potentially give me a split, the ratio split between how you see the ratios between domestic and export refined product, going in 2012? And the second would be, is there any more oil fields with similar criteria that would, <mark type="ph" /> meet (41:25) &#x2013; the recent write-downs that you had, or would you expect any more oil field write-downs in the near future? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would appreciate if you could clarify your question. The first one, sorry, as I understood was about the split of LukOil refining between domestic and international, i.e. supplies of refined products that would be correlating with basically refining volumes. Is that the question? I mean, how much we sell domestically and how much do we refine and sell internationally. Is that the question?</p>
          <p>Okay. Well, the company today sells &#x2013; well, refines in Russia over 1 million barrels a day. International refining is significantly smaller. We refine and sell &#x2013; well, we just added significant portion to our refining through TRN and ISAB acquisitions. But even with those, the sort of equity refining in international arena is about, right now, about 300,000 barrels, 400,000 barrels a day. So, it's still mostly dominated by domestic refining. And domestic refining is significantly more profitable. That's something we were showing that domestic refining is yielding close to between $15 and $20 a barrel of refining margin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And second part...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What was the second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just if you have any oil fields that could potentially result in write-offs and further impairments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I most certainly hope that we don't &#x2013; Yuzhnoye Khylchuyu field is a unique field. And I will give you an example. Initially, this field, Timan-Pechora <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:56) &#x2013; sorry, Timan-Pechora company and later on when Exxon Mobil was unable for political reasons to deal with it, Conoco wanted to develop this field and then ourselves together with Conoco. So you know &#x2013; top geologists surveyed this field. They really believed it was unique. However, its uniqueness is also in the fact that the oil content and reservoirs were not in line with the initial estimations.</p>
          <p>Geology is a very complicated science. You can project things. You can estimate things but only when you cut and open, just like in medicine. You will see what's really in there. And therefore, Timan-Pechora and Yuzhnoye Khylchuyu fields has shown that we need to interpret more carefully geological results and at the same time spend more on additional drilling and that's what we are doing in the Caspian now.</p>
          <p>We intended to drill &#x2013; initially we intended to drill only two wells in the Caspian but then we made a decision to drill two additional wells as <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:19) on Karchagin field also was due to the fact that in order to confirm estimates we wanted to drill one more well. So, like we say, we should not do anything prematurely, but in any case, we believe that the mistakes that were made with the estimates should not be repeated going forward.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Daniel O'Sullivan from Energy Intelligence. If you could just &#x2013; I know you're going to present on March 14 about the fracking and stuff in Western Siberia, but if you could just give us some color. Are you saying that essentially through the use of this technology, you're going to be able to halt the decline in Western Siberia? And if so, is that something you expect the rest of the industry to be able to do so alongside yourself? And beyond that, is there any potential for the application of this kind of technology to actually cause kind of net growth in these previously, kind of depleting brownfield territories as we've seen happen in the U.S. with this technology? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Well, a very important question with regard to the potential or reserves in Russia is as follows. Right now, despite active exploration and despite the use of new technologies, our recovery &#x2013; or the recovery ratio remains in Russia rather low. In our company, it exceeds slightly 20% of geological reserves. It's very low. In U.S., it's 43%. In the North Sea, it's approximately 52%. So, in Russia, I would say, there is a very strong upside for increasing recovery rates.</p>
          <p>If we reach the level of 40%, for example, which will still be below the U.S. level, this will produce approximately 10 billion barrels of proved reserves in the oil fields with existing infrastructure. But in order to achieve this, we need technology &#x2013; and drilling of new horizontal wells with the multi-zone hydrofracturing which we've started using in 2011. Another technology which is widespread and was actually used in the U.S. is the tertiary recovery, so called. It's water and gas flooding of wells. We haven't been using it actively, so far. The technology is expensive, and that's why we've been somewhat reticent, so far, but we do intend to use them going forward, and we hope some incentives from the government, which will enable us to use the technology soon.</p>
          <p>So I would say both Russia and LukOil have a strong upside and heavy potential for increasing production. We need to use the right technology, we need to use the right experiences, and we need support from the Russian government. We need tax incentives. The government needs to incentivize brownfield development.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I understand you're going to outline your strategic update in March. But I was wondering if at this stage you're willing to provide some guidance regarding the massive CapEx program and whether you're willing to relax your financial targets in terms of your financial policy. Obviously, this massive CapEx is going to result in higher leverage and lower free cash flow, if there's any comment at this stage you can provide further?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it would be difficult to say yes or no to this. Yes &#x2013; our CapEx is expected to increase. But at the same time, we will prove that the increase in CapEx will also lead to an increase in free cash flow and therefore, an increase in shareholder value. And this is not going to happen in a decade. This is going to happen in the short and mid-term.</p>
          <p>Our CapEx should also be split into long-term CapEx in Russia and short-term CapEx, let's say, in Iraq which is not massive but which also makes part of our total CapEx. This is &#x2013; so, it's difficult to say whether our CapEx is massive or not massive. You will be able to judge whether or not it's massive given the company plans and new technologies the company intends to use. So, you will be able to judge about that after the presentation which we'll hold on the 14th of March.</p>
          <p>We intend to create new value for the company. And we intend to create such value using new technologies. We are talking about billions and tens of billions of reserves that can be recovered. And in order to achieve this, we will need to invest. A portion of our CapEx will be invested in refining. That is also significant CapEx. But at the same time, if you see an IRR of 25% to 30%, I mean, you should be the judge of whether or not this is a good investment.</p>
          <p>I believe it is a good investment. And therefore, we just &#x2013; the initial reaction is always that massive CapEx is bad, but you need to go into &#x2013; to go deeper here and to analyze our CapEx deeper. We are creating a new platform. We are not, by the way, we do not intend to change our covenants, by the way, unless there is a major catastrophe in the market. And all our projects are so efficient that I believe that you should really support them after analyzing them. So, I hope I answered your question for now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I will answer the question of writers, questions of writers a little bit later, if you don't mind.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Any more questions from investors in the room?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As for return on capital and given horizontal drilling, how much has horizontal drilling allowed to increase IRR?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's difficult to generalize. If you look at our Tedinskoye field, initially IRR was negative here when we used the horizontal well, so when we started using &#x2013; with standard wells; when we started to use horizontal wells, IRR was 18%. When we started using horizontal wells with multi-zone hydrofracturing, IRR was 20%.</p>
          <p>We need to see on the field by field basis. We just look at specifics of fields and we use technologies that are appropriate for &#x2013; in increasing productivity at those fields.</p>
          <p>Horizontal drilling, multi-zone hydrofracturing is a very expensive toy. So, it should be used only at fields that are suitable for those technologies. But in any case, I can say that this is a revolutionary technology and the use of the technology in Western Siberia and going forward at other fields will also revolutionize our recovery &#x2013; oil recovery rate. And we will do everything to prove this.</p>
          <p>This is not going to happen overnight. We need to build some experience but we continue to do that each year. So, new ideas, new results and new understanding of processes. It's impossible to send a team of drillers who drill in one part of the country and make them drill in another part of the country because once again, different fields have their own specifics, reservoirs are different, metrics of those reservoirs are different and until you drill several exploration wells, you cannot understand which technology is the most suitable &#x2013; is most suitable for a specific field. But we see very good and promising results and we will continue in this path.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One more question and a follow-up, if I may. I was just wondering, how does your &#x2013; because you keep referring to IRR, how does your capital allocation process for domestic downstream work? I mean, do you target particular IRR under the existing tax regime, or do you focus more on minimizing the payback periods given what's somewhat perceived to be a  <mark type="indiscernible" /> (56:22) regulatory environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are using anything and everything available to us, and we take into account both tax regime and our target IRR when we consider projects. Given the existing tax regime in Russia, these projects are extremely profitable right now in Russia. And there is a huge demand in the markets for refined products. Approximately 300,000 cars more appear on the roads of Moscow alone every year. And therefore, there is certain pressure on the company to increase refining.</p>
          <p>But the key, the main idea here is that this is an extremely profitable business, and we benefit fully from this business. If you look at our figures, we have mentioned net income per barrel of approximately $11 to $12 per barrel. And if you divide all our revenue by the number of barrels, you will see that it's about $20. And this is exactly &#x2013; this is precisely the effect of refining and some other segments which are closely related with production, for example, gas, petrochemicals, electric power. So, I believe, vertically-integrated companies are attractive, even though investors sometimes believe they're not, but we will see and we will show you on March 14 that we will be &#x2013; we'll continue on this path.</p>

          <p>Mark Henderson here from Credit Suisse. Just a question on your horizontal wells, you're guiding to a fairly substantial increase in horizontal wells <mark type="ph" /> beginning (58:44) next year. I'd be interested to know how does that impact the overall new well count for next year? Will that be substantially increased? And then just on from that, would you be prepared to give us any guidance on how many of those wells will be drilled by Eurasia Drilling relative to history as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's difficult for me to answer this question. Once again, I just wanted to announce the presentation on the 14th of March. Obviously, the increase in the number of horizontal wells, which are much more &#x2013; which offer much higher flow rates, increase overall efficiency of our production and field developments. Obviously, they allow to save on infrastructure, on workforce and so on. But once again, on March 14, we will show you all and we will give you all this information, all the figures, and we'll discuss this particular segment. And people who are in charge for this project of horizontal drilling will be present there and will discuss this with you in greater detail. But overall, I guess, your question partly answered this...</p>

          <p>You have spent $500 million on M&amp;A and in international in the first quarter, could you please advise which acquisition you did in this quarter. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, we spent approximately $500 million on buying the share of BP in CPC and in Tengiz; in LUKARCO joint venture so this is $500 million you're asking about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Well, as you know, there is a regulation of the Ministry of Finance and all companies have to switch to IFRS within three years. We don't have any choice here. We simply have to do this, and we intend to do this as of 2015. And our Deputy Chief Accountant can answer this in more detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, indeed, we do intend to switch to IFRS. And since this transition would require availability of IFRS data for two years before the actual transfer, so we will start preparing such financials in 2013 and 2014 already in order to be able to switch to IFRS as of 2015. Indeed there are significant differences in standards in terms of write-offs and in terms of interest and control of the company. Well, I would &#x2013; I think U.S. GAAP and IFRS will further converge. And we actually hope that in three years that both standards will be very similar &#x2013; will be the same in 2015 even though American legislators depend on ICC. And we don't know what is going to happen there. But we are going to switch to IFRS.</p>
          <p>And we are going to inform you about this, and this will &#x2013; the same &#x2013; we've had a lot of questions about switching to U.S. dollar accounting &#x2013; the accounting in U.S. dollars as well. We will consult you before doing so.</p>

          <p>From Geydar Mamedov from Goldman Sachs, from Maksim Moshkov in UBS, and Pavel Kushnir from Deutsche Bank. But they are all questions that are relating more to strategy, which is on drilling volumes, what the contract risk will be, the efficiency of multi-zone fracturing, and what will be the dividend policy going forward?</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, we probably would not want to move into those questions at this presentation and really would like to postpone those questions to the 14th of March one. And so, gentlemen and ladies, I'm sorry, we cannot take all the questions. And actually in this particular one, we really would like to take ones on the financial results of 2011.</p>
          <p>Any other ones?</p>

          <p>It will be very efficient use of your time and their time if you could please, sort of, put yourself into groups what you would like to discuss and send questions to IR department, so we can &#x2013; we don't have to have all six present as one one-on-one. So we can have sort of separate groups that we can organize for meeting with particular vice presidents depending on what is your bigger area of interest, or please send more analysts and more people so you can have a few concurrent meetings with the different parts of the organization.
