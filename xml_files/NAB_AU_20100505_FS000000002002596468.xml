      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll kick off. Thank you and good morning. Welcome to those of you here in person, those on the phones and on the webcast. I've got my executive team with me here and Lynne Peacock, our U.K. CEO is on the phone. I'll give you an overview of the results and then Mark will go into more detail and of course we'll have Q&amp;A after that.</p>
          <p>In summary, I'm actually pleased with the result and the current position of our business. The group's delivered a solid cash earnings result, growing 8.2% on PCP in an environment where there was marked variation in the strength of economic missions across our key markets. There was subdued business system credit growth and continued uncertainty around regulation and then, however, there was the offset of stabilizing asset quality. This sound result reflects the portfolio mix and the investments we've made for our future.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet remains strong with a Tier 1 ratio of approximately 9.1% and continued higher liquidity levels. Pleasingly, we've been able to increase the interim dividend to $0.74. Importantly, I am optimistic about the future outlook and the position of our businesses are in to take advantage of key emerging trends.</p>
          <p>Firstly, the economic recovery appears to have commenced in each of the key geographies we operate in. In this environment our business bank and wealth business continue to perform well and are ready to take advantage of the return of business credit growth and the growing wealth management market.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we are seeing the emergence of a set of regulatory and political developments which were aimed at addressing the need for greater transparency, fairness and competition. And in light of this, we've also made good progress in our broad reputation agenda, particularly in NAB's Personal Bank where the investments we are making are showing tangible signs of success. Recent internal employee survey results indicate our staff are more engaged than ever before, have a good understanding of our strategy and our priorities and are focused on delivering them and growing our business.</p>
          <p>Today I want to outline to you where I see the growth coming from and Mark of course will take you through the detail of the results a little later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>But first to the economic outlook. Here comes the clich&#xE9; &#x2013; I am still cautious but I am increasingly optimistic.</p>
          <p>The economic recovery has commenced almost everywhere. Global economic growth forecasts have been revised upwards and financial markets have been reasonably buoyant. However, there are sizable differences in economic conditions and outlooks between the major economic regions. While the global downturn was highly synchronized around the world, economies are varied in the speed in which they are emerging from recession with Australia and Asia being well ahead in terms of recovery followed by New Zealand and then the U.S. and the U.K.</p>
          <p>But in our key market of Australia, we're optimistic the conditions will continue to strengthen as Asian growth remains robust. And we'll see the benefits of this emerge in business credit growth over the next 12 to 18 months.</p>
          <p>In addition to this there's still the uncertainty around the factors influencing our industry. There is a heightened political scrutiny driven by consumer perceptions that banks have benefited from reduced competition due to bank mergers and significant government support and stimulus measures skewed to household mortgages. With this being an election year, there's an increasing risk that the government may consider measures to address consumer concerns about competition.</p>
          <p>This environment supports our decision to restore our reputation with the community through the personal bank and build a sustainable long-term franchise, similar to what we did four years ago when we took a stance on fees with an MLC. While this cost MLC some market share early on, we believe MLC is well placed to operate under the new regulations announced from the financial planning industry.</p>
          <p>Discussions around the globe continue with regard to the regulatory environment, and whilst the exact outcome is still unknown, care must be taken by regulators to ensure the new measures do not damage the fragile global economic recovery. Such measures may adversely impact the future growth of the Australian economy and overall banking system.</p>
          <p>And the third point, it's well known that Australia has and will continue to have a reliance on international term debt to fund its current account deficit. From an economic perspective, it doesn't make sense to pour a significant percentage of the marginal funding dollar into mortgages. These funds should be increasingly skewed to business lending and infrastructure development to improve the productive capacity of the Australian economy. And this is exactly what our business bank did during the GFC.</p>
          <p>And finally on the changing Australian wealth management landscape, the wealth management market continuous to remain an attractive growth market. The recently announced regulatory change proposals improve transparency and remove conflicts, and growth will be accelerated with the announced proposal to increase the superannuation guarantee charge to 12%, something we've been calling out would occur over the past six months.</p>
          <p>You may recall this slide that we put up in our strategy update in 2009 and it's been the guide that we've used over the past 14 months with regard to how we're positioning the bank. Consistent with the strategy we outlined, NAB has been working hard to make the investments and changes we believe are necessary to take advantage of this changing post-GFC environment.</p>
          <p>I'll now take you through in more detail why we're well positioned to take advantage of future opportunities. The recent environment has clearly favored those of our peers who have the largest retail banks and biggest exposures to consumer credit market; that is just a fact. While we have continued to perform well, NAB's traditional strengths in business banking and wealth have not been favored by this dynamic.</p>
          <p>Turning to the future, what we can now see is the number of the headwinds our business has been facing during the last 12 months relative to some of our peers are beginning to shift and change direction in favor of NAB's strategic focus and strengths.</p>
          <p>At a group level, we've restructured our business to provide greater transparency along our lines of business and have continued to maintain strong balance sheet settings and create an enterprise-focused culture.</p>
          <p>In business, despite the recent subdued demand for credit, we've continued to lend, with 17.7 billion of new lending in that business in the half. We have aggressively expanded our frontline relationship banking work force. The 150 business bankers we indicated we'd hire last year have been hired and we plan to hire 200 more. Applications are now running at 3,000 to take those jobs. And we continue to build our reputation as Australia's best business bank. In the recent East &amp; Partners survey of business banking customers, 65% of all bank customers including those from other banks, nominated NAB as the bank with the best reputation for business banking. As business credit demand returns, we believe we are extremely well positioned to both take advantage and benefit from this.</p>
          <p>In wholesale banking, we refocused the business on franchise-related activities, particularly cross-sell of institutional banking products into our business banking customer base. By way of example, we have collocated wholesale banking product specialists with our business bankers in a number of our business banking centers. And the capability of our specialized finance business is evident with the appointment of the lead financing role on a number of large infrastructure project financings, including the Peninsula Link road project and the Victorian desalination plant. This capability should enable us to capitalize on the estimated 700 billion in infrastructure finance required in Australia over the next 10 years.</p>
          <p>In personal banking, the investments we are making to improve our customer relations to our satisfaction and our competitiveness, our processing efficiency and our broader reputation are starting to gain traction. Mortgage growth is above system for the first time in five years, new transaction accounts have increased five-fold and complaints are down to 42%.</p>
          <p>Now, if you believe that the status quo will remain, that is that we'll have two pillars and two stumps, there'll be no intervention from government, no intervention from regulators, no researches of second tier banks, no researches at regional banks, no new competitors, then the repositioning of NAB's personal bank will not be the right strategy</p>
          <p>However, if you believe as we do that any or all of those are highly likely and in some cases inevitable, then we're on exactly the right path. We believe we've got the right settings in an environment which we see is becoming more competitive and increasing the risk intervention in any of the forms we've outlined.</p>
          <p>In wealth, we believe the recent government announcements in response to the Ripoll and Henry reviews as well as our recent strategic acquisitions all strongly favor the NAB franchise. Our MLC will see business is ahead of the curve and well positioned to take advantage of the now mandated move from commissions to fee-for-service for financial planning and wealth businesses.</p>
          <p>We think the government's decision earlier this week to lift compulsory superannuation from the current 9 to 12% also provides strong validation that the focus and strategy we've set in our wealth management business is the right one for the future</p>
          <p>In the U.K., Clydesdale Bank was one of the very few banks that did not require government intervention. This leads us well positioned and with attractive options given the changes that are occurring in that market. During the GFC, Clydesdale improved its reputation by continuing to support its local economies through lending and was able to attract and retain a strong retail deposit base. With the front book margin being as favorable as it has been for years, this positions well to benefit from any uplift in the economy.</p>
          <p>BNZ continues to perform ahead of peers. Despite the challenging environment has become an area of innovation for the group. The retail business has been successful at establishing unique store formats that provide customers with services more akin to a retail shopping experience, and the innovation of certain systems, such as the Out of the Box banking system that provides customer access to a simplified product range at simplified price points.</p>
          <p>And finally, GWB has incrementally added scale, reducing initial acquisition economics and we continue to maintain our current bias towards low-risk, strategic bolt-on opportunities.</p>
          <p>Other progress I'm pleased with is the return we're beginning to show in investment into leadership and culture. This year's results of the staff engagement survey are a significant improvement over what we've historically achieved in this area. An 85% response rate across 40,000 employees tells us they were keen to give us the message that two years ago NAB was eight percentage points below the average engagement score for all financial services companies, and today with a score of 68% employee engagement's increased to be above all financial service company average. I'm pleased with the manner we're driving, and the improved employee engagement we're now achieving is an important validation of that.</p>
          <p>In the past six months, NAB's also been recognized as the business bank of the year by CFO Magazine, the CANNEX outstanding home loan award, the Choice award for the best low-fee bank account, the Money Magazine award for the best online savings account, the best overall platform for Navigator, the best domestic bond house, and the only bank to be the employer of choice for women.</p>
          <p>Pleasing these results are because the trophy cabinet's been quite bare for us in recent years and that validates the last six months. We're making significant progress.</p>
          <p>In closing, my priorities remain focused on the things the bank needs to do drive future TSR performance. We need to maintain balance sheet strength; we need to continue to address our portfolio priorities; we need to continue supporting our customers, addressing their needs and improving our reputation in the community; and continue to focus on costs and continued investment for the future. We need to continue to implement the programs that strengthen our leadership capability and attract and retain top talent and create the enterprise-focused culture on which we're making such significant progress.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to Mark who will take you through the result in some more detail.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Cameron, and good morning, everybody. I'm not 100% today. I don't think it's bird flu, but I'll try not to cough over the front row. So with that, let me take you through the financial section and also provide some perspective on how we see these franchises performing over the coming periods. And as you would expect, this result is really one that reflects primarily the sectoral issues that we've all been experiencing and going through coming out of the GFC.</p>
          <p>We've had significant revenue headwinds as markets settle and as we've endured a downswing in business confidence. We've had a bad debt cycle, pretty full, mainly on the business side albeit that that is now receding. And we've all been moving to more conservative balance sheet settings that have come at a cost. And who knows? Maybe they will become more permanent.</p>
          <p>In NAB's case, the results also reflect a period of heightened investment. And you will see as we go through that our spending on our re-platforming is now starting to kick in. We've also been deliberately hiring new bankers into our business franchise and opening new business banking centers to create capacity for the eventual upswing in business credit. And as you all know, we've been engaged in some targeted M&amp;A to fill out parts of the franchise.</p>
          <p>In NAB's case, the results also reflect some deliberate repositioning of the businesses, most notably on the personal bank side where we have introduced our fair value agenda and on the wholesale side which is transitioning from the old nabCapital world to a wholesale business more closely fitted in around the other parts of our franchise.</p>
          <p>So we now feel we're coming into a period where we will benefit from business unit strengths that we've established. Business credit looks like it will rebound quite strongly in the second half of this year and certainly be stronger next year and we think that our match fit Australian franchise in particular is very well positioned to benefit from that.</p>
          <p>We are seeing a flight to quality in wealth amongst advisors and investors, and we'll probably benefit from an acceleration in the savings rate in Australia as well. So that franchise strength come to the fore at an important time.</p>
          <p>And on the retail sides we've had quite significant reputational gains that are already starting to show up in customer flows. And as you all know, that's a tanker that takes some time to turn, so the early signs are quite encouraging.</p>
          <p>Let me take you quickly through the prima facie result and then I've got a slightly cleaned up version to give you a better sense of some of the underlying trends. Clearly what characterizes the result is some revenue softness. The NII is up only 3.9% PCP and down 1.2% sequentially and the OOI is weaker than that, down 19% PCP and 3.7% sequentially adding up to a net operating income which is slightly softer against both periods.</p>
          <p>At the aggregate level the expenses remain under control with between 1.3 and 2.4% growth and giving an underlying profit result that is 8% weaker on a PCP basis.</p>
          <p>Like our peers, we've experienced a swing back at the B&amp;DD line, both because the arrival rates of new problem loans is diminishing and because coming out of the cycle we obviously see no need to build collective provisions any further. So we have on a sequential basis a 38.6% reduction at the B&amp;DD line. So that brings us to the cash earnings that you've already seen in and Cameron already commented on, a 21% sequential increase and 8.2% over the prior period.</p>
          <p>On the balance sheet, we've maintained the strong capital position. We're at a Tier 1 ratio of about 9.1%. The ROE has started back up nonetheless. And the RWAs have continued to fall. Now, in a earlier periods the decline in RWAs was in part due to our efforts to improve our housekeeping and release RWAs. In this period it's much more a function of what's been going on on the foreign exchange rates that we use.</p>
          <p>If I turn to just a sequential picture ex acquisitions and ex FX, and you can see down at the bottom of this slide how they contribute to the result overall, you get a slightly cleaner view of what's going on. The story is not substantially different, but it's worth bringing up some points. So the NII is pretty flat on a sequential basis, and that's consistent with a flat balance sheet. And the way we report, the balance sheet I think contracted about 2% PCP and I think 1% sequential. And ex effects we have a very slight growth, about 1% sequential growth in the balance sheet. So that's fairly consistent and consistent with flat NIM, as you'll see a little later.</p>
          <p>The OOI line sequentially falls more strongly if you back out the acquisitions, because Aviva and JBWere contributions come in at that line. So you see a $225 million or so drop at the OOI line, which will become apparent as we go through. The B&amp;DDs change only slightly to about a $700 million pick-up and the cash earnings improvement sequentially is therefore 17.5%.</p>
          <p>Having mentioned them, I do just want to update quickly on the acquisitions that we've undertaken, and there have been five in the period of varying materiality. The first is Aviva. Aviva goes extremely well. The planning is complete and they're into implementation. Already we have scaled up our expectations of synergies from the business case from 50 to 70 million. And there are encouraging signs both on the revenue synergy line and on the cost of implementation that suggest that they may both be slightly better than we had forecast. So we're very, very comfortable with how that is going, and in particular how the IFAs that Aviva brought to us have reacted to being part of the MLC extended network.</p>
          <p>Another acquisition was the broker administrative business from Challenger which we call Advantedge. And that was a business very much on its knees when we bought it because it had a parent that really couldn't give it access to funding and it was only producing about $100 million a month in settlements. We already have that up to $200 million a month having relaunched certain capabilities and reintroduced ourselves to the broker community.</p>
          <p>And that 197, the business is only operating at 40% of its previous and current capacity, so we expect to have that up to about 500 million of settlements in the foreseeable future on a monthly basis. Now, 500 compares to our retail bank Red Star settlements at about 1.7 billion a month. So it's about a 30% increase in our throughput on mortgages when this thing is operating at its current capacity.</p>
          <p>As Cameron mentioned, with GWB we've been doing a de-risked and well-priced small tuck-ins in the U.S. that have been lowering our averaging entry multiple, so this is the multiples all at the point of acquisition. So we paid 19.2 early on, we're down to an average now of about 16.5. And of course there are further opportunities likely to come along, not necessarily of any great size, but on-strategy and helpful to the economics of the business.</p>
          <p>And the final acquisition has been of JBWere. And JBWere is enjoying more buoyancy in the Australian share market, is forming a very constructive relationship with our private bank with a high level of referrals in both directions. And our retention of advisors has been excellent. In fact we have 165 advisors and the acquisition case had postulated 163.</p>
          <p>So in all of these, they're small, but in all of them they are at least on track for their business case and they're having a positive influence in our business. And you can see on the bottom right there their contribution to the various lines in our P&amp;L through to an $81 million cash earnings contribution.</p>
          <p>So just coming back to group income in more detail. As I've already said, the major factor on the income line is the constrained balance sheet movement. And really that's a function of how our various franchises have gone. Really, the business bank, New Zealand and the U.K. have been pretty flat in their use of balance sheet. In the case of New Zealand and the U.K. that really reflects primarily recessionary conditions. In Australia, it reflects more that there was a significant contraction in business credit, and while confidence came back, activity has been slower to come back. So over the last 12 months we estimate the system is down almost 7% and we're down about 3%. So there have been 80 basis points of market share gain over that period, there have been some slight market share losses in the last couple of months, but overall we've been thrilled with that performance through the cycle.</p>
          <p>The personal bank had some growth in balance sheet, both because it continued to originate mortgages and it bought a $4.5 billion back book from Advantedge which obviously boosted its balance sheet. And wholesale and SGA have been in some shrinkage.</p>
          <p>So, staying with NII and just coming to the NIM line, I think we foreshadowed at the last results when put under pressure that we thought NIM would be flat. And it pretty much has been. The major factors in here, the accounting volatility is minimal in this period, but we have benefited from improved lending margin, primarily getting the full period of effect of re-pricing that continued particularly on the business side up to Christmas. And it has actually continued a little bit since as  facilities mature, but is much less of a factor. And we all know that there's been significantly heightened competition to deposits that has taken some of that back.</p>
          <p>You'll see two basis points at the group level there related to U.K. basis risk, and at its peak, the U.K. bank had a &#xA3;90 million basis risk expense. In the September '09 half that had reduced to a &#xA3;30 million headwind and in this period it completely reversed and the basis risk is no longer out of line with norms for our business. And in fact the vulnerability to that has been significantly reduced. So we hope that that would never come back.</p>
          <p>And then some small changes on the funding and liquidity lines based on how the portfolio mix has changed and the yield curve has changed, all coming through to a pretty much a flat NIM outcome at 2.26%.</p>
          <p>Then turning to the OOI, there a couple of things worth pointing out here. One is you'll see if you look on a sequential basis the fee income dropping from 1,417 to 1,263. And there are really two things that account for that. One is the new positioning on unfair fees which we estimate cost about $100 million in this period and was pretty much in force for most of the period. So that's indicative of the run rate. It may go up slightly in the second half, but that's pretty indicative of the run rate I think.</p>
          <p>The second factor taking a bite out of that fee line is that there were some one-offs in the U.K. result last year which were disclosed around benefits falling from a new wealth distribution agreement and some sale of property and the like that don't recur, and they contribute about 50 million to a correction of that line.</p>
          <p>And then the second significant factor is what's going on with global markets and treasury income, and I've given in the bullet point on the right here the aggregate amounts of that. So in this period dropping just over $300 million, of which about $170 million finds its way to the OOI line which is that orange bar there. So that gives you a pretty good sense of what's been going on at the group income line.</p>
          <p>Turning to the group expenses. And the waterfall chart at the top probably gives the worst view of our expenses that you might take, which is to say on a pre-acquisitions and FX basis our group expenses rose from $3.8 billion to $3.95 billion, which is a 5% increase PCP. As you've already seen, on a sequential basis cleaned up in the same way the expenses are pretty flat. So we're still comfortable that we will be at or around our guidance as it comes to an end in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>Just touching on what's gone on in some of the businesses on a PCP basis as you go across that waterfall. The business bank up $34 million is a 4% increase and reflects, as Cameron said, some very deliberate targeting of investment opportunities in that business. I think we hired 150 bankers last year and we're hoping to bring in another 200 this year and are well underway on that, opening another seven business banking centers and these sorts of things to increase our capacity ahead of an increase in demand and bringing in some very, very good talent along the way.</p>
          <p>The wholesale business is up 37 million which is quite a large jump for that business, although more than half of that relates to a catch-up incentive compensation accrual that relates to the prior period and so it doesn't reflect the ongoing run rate of expenses in that business.</p>
          <p>The U.K. too has quite a significant step up, $62 million there. And around half of that represents a higher expense associated with the U.K. pension which is now, given what's happened in the U.K., in a more substantial deficit as you know, and we've been taking account of that in our capital. But it also has a P&amp;L effect and that probably is ongoing. And that is a business too that is accruing bonuses at a higher level as it is in turnaround.</p>
          <p>New Zealand and MLC continue to have excellent cost disciplines keeping their cost growth minimal or flat. And SGA is shrinking its cost base as it moves from a set of businesses that were originating to a set of businesses that are merely running off the assets.</p>
          <p>And if you come to the bottom, you can see we have negative jaws. It's really a function of what's happening at the revenue line, not a function of what's happening at the expense line. So as soon as we get back to business sector growth and given that the markets business has now largely stabilized, we would expect that to flip back to positive jaws in the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>And then finally, as we always do, we've given you our investment spend. At 399, if you look back to the PCP at 331, we are spending at a higher rate. That reflects the extra demands that the re-platforming of the bank is putting on us and you can see there that the infrastructure spending is now 45% of the total. And so that progresses.</p>
          <p>Turning to asset quality. The top two slides really give you a sense of the rollercoaster on B&amp;DD. You can see what I said before, in the top left the 1,230 is primarily specifics as we deal with known situations and there is a minimal top up on the collective. There is still some growth in RWAs associated with declining credit scores, but it is marginal, it's about $1 billion I think. And there is always a lag in that as we capture late customer data and bring it into our models. But nevertheless, the trend is distinctly down. And if you look in the top right you can see the quarterly numbers and see that it's a fairly sustained recovery to this point.</p>
          <p>As Cameron said, there's clich&#xE9; in saying he's optimistically cautious, or cautiously optimistic, whatever it was, but there are still forces out there that can upset on the B&amp;DD front, upset businesses. We have a strong Aussie dollar, we have rising interest rates that are affecting discretionary spend and the like. But that said, we're not actually seeing any real stress in our SME  portfolio at the moment. It's actually it feels to us to be fairly contained and we'll see if that endures.</p>
          <p>Down at the bottom on the left you've got the impaireds, which moved up only slightly as one large corporate flipped over from watching to impaired but was well monitored and understood and provided for. And so the impaired to GLA is up 9 basis points to 135 and the 90 day past due is up 3 basis points to 52. So real stability coming through there.</p>
          <p>On the coverages, we tended to focus on this collective provision to credit RWAs ex housing, and that's up now 9 basis points to 155 basis points. And we have also, as you will have seen, booked a general reserve for credit losses in this period, which, while it's not a provision built up through the P&amp;L like other provisions, nevertheless does represent a ring fencing of capital against future credit events. And so bringing that into this calculation effectively means the bank has ring fenced 199 basis points against these credit RWAs.</p>
          <p>The other notable developments on asset quality during the period relates to the CSOs. There were five credit events in the pools that the CSOs variously point at during the period including AMBAC. All of these were largely anticipated and they did put three of the six instruments into their first attachment layer; one of them in fact has nearly burned through its first layer and two others have entered. And that created, as we always said it would, some accounting volatility. So the net effect of that is that we've taken about a $110 million negative fair value loss adjustment in the period in SG&amp;A.</p>
          <p>We have a B&amp;DD of $489 million that in our cash earnings representation of the result, we have netted off against the claim from the hedge counterparty, but in the statutory you'll find those two things separated. And so the net effect of all this is that we've effectively paid a $650 million hedging premium. We've now had $490 million of that back in cash. Of the $650 million hedge, nearly 450 million of it has been expensed in the P&amp;L. So over the remaining life, which is quite long actually for some of the instruments, there's only a further 200 to find its way to P&amp;L. Now, there will be some volatility around that of course, but that is the expected outcome.</p>
          <p>So the real risks still remains leg II. And you'll find in our notes and if you compare them to last time, the number of credit events that might &#x2013; would need to occur on an instrument by instrument basis to get to leg II and you'll find that the level of protection is materially the same now as it was before. So there's no significant weakening of the positions with respect to leg II attachment.</p>
          <p>Our Tier 1 capital is a fairly simple roll-forward at this time. As I said, we've improved slightly from 8.96 to 9.09. We're now 11.61 on an FSA basis. And really, the roll-forward relates to three things. First of all a 64 basis point improvement from the cash earnings and 37 going out by way of dividend. We've accrued on the basis of 20% DRP participation.</p>
          <p>The RWA movement is 10 billion negative which releases 26, but should really be looked at in conjunction with the FCTR since it's primarily a foreign exchange driven adjustment. And then you will see that the GRCL costs us 22 basis points of capital, but we also get back 8 basis points of that in the EL/EP adjustment. So that's a net 14. So a very simple roll-forward.</p>
          <p>We're comfortable at a high level of capital at the moment. We've said repeatedly we're really comfortable anywhere above 8 at the moment. And so we may bring it down at some stage, but really while the regulatory debate continues and while we're still active in M&amp;A, it would be premature to do that now.</p>
          <p>On funding and liquidity, I think this points to a very strong balance sheet. All the way through this crisis we've talked about keep the bank safe and our ratio's moving in the right direction. And I think we really have kept our powder dry. So we've now gone from &#x2013; I think pre-crisis we were somewhere around 70 or even 69 on a stable funding index. We're now 83 on a stable funding index, which is a significant shift. Who knows where the regulators will require us to be or how long we will have to get there but it's certainly a prudent thing to continue to move in this direction.</p>
          <p>All of our franchises have done a great job around harnessing their customer relationships to bring in deposits. The business bank raised $4 billion in the second half at 2.2 times the system. The personal bank help by UBank raised 3 billion at 1.7 times the system. The U.K. raised &#xA3;700 million at 2 times the system. And New Zealand raised 1 billion at 1.3 times the system. So they've all really delivered for us on the customer front, and the customer funding is now 63%.</p>
          <p>We've also been continuing to err on the long side in our term funding issuance. You'll see in the bottom right, our average tenor for this period of issuance is 5.5 years and we have done $15.2 billion. And frankly, given the way the balance sheet is behaving we probably only need 18 or $19 billion this year to meet our commitment. We've given ourselves the funding task of 20 to 25, but it would be effectively pre-funding next year's requirements.</p>
          <p>Since July '09 we've been completely off the government guarantee, so we've been doing in all in our own name. And we're very watchful of the government guaranteed debt because we're cognizant that it's AAA debt and typically owned by different sorts of people to the kind of institutions who want to own AA bank debt. So it will actually represent something that needs to be  carefully managed as this debt matures and needs to be rolled into different kinds of investors.</p>
          <p>Then on the liquid asset holdings, we continue to hold GFC levels of liquidity. Probably the greater regulatory threat to the Aussie banks lies on the liquidity side, so it would be premature to bring that down significantly. And I think by Australian bank standards we have had very conservative allocation of assets on the liquidity side, probably at some cost to earnings, but, again, anticipating where the regulatory rules are likely to take us.</p>
          <p>So, we focused mainly on the group results but I do want to touch on the business franchises and give you a sense of their performance in this period before turning to how we see them in the future period.</p>
          <p>So let me quickly run down them. You'll see five franchises really in recovery and two receding. So the business bank result is outstanding. On a sequential basis it's a 41% improvement. If you take out the impact of changes in asset quality from that business, it's still more than 5% improvement sequentially and 12% PCP despite minimal volume growth, in fact, a shrinkage in business lending. And that is really the effects of pricing and beginning to get some traction on the enlarged cross-sell agenda.</p>
          <p>The business bank is down $150 million. In fact, if you take out Advantedge it's down about $175 million in a cash earnings sense. And I'd really draw your attention to three things driving that; two are substantive in the case of the business and one is really a group allocation issue.</p>
          <p>The first is the fair value fees agenda, and as we've already said, we invested about $100 million in the period as group in taking out unfair fees. So if you tax-effect that you'll have a view of how that has influenced, because it's primarily in the personal bank.</p>
          <p>Secondly, our mortgage pricing has been more aggressive, so we have allowed a higher input cost, partly on the wholesale side, but particularly on the customer side to come into that business without recovering them directly through the mortgage re-pricing.</p>
          <p>The third element, which actually takes about $50 million out of sequential and $20 million out of the PCP, is that we have shift from a planned balance sheet capital benefit methodology to an actual balance sheet methodology, which is where we had traditionally been. We shifted during the GFC to a planned balance sheet methodology because we wanted to take away an incentive for the businesses to grow, except in very attractive ROE conditions. And so that's served its purpose of preserving balance sheet strength. And as we switch back now to an actual balance sheet it gives the businesses a greater incentive to pursue growth. So we feel it's the right time to make that adjustment. So it's an internal allocation between the business and the group, and as I say, it's about $50 million of cash earnings in September '09 and 20 in March '09. And if you make those adjustments you will get a greater sense of the actual momentum through that business line.</p>
          <p>The U.K. is clearly experiencing a turnaround. I've already mentioned that there were a number of one-offs in the September '09 result. They obviously don't recur, so the turnaround is probably stronger than it's represented here and this bank is probably 40% of the way back to where it used to be in profitability terms.</p>
          <p>There are encouraging signs in the U.K. around &#x2013; well, GDP growth is anemic, but the housing sector is actually up 10% year-on-year and more liquidly in housing is excellent because it gives access to turnover and front book margins, but in our case with 85% of the development portfolio in commercial property being in housing, more liquidity in housing is very helpful. Obviously, and unfortunately for us, the strong Aussie dollar and the weak sterling limits the contribution of that at the group level.</p>
          <p>The New Zealand franchise has been remarkably stable through this downturn and through quite a marked recession in New Zealand and is now enjoying a recovery in BDD and has seen its NIMs rising despite continued arm wrestling over customer deposits and the flat balance sheet brought about by that downturn.</p>
          <p>MLC and NAB Wealth, here you have the acquisitions of JBWere and Aviva are distorting to some extent. So you have a 25% uplift, without Aviva it's more like a 6% sequential uplift, but if you make various adjustments at the investments business level and the insurance business level for prior-period effects, then if you take the time you will get through to a view of the underlying businesses cleaned up for all that, both parts of it growing in the 12 to 14% underlying cash earnings growth level. So they're both very healthy and moving ahead.</p>
          <p>And then SGA is blessed with negative revenue costs and bad debts, so hopefully that will repair over time. But the loss is less and half of it is brought about by the accounting on the SCDOs that I referred to earlier.</p>
          <p>So let me then turn to these franchises and give you a sense of how we feel about them and how they might go.</p>
          <p>On the business bank, you can see on the top left the relatively flat business lending volumes. So a very slow downward trend in the GLAs. In fact, the bank grew slightly because of a bit more attraction on the mortgage side. But that flatness, if you look over at the right hand side and the red line there is NAB, NAB has consistently been above the sector. And, in fact, through this period, despite its flatness and despite some very concerted tax on NAB customers from other banks in the business space, we estimate that we actually brought in three customers for every one customer we lost during the period, and we now see the pipeline at the strongest level that it's been probably for five years. So we're very encouraged by that, both at the SME level and at the institutional level.</p>
          <p>The house view, and you'll see it at the back of the appendix from our economist, is that second half growth may bring the system to minus 2.7% for the year, but the feeling in the business itself is that that could be conservative and we may even get back to zero for the year with the second half a growth offsetting the contraction in the first half and, of course, we expect 2011 to be stronger still.</p>
          <p>Now, we would argue that NAB is in an excellent position to benefit from this upturn, and remember, we're talking about a franchise that delivered 50% of our cash earnings as a group. We have been investing in people and business centers. We have conducted ourselves extremely well through this downturn. We have remained predictable to customers. We remained open for business and we've engaged in relationship conservations when it's come to re-pricing, and all of those things position us extremely well with our customers.</p>
          <p>In the bottom right you'll see the survey results that Cameron referred to with all of the banks volunteering a large number of business customers to be surveyed and those customers being asked who has the best reputation in business banking. Pleasingly, 85% of NAB customers think NAB has the best business reputation. And if you look across the peers, more of their customers think NAB has the best reputation than they think of their own bank. And so we believe that as we come into an upturn and as people are less concerned about changing banks, we will be pushing on an open door in terms of bringing in new business.</p>
          <p>And then the last thing I wanted to touch on with this franchise is the TCR at the bottom left. And this is a metric we are using to discipline our cross-sell agenda. So this takes all of customer relationship revenue and puts over the lending footprint. So at the moment we make 219 basis points from lending and deposit gathering and a further 96 basis points from other activities. And we've set ourselves the interim target of getting that to 360 basis points and we know exactly where we're going to go after it: on transactions, on wholesale, markets and the like and on the wealth opportunities. So we'll be using that to deliver growth.</p>
          <p>Now, whether the result ends up being 360 or not is partly a function of what will be happening in business margins themselves, the 219 which are held constant here for illustrative purpose. I would say that we think business margins will probably slowly contract from this point going forward but we don't think it's going to be particularly rapid.</p>
          <p>Turning then to the wealth franchise. This is another franchise that we're quite excited about. Over the last period equity markets have been quite stable, so we haven't had a particularly high market earnings effect, but we have the introduction of Aviva and we have had positive net flows.</p>
          <p>Now remember, this is a business that has been a through transition much like the personal bank is embarking upon. When MLC first came out against secret commissions and rebates, it was deeply  unpopular in the industry; it affected flows and it affected reputation. But recent moves by legislation and by government sponsored review have really vindicated that position. And the franchise has emerged with a reputational and capability lead that is underpinning the flight to quality that we are beginning to see now. And of course the Henry &#x2013; or the government reaction to Henry should provide a natural boost to the underlined growth rate of this business.</p>
          <p>So I think there are four things I would say about this franchise. The first is that it is now, following the introduction of Aviva, extremely well placed in terms of its market reach. MLC's strength in the past has come more from its tight distribution than from its relationship with IFAs, for the reasons I touched upon, and Aviva brings a further 4,000 IFA relationships into the MLC family, so at a time when many of those IFAs want to be dealing with an organization that can help them to understand how to operate in a fee-for-service environment.</p>
          <p>Secondly, this franchise has an excellent track record on costs. And you can see in the top right the underlying costs without the acquisitions consistently trending down as the management teams sensibly set about realizing savings and synergies without bringing on unacceptably high levels of operational risk.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, if you look at the bottom right, you can see a marked difference between the RORC or you'd see the same thing on ROE between the investments business and the insurance business. And management have been working to improve the effective returns in the insurance business, both by running a business that has a better claims experience than the industry typically is able to deliver and by working on what we call longer life products that are less prone to churn by brokers and, as such, typically attract less capital. So we expect to average up the returns in the insurance business towards our group target and therefore have that as a strong contributor.</p>
          <p>And the other thing I would say is through the M&amp;A activity we have really rounded out this franchise into a compelling proposition. NabInvest is now with FUM of $23 billion, including some very interesting and well performing asset management styles. The private bank brings many cash and credit capabilities that didn't previously exist in-house. And JBWere brings well reputed high-end equities capability.</p>
          <p>What's more, the MLC franchises themselves are consistently rated the best advisers according to customer survey. So it's really turning into a quality house at the right time.</p>
          <p>The personal bank has started well behind its competition because of systems and other capabilities lacking. The advantages others have gleaned from the GFC mergers and the fact that the NAB brand did not extend very naturally to where the areas of activity have been in recent periods, such as the new home owners, all of these things are being addressed and we are seeking to establish positive differentiation for this business.</p>
          <p>We've led the way on unfair fees and that has now been matched by competitors. So it is a point of differentiation. And we have already seen a significant response in accounts openings. Account openings are about 6 times higher now than they were at the same time last year</p>
          <p>We've also seen a significant drop in our complaints; they're down 42%, freeing up capacity in our networks and our call centers. And we are beginning to close the gap on customer satisfaction from a year ago being more than a 5% gap to now being a 2.5% gap</p>
          <p>Now, there are many things other than price and reputation that drive customer satisfaction and so we had many more things to work on, but we have nevertheless made significant progress. If you look on the bottom right, you'll see the Sweeney Research brand tracker surveys which only six months ago had us at a significant gap to the peer average on every dimension and now have us at least equal with peers, which is the significant turnaround.</p>
          <p>The other thing I would say is we've been focused in previous discussions very much on the share of the home loan system growth, and I appreciate some of this comes at a time when other banks are feeling indigestion and stepping back, but our personal bank over this six month period nevertheless grew at 1.2 times the system &#x2013; it's 1.1 times excluding the contribution of the Advantedge, and in fact in February and March was at 1.6 and 1.9 times the system. The business bank is managing at about 1.0 times the system. So we are now that others have lost some appetite able to bring in what we all know is a high ROE asset class and restore some balance.</p>
          <p>And the other thing I would point to is that we now have differential pricing in the broker networks where for higher risks we charge more and for lower risks we charge less. So that has seen a change in the mix of the loans that we get from brokers with the below 80% LVR applications having increased from 65% to 81%. So we're averaging up asset quality at the same time as increasing assets flows.</p>
          <p>On the wholesale bank, we've talked about markets and markets settling, and it does seem to have stabilized to a degree. So the business as a whole in fact, if you &#x2013; I pointed you a number of times to September '08 as a half that we think about ourselves growing off, and as a business as a whole, not just markets, but everything, we're up 25% in our revenues on September '08.</p>
          <p>So we have to good momentum across the business. Our markets are settled and the settling is slowing. It's brought itself back to the number one position in interest rate swaps. It has a concerted effort underway in bringing FX customers. And bear in mind this is really leveraging our core lending relationships and just bringing in natural add-on services at a time when customers appreciate the continued support on the lending side.</p>
          <p>The other two things I would point to, first of all, bottom right, is that we have a very widely respected specialist finance and debt capital markets set of capabilities that are recognized by their peers. And as Cameron said, with 7 to $800 billion of infrastructure spending coming in this market, let alone what will be happening across Asia, we're very excited having kept our powder dry in balance sheet terms to be able to support this business in getting a disproportionate share of that.</p>
          <p>And our asset servicing business, I think we're the last bank in Australia to have an asset servicing business. It accounts for a third of the market, with the reminder of the market really a fragmented &#x2013; largely a fragmented set of international players. Is a very good returning business that will enjoy the growth in asset management in Australia and also, importantly, brings deposit flows that support liquidity at a time when that is important. So this is a very healthy franchise. It has been through a period of introspection as it's moved away from the nabCapital world, but we think that too is going to hit its straps.</p>
          <p>And then finally just touching on the international businesses, and I think I've said some of this already, but just perhaps to add a little bit more. The U.K. is clearly in a turnaround. You would be a fool to declare victory because there are certainly sovereign risks across Europe, there is a potential for a hung parliament and what that might bring in the U.K. and therefore potential for double dip. But all that said, what is happening, particularly on the housing side, is quite encouraging, the front book margins are attractive and reputation has been strengthened through this period. So we are focusing the management team there firmly on growing the balance sheet again and benefiting from those front book margins.</p>
          <p>And then on the New Zealand side, I think we've for many years said this is a high quality franchise and we haven't always had the proof points. And when you go through a recession and a crisis, I think you get more proof points. And if you look here just at the index of cash earnings through this period, BNZ has clearly outperformed all the other franchises in that market and lives up to what we've said about it being a &#x2013; having a strong risk management culture, a well diversified portfolio and a valuable member of the group that is innovative both in leading the way on cost restraint and efficiency and quality and also being quite an innovator in retail banking, which ideas are then being carried to other parts of our network.</p>
          <p>So let me conclude by saying this is a result that's affected by the downturn and the correction that I pointed out at the beginning. We have been hampered by low activity in business, but we see that coming back and we see all of our franchises either in a strong position or an increasingly strong position. And so we have a good confidence about the medium-term potential we can unlock.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Now we'll connect to Q&amp;A. So as you all know if you can state your name, organization and try to keep it to one question if you could so we can get around to as many people as we can. So let's start in the front with Ben King.</p>

          <p>Hi. It's Ben Koo from Goldman Sachs JBWere. Just a question on the business bank which is half of the cash earnings, when you're looking at the revenue trajectory going forward, can you give us a feel for the areas that you're seeing the increase in the business lending, part one?</p>
          <p>And also, when you're looking at the fee income side of things, how do you &#x2013; part of that also seems to be just the pricing in the fee re-pricing, is that largely done, is that also party for undrawn facilities? And what do you see in the trends in that line and how do you expect to continue growing the fee component?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay, I might get Joseph to answer that. I mean, I think what we, as Mark said, that we're seeing the pipeline very, very strong. I mean, the issue is now going to be around timing, to what degree will it come back in second half '010 and will it be stronger in 2011, but I might get Joseph to put a bit more color on where you're seeing the pipeline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, we're seeing the pipeline quite strong right across the whole customer segments, from the SME sector right through to large institutions. I mean, the story of business lending over the last 12 to 18 months, there's been a huge de-leveraging, largely at the top end of town. But many of those clients have left facilities committed but undrawn and have indicated that they'll be using those facilities when the investment environment is supportive enough for them to move. So I think we're very confident about the pipeline across all segments, and as Mark mentioned in his comments, it's as strong as we've seen &#x2013; at least in the last five years, so that's very encouraging.</p>
          <p>On the re-pricing, we've estimated that we've re-priced around about 80% of our entire book. We've  virtually re-priced everything at the top end but there was our core of customers that were on fixed price, loans coming into the GFC, and as those facilities come up for renewal, we'll obviously be re-pricing those at today's markets. So there's still some re-pricing which we're estimating across the book to be equal to about 20% of our book.</p>
          <p>We do anticipate that as competition re-enters the business banking market, which we've been seeing now for the last six month, that there will be pressure on margins. So we don't see &#x2013; I think as Mark and Cameron have said, we don't see margins going up much across the book except for some of that re-pricing and as higher funding costs still come in there will be more downward pressure. However, we're quite confident in our ability to manage the implications of that through the strength of the relationship philosophy that we have very much as a defining feature of this business. So that's certainly the future.</p>
          <p>Was there &#x2013; was one other point that I think I...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think fees will also be obviously influenced by a level of activity, because we've been in an environment where lending has been relatively flat, and as we see lending picking up, as anticipate we'll start seeing in the second half going into FY '11, then we'll see fee-based income tied to additional lending and to the risk management that goes with that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's James Freeman from Deutsche Bank. I just wanted to ask on the margins side things if I could. As you start to grow the balance sheet, which is obviously the objective over next six to 12 months, just the anticipation of what will happen to margins, particularly given you obviously have that 20 basis point discount for the peers on the mortgage front, and in particular just sort of what you expect to happen on the personal margins because I do note that you said the lack of re-pricing was one of the impacts there, but surely that must compound as you actually grow that balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes, it does. I think that the aggregate picture is going to be pretty much akin with what Joseph said. I wouldn't be looking for margins to increase. I mean, for a start, on the mortgage pricing we had probably four months effective in this half and we we'll get all of it as long as we keep it. And business will soften slightly. And you're right that new volume will require new funding which is a mix of deposits which are more expensive than they have been in wholesale, but you are right. So you're right. So it will probably soften slightly I would say going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's so many moving pieces it's hard to know. I mean, the deposit competition was super intense, then in the last couple of months it relaxed. So it would be foolhardy to try and give a point estimate. But I wouldn't be looking to margins to ramp up significantly from this point.</p>

          <p>I'll start on the U.K. I think as we said at the AGM, we're considering all our options in the U.K. We've got a great franchise. We're very comfortable status quo. We don't feel any pressure to consolidate. We're assessing the options. We feel that if we do look at any options to grow that they need to be demonstrably and financially accretive. And we don't feel any pressure to exit either because we are seeing the rebound on the status &#x2013; so the status quo for us is okay and we're just going to keep an eye on opportunities as they progress.</p>
          <p>On AXA, we indicated our view that we didn't agree with the ACCC's decision. I think it's &#x2013; they pointed to a number of issues. I think it's sensible, having pursued the transaction, that we actually explore what our options are, which is what we're doing. And we're keeping all our options open at this point in time as to how we might address some of the concerns they've raised.</p>

          <p>Jon Mott from UBS here. Just got a question on investment spend, that you did highlight is picking up. And also, just on the systems that you have in place at the moment, and we're hearing a lot of anecdotal evidence from third parties, for example in the personal bank, that you've tried to re-accelerate the mortgage business but it has problems with processing, that it's taking a long time to get applications through which is a huge headwind in recovering that. And also hearing from other people that in MLC and other types of business, legacy systems is still an issue. Have you &#x2013; and I'll add to that that over the last few years you've really had a policy of keeping the cost below inflation and less than your peers. Have you been underspending over a number of years now that it has led to these systems issues and do you actually need to materially increase your infrastructure spend to get those back up to speed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are continuing with the investment in next generation. We haven't &#x2013; I mean, what you'll see on the chart that was put up there is that the spending has broadly remained the same but it was skewed in prior periods to more compliance type an issues, regulatory projects, and now it's very much skewed towards the next generation project. I mean, that's proceeding very well. With the resources we have 475 people working on that project; it is a high priority for us. And we've not diverted any of those resources to any other things we've done. Can't do anything but getting that re-platforming done.</p>
          <p>I might get Lisa to comment on the processing issues because we are making headway there. But I think the re-platforming to us is a priority and I said, I think when I took over, that it was going to be one of the two or three most important things we did and I've taken sponsorship of it. So we're very pleased with the progress.</p>
          <p>The ultimate &#x2013; before I get Lisa to comment on the processing, I mean, the ultimate proof point is UBank is actually on the new platform. We have a functioning business, albeit limited in its capability, that we're seeking to build that capability out with mortgages this year that is actually a functioning example. So the technology's actually got a proof point. So this is I think a demonstration we're delivering actually some new functionality into the market. Do you want to comment on the processing, Lisa?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Cameron. I don't think it's any surprise that we have had some challenges around our mortgage processing. It's been a challenge for us over a period of time actually and our focus historically had been to actually really streamline the component parts, which we had been able to do.</p>
          <p>Our focus now though is looking at the whole end-to-end experience, particularly around our home side, our broker business where we've been able to &#x2013; had some challenges around February or so, they are now reducing, where we focused on increasing the asset quality, bringing those loans in much more rapidly to the extent that we grow well above system in February and March for that business and banker error rates and so forth have reduced as well. So we're now starting to see an uptick in that. In the very short term, it's about improving some of those processes and policies, which we are able to do in the longer term; it's about investment in that next gen platform.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Matt Davison, Merrill Lynch. Just a question on the fair value agenda in the personal bank. You've obviously seen a pretty heavy fall in profits over the period and now some signs of market share gains. I'm just interested, going forward for the fair value agenda, do you need to keep giving up additional fee revenues, do you need to keep giving up additional margin or have we seen exactly what we will to preserve where the brand is at?</p>
          <p>And just on the question you &#x2013; I guess earlier you pointed to some political scrutiny, and I sensed you thought that would happen in the retail bank. Just interested in why it would be the retail bank and not the business bank as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the free front, the fees that we took out last year were the fees that we felt were not part of a sustainable business model. So we haven't subsequently removed fees; we took out the ones that were clearly the biggest pain points for customers, ones that we saw disappearing around the world, and Lynne can add to the fact that certainly, yeah, there's been quite a substantial reduction fees in U.K. banking off the back of regulatory change.</p>
          <p>So we said, look, this is not part of a sustainable business model; in many respects they generate a disproportionate level of complaints. We're better off taking them out on our own initiative. We don't see substantial other reductions, because the ones &#x2013; we think a lot of the fees that we charge are legitimate and relate to a service. The ones we took out were the ones, as I said, were not part of the business model.</p>
          <p>On the mortgage pricing, and I think what we've tried to do is demonstrate &#x2013; I mean, you can talk about supporting your customer or you can actually do it. So I think we've demonstrated that we wanted to grow the business but also demonstrate that we have an obligation as a commercial bank that is perceived to be benefiting &#x2013; rightly or wrongly &#x2013; from a whole series of assistance to be doing right thing, and we've done that. Now, whether we sustain that over time, that will depend on funding costs and a range of other things. But we took that decision also about the repositioning of the franchise.</p>
          <p>On the issue of retail, I think we see far more pressures. It could be government intervention. But if you think about where we're seeing is we talk to the market, we're the entrepreneurs though, well, they're not sitting in their garage inventing products to attack 20% ROE markets, they're sitting in their garage inventing products to attack 30% ROE market. So where's the next attack? It's going to come through retail. It's going to be new competitors, it's going to be resurgence of the regional banks and in some way it's going to be return of their capability. It's going to be where the most heat is on around. So I think we just took a view, much as we did in MLC, this is coming in some, way, shape or form. The pressure is there and the best thing to do is get your business in line to deal with it. So whatever headwinds happen to emerge won't impact this, in fact, you'll be a beneficiary of it.</p>

          <p>Jarrod Martin from Credit Suisse. Question for you Mark. You made the comment that over the course of the half you didn't think the risk of the SCDO portfolio had deteriorated, though I note on slide 71 that there's a number of the deals that only require potentially another five credit events before you incur a loss. And I note that you incurred five credit events over the last half, and considering some of the issues in Europe and the exposure of those portfolios, what makes you feel that the risk hasn't heightened over the half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're right, there were five events, but these instruments point to different names, and you get one like AMBAC which actually affects more of these than any other, so that's quite an extraordinary case. So you normally find if you get a credit event, it maybe affects two instruments and doesn't touch the other four.</p>
          <p>So we had five in the period; if you go back to the September '09 equivalent slide and you go across that third to bottom line where you see the average number of events to reach the attachment point, so you can see 13.5, 11.9, 13 et cetera, you'll find typically they were about 1 different I think last time. So five events has affected each of these instruments by about 1.</p>
          <p>And what happened in this period with the five going &#x2013; and there were five we really anticipated. So we have a good feel for what's likely to come. So we don't, the way we see the world at the moment, anticipate that enough is going to come out of the pool to threaten these second attachment points.</p>

          <p>It's Richard Wiles from Morgan Stanley. Cameron, you said you'll only participate in consolidation in the U.K. if it creates shareholder value. I'm not too sure many people outside the organization know exactly what NAB means with that comment so I'm wondering if you could perhaps expand on the importance of assessing P/E multiples, price-to-book multiples, and also, just from a NAB perspective the relative importance of EPS accretion and ROE accretion. And finally, comment on how important your views on currency might be in assessing any opportunities in the U.K.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your currency's currency. I mean, you can't &#x2013; you could do something predicated on a currency are coming in and get a worse outcome or a better outcome.</p>
          <p>On consolidation, I think what we would want to see substantial accretion in both the EPS and ROE. I mean, I think that's the &#x2013; we certainly don't subscribe to a view that says you need to get big in order then to get out. So, because I think if the first deal is not a financially attractive deal and you're waiting for the second deal to be the one that delivers it and you can't deliver the second deal, then you're stuck with a larger franchise with worse economics. So our view is the only driver is that it's got to be substantially attractive on both those measures. And if it is then we'll consider it, if not, then we're very comfortable with the status quo.</p>
          <p>I'd also say we would rather than currency we'd be looking at implementation risk because some of these issues is they're not &#x2013; they're carve-outs and things which are quite different to whole bank acquisitions, so what's the implementation and the regulatory environment, the regulatory environment is clearly more problematic in that market than it is in others. So we'd weigh all of that up in looking at it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me get the crystal ball back out. I mean, business bank is by far the most material franchise to us. So if we see a pick up in business activity in the second half, as we believe will happen, but barring a shock, and there are some shocks around at the moment as you know, then that will definitely move the needle. And we're going to be putting on assets in retail as well and it looks like markets have settled out. But that's a highly unpredictable area and particularly one that is targeted by foreign banks because they don't need much infrastructure on the ground to compete for it. So there are still competing forces there, but if we get the balance sheet moving, I think we will be fine.</p>

          <p>Well, I think we'll always be &#x2013; for a period at least anyway until we shake it off &#x2013; be dogged by legacy perceptions, but what we've called out here is on the acquisitions we've done. This year we're exceeding expectations on our business case and our implementation run rate. Now, they're relatively small, but we feel comfortable that we can handle those. If we do get AXA, we're very comfortable this will be the time to do the implementation in conjunction with a further work on Aviva, so given the frameworks are set up and Aviva's exceeding our expectations.</p>
          <p>And at this stage we've made no call on what we're doing in the U.K. We're growing the business and benefiting from the upturn there. I mean, we would make that assessment along with everybody else if we decided to do something over there. But at the moment we're dealing with the existing portfolio I think pretty well.</p>

          <p>Brian Johnson, CLSA. Mark, one of the horrible things about NAB has been the unexpected just kind of happening. There was a quarterly disclosure that showed that you had $12 billion of Italian government bonds. Could you run us through what the figure is now. And I apologize if it's in here but I haven't sent it, what is the figure now? Could you explain to us how they actually came into being, but more importantly, I'd like to understand what was the thinking between the counterparties which I believe weren't Italian banks that they chose those ones, because it's just one of these things that I don't think anyone really understands. If we get a common sense explanation of that, we'd appreciate it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So when we engage with other banks, for example, around derivatives, if one side of a transaction is out of the money you typically get security posted. And so we had certain European banks putting up Italian government bonds as security. They're all repo eligible quality instruments and -</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Into the European central bank. So for us to lose money not only would the investment grade bank have to fail, but the underlying sovereign would have to fail. So it's a pretty unlikely case. Nevertheless we took the point that it was a area of concentration. It's now down to I think about $5.5 billion, and most of which matures over the next three to six months. So we're going through a process of deciding whether that's a reasonable level of concentration or not. But the probability of loss is so many steps removed that we don't see it as a significant issue.</p>

          <p>It's Victor German from Deutsche. Hi, Cameron. Can I just confirm the eager response to Richard's earlier question in regards to acquisitions in U.K. where you're looking for substantial ROE and EPS benefit. Can we just confirm that when you're looking for those benefits, your cost of capital is incremental cost of capital rather than using some of the surplus that Mark alluded to earlier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean, anything like that has to wash its face. We're not going to sort of marginal cost it from a capital point of view or anything like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Another question for Mark, if I may. Mark, a few hours ago, INZ produced a result, and the provision charge fell, the collective provision charge declined. There's a big, thumping increase in the general reserve for credit losses. If we look at this result, we see the specific provision charge falling and we see a very, very moderate write-back at the collective provision, we see the 50% expected loss decline a little bit, but then we see a big, thumping increment into the general reserve for credit losses. Just on that GRCL, could we get a feeling as to whether that came through in this &#x2013; in the second quarter as opposed to the first quarter.</p>
          <p>And the second one is can you give us a feeling going forward, the relationship between the P&amp;L charge, the expected loss and the GRCL as the business book continues to grow, because it &#x2013; like does it actually put pressure on the cash distributable earnings going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really just relevant to capital, not relevant to earnings. So I would guess all other things remaining equal, if we ran down collective provisions, the GRCL would rise. And if we built collective provisions, the GRCL would fall. It doesn't quite work like that because they're pointed at slightly different things. So it removes then any capital incentive for us in doing that, but it would still leave the P&amp;L incentive.</p>
          <p>But there was a slight difference in your comment. We didn't actually release any collectives in this period, they actually built up very slightly. You may be looking at something that has some foreign exchange effects in it. So we haven't been releasing provisions. We still have our economic cycle adjustment. We've worked hard to get to this level of provisioning, and if anything, the accounting rules may change to lock all that in anyways. So we're not anticipating a significant release. And so the GRCL is there and it will just &#x2013; as I say, other things remaining equal, they'll just move opposite to each other.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So does it kind of mean that as accounting earnings go up, cash earnings go up, perhaps the capital generation falls back a little?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As account, no, it should mean that the capital generation is the same. If it goes up because you release collective provisions...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Or as you grow more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Then you would offset it with other things remaining equal. So in other words, if the release of collectives was unwarranted based on the underlying risk, then you wouldn't release any capital because the GRCL would pick it up. If it was warranted, they would both move down together.</p>

          <p>Hi. It's Chris Williams at UBS. I just wanted to dig into this personal banking result a bit more. If I have a look at your staff numbers they're up well over 10% on a spot basis, your costs are up about 5%, so clearly we haven't had a full period effect of that, your margins are down 30 basis points in the half notwithstanding the comments you made about funding attribution going into that business and you haven't had a full-period impact of the fee income flow through into that business. Clearly you point to this being a sustainable model that you're trying to implement into the business.</p>
          <p>So can you give us a feel for the sustainability of current ROE, 61 basis points or where you think that will be sustainable and the current level of the margin and where you think a sustainable level might be? Just trying to get a feel for how long these sort of negative jaws comes through the business and where we think you'll reach a base in terms of growing that business from in the future.</p>

          <p>I'll probably pick it up. But, I mean, I don't think we can give a very good forward-looking statement because we don't know exactly what settings we're going to maintain. There is an increasing cost in the business, there has been bringing people in, both for selling capacity and collections and problem resolution, so there has been some investments there. We see the volumes rising which means that's going to get spread across more business. And so we'll just have to see how that plays out. But you point to all the variable yourself; it's just a question of taking a view on those and you'll have a sense of where it goes. But this is still a business with a high ROE, and so it's a business we're very comfortable to grow.</p>

          <p>Scott Manning from JPMorgan. Just on the business credit growth, while we acknowledge that you do have a high proportion of your domestic earnings coming from the business side, once you take into account your global positioning the proportion of your total booked that's in domestic business is actually pretty consistent with the other guys. So once you take that into account, and I'm sure we've all got a bit of business credit growth picking up in our forecast as well, there's probably limited opportunity there for the quote, unquote, positive surprise coming through. So what other areas of the business do you see that might actually provide the delta on earnings, whether it be the global factors through the rebound in the U.K. or the conduits portfolio, that you guys are focusing on?</p>

          <p>Well, there is a rebound in the UK, I mean, I guess it's a question as to how that will progress and that's evident in this. I would make a comment though, everyone's going to have a business credit rebound in their numbers, anyone that's going to talk to a pipeline. The issue is can you actually capitalize on. And the real issue here is you can't go back and redo the last 18 months. If you pissed your customers off and handled those relationships poorly in the last 18 months, you can't go redo that. So I think the acquisition we're seeing &#x2013; Mark alluded to the pick-up of customers, the reputational surveys, those sort of things suggest that whilst you've all got it in there, it's actually can you deliver on. Now, what we don't know is the timing; it may be a 2011 story, it's going to depend on that. But what we can feel very confident about is that we will capitalize on that pipeline given the reputation of how we handled the last 18 months. You can't redo that.</p>

          <p>Sorry, so if we've got CBA and we're just pulling out of the housing market and you'll be above system in housing, then you're also indicating that the strength of the franchise you'd expect to be above system business growth as well?</p>

          <p>Correct we will. And we traditionally have been, yeah. Joseph, yup?</p>

          <p>I had a comment there. We have done just slightly over 20% of business lending in Australia which is a position that we've grown by just over 1% over the last 18 months. But that disguises some fundamentally important insights into our book. And we're quite light in terms of the top end of town, the so-called institutional market. But our market share's probably around sub 15%. But we're very, very strong in the SME market where we've got about 30% market share, a position that we've grown by close to &#x2013; just over 200 basis points in the last 18 months.</p>
          <p>Now, we believe that our reputation and strength in SME banking in particular will put us in very good stead to manage the growth that we'll see coming through there, but also to manage the margin pressures, because the margin pressures tend to start at the top end of town, which re-prices quite quickly, we're underweight there.</p>
          <p>And the relationship strength and the proposition mitigates some of those pressures when you get into the mid-markets. So your ability to manage margin pressure where you've got strong relationship proposition in SME market is an important distinction when you look at the composition of a business banking franchise, and we see that as one of our core strengths And I point to the fact that 2% market share growth in SME banking over the last 18 months is equivalent in normal market conditions to &#x2013; close to 10 years of hard work.</p>
          <p>Growing your market share by 25 basis points in a competitor market is quite a challenging thing to do, but because we stood in the market and supported businesses when the market was uncertain and access to credit was a concern for many small businesses, we believe that we'll be able to build on that reputation going forward. And some of the surveys that both Cameron and Mark talked to, in our view is proof point that we're well placed to continue to grow and manage the economics, so our margin and fees, as momentum starts to build up, particularly going into FY '11.</p>
