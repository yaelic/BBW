          <p>Good morning.  My name is Lou Ann, and I'll be your conference facilitator today.  At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated First Quarter 2008 earnings teleconference.  Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink, CFO, Paul L. Audet, and General Counsel, Robert P. Connolly. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you.  Mr. Connolly, you may begin your conference.</p>

          <p>Good morning, everyone.  This is Bob Connolly.  I'm the General Counsel of BlackRock.  Before Larry and Paul make their remarks, I want to point out that during the course of this conference call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements.  We call to your attention the fact that BlackRock's actual results may differ from these statements.  As you know, BlackRock has filed with the SEC reports which lists some of the factors which may cause our results to differ materially from these statements.  Finally, BlackRock assumes no duty to and does not undertake to update any of these forward-looking statements.  With that, I will turn it over to Paul Audet, our Chief Financial Officer.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Our first quarter results clearly reflect two different stories.  One, very strong core business operating fundamentals but also the impact of adverse financial markets on non-operating income where we saw earnings decline by $0.12 associatively with nonoperating income as opposed to a contribution of $0.16 for the first quarter of 2007 and $0.10 for the fourth quarter of 2007.  First, let's discuss core business.  Operating income as adjusted totaled 417 million for the first quarter.  This represented an increase of 34% compared to the prior first quarter, prior year first quarter.  On a per share basis, operating earnings increased 41% to $2.02 compared with $1.43 earned in the first quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Adjusted operating margin also rose in the first quarter to 37.6% compared to 36.7% in the first quarter of '07.  These results were driven by organic AUM growth over the past 12 months which totaled 158 billion, including 35 billion of organic flows in the first quarter of 2008.  Long dated organic asset growth over the last year totaled 56 billion or approximately 6%.  Cash management assets increased over 102 billion to 349 billion at March 31, 2008.  First quarter organic growth of 35 billion was largely concentrated in cash management flows as new long dated fundings were offset by client withdrawals aimed at generating either liquidity or changed investment strategies.  Overall, AUM finished the quarter at 1.364 trillion, up 1% from December 31 to 35 billion of organic AUM growth was largely offset by the impact of declining equity markets as equity asset depreciation net of FX totaled 32 billion, or 7% of beginning AUM for equities.  Fixed income assets appreciated approximately 1% for the quarter while alternative products depreciated 1%.</p>
          <p>Larry's going to talk about pipeline, so I'm going to leave that for him to discuss.  One thing that we would like to note with respect to the first quarter, we incurred no additional charges in the first quarter on enhanced cash funds and have returned over 50% of investor capital to date.  BlackRock has not recorded nor has ever recorded any charges with respect to our money market mutual funds.  Our remaining SIV exposure complies only top tier financial institutions, all of which have been restructured or guaranteed by their sponsors.  Total SIV assets will approximate 800 million by June 30 or .2% of overall cash management AUM and we have no remaining SIVs in our 2A-7 money market mutual funds.  For the quarter, investment advisory fees were 1.13 billion, up 30% from 2007, but down 2% from the fourth quarter.  Obviously, respecting the strong year-over-year asset growth but also declining asset equity markets since year end.  Performance fees of 41.5 million for the first quarter were largely due to positive results in international institutional separate accounts which overcame our reduced forecast for fund of hedge fund performance fees.  A significant percentage of the company's performance fee products have contractual periods which concluded in the third and the fourth quarters.  Last year in 2007, 86% of our performance fees were earned in the third and fourth quarter of the year.  This represents a primary factor driving the $111 million decline in performance fees from the fourth quarter of 2007.  BlackRock Solutions continues to generate significant growth and new business volumes both on the Aladdin system as well as risk advisory assignments.</p>
          <p>First quarter revenues totaled $60 million and was up 41% year over year.  Compensation costs for the first quarter were 469 million, representing 36.1% of total revenue and included a reduction in our forecasted and expected bonus accrual rates as we generated lower than expected non-operating income.  During the quarter, we also saw good management of the expenses especially on general and administrative.  We were only up $10 million year over year and general administrative expense and all of that represents FX remeasurement changes.  For the first quarter, we actually incurred FX remeasurement costs of $8 million as compared to a $2 million income in the first quarter of last year, a 10 million differential, and we actually had 5 million of FX remeasurement gains in the fourth quarter.  This remeasurement is largely due to obviously the escalation of the Euro as it relates to both the sterling and the U.S. dollar.  For the first quarter, our effective tax rate was 35%.  That was 36% in the first quarter of 2007 and 35.4% for full-year 2007.  With respect to the nonoperating side, we have provided in our release a breakdown of where that resided but largely reflected marked-to-markets in our investment portfolio.  We right now run economic investments of about 1.4 billion.</p>
          <p>The change -- the $24 million loss-- largely reflects the fact that and it was a 57 million change year over year with respect to declining net investment income associated with higher interest expense as we raised 700 million of debt last year, approximately 13 million of net changes year over year with respect to our real estate valuations.  A little less than 25 million change year over year with respect to hedge fund and fund of fund co-investment valuations.  Approximately 10 million of which was associated with the write-off of one investment which was with respect to a fund in liquidation.  The balance of the changes were largely comprised in CDO and CDS impairments as well as other marked-to-markets on equity balances.  Clearly, this is a change from prior periods, but I would note that for the fourth quarter, our nonoperating income reflected about 2% of our overall investment portfolio on a positive basis, and in the fourth quarter, we're showing a 2% decline as against very significant market declines across the board.  With that, I will turn it over to Larry to discuss the business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone.  Thank you for chiming in.  As Paul discussed, the quarter clearly reflected two stories, I'll try to give color on both.  So let me start off with all this market turmoil, with all the tremendous changes in values in the fixed income market and the equity markets and many of the alternative markets, it was very clear to the management team of BlackRock that our model is working and working extremely well.  Having a diversified global business model has allowed us to work with clients worldwide and allowed us to work in terms of clients who are seeking solutions to balance sheet issues, and it will also -- this global model is helping us explain why-- why our pipeline is so robust, which I will discuss in a minute.</p>
          <p>Our pipeline as discussed in the -- in our release is about $106 billion, $20 billion of cash which about $15 billion of it has been funded already.  So as of this moment, our cash management, which is very volatile is back to almost the March average of about $50 billion.  We ended the quarter about $35 billion, and we just saw for preparation for tax and we saw this quarter rebalancing in cash.  We saw outflows the last few days.  So nothing disturbing and this is very customary, I think, in the first quarter in terms of what we saw.</p>
          <p>Impressively also, we have $23 billion in terms of long dated pipeline wins in our core franchise, and what we are trying to explain and I will put a little more emphasis a little later in my talk, a new category called advisory asset management and this is our position, our business in which BlackRock Solutions are working with our clients in terms of long term distributions and dispositions of positions held by different institutions. That totals now $62 billion.  Our asset mix, in my mind, has really differentiated us showing that despite a 7% decline in our equity business that we still have net asset growth.  It once again, proves to me and hopefully to all of you, that having a strong cash, strong fixed income, strong equity and strong alternative business allows us to migrate alongside with our clients, and I will describe some of the migration we saw in the first quarter a little later, and also importantly is having the strength of two distribution channels, a very strong retail channel where we at BlackRock are seeing growth in our equity retail channels in the U.S.</p>
          <p>We saw some outflows in our global equity platform so netting basically zero but our U.S. open-end platform, we saw growth in our equity platform, which is in the backdrop of the mutual fund outflows in equities, we had a very good quarter.  And then the institutional side where we are working alongside with some very, very large clients.  I should also add our RFP pipeline has never been stronger.  We have some RFPs right now that are in the tens of billions of dollars.  I'm not here to suggest that we're going to win those, but there are some very large reallocations that we are seeing from clients that we are participating in, and I will describe that a little later.  As Paul described, our operating income was 202, which in my mind is a very indication of how strong the core franchise was in the first quarter and the momentum we have going into the second quarter.</p>
          <p>This, as Paul suggested, represented about a 41% increase from a year-to-year change.  So our core business is very strong, and we are responding to these global markets that are experiencing some severe strains and difficulty.</p>
          <p>Let me go over to the flows, which are very unusual.  For the first time, we are seeing some strong outflows in fixed income going into cash.  About 50% of the outflows in fixed income were clients who were saying I need to -- I'm very uncertain about the market.  Many clients are saying, I cannot make the appropriate return owning fixed income or certainly treasuries at a 3.50, where the 10-year's approximately plus or minus a few basis points.  So more and more client were saying I can't make enough return on some of the fixed income products for the moment until I feel more comfortable, let me be in cash.</p>
          <p>We see some of those clients are going out of traditional fixed income into alternatives.  Much of our alternative growth which we had nice growth in the first quarter was in the special situations.  Our distressed mortgage fund we created a distressed debt fund that we created that was more an alternative basis, but if you look at the makeup of those alternative wins, they were very fixed income oriented.</p>
          <p>So a lot of that alternative win is how we define alternatives but the preponderance of those alternative wins are fixed income, and they're more alternative in terms of fee structure also, I should add, and so we saw some very unusual flows, and I think that will persist.  I'm not here to suggest that we're not going to see flows that are not going out of fixed income.  I think flows will go out of fixed income to liquidity and to alternatives.  What we are now trying to say to clients it is time to take on more risk and we're suggesting many clients to start looking to move away from treasury oriented strategies to more credit oriented and mortgage oriented strategies.  So we are recommending and this is why I think our pipeline RFP is so strong for clients to start relooking at how they look at fixed income.</p>
          <p>In one of our pipe line wins was a $1.3 billion win in high yield so some of our work with our clients are starting to take hold in which clients are agreeing with us that it's very hard to make any real return on owning treasury securities or being even in a core fixed income strategy.</p>
          <p>And so we're looking at -- we're working with clients to try to really look at either reoriented their positions to more credit to more mortgage strategies and in many cases, some of our clients are still looking to do long-dated liability types of strategies, too.  So they're trying to, you know, irrespective of the low interest rate environment.  Many of our clients are just saying I don't want to have a volatility and I am locking in long duration strategies where we still see some real opportunities.</p>
          <p>So our clients are confused.  Our clients have put more than huge sums of money in our liquidity business.  I don't think we are unusual in this.  The liquidity business is very robust right now.  As Paul suggested, it's important for us to note, again, that we are not experiencing any real credit issues that we're putting onto our balance sheet unlike so many other institutions, and I think so many other institutions will be reporting in the next few weeks.  We've had a very strong credit story in our liquidity business.</p>
          <p>Our team has done a very good job of navigating this, and as Paul suggested, we are very happy in which how we are trying to rapidly reduce the exposure we have with our clients in those two cash strategy funds where we froze those positions last year and we are now as Paul suggested, 50% of the monies have been returned at par to our clients and over the course and balance of this year, we believe all our clients all will receive all their money back at par.  And so this is what we're working towards.</p>
          <p>As Paul discussed, our non-operating income, obviously this is the other side of the story.  With global assets impaired and as we invest in global assets working alongside with our clients, some of our positions have been impaired.  It's a 2% loss in the overall portfolios.  Paul suggested it's the near side of a gain we had in the fourth quarter.  I will tell you very loud and clear, we continue to expect to be investing in alternatives, in real estate alongside with our customers as we roll out more strategies in the alternative space.</p>
          <p>We will be investing alongside with our clients.  And so much of that -- this is our philosophy.  This is what we're going to do.  I will also say, though, there's not a dollar of our assets that we employ for proprietary trading.  There's not a dollar of our market capitalization that we use for anything but fiduciary business with our clients, and so the impairment that we have here in our nonoperating income is all related to investing alongside with our clients in strategies.  I should also add some other issues where we've had, you know, on a mark-to-market basis some impairment.  We are a strong believer that investing in credit and mortgages is a great opportunity.</p>
          <p>Obviously it has not hit the bottom yet, and so we actually are experiencing some modest impairment in some of those strategies that we're investing in in the first quarter.  We will continue to invest in those strategies because we believe over the course of the next two years, these are going to be great opportunities to invest in in the bank loan markets, great strategy to invest in, in mortgages and other distressed areas, so you know, unfortunately, you know, we're not going to be able to call bottoms.  We're not going to be immediately investing in making huge gains, but we believe we need to start adding to those positions now and we're working very carefully with our clients and unfortunately in the first reporting period, some of those have short-term losses and in fact, our clients are calling us and asking, can they put more money in these strategies.</p>
          <p>And in some of these strategies we're closed.  So even this week, we had a client say, can we actually put more money in these strategies, and we said no, we have closed.  Obviously, we're going to announce and roll out some other products and we're pretty excited about one or two of them right now, but I think this is just part of our long-term strategy that we believe we're being paid to take on some of these risks in these product areas.  So it's important to understand the non-operating income area, it is a disappointment for me, and however, it is our strategy to continue to build our investments alongside with our clients and if the marketplace does turn itself around, obviously we are going to show some vast improvements in those areas.</p>
          <p>Let me talk about BlackRock Solutions and the BlackRock Advisory business. We are in a unique position.  We are one of a handful and I don't know who the other handful are, but it's fair to say that we are one of a handful of organizations that have a fiduciary business in this advisory side whereby we have a total separation from our investment management team in terms of understanding and working on this risk.  BlackRock Solutions now has over $7 trillion in assets that we do analytics for, and so we have a broad base of assets that we evaluate on a third party basis working with our clients.  We have this advisory team that is working with our clients, helping our clients understand their embedded risk and we're trying to work out strategies.  This is the business that's been heavily in the news with some substantial assignments, and so we are trying to create more transparency to all of you of where these assignments are and what they are.  It is fair to say these are temporary assignments, but it's also fair for me to say in many of these cases, these contracts are 5 to 10 years long.</p>
          <p>These are not temporary assignments in the terms of being a three-month assign.  These are going to be assignments that are going to take whatever it takes, up to ten years in many cases, in some cases, to work out a long-term solution.  Now, it is our hope that the market rebounds.  It is our hope that we're going to be able to work with our clients and that the portfolios are reduced in a much shorter period of time, but you know, we have no ability to predict what is going to happen in the capital markets in this time.  Obviously, by our views that I discussed about our co-investments with our clients in mortgage and credit, we do believe there will be a turnaround, and we believe during that turnaround, we will be in a liquidation mode with some of our clients in these portfolios.</p>
          <p>There are many more assignments like that that are percolating around right now.  We believe this is not going to be just a short-term business.  I believe this business will be, you know, at least an intermediate type of business.  We see and are talking to many other clients who are sitting with impaired assets, are sitting with assets that they don't have the full capacity to understand and to manage and so we are actively engaged with many other institutions right now in terms of working with them in trying to assess what they should do in this area.</p>
          <p>We are also working with many new institutions who are saying, okay, I can't afford to not have a better risk manage system and so unfortunately, for our clients who are experiencing these problems, this is all -- you know, we are working with our clients to help them put on better risk systems.  In some cases there are the Aladdin system at BlackRock and in some cases, they're using other investment systems, but I do believe the business of our Solutions business will continue to grow at very fast -- at a very fast rate.</p>
          <p>As I said in the past, this is a business that's very hard in terms of staffing.  We are aggressively recruiting and hiring, aggressively growing our people, but I must tell everyone that in the first quarter, working on these very cumbersome, very visible assignments, I saw as a CEO some extraordinary work done on behalf of the team.</p>
          <p>We saw examples of work done that I've never seen in our 20-year history at BlackRock.  We are able to work with these clients who are very visible in terms of their issues, and we've been able to work very closely with them and help them array and assessment of their risk and are working with them with a long-term plan in terms of reducing the exposure in these asset categories.  So we are quite constructive on this business.  We believe this business is going to be extremely robust for the coming months, quarters and years to come.</p>
          <p>New business mix, we continue to see, as I said earlier, very large RFPs.  In two of the cases, there are more than $10 billion in terms of assignments.  These are all long-dated assignments.  These are both in fixed income.</p>
          <p>We are very involved with many other institutions right now who are looking for opportunities to invest in credit, in mortgages and other types of distressed products, and so we believe once there is a little more stability, and I'm not sure when that will be, but once there is a little more stability, we believe there will be some large, large flows into the long-dated fixed income products that were in distress, and we believe we will be one of the firms that will be able to take advantage of those flows in those businesses.</p>
          <p>Our cash management business continues to be very strong, as I said earlier.  We've been able to avoid, you know, the good majority of credit issues.  We were very well positioned.  We continue to staff that area, too, and we continue to differentiate ourself due to the fact that we are not sitting here with any large exposures that we had in our -- in our 2a-7 products and our other cash management strategies.</p>
          <p>Our equity business continues to grow.  We continue to grow in terms of the knowledge base in the world.  At BlackRock, it's a lot more than bonds.  As I said in our domestic retail open-end fund business, we had some very good flows in our equity business.  Our global opportunity fund is going from strength to strength worldwide.</p>
          <p>It is one of the most noted mutual funds in the world right now in terms of growth. Dennis Stattman and his team have shown extraordinary abilities to navigate these global markets, and outperform in these volatile markets, and we are continuing to see some substantial flows in that product area.</p>
          <p>We are continuing to build out our equity products.  We are thrilled with the new European equity team that we have in place in the first quarter, and we expect to see flows with them.  We continue to see some great opportunities in our agricultural equity funds in our mineral and mining funds, our natural resource funds, our UK equity teams have had extraordinary performance, and we continue to be one of the dominant equity firms in that area, so we have more and more opportunities in the equity business, and we think this will continue to build more momentum in the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>So overall, I would say the platform is well positioned to handle the inquiries and solutions.  We're very well positioned in the fixed income area to take advantage when the market goes from fear and when we see a rebalancing out of treasury oriented products into more mortgage and credit oriented products.  I think I said in a speech earlier this year that I think the next bubble is U.S. treasuries.  U.S. treasuries just represent a fear security, and so we are, you know, pretty loud in terms of telling clients to try to rebalance as much as possible out of treasuries and to go into CMBS, MBS and other credit products.</p>
          <p>We continue to -- so we continue to see those opportunities in fixed income.  We can see those opportunities in equities.  And on the alternative space, we are working on some very, very large ideas in terms of working out large-scale opportunities in terms of in the distressed mortgage, the distressed credit areas that we are actively working on right now, and we hope to have something very large in the second quarter in terms of working with our clients and investing in these distressed opportunities.</p>
          <p>We also would like to just tell everyone we did have our 20th anniversary in the first quarter.  It was an extraordinary event in terms of the recognition of where this firm came from and where we are today.  I will say to everyone the momentum in the firm, the culture, the enthusiasm on a global basis has never been greater.  Our teams are one.  We talk all the time about one BlackRock, one team representing our platform.  I can tell you very loud and clear we have achieved mass in terms of the opportunities that we have representing our clients globally as a one BlackRock organization.</p>
          <p>We also will be very proud on May 1 of this year when we formally become BlackRock Worldwide in terms of our mutual fund retail platform.  We will drop the hyphenated name on April 29 this month with the hyphenated BlackRock-Merrill Lynch Advisors in Europe and Asia and in terms of our mutual funds.  And so the branding has been very successful.</p>
          <p>We have achieved scale in terms of the knowledge base of BlackRock, and we have achieved the ability to be very comfortable and excited about representing ourself globally, worldwide on May 1 as one BlackRock.  I would like to thank all the employees for all the hard work in the first quarter.  I know it's been quite stressful, and with that, I'll open it up for questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator instructions" /> Your first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot.  Just two questions here.  The first question was on the fee rate and the alternative and fixed income businesses which declined sequentially.  Has new business winched in the driver of fee reduction here, or is there anything kind of unusual in the numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Craig, what I would like to do is probably deal with you that on-line.  What I can tell you is there's two issues at work.  Fixed income, we did announce in the release a reclassification.  We did have a balance product that got reclassified on revenues in the fourth quarter between equity and fixed income incorrectly from what you would have seen in the prior release, and that is implicating the fixed income decline in rates, a good amount.</p>
          <p>The other part of that is just so everyone knows, two different factors in fixed income, a large CDO issuance Tourmaline II in the fourth quarter which added 2 million of one time origination fees in the fourth quarter and also, if you'll remember, we did reduce a lot of our ownership and through impairments of some of our CDOs in the fourth quarter as soon as we did that, we also turned off fee arrangements on a lot of the subordinated tranches of those, and that implicated fixed income revenues about 6 million, so that is the appropriate decline, but it's not necessarily anything other than those.  Alternatives is merely a factor of timing and so I think the quarter rate that you saw in the first quarter is appropriate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so that's appropriate for a forward run rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Second question was on the auction rate preferreds in the closed-end fund.  I was wondering if you could provide a little more color.  Because I'm wondering, it looks like you just refinanced about 20% of your ARP paper that's outstanding and when I look at what current needs are to refinance them, in the muni paper, it's something like yields under 4%, and you need maybe perpetual liquidity from a third party.  I'm wondering if you think, you know, with the current liquidity situation if that's maybe realistic or if there's some other type of solution?</p>
          <p>Because I know you have been mentioning in your press release yesterday a dependent option bond and also the credit put solution.  So I'm wondering if maybe you think that those type of solutions would work over the next few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are working very closely right now with institutions like your institution and a few other institutions in terms of trying to work out a solution.  We have been engaged working with the Federal Reserve and the SEC in different -- in creating different structures.  We are very sensitive to our clients in terms of who are sitting with these auction rate preferreds.  We will know if we have a solution for the entire auction rate market in the next probably week or two.  But we've been working very closely with a lot of the -- with the selling agents and the distribution agents.</p>
          <p>We believe -- this is a very difficult process.  We have two classes of shareholders and we have to be very sensitive without, you know, in helping the preferred shareholders, if we do something that harms the equity shareholders, we are in trouble.  The SEC doesn't like that, and so what we are trying to work on, as you suggested, different financing techniques in which we could help the preferred holders without impairing the equity holders, and as you suggested, the yield spread between the auction rate preferreds and where 2a-7 money market funds for munis are trading, there's a huge yield spread and so if we'd work on put strategies to make the products 2a-7 eligible and working with the regulators, we could find a solution in which both parties could win.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>By no means, not at all.  I don't think we have any, from the BlackRock side, we don't have anything that would inhibit or impair our opportunities.  The real opportunity inhibitor would be, will banks even put a LC behind this at this time.  Does it even have the capital to put on more LC or capital to offset this.  So we're not the inhibitor.  The banking system might be.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually Paul, this might be a question to start off with you.  The 1.4 billion in balance sheet investments that you have, can you just break out by type of investment what's in there, and also if you can just talk about the end of the quarter, your CDO max loss exposure, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Remaining CDO investment exposure is approximately 8 million but 5 million of that is a cash flow CDO which I would not anticipate any further impairment adjustments on.  So for all intents and purposes, we're pretty much down to nothing on our remaining CDO co-investments.</p>
          <p>With respect to the 1.4 billion, I think it would be better to go through that off-line with you because that really is our economic value.  Essentially, our total investment portfolio, as you know, runs over 2 billion, but we take out the noncontrolling interest pieces and it gets into a pretty detailed discussion, which I think is better for off-line, but and I &#x2013; and certainly, I can go over that with you later on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great, but just following on to that, if you know, if you look at private equity, it looks like some of those investments were actually written up while real estate and hedge funds were written down during the quarter.  Can you sort of just characterize performance between those two?  Was there any one particular partnership in private equity that drove the write-up? I don't know if BMI is in there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The most I can give you at this point is that you had some negative performance in private equity domestic U.S. versus some positive performance internationally.  I think that for all intents and purposes, as you well know, most private equity is a marked-to-model process, so ultimately it's not necessarily moving with the market movements in pricing, it's moving with whether or not the cash flows for the underlying portfolio investments are moving.  That would be the -- that was the one area where we didn't have quite as much movement.  The other assets is where obviously you have a lot more marked-to-market exposure because of level one and level two assets and that's why I say we should really talk about that more off-line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect.  And then Larry, in terms of timing, and I know it's hard to predict exactly when this rerisking or the reversal of the safety trade will happen, but what do you think it's going to take or what milestones or mileposts are you looking for to sort of say, you know, hey, there's more rerisking happening and you know, just what do you sort of expect on a go-forward basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're actually seeing that now.  You know, albeit small, we're seeing more and more institutions who are raising the questions.  I think almost, a good part of the RFPs we're looking at now are more risk oriented in the fixed income area.  We are working on a couple substantial assignments right now in terms of taking down large blocks of some of the distressed products.  Working with our clients right now in terms of the evaluation of this.  So we're beginning to see it.</p>
          <p>I think the -- the one-- there's two milestones that I would look for.  One is as the financial institutions end their first quarter with their new marks, you know, we believe we're as I said before, at the capitulation stage, where we believe now where the marks are occurring are closer to clearing prices now, and so we're actually seeing more movement.  I think I saw today that Deutsche just sold a big block of their bank loans on the tape today at a dollar price to the 90.  This is, you know, so we're starting to see the clearing institutions who are marking, are starting to mark in our mind closer to market or at market, and we're starting to see clearing prices occur, and so as more and more institutions starting to, I guess, capitulate and now reduce their balance sheets, I believe there's quite a bit of equity out there to invest in these products, and so you know, we believe we're at the beginning of a capitulation stage.  We believe we're at the beginning of the stage in which investors are willing to have a strong appetite to put money in these areas.</p>
          <p>And then I think the third thing that I'm looking for to really create a more stable economic environment in the United States, I believe we as a country need to find a solution to low-income housing.  The Republicans and Democrats continue to battle on what is the appropriate policy, but we need to create a new FHA housing program in which we stabilize low-income housing.  I think what the administration did in raising the loan limits for Fannie and Freddie will stabilize the jumbo mortgages up to $775,000, and so we're beginning the healing process in a lot of areas.</p>
          <p>I think monetary policy is a healing process.  Certainly what the Federal Reserve did in terms of opening the discount window is a healing process.  Now we need to see something in terms of really helping the lower income housing market and creating that stability there.  If we could do that and stabilize housing in America, we will then stabilize consumer confidence and then I think we will see obviously a big upswing in credit, probably a bigger upswing in the equity markets, and we'd see a great outflow in liquidity, but we're beginning that process now, Marc.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was wondering if you could give any more detail on the economics or the  theories I guess on the 62.5 billion of advisory assets and then talk a little bit more about where we'll see those show up optically in the P&amp;L, whether it's core fees or more other income?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will be core fees.  It will be -- I don't think we have decided are we going to show that up in the Solutions box or the -- I assume we're going to show it in our Solution box because it is the Advisory side of it so that's where it's going to show up.  So it's not, so -- our fees are very competitive, and that's all I really can say.  As you know, in one of our assignments, there may be -- it may be much more visible if there are congressional hearings on it, but our fees are very competitive in our mind and I believe you know, they're competitive in terms of the work we're doing and it's obviously a lot of work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I gotcha, I understand.  It's kind of a sensitive subject.  As far as, like the assets go, will those show up as actual flows in the different buckets, fixed income versus --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  We keep them separate.  We're going to keep them separate just to give that more transparency because if, indeed, the marketplace does improve a lot, you know, we're going to show you with clarity where those positions are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful, and then can you talk a little bit about aggregate investment performance metrics?  I think last quarter you guys had said something like 58% of fixed income funds were outperforming their comparable Lipper averages over one, three, and five years or more and then 84% for equity funds.  Do you have those kind of broad--</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have them in front of me.  I think equities I think was 70% something like that, excuse me, how much was it Sue?</p>
          <p>Over 80% in equities again.  In fixed income in the first quarter, they're actually mediocre.  They're probably right, you know, 50ish percent.  That's lower than we want.  A lot of it is because we're starting to put on more risk in some of these credit areas and you know, the only thing that did really well in the first quarter was treasuries especially in the short ended treasuries.  So we are going -- we did not have any real massive exposure there.  I can say with some of our largest, largest competitors, we did very well.  I would also identify PIMCO did a spectacular job in the first quarter, but most of our large competitors had inferior returns to us in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  That's helpful.  I was hoping to get a little bit more color on, I guess, the types of cash management products that are getting the flows, or I guess, in other words, the mix of prime funds versus government funds.  I think from the release I was able to infer that about 7 billion of the 35 billion in money fund closed were retail.  But I was hoping to get a little more color by fund type.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of it is prime institutional, and I would say of that breakage, probably about one-third or two-thirds, one-third between government related and what I would call, you know, your prime institutional, basically your taxable,occurred .  So I think somewhere around there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then the 7 billion retail, is that about right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then any areas and I think you alluded to one or two of these in your prepared remarks where you were experiencing capacity problems, such as BlackRock Solutions or otherwise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually, we're not in Solutions.  We're just very mindful of where we are in Solutions.  As I said, we have done a lot of hiring.  We continue do to a lot more hiring.  I don't want to give any indication that we are at our max in this area.  I can tell you we're working hard in this area and we have a lot of people working endless hours and it's a real tribute to the entire team.  But there's really no areas right now where we're really maxed out or capacity constrained.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  That's great.  And then just last question.  Can you talk a little bit about the balance sheet? Where cash and cash equivalents ended the quarter versus the 1.65 billion at year end and then also the outlook for capital management and share re-purchase and as part of that, can you also talk about the capacity and appetite for additional acquisitions and maybe just outlook for consolidation in the industry broadly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can do that first, and then I will let Paul go into the mix on the balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I expect to see a dramatic consolidation in the investment management business.  I believe you're going to see institutions who are struggling with low P/Es or struggling with asset quality problems who are going to look to embellish their capital through either sales of their asset management business or contributions of the asset management business.  So we -- I believe the M&amp;A market for asset management is going to be very strong.</p>
          <p>I think in terms of the alternative space, people are starting to witness obviously some setbacks, and I think people &#x2013; and I would say very clearly we are seeing from our global clients more and brand names becoming more and more important and having a financial strength is going to become more and more important.  So we believe we will have at BlackRock many M&amp;A opportunities.</p>
          <p>I will also caution you we have always had very many M&amp;A opportunities, and we've been very judicious in terms of making sure that they work culturally with our firm, working with our distribution platform.  Working with our strategic views of where growth will be in the future.  So I don't want to suggest that we will be doing a transaction any time soon.  I can suggest that we have seen -- we've had many inquiries from many institutions about opportunities in working alongside or doing something with BlackRock.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As to the other side of the equation, as you know, we don't publish a balance sheet, but what I can tell you at this point in time is traditionally in the first quarter, our cash equivalents usually show some element of decline because we paid bonuses in the first quarter which are usually much more substantial than our cash flow, but I don't think it should be a material amount.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks.  Just two follow-ups.  Most of my stuff has been answered.  I know it's early first quarter, Paul, but can you give us any sense of how the performance fee outlook is going to trend throughout the quarter?</p>
          <p>Obviously, the back half is stronger.  Any early read though how we should be thinking about it relative to last year, or is it just too early for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You answered your own question.  It really is early.  The best I can say is obviously, you know, second quarter, we will see a fall down, which we normally do.  It's our lowest product lock that we have.  We did see, and I think that one can assume that we're going to be probably a little bit less than you would have otherwise expected because I don't -- we're seeing a little bit of a southward movement in our expectations of fund to funds related performance fees, and as you probably well know, most of the fund to fund businesses were having some declines in the first quarter and that is to be expected.</p>
          <p>As to the second half, it is so much a characteristic of where the markets move over the balance part of the year.  I couldn't give you a total.  If you were to ask me, I would probably say it will be hard for us to overcome last year based on where we see markets today, whether at this point in time, I can't do any better than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair point, and then a question for Larry.  How important is confidence in the U.S. currency going to be for potential rerisking?  Because I see today the euro is setting a new high on the back of, I guess, their inflation news.  I am just wondering do you view that as one in the same as belief in the U.S. will trigger more risk taking, or that doesn't necessarily have to go hand in hand via the stronger currency?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's no question we're seeing from our global clients a greater interest in investing in nondollar assets.  We're seeing that everywhere.  And we also understand in many countries outside of the United States are experiencing extraordinary inflation.  Inflation rates, you know, in China are 8%.  The inflation rates in the Middle East are, you know, above 8%.  Because basically, they're more pegged to the dollar and so they are obviously a lot more -- they have to be a lot more confident in the type of investment they do in dollar-based assets.</p>
          <p>I can tell you in many areas in the world now, there is a great appetite or great interest let me restate that in terms of investing in the distressed area in the United States.  We did see in the tick flow yesterday that, you know, 400 bucks, $72 billion of dollar-based assets last month, so there's clearly still a lot of investing going on, but you're absolutely right.  The deterioration of the dollar is creating a lot of consternation, investing in dollar-based assets have really -- have underperformed terribly for our global investors and yet, we are still seeing huge interests in some of these special situations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  And then any broader concern around funds of funds, or any fear in regards to potential increased hedge fund regulation?  Just in light of, you know what has transpired with the broker-dealer industry, or do you feel like the strong will survive and the weak would fall off anyway?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, A, I'm a big believer that Secretary Paulsen's proposal is something everyone should look at.  We believe there is need for a global regulator in the Capital Markets.  We believe the Capital Markets has grown a lot faster than our -- than regulation.  We believe there should be a review of how one regulates everybody who is a big participant in the global capital markets and that includes private equity firms and that includes hedge funds.  So there should be a systematic review on a global basis on that.</p>
          <p>I think your point about the good are going to get better and the weak are going to get weaker, I think that's going to be the case.  We are irrespective of the setbacks in many hedge fund strategies, there are still some hedge fund strategies that did quite well and we still see a very good pipeline in clients who are looking for fund of fund strategies.  There is a view and I think it's proven to be the right case that you have less event risk in a fund of funds strategy than you do in investing in one or two hedge funds.  Obviously, if you picked the right one or two hedge funds, you have no event risk, but systematically, if you have a more diversified or systematic approach to investing in hedge funds, like a fund of funds product should, then one would expect to see increased flows and indeed, we are seeing in our pipeline and in terms of our RFPs quite a bit of interest in our fund of funds strategies.</p>

          <p>No, we closed -- we actually closed one fund in the first quarter, and so therefore, it was not a large fund indicative of the origination, cost us only about 3.5 million or so, but we did close a new fund.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay great.  And then I had a follow-up question on the -- talking a little bit about competitive environment.  Larry, you talked a little bit about relative performance recently, but are you seeing any kind of shift in the landscape and I assume that with some competitors having some weak numbers the past year or so there's in addition to yourself, and PIMCO, there's plenty of others out there clamoring to kind of break into the oligopoly.  Are you seeing a shift in the landscape in any way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I don't think there is an oligopoly anymore.  I think it's more of a myth.  What we are seeing now in the fixed income area is very akin to how the equity business became.  We're seeing more specialized mandates in fixed income than ever before.  I think the old times when you had just core strategies that were the prominent mandates, that's when the oligopoly truly was representative of the business.</p>
          <p>Today, we're seeing more and more clients who are looking more for more of a diversified portfolio approach in fixed income with much more credit strategies, tip strategies, global fixed income strategies, and so there's certainly room for a lot of specialty managers in those product areas, but I would say our large competitors and peers are benefiting also because they can go to these clients, and discuss with them not just a core strategy, but all these specialized strategies, too.</p>
          <p>So we are seeing more and more diversity in demand from clients in terms of fixed income strategies, and I believe the giant bond managers are all benefiting from that.  We are seeing certainly a much greater interest in long duration strategies, so there's certainly ample room for more investment managers in the fixed income area, but you know, I would still say the top five or six whoever they may be are winning a good shot -- a good percentage of those mandates.</p>
          <p>The areas where we continue to see will dominance at BlackRock versus other firms is in our insurance business.  You know, our number one competitor there is not a PIMCO or a WAMCO but it's Deutsche bank, so there are different, depending on the strategies, or the business product, there are different competitors.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right great.  That was it.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Bill Katz with Buckingham Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good morning.  Thank you very much. Just sort of a couple technical questions and some bigger picture ones.  Larry, you said you are angling for two sizable fixed income RFPs.  Are those in the 23 billion long-term RFP..?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, they're not.  These are RFPs.  These are not pipelines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  That's helpful.  From a rotation perspective, I guess where I'm struggling a little bit is, you had a pretty big fixed income pipeline coming into the quarter and then you had outflows coming out of the quarter and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...there seems to be a more decisive shift back to risk. Are we going to be in a situation where your legacy business could attrite that would offset the incremental shift to more of a credit centric backdrop so that at the end of the day you are not able to grow that business significantly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that certainly is a legitimate question and we certainly saw that in the first quarter.  I actually believe that it will ultimately be the opposite.  I believe once there is greater comfort, we're going to see huge flows out of cash.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Cash management.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Into these longer-dated strategies.  But in the first quarter, we had that rotation.  We had continued client outflows out of longer dated fixed income strategies to cash strategies.  We did have some rotations out of fixed income and equities as equities fell and bonds basically were stable.  So we did see that, too.  You know, so the first quarter, you know, was certainly what you described, Bill.</p>
          <p>I don't believe -- I don't believe that will remain, that will be the case in the third or fourth quarter.  It might be the same in the second quarter.  Look it, I believe it's very hard for clients with their liabilities to make any real return with a 3.50 10-year, and so they're, you know, if we persist with these lower treasury rates for a long time, you could be right if that's -- you know, but because the credit spread is so wide I think that will not be the case.  We're just going to see a much greater migration into these credit oriented strategies or other types of strategies.  They may be recategorized as alternatives, too, Bill.  Because a lot of these strategies that we're working on are fixed income oriented, but they're alternative products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You talked about that before.  So from a pricing perspective, that's my third question.  The $62.5 billion which I presume won from a recently taken over broker-dealer.  Are these things priced closer to what you gave up in the state of Florida, or more typical of the institutional fixed income legacy pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I really can't talk about it.  What I will say the Florida situation was entirely different.  To give you some color without describing what it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just a couple bigger picture questions.  If you look at the valuation of some of these alternative managers out there, they're trading at a fraction of where they went public and a sharp discount to the typical asset manager including your own multiple, are you worried in any way about the implications for the valuation of BlackRock to the extent the alternative business gets significantly bigger?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not really because what we are, you know, our alternative business is going to be -- is not in private equity.  Where most of the ones went public.  You know, it's going to be special situations and distressed debt where we are working on, you know, a strategy with our clients.  You know, our core business is continuing to grow.  The solution business is long dated a business as any business you could ever have.  So I think it's a legitimate question, but I think if anything our first quarter is a great example of how we differentiated ourself versus some of these other alternative only platforms.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just two final questions, one is, given all the capacity being taken out of some of the sort of de facto competition of the broker dealers and of the banks and structured products and other fixed income businesses, do you anticipate any compensation relief, if you will, as you look out in the second half of this year into '09 and again I think that was a pressure point in the last few years given sort of the height of the bubble on structured product, et al.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you talking about compensation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, well I have two of the employees here are listening to me.  The answer is clearly yes.  You know, our compensation will be moderating quite a bit in terms of the growth rates.  I think that's not just a New York phenomenon.  I think that's a financial industry phenomenon.  So there's no question, you know, we have -- we are a part of the financial system and when the marketplaces pay up for a lot for talent we have to be part of that.  When it's moderated like I think it will be moderated this year and the next year, I think you could see some moderation in our compensation expense.</p>
          <p>The one thing I can say, Bill, in terms of opportunities for us is it's been rumored in the marketplace in terms of downsizing at some of these institutions in terms of head count, we have a great ability in terms of hiring people as we continue to build out our businesses and so I'm pretty excited about some of the people we're interviewing right now.  It's a real positive indication of the type of people we can be attracting to BlackRock.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the final question, last quarter, you had mentioned that you were studying the ETF business in some regard and I'm sort of curious, maybe it was more from an institutional angle than a retail angle, where do you stand on that in terms of what do you think the implications are for the industry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are studying the ETF business.  Obviously, that market has stalled quite a bit which I'm quite surprised.  I thought that market would continue to grow.  You know, it's a market that we're studying.  We're studying it actually with one large player who is in the ETF business right now to see if we can do things together and we're studying it with a large distributor who we're working together in trying to create different ETF types of ideas.  It's a great product.  It's a product that obvious obviously we don't have any on our shelf, and on the other hand, like I said, we are surprised at how much it stalled in terms of the growth in the first quarter.  Which gives us an opportunity to study it and really assess it, does it make sense for us to be a part of that platform or that product?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would just like to thank everybody.  It's obviously been a quarter that we can all remember.  For good and for bad.  I think we are, as I said earlier, really well positioned for the remaining nine months of this year.  I'm pretty excited about where BlackRock has grown and the opportunities we see on a global basis and hopefully, we can transform all those opportunities into robust earnings for the remaining nine months.</p>
          <p>Everyone have a good quarter and I will be talking to you soon.  Thank you, bye-bye.</p>
