          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Nine Months 2012 Results Presentation of the Linde Group. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. Just to remind you, this conference call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>And I would now like to hand over to the Head of Investor Relations of the Linde Group, Dr. Dominik Heger. Please begin your meeting, sir, and I will be standing by.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Dominik Heger from Investor Relations. Thank you for joining our call for our results for the first nine months of 2012. For the first time, a webcast will be available. Georg Denoke, CFO and Member of the Executive Board will be hosting the call, and Professor Aldo Belloni, Member of the Executive Board will also be available for your questions.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Georg Denoke, and after his presentation, you will have the opportunity to address your questions. Georg, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. From my side also, a warm welcome to this call. I'll start my presentation with a quick summary of the performance in the first nine months. In a more challenging environment, Linde was able to increase group sales by 8.4% to &#x20AC;11.1 billion.</p>
          <p>As you know, major events in the third quarter have been the acquisition of Lincare as well as related financing and refinancing. Lincare contributed with &#x20AC;231 million sales in the reporting period. At the same time, the operating profit grew by 8.5% to &#x20AC;2.6 billion. This equals a Group margin of 23.2%, which is 10 basis points higher than in the same period of 2011. As a result of this performance, earnings per share increased by 2.6% to &#x20AC;5.15. Adjusted for the allocation of the purchase price of BOC, the earnings per share increased by 2.1% to &#x20AC;5.08.</p>
          <p>I would like to make you aware that our adjusted figures are only adjusted for the purchase price allocation of the BOC acquisition but for the Lincare acquisition. From an operational perspective, you can see that our operating profit in the Gases Division was with 27.1%, almost on the same level of last year.</p>
          <p>Excluding the impact of Lincare, we have seen the highest growth rates in the emerging markets. At our Capital Market Day, we had communicated that we have realized &#x20AC;700 million of gross cost savings through our HPO approach until the first half of this year. With this, we are already in the target range of &#x20AC;650 million to &#x20AC;800 million for the four years program ending this year.</p>
          <p>Based on the performance in the first nine months, we reinforced our outlook of growth in sales and operating profit compared to the record year 2011. I would like to use the opportunity to also inform you about the continuation of our HPO program. For the period from the 2013 to 2016, we target to achieve additional gross cost savings of &#x20AC;750 million to &#x20AC;900 million.</p>
          <p>I'll start now with a detailed look at the performance with Group sales on the next slide. Gases sales increased by 10.7% to &#x20AC;9.2 billion. As mentioned, the growth was supported by the contribution of the newly acquired U.S. homecare company, Lincare. On a comparable basis, excluding Lincare, sales grew by 3.3%. The growth was also positively impacted by start-ups of new tonnage plants and de-captivations, but also negatively impacted by one-time effects because of plant shutdowns.</p>
          <p>With &#x20AC;1.7 billion sales, the Engineering division stayed on a solid level. The order intake was dominated by orders from Asia-Pac and North America. In the third quarter, the order backlog has again increased by another &#x20AC;100 million to &#x20AC;3.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide, which shows the Group operating profit. The Gases division achieved further increase in operating profit of 10.2% to &#x20AC;2.5 billion. As already mentioned, this growth was supported by Lincare. With &#x20AC;240 million, the operating profit in the Engineering division remained stable while the operating margin stood in the reporting period at 12.3%. This is again the result of a very successful execution of individual projects. I give a more detailed picture of our Gases Division with our sales bridge on the next page.</p>
          <p>As outlined before, the underlying price and volume effect for the reporting period was 3.3%. Here, the acquisition of the Continental European homecare business contributed by $86 million of additional sales. Lincare was fully consolidated on 8th of August, 2012. Therefore, you see in the bridge the &#x20AC;231 million from Lincare which, translates in 2.7% additional sales growth.</p>
          <p>The contribution from currency effects was positive with 4.5%. This effect mainly results from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, the Australian dollar, and the British pound in the reporting period. The positive sales impact from the pass through of higher natural gas prices remained at 0.2%, as a result of mixed effects from Asia-Pac and Americas.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, you can see the comparable growth by product area, which excludes currency effects, natural gas price impacts and Lincare. In the product area, healthcare, we saw 13.3% growth. Including the contribution from Lincare, the growth rate was 38.6%. The product area, tonnage, increased by 2.3%. Excluding the impact from plants shutdowns, the increase would be 6%. And as you are aware of our activities in the joint ventures, especially in the Middle East, the growth rate including these would be 7.4%.</p>
          <p>You might remember that in the second quarter, the development was negatively impacted by plant maintenance shutdowns. Despite unplanned shutdowns in the third quarter, the growth rate has improved in a sequential quarter-on-quarter comparison.</p>
          <p>Growth in the global economy in the first nine months of 2012 was slower than in 2011. Economists are also not anticipating strong economic momentum in the remaining months of the current year. With 2.6% comparable growth in bulk and 1.6% in packaged gases in the cylinder business, this softer volume development was visible in the whole merchant business. From a sector perspective, photovoltaic, electronics and steel were rather weak whereas food and beverage as well as manufacturing supported the growth.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, I will go deeper in the details of our operating segment and start with EMEA. In Europe-Middle East-Africa, we achieved revenue growth of 5% to &#x20AC;4.5 billion. On a comparable basis, the growth was 3.6%.</p>
          <p>On the one hand, the business performance was negatively affected by unfavorable economic conditions, mainly in the south of the Euro zone. In Eastern Europe and the Middle East, on the other hand, we were able to benefit from the good economic environment. The growth in EMEA was driven by homecare and bulk. This positive homecare development was supported by the acquired Continental European operations of Air Products.</p>
          <p>To point out one investment in the EMEA, I would like to mention our new filling plant in the Baltics in Riga. In September 2012, we opened this new facility for industrial gases, medical gases and gases for the food industry. This plant will cover the rising customer demand in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia and is the most modern of its type in the Baltic region.</p>
          <p>In the next operating segment, Asia Pacific, we have realized revenue growth of 14.4% to &#x20AC;2.6 billion in the reporting period. The comparable growth increased by 4.5%. This growth was realized despite the adverse effects of unplanned plant shutdowns and the weakening demand in product areas. Within the Asia Pacific segment, the fastest business expansion was once again in the Greater China region.</p>
          <p>From a product area perspective, we have seen the strongest contribution from bulk and cylinder, but also support from de-captivations and startups of new tonnage plants. Within this operating segment, I would like to highlight our new contract with the steel producer, POSCO SS-Vina in Vietnam. We will build the largest gas operation unit in the country, in the Ba Ria area. Here, we will invest around &#x20AC;40 million to supply the tonnage customer and for surrounding merchant market in this growing region.</p>
          <p>I'll move on to the operating segment, Americas. Here, we achieved revenue growth of 20.9% to &#x20AC;2.1 billion. Of course, this dynamic growth was strongly supported by Lincare. On a comparable basis, also excluding Lincare, we saw an increase of 2.4%. Besides the growth in the healthcare segment, the solid business performance in North America was also supported by the good development of our bulk business. As a result of relatively robust demand in liquefied gasses, cylinder gasses, and healthcare, we were able to achieve steady revenue growth in South America during the reporting period.</p>
          <p>Business performance slowed due to falling growth rates in Brazil and the plant stoppage in Venezuela. An investment highlight in Americas in the third quarter was start of the construction of a new air separation unit in Lewisville. This plant will enable us to meet the growing demand from customers in the U.S. base of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas.</p>
          <p>I'll move on to the next page, the profitability of our operating segments. In EMEA, the operating profit increased by 4.1% to &#x20AC;1.3 billion. This resulted in an operating margin of 28.3%. On the positive side, the margin was supported by pricing and contributions from our HPO program. On the negative side, we have experienced a further weakening in Southern Europe with an impact on the earnings front.</p>
          <p>In Asia Pacific, the operating profit was up 9.9% to &#x20AC;697 million. This resulted in an operating margin of 26.7%. By comparing with the last year, three main factors have to be taken into account. Due to increases in the natural gas price, in opposite to the U.S. market, the higher pass through had a negative impact on the margin.</p>
          <p>Also, the continued up-front investments, which are required to grow the business and employ new staff in the rapidly expanding Asian markets, affected the margin. We already mentioned plant stoppages had an adverse impact on operating profit as well.</p>
          <p>In Americas, the operating profit rose by 28.9% to &#x20AC;522 million. At 24.3%, the operating margin exceeded the figure for the prior year figure period of 22.8%. The main reasons for the increase were pricing, volume growth, the pass through of lower natural gas prices, and the Lincare acquisition.</p>
          <p>You will see now the performance of our Engineering Division on the next slide. With significant growth in order intake and order backlog, we saw a very positive business trend in our Engineering Division. The increase in order intake by 25% was supported by a further order for equipment and gas processing plants for exploitation of shale gas reserves in North America.</p>
          <p>Year-to-date, the order intake in this relatively new segment is already around $600 million. These orders and additional project wins in tonnage in our Gases Division has contributed to increase &#x2013; to the increase of our order backlog by 8.3% to &#x20AC;3.9 billion. With this order backlog, we are back on the high level as of the end of 2010.</p>
          <p>From the plant type perspective, more than half of the order intake was related to natural gas plants and air separation plants. Based on the percentage of completion of projects, &#x20AC;1.7 billion of sales have been achieved. This is 2% below the last year's figure. The operating profit remains stable at &#x20AC;214 million. This implicates an increase of the margin to 12.3%.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide. 2012 was a year of significant investments. For that reason, let me give you a more detailed look on the development of our financial position. Since end of last year, the net debt position increased by &#x20AC;3.4 billion to &#x20AC;8.5 billion. The net debt to EBITDA ratio for the last 12 months now stands at 2.5 times.</p>
          <p>Please be aware that this is the result of the inclusion of Lincare's contribution to operating profit only on a pro-rata basis, while the acquisition financing is, of course, fully reflected in the net debt figure. In particular, the last quarter was marked by the closing and refinancing of the Lincare acquisition.</p>
          <p>Against the background of the volatile market environment, we decided to act quickly in the de-risking of the &#x20AC;3.6 billion acquisition financing. The first cornerstone was a capital increase of around &#x20AC;1.4 billion by an accelerated book building in July. With this, we got the affirmation of our A and A3 rating by Standard and Poor's and Moody's.</p>
          <p>The capital increase allowed us to reduce the acquisition facility to &#x20AC;2.2 billion. In a very successful syndication process that closed in early August, 26 national and international banks participated in the acquisition facility. In September, we turned to the capital markets to reduce the syndicated acquisition loan amount by currently slightly below &#x20AC;1 billion.</p>
          <p>Due to the excellent capital market excess, we have been able to secure very low interest rates on a long-term basis and were able to realize this with low spreads. In fact, this further supports EPS accretion to our investments in acquisitions. Around 60% of our net debt has a maturity of at least five years, and more than 85% more than one year. This underpins our long-term financing strategy.</p>
          <p>I now move onto our HPO program on the next slide. The HPO program for the years 2009 to 2012 is fully on track. As outlined earlier, we have achieved already &#x20AC;700 million of gross cost savings as of end of June this year, and therefore, we are in the target range for this four years timeframe. Of course, we plan a further contribution from the second half of 2012 as well.</p>
          <p>We will continue our effort to further standardize and optimize our processes. As an ambitious new target range for the years 2013 to 2016, we aim to achieve gross cost savings of &#x20AC;750 million to &#x20AC;900 million. We focus on the areas, supply chain management, procurement and SG&amp;A within an extended footprint as well as further standardization steps regarding the engineering and construction of our plants.</p>
          <p>I will now move on to the outlook. Despite the more challenging macro environment, we reconfirm our outlook for the year 2012. Based on the current economic forecast, our objective is still to achieve increases in Group sales and operating profit compared to last year. I have just described that with more than &#x20AC;700 million gross cost savings of our HPO initiatives for the years 2009 to 2012, we are in the target range.</p>
          <p>For the Gases Division, we expect for the financial year 2012 a slower growth rate than last year. You have seen over the last years our productivity improvement track record and we continue with this focus. Based on the project execution, our CapEx guidance for the Gases Division is around &#x20AC;1.9 billion for 2012. With this figure, we will be above our historic average of the last years of 13% CapEx sales ratio.</p>
          <p>For the Engineering Division, we anticipate sales at around the level of 2011 and an operating profit margin of at least 10%. As you know, the acquisition of Lincare altered our mid-term target. Based on the transaction, our target of adjusted return on capital employed of at least 14% is expected to be achieved in 2015.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we aim to achieve our &#x20AC;4 billion EBITDA target in 2013, which means already one year earlier. The expected growth will be supported by continuous ramp-ups out of our project pipeline. I have already outlined the continuation of our HPO program in the year 2013 to 2016.</p>
          <p>For the Gases Division, the average CapEx sales ratio shall be 13% with a plus added for potential large scale projects in the megatrend, energy and environment. Our ambition is to remain fully focused on our continued journey to becoming high-performance organization.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. We will be happy to take your questions now. Operator, please.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Mr. Stephan Kippe. Your line is open now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello, Stephan Kippe from Commerzbank. Two questions if I may. First of all with regards to Lincare, you provided us with top-line figure for Lincare in the Q3 contribution. Could you give us any sort of indication as to where the operating margins for the Lincare operations have been, maybe compared to Q3 last year or Q2 of this year?</p>
          <p>And second question in general, on a constant asset basis, how would you describe the Gases volumes have developed in a year-over-year comparison and also compared to the previous quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you, Stephan, for your questions. I think as pointed out, we have &#x20AC;231 million contribution in sales, and from a perspective of profit, this is fully in line, I think, with previous quarter. This is the indication we can give to you.</p>
          <p>On a volume perspective, I think from a perspective of where it has been active, as we pointed out, we have seen from a European perspective, Southern Europe rather weak and Eastern Europe, Middle East in a stronger economic environment. Also Nordic is holding up better than Central Europe. From a perspective of Americas, we have seen really the unplanned shutdown in Venezuela and weaker Brazil and an okay North America and strong in bulk, as I pointed out.</p>
          <p>And in Asia, we have still China being the frontrunner from a perspective year-on-year growth, and of course, we were negatively affected by the plant shutdown in Singapore, which hits us and this is in a way the combination.</p>
          <p>Australia was a little bit softer, if we compare quarter three this year to quarter three last year. The reason is also here, honestly the warmer winter in Australia compared to last year. So the LPG business was in the southern hemisphere overall a little bit softer. So that is from a perspective of the volume development, I think which we want to share with you at that point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you for your detail. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the Ms. Evgenia Molotova from Citigroup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Several question, if I may. Today, there were a lot of discussions about the actual organic growth rate for the nine months. Based on the footnote in your slide six, that you include &#x20AC;113 million of changes in consolidation in your organic growth rate. So, I just wanted to clarify, as far as I understand from the note from page 29 of the report, you include &#x20AC;86 million of Air Products into this number and the rest, is it site takeovers or is it also M&amp;A?</p>
          <p>And the second question is actually about the startups this quarter. If you could tell us how many startups did you have and which of them were takeovers? And the last one is on price and volume development in bulk and cylinders in Western Europe in Q3, if you could guide on that, it would be great? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you, Evgenia. Very detailed questions, as we are used to it from you. So, when we look into the volume development, I start with the last one. When I look into the volume development of Continental Europe, then we have to understand that the overall perspective is positive on the volume side, also it's, of course, supported by our new merchant LNG business overall in Scandinavia for example.</p>
          <p>And from a pricing perspective, it's rather neutral in RCN. And I was pointing out the effects by Continental Northern Europe. So, better North and weaker South, Central more neutral. And when you include here EMEA, then we have Eastern Europe remaining stronger and the Middle East, of course, more positive.</p>
          <p>More visible, of course, not in the top line because our big scheme for enhanced gas recovery, which is moving aggressively up is of course not top-line visible. But that's as a contribution of the share of the net income in our EBITDA number. In UK, I was not mentioning that UK pricing here was positive and also positive volume development.</p>
          <p>When we then move to your question of the comparison of the quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year comparison, I think we pointed out what the Lincare effect is. I made clear in my speech what the AP effect is from a Continental European perspective. If I carve that out, right, the year-on-year effect quarter-on-quarter is roughly 1.5%, 1.4%.</p>
          <p>The year-to-date effect is without AP 2.3%, and the quarter-on-quarter effect is positive with roughly 3.5%, including AP, it would be 3.9%. And the others are de-captivations here when you refer to the number of &#x20AC;130 million in change in consolidation, some of that is in the back-up of the page 29. So these acquisitions are small acquisitions like the acquisition mainly in Korea. These were small acquisitions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But these are de-captivations here, so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>These are acquisitions. De-captivations are here not included.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the number of start-ups this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we had around four start-ups this quarter. And we had the negative one-time effect, which I was referring to. I think this is, of course, especially from a tonnage perspective to be considered in your evaluation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Peter Clark from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Actually, a follow-on from that straightaway. On the backlog, you obviously talked about the Engineering backlog, just wondering about the Gases backlog, because you mentioned four startups. Am I right in thinking that you still have more coming on in the fourth quarter? Just wondering where the backlog stands for the Gases. I think it was &#x20AC;2.6 billion 2012 to 2015 before with the second-half weighting this year, and then rolling from there, and perhaps also the portfolio of opportunities, I think, was &#x20AC;4.3 billion at the half-year stage?</p>
          <p>And then on Lincare, again, I know you've given the number for the week's trading from August. But what I mean, just trying to pro-rata, it looks like it's still got healthy top line growth, perhaps not quite as strong as Q2, but certainly a nice high-single digit number inferred year-on-year. Just, I mean, you might not want to comment at all, but just if that's the right line of thinking, still decent growth coming through in Lincare year-on-year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I start with the overall project pipeline. I mean we did not include that slide because they are not significant or any changes honestly. So the opportunity backlog of &#x20AC;4.3 billion is still unchanged, and also there were no new wins here for 2012. So, opportunity level remains high, as order intake in Engineering was very strong.</p>
          <p>You see really here that the business development is still really the busiest business development which we had and, of course, it's also visible that we are stronger in the development of tonnage schemes than ever through our Engineering setup of course. This was always the intention that we win more tonnage schemes in the future as a synergy between gas and engineering.</p>
          <p>So from a perspective of additional ramp-ups for quarter four, I think you have to understand that Q3 is impacted by these one-time effects in especially South and East Asia, which is really pointed out here, as I mentioned it in my speech. So from this perspective, that is I think hiding the gross contribution of the new tonnage schemes.</p>
          <p>Overall, we cannot communicate yet the detailed number, I think, but there is no change. There are sometimes rollovers by a couple of weeks. And therefore, I think, I'm careful now to point out a number because it can be then January. But there is no delay, which is significant or un-normal, which we want to communicate here that no one really misunderstands me here.</p>
          <p>On the Lincare, top line I think, yes, it's a &#x2013; and as you said, it's from a currency perspective adjusted for currency, talking in U.S. dollars, it's a slight increase against quarter two as you were mentioning it.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Markus Mayer from Kepler Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On your new HPO program, can you give us an indication how much is coming from Lincare from the savings and certainly to more or less housekeeping question on the tax rate which was extremely low in the third quarter. This 2012 guidance of around 24%, this is still up-to-date? And then on financial result, you said you had higher financing costs, but due to good financial income, financial result was rather flat sequentially. Can you give us a guidance for the full year assumption here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Markus, I think we start with this last point here really on the financing result. I think what you have to adjust is a positive valuation effect due to the FX hedging in Lincare cash transaction. I would give you a number, this number would be around &#x20AC;20 million here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you compare that, it was of course very important to hedge the currency move even if this was in end not that significant, but in the two months period until or more or less two months period until closing, in the third quarter, the U.S. dollar was moving I think nearly $0.10 in its peaks and downs. So, from that perspective, we decided before we moved into the market to hedge that transaction, that is the positive valuation effect and then there were some smaller valuation effects, which we always have, but that's single digit.</p>
          <p>So, from this perspective, if you adjust that, you would have a run rate of, let's say, &#x20AC;105 million, around &#x20AC;100 million, I would say. And therefore that's also what we recommend for fourth quarter. It's very difficult to forecast, but let's say it's around &#x20AC;105 million, which I would recommend to take in financing result here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Very good.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From a perspective of tax rate, I think you were referring now to the whole tax rate of 24% for the year, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, with this very positive effect which we described here in quarter three, I think the guidance for quarter four tax rate is 24%. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>And then HPO, so as you know, the synergies for Lincare are unchanged. We communicated that from a cost perspective. So, there is no new number to which we can refer to at that point in time, but we also see that our HPO range from &#x20AC;750 million to &#x20AC;900 million has an headroom, of course, which has been including in a way also improvement in that respect, if we move through the quarters into the next years.</p>

          <p>Okay. And then maybe a follow-on on this. <mark type="ph" /> You said the same (38:25) from the savings coming from the SG&amp;A part, is this mainly the, so called, old Linde or if this in part got out of Linde and Lincare the savings which are coming from their side?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Just a few questions, if I may. First of all, I wondered if you could quantify the impact of the shutdown you had in Venezuela, in Latin America, I think that was one of the Petrobras facilities when should we think about that cycling through and coming back on again?</p>
          <p>Secondly, in terms of the cylinder business, I wondered if you might give us a flavor of what you are seeing in terms of rentals? And then finally, I wondered if you could also give us any color on the proportion of your large projects which running below take or pay levels if any? Thanks. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think from a perspective only to put that in context, when we were talking about the weakness in South America, one part was Venezuela, but the more significant part is Brazil here to put to that in context, and we don't disclose the number in that context with customer. I hope that you have understanding for that.</p>
          <p>From a perspective of the rental business, I think overall, the rental business is of course &#x2013; when we look into our numbers, its overall okay the trend. I think this is the main message really I want to give. And then, when you move into the details of course, when you move into Southern Europe, then you see, of course, there a negative effect. But overall, I think the absolute perspective is still a positive perspective, which we see against the context of the IP related, industrial production related development.</p>
          <p>Regarding your question of the proportion of take or pay in the large schemes, I hand over to Dr. Aldo Belloni.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course, this proportion of our large projects running below take or pay is depending on the industries, which are affected more or less. So, the steel industry <mark type="ph" /> is definitely is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (41:19) displaying the larger amounts of below take-or-pay, especially if the quality of the steels produced is not more sophisticated level. I think there are countries with 15% to 20% below take-or-pay measured in sales, in dollars. But of course, we're defending our contracts very rigorously and we charge the take-or-pay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. And sorry, just to add on, the final thing I wondered was you talked about four startups being in Q3. I wondered if you could give us a rough indication of how many you expect to come on in Q4? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think I answered that question in one of the previous rounds. We don't give you a number because of the cutoff date of the end of the year, and sometimes you have delays by a couple of weeks without pointing out that we have here significant delays, but we don't want to refer to a number. It's anyway complicated really if you don't talk about then the details of the scheme.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking my two questions. The numbers for the shale gas related projects and the order intake was &#x20AC;600 million. Can you give the numbers for the total backdrop, is that a similar number, because you started only winning the business nine months ago. Is there a bit more in the backlog? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question is on straight number crunching. Operating cash flow for the nine months is down 11% or &#x20AC;193 million. You've added roundabout &#x20AC;90 million EBITDA. So I include the tax, so the delta is &#x20AC;250 million of operating cash flow that are missing. I know about the Engineering prepayments. So can you explain why the operating cash flow is not following suit with the EBITDA, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think when we go through your first question of the order backlog of shale gas, I think the number is around $800 million, both were dollar number here so there is still a little bit in. And overall since quarter four 2010 in this segment, we achieved more than $1 billion as you aware of.</p>
          <p>From a cash flow perspective, I think this was your second question. Important is really to understand the details, so we have as you know the ramp-up of the final orders from gas for engineering through new gas on-site tonnage contracts, long-term contracts. This number is a very significant from an order backlog perspective, close to $1 billion of the order backlog of Engineering is related to internal orders. And when we talk about the order intake for this quarter, it's really nearly 30% of that, close to 30%, slightly below.</p>
          <p>Then the other part is the cutoff date of the quarter. I think you know that the 30th of September was a Sunday of course. So, it's not the tendency that the big customers are paying you then on Friday, they rather prefer you to pay you on Monday, that's one part. And then, and this is I think important to understand, there's an, let's say, negative operating cash flow effects from the Lincare transaction related to the transaction and that is probably then the remainder which you don't see.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Neil Tyler from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just following up or staying with the subject of cash flow, could you give us some indication of any cash flow related items that will relate to the HPO program, the continuation of that? And then also, whether we should be thinking about any short-term cost implications of higher costs to achieve those goals? And finally again on HPO, the phasing of those savings, do you expect those be reasonably evenly spread over the four year period? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Neil, thank you for your questions and we fully appreciate this question. At the current state, I think we'll need to explain to you the process which we go internally through. It's here the bottom up commitment which we received from our teams in the world, in the different regions. And of course with the budget session in front of us, we will exactly talk about all the details of the phasing. The phasing itself, I think, or the onetime cost better. The phasing itself, it's over the four years period. We wouldn't now say that there is a clear X pattern over the years in this program. This is I think not the case only to explain to you.</p>
          <p>We are continuing what we did in the past, which means further harmonization of processes in the different geographies, and this is something which we do against our current setup, right. So, we do this when we invest.</p>
          <p>From an expansion perspective or from a maintenance and repair perspective, we apply new processes when we talk about a new filling plant in Riga today, then that is of course against the new standard with the new harmonized processes from a global respective. So, that is also hand-in-hand going with the expansion of our footprint.</p>
          <p>From a procurement perspective, I think it's important that this is more really annualized number according to the size of our business. So here, we see a ramp up of further consolidation of our procurement across the globe against the material groups. And I don't want to refer today related to any cash costs related to the program, because we are not through with this.</p>
          <p>And of course, in this plan is also, for example, the introduction or the further introduction of our renovation of our IT systems, so that is something which is something which is over the year is something which is in continuation and here you already seen in 2012 a slight ramp up. So anything would be too premature at that current moment and time to disclose here cash cost numbers against the ramp up of our HPO figure.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have got a few questions, if I can. Firstly, on the Americas, your commentary is all about why the margin is up year-to-date in the Americas, yet in sequentially, Q2 to Q3, that margin was down by 160 basis points despite the commentary in your introduction sort of suggesting that Lincare was supportive of margins in the third quarter. So, I wonder if you could just comment on that dynamic, please?</p>
          <p>Secondly, if I strip out the Air Products contribution to healthcare, it looks as if healthcare organic growth slowed somewhat in the third quarter; it was about 2%, just over 2%. I wonder if you could just talk about any dynamics that might &#x2013; volume and pricing effect perhaps in the European markets that would explain that. And just sort of expanding from that, some of your competitors have talked about weakness in Southern Europe spreading towards Core Europe. You seem to be still focusing very much more on weakness in Southern Europe. I wonder if you're seeing any dynamics there.</p>
          <p>And then finally, I wonder if you could just give us some guidance on the D&amp;A number for the fourth quarter, I think, perhaps underestimated the depreciation charge, maybe because there was that extra &#x20AC;17 million impairment in Q3, but I wonder if you could just give us some guidance for the fourth quarter, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you, Peter, for your questions. I can point out again on Americas, the main deviation is really Venezuela and Brazil when you do the quarter-on-quarter comparison.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, they explain that short fall in the margin, yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From a perspective of the development of healthcare, I think my number is still a little bit higher than your 2%. So, overall, I wouldn't say that this is an extraordinary number. It is really in line with our expectations around, I would say somewhere between 3% to 4%, that would be rather my number. We had seen that in the past that has to do with some tender businesses, and therefore, it is deviating from a perspective of 4% to 5% expectations, which we do have. But nothing which is here to be pointed out. I think on your question related to weakness in Southern Europe, I think it's all about footprint.</p>
          <p>When you refer to the rest of Europe, I cannot refer to others, but I think we have seen what I pointed out very clearly in Europe at the current moment. And of course, we have seen softer volumes in some of the Continental European business, but I wouldn't say that this is something which spreads into that. It's related to mainly global trends when you look into automotive industry, when you look in some other industries. So that's a result and in the combination, but nothing which comes out of Southern Europe alone.</p>
          <p>On the depreciation, I think you made the right comment, so we have a depreciation effect which is extraordinary, the &#x20AC;17 million. That is something which you should adjust, and if you take that out, we are ramping up CapEx, I think this is the message for you, and the CapEx is then visible in depreciation.</p>
          <p>And of course, we assume as I've said in the opening comments, we assume a &#x20AC;1.9 billion CapEx figure for 2012, therefore that is something which you have to have to take into consideration. If I give you a number, then you also should understand that the depreciation is including PPA of Lincare. I think this is also important, we are not excluding the PPA number of Lincare, that is the other effect also visible a little bit in the third quarter already. So if you adjust for that, then you would find out that we're in line with our guidance and expectation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So if I were to on a net basis assume total D&amp;A charge of sort of &#x20AC;20 million higher in the fourth quarter to reflect the removal of the &#x20AC;17 million, but a ramp up of CapEx and a full quarter of Lincare, is that reasonable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's reasonable, and I think the number would be then rather &#x20AC;400 million or something like that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, good afternoon, everyone. The first two questions on shutdowns. From the number you gave during your presentation, Georg, it seems like the impact of shutdown in the third quarter was almost as high as in Q2. I just would like to know &#x2013; I understand you don't want to share with us all the details of the problems on the plant-by-plant basis, but on the best of your knowledge, what do you think will be the impact in fourth quarter with these problems continuing?</p>
          <p>And secondly, I just would like to know that with shutdowns, do you have any problems with your take or pay contracts. If there are any litigation going on with your customers that explains some of the problems continued from the second quarter. So that's the first point on shutdown.</p>
          <p>Secondly, on onsite, just for the shutdowns because you shared with us, it seems we had &#x2013; I calculate 9% underlying growth in onsite. Can you just break that out between the contribution of bolt-on acquisitions, de-captivation in one hand and the effect of ramp-up? And any indication of what you expect for the fourth quarter on contribution of bolt-on acquisitions, de-captivation and ramp-up would be very useful? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jean, are you still there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm still there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Because, we have a deadline here, so I hope that I got all what you were asking for. And I nevertheless probably don't answer all what you are asking for. But related to the perspective of quarter two, quarter three, I think we have seen the continuation of the South and East Asian shutdown. I think this is visible in Q3; therefore, Q3 is higher than Q2. This is the main effect. Then we have the effect in Venezuela, which is in comparison rather small, and then we have the turnarounds, which you normally have.</p>
          <p>So, there is nothing related to an effect, which is extraordinary on a broader basis, but there is again some operational shutdowns in South and East Asia, and therefore we haven't &#x2013; let's say, if you would adjust that, of course, it's insignificant number as I pointed out in my opening comments, and I think this is important to understand, but I cannot guide you here through the details, but some of the growth through new plants is eaten up by that. And also from a volume perspective, if I say, if you really would adjust for this, of course, the volume number would look much more impressive if you keep that in context. So, I can't give you here the details, but Q3 was slightly more significant than Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But what do you expect in Q4. I think that's a simple question for shutdowns. Do you expect the similar level of shutdowns to impact onsite in Q4 or that should go away?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my two simple questions. The first one is on HPO. Could you talk about the retention rate that we should all assume, I get in mind about anything between 30% and 50%. Given what you're going to do with that second HPO, could you tell us where we should stand on this?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on pensions and the mark-to-market, which has been again negative for your pension provision. Can you remind us what pension top-up we should be assuming for the next 12 months, both on a planned basis, but also to the best of your knowledge what incremental or exceptional pension top-up we should be modeling? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, first thank you for your questions, Laurent. I think on the HPO effect, as we always said, I think to forecast that for four years is from a retention perspective very difficult. Overall, when you compare that these programs in the market, you have seen always that in good years, you have around 50% contribution or a little bit more, and then in weaker years, you have less. That is the average figure. I leave it really to you to forecast that, because I can't forecast that, therefore we're guiding you on a gross cost savings perspective.</p>
          <p>I only want to tell you that one focus of HPO is, of course, our pricing also. So pricing has special focus is always included. This also drives then the bottom line impact of all the other gross cost savings in HPO.</p>
          <p>Overall, we have seen a more challenging environment in pricing, as you know, but I think overall, we also can say that we were not disappointed with our success in the different markets, but in some markets, of course, you cannot turn the trend through your initiatives when you look in some of the IP GDP related growth figures of country. So, the normal answer is as always, it's what we have seen from a market perspective in the past, as you said.</p>
          <p>On the pensions, I think I don't want to move any year forecast call now, it's a Q3 call. On the pensions, I think you have seen a further increase, but nevertheless an overall very, very strong performance and the increase is mainly related to the low interest rates and that is I think not a surprise.</p>
          <p>So if you say the interest rates would remain on that level, then there is no special top-up expected in the numbers. So from that perspective, I don't have a better answer for you then keep it as it is. If the interest rates will go further down, of course, you will see another negative impact, but overall, I think from an economic perspective, our performance in the pension area is a very successful one. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Norbert Barth from Baader Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Most of my questions are already asked &#x2013; answered. But still I try it on the Lincare contribution on an operating basis, if you could not give more detail on that in the report as this net profit of $20 million? And also additionally perhaps to that, if there are from the consolidation side some further one-off like inventory step up, so what we have to bear in mind for looking forward?</p>
          <p>And perhaps secondly also on the future HPO program, can you elaborate a little bit why this number is higher than the previous one, because honestly I thought little bit that it's much easier if you start such program to make cost savings, and when you continue, so especially in the charts there, the split of this increased savings in the bulk and cylinder business, perhaps you can elaborate a little bit on that, what this behind it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Norbert, I think there is no new number for Lincare. Also in this question, I have no other answer. I think it is really as I said fully in line with the previous quarters, so no surprise, otherwise we would tell you.</p>
          <p>On the HPO program perspective, I think it's a context as we said. So when you go especially into the cylinder area, into the bulk area, you also have to understand that this is the area when you take our 13% average CapEx sales ratio in context, right, then we always say half of that is for growth in tonnage and the second half is really for maintenance and repair and for distribution equipment. And the distribution equipment includes, of course, also here <mark type="ph" /> ceiling plans (1:02:59) for example and this kinds of stuff.</p>
          <p>So, when we talk about this second half, then you can say, two-thirds of the second half is related to the GDE investments, gas distribution equipment, and one-third which means from the total basis, one-sixth is related to maintenance and repair. So, that when you harmonize your footprint, which is growing, you will see by continuation of the program that we come to the renovation of additional investments in cylinder and bulk, for example, and then you have the growth in the other markets, where we will participate from.</p>
          <p>So, from this perspective, this is one part of the answer, and then as we extend the footprint overall, which supports these number. And then the additional, let's say, top-up would come out of more successful integration of our synergies through the acquisition we plan and have executed.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. John Klein from Berenberg Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. I apologize in advance if I may have been answered. I joined later. I have two questions. The first one related to the working capital development at Lincare, we've seen during the first half of 2012, particularly receivables went up pretty sharply. I heard that could have been due to auditing done by Medicare. It seems from your consolidated statements that that has come to a halt. Maybe you can give me a bit of a flavor if that will reverse, so we'll see a stronger cash inflow in Q4.</p>
          <p>Second question, if you could give a bit more flavor on the margin impact in Asia, you're saying in your report it's a mix of plant stoppages, ramp-up &#x2013; ramp-ups and a bit of a weaker market. If you could split that up a bit, what has the most negative impact on the margins in Asia? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. To your first question, John, I think on the Lincare side, they are still on the same level as in Q2 roughly, so no significant change. But of course, this is related to the administration program. And therefore, that number will go down over the quarters when you have went through these administration extra work to prove the working capital here from an administration perspective.</p>
          <p>On Asia and the margin development, it's really &#x2013; as we said, it's related to the ramp-up of our increase in the merchant business. Because for that, we want to have the application engineers into here. So we are doing a lot of new on-site investment, as you know, which also has related capacity in the market. And for that capacity, we are differentiating ourselves always through the application path in our business.</p>
          <p>So we have a lot of applications which we want to bring to Asia, which we have already in more developed countries. And from that perspective, that's visible, this is kind of sales engineering in gases which is ramping up this figure. And then we have to be diligent with our investments. And so also in the administration area, we have more entities which we have to consolidate. We have more controlling costs to do. So from this perspective, this is the second contribution.</p>
          <p>A detailed split, I can't give you. This really, as we told you on day one, we said this year is a year of dilution of margin in Asia because of this effects and, of course, on top the shutdown in South and East Asia of this scheme. But overall, it's not unexpected that we do these three investments, because we have the commitment in our CapEx number already in and we have to be careful that we deliver according to the business plans when we move now into the emerging markets.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon. Redburn in London. I just got two left actually. Firstly on your engineering order intake, is there any color on what the margin impacts would be from this extra $600 million? And one of your peers suggested that a similar kind of business will lead to margin erosion over the next few years. So interested in your perspective. And then secondly, could you just help us to understand what happened to your cost of goods sold in this quarter? Unlike most of your cost items, COGS went up 13% year-on-year, which is way out of line with the recent trend. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the order intake related to the shale gas trend in the U.S., you mean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yeah, exactly. And...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we cannot confirm that this was dilutive, and I also don't really know where you are referring to, to a competitor of the gases industry or an engineering competitor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. This was <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:08:27).</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I leave that for Aldo to point out who is <mark type="ph" /> exiting (1:08:51) this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I have to draw your attention to the very peculiar spots of Linde, which is taking care of the shale gas processing. This is our office in Tulsa, a company which is in this business since more than 35 years. I don't see any comparable entity within <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:08:54) with this operation of Linde. So I think that you are misled by this indication.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tony, the second question &#x2013; excuse me, can you repeat that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It was just a very specific question relating to your P&amp;L for this quarter. The cost of goods sold that you've reported looked to be very high year-on-year. And it was just whether this is something specific to Lincare, an accounting issue, because from what I can see, year-on-year growth through the first half was something like 5%, 6%; in Q3, it was nearly 13%? So whether that was just a one-off effect in Q3 or whether it's reoccurring?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I don't see the development, as you described the development. because the gross margin from a cost of goods sold is similar from our group's perspective. So I wouldn't say there is a special ramp-up. But we have to go into the details. I don't have an answer for you here, because I don't see the trend. Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Another question on M&amp;A. So recently, a news that you've bought the Chinese <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:10:17) gas producer and not only a small news, but can we read out of this that the consolidation of the Chinese gas market is now becoming more and more thin and that Linde's products <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:10:32) process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think from a China perspective, this is not new for us. We always want to participate also in the merchant development of this business. And here you see through some of the acquisitions and acceleration of the footprint in the smaller end of the merchant business. But I wouldn't point out now that this is a significant consolidation, which is going on at that point in time.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
