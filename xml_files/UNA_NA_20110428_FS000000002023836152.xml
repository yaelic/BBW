          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to today's Unilever Q1 2011 Results Call hosted by Jean-Marc Hu&#xEB;t and James Allison. Throughout today's conference your lines will remain on the listen-only. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I would like to remind all parties, this call is being recorded for replay purposes today. Thank you. I would now like to hand the call over the Jean-Marc Hu&#xEB;t to begin. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, and good morning and welcome to Unilever's first quarterly presentation of 2011. As you know, this is the first time Unilever has issued a trading statement rather than a full set of financial results. We are increasing our disclosure on top-line performance and will continue to comment where appropriate on any other significant developments.</p>
          <p>I will begin by reviewing our overall performance in the first quarter. I'll then give a brief update on the integration of Sara Lee before handing over to James Allison, who will review our category performance. Finally, I'll conclude with some reflections on our outlook for the rest of the year. So let's get going.</p>
          <p>First of all, I draw your attention to the usual disclaimer relating to forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures.</p>
          <p>Chart Three. Turnover for the quarter was &#x20AC;10.9 billion, up 7%. ForEx was positive by 3.1%. But the impact of ForEx in the remainder of the year will reverse if rates remain whether they are today. Underlying sales growth for the quarter was 4.3%. Volume was once again the major contributor to our growth, but for the first time in seven quarters, price was also significantly positive at 1.8%.</p>
          <p>Disposal impacts were marginally higher than acquisitions in the first quarter by 0.5%. As with ForEx, we expect this effect to reverse, particularly from around the middle of the year, when we hope to have completed the Alberto Culver acquisition.</p>
          <p>Underlying sales growth of 4.3% represents solid performance. It's the fifth consecutive quarter in which we have achieved growth broadly within our long-term target range of 4% to 6%. This is broad-based growth across all categories without exception. It is also higher than the full year growth we have achieved for the last two years, 2010 and 2009, more evidence of the consistent long-term improvement we are aiming for.</p>
          <p>Chart five, the key driver of this growth remains our strong performance in the emerging markets, which in the first quarter, represented 56% of our turnover, a new high. First quarter underlying sales growth was 9.9%, with healthy volume growth of 6.5% and price growth of 3.2%. This is a clear reflection of our ability to increase prices in emerging markets whilst continuing to grow volumes strongly.</p>
          <p>We expect, as you know, the emerging markets to drive around 75% of our growth over the long-term. With more of our business in these markets than any of our peers, this is a key reason why we believe that Unilever is the emerging markets company. Our strength and depth across these markets was demonstrated once again in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>In China, we once again achieved double-digit growth and share gains in most of our categories. In India, we continued to see performance step-up with sustained strong volume growth and judicious price increases. In South Africa, we have driven share gains and double-digit growth, performance we have not seen in that market for some time. In Indonesia, after a slow second half in 2010, our business is back on top form, with strong double-digit growth well ahead of the market. And there are many other markets where we saw growth in excess of 10%; Mexico, Argentina, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria and the Philippines, just to name a few.</p>
          <p>In these markets, our impressive portfolio of category leading positions, deep distribution capabilities and our scale provide a strong foundation for our businesses. With per capita consumptions still low, we are able to build on these foundations with market development programs that drive consistently superior growth. For all these reasons, we remain confident that the emerging market will continue to drive Unilever's growth for many years to come.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at our performance across the regions, starting with the heartland of our emerging markets strength, driven by Harish Manwani, Asia, Africa, Central and Eastern Europe. On the sixth chart strong momentum continues in AACEE. Underlying sales growth was strong at 8.9%, with positive price contributing 1.9% and the balance coming from volume. This is a good performance against a backdrop of geo-political challenges in various parts of this region. It is also broad based and consistent with all categories seeing mid to high single-digit volume growth and positive price.</p>
          <p>Our growth in the region continues to be driven by success in our market development activities. In particular the role played by our bigger, better, faster innovations in the rollout of our brands into new markets. The chart just shows a few of the many examples we have in the region, be it continued success from liquid detergents in East Asia, new launches of our fast growing Surf brand, which is well on the way to becoming our next &#x20AC;1 billion brand, or further expansion of brands such as Lifebuoy, Cif or Fruttare ice-cream in to new markets, or be it the rapid rollout of the Dove Hair Damage Repair range into more Asian markets, such as Japan or Indonesia.</p>
          <p>From a country perspective, worthy of special mention are our businesses in Africa and the Middle East, where we are saw double-digit underlying sales growth. This really is a tribute to the tenacity of our people on the ground who continue to perform ahead of their markets, despite the many challenges put in front of them by external events. The only area of relative sluggishness is Central and Eastern Europe, where markets remain difficult.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to the Americas region, driven by Dave Lewis. Here we saw underlying sales growth in the first quarter of 4.1%, of which 2.8% came from price and 1.3% from volume. In highly competitive markets, this is good performance, specifically in Latin America, where we saw very strong performances in Argentina, Chile and Mexico. Growth was also broad-based across all categories with a healthy balance between volume and price.</p>
          <p>In North America, conditions were more difficult. And underlying sales growth was marginally negative for the quarter. This is a tale of two cities, with continuing strength in personal care and more challenging conditions in our food businesses. In personal care, growth was driven by particular strength in deodorants and hair, where recent share gains continued throughout the quarter. In food, growth was held back by our spreads business, where pricing moves in response to commodity cost pressures have not yet being followed by competitors.</p>
          <p>Although some volume has been lost as a result, we do not expect these losses to persist over the longer term. Innovation highlights for the quarter include the launch of Dove for Men Care deodorants in the U.S., the Rexona Body Splash range in Latin America and the high profile launch of our Magnum Ice Cream brand into the U.S. on the 1st of March. It's too early to assess the results of this major launch, but initial signs are very promising.</p>
          <p>We also continue to work towards the completion of the Alberto Culver acquisition, which we expect to close before the end of the second quarter. We will update you in full at our half-year results with respect to Alberto Culver. Just a reminder for those not aware, this acquisition will help rebalance the portfolio in North America, but also Western Europe, and enhance, obviously, our hair portfolio globally.</p>
          <p>Now turning finally to Western Europe, where markets continue to be sluggish, and where underlying sales growth in the quarter was negative 2.7%, with the decline driven fully by volume. There were bright spots in regions such as the UK and our French business, both of which continued to prove resilient in driving growth despite tough trading conditions.</p>
          <p>Albeit against a strong comparator and difficult economic background, this clearly represents a slow start to the year. But let's keep some perspective on this, however. We are on track with our strategy for Europe. We have strengthened the organization specifically in customer development, stepped up the pace and the quality of our innovation and acted to improve the portfolio through M&amp;A. See Sara Lee as well as Alberto Culver.</p>
          <p>With respect to the quarter itself, we did lead in terms of pricing in the food categories and perhaps we are paying somewhat the price, at least in the short-term. Savoury specifically had a slow start and the pace of innovation will pick up as the year progress. And as our competitors have referenced, Easter falls well into Q2 and so should be neutral for the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>So our business in Western Europe has stabilized over the quarters and remain confident that we are taking the right actions for the long-term. The success of these actions should and will certainly be judged over periods far longer than the 90 days we have just completed.</p>
          <p>One of the key actions we are taking in Western Europe alongside driving innovation is improving the portfolio mix. One aspect of this is the acquisition of the personal care business of Sara Lee. I am pleased to report that the operational integration of the business has progressed well, with only three markets now outstanding and full transition to Unilever operational systems expected to be complete around the middle of the year. We are on track to deliver cost synergies in line with our previous guidance, which to remind you, was &#x20AC;75 million on a full year basis.</p>
          <p>Restructuring costs needed to drive these synergies will be around twice this level. It is too early to read much in to the performance of the business at this stage. But we are in encouraged by mid single-digit in the core West European businesses in the first quarter. The Netherlands, France and the Nordics were the main drivers of this good start.</p>
          <p>We are also pleased with what we are finding when we look at the brands in more detail. In some cases we see brands that are the unique positioning. However, they are brands that have not been fully exploited yet, either where they are present or further afield. Finally, we expect to complete the disposal of Sanex around the middle of the year.</p>
          <p>Now let me hand over to James, who will review our category performance in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jean-Marc, and good morning to everybody. Our category performance continues to be underpinned by bigger, better faster innovations and new market launches. As I run through our four categories, I will focus on this theme using one major example from each category. I'll emphasize in particular the use we are making of technology to differentiate our innovations more strongly and in so doing, giving better value to our consumers.</p>
          <p>Let me begin with Personal Care, now the biggest of our four categories, where underlying sales growth in the quarter was 5.3%. Performance was once again led by deodorants, but growth was consistent and broad based with skin, oral and hair also growing both volume and price in the quarter. Emerging markets once again performed strongly.</p>
          <p>In quarter one, we commenced the global relaunch of Rexona for women. This features new breakthrough technology that we call MotionSense. This formula delivers longer lasting protection than even before and involves unique microcapsules that sit on the surface of the skin. Movement by the user causes these microcapsules to break and release bursts of freshness throughout the day. Add to this a new ergonomically designed can, and we have an innovation that we expect to make a big impact in the year to come.</p>
          <p>In Home Care, underlying sales growth was 6%, with price positive for the first time in several quarters at 1.4%. Emerging markets were again at the forefront, with several key markets, including China, India, South Africa and Indonesia, all seeing strong double-digit growth.</p>
          <p>In Western Europe, performance was more subdued, particularly in the U.K. laundry business, where continued high levels of price promotion from competitors has seen us lose some short-term volume as we led prices higher.</p>
          <p>In Laundry, our technology advances are most evident in our Small and Mighty range. By helping consumers reduced both the temperature and the cycle time of their washes, we save them money and contribute to our sustainable living goals. We will continue to pursue similar initiatives throughout our Home Care range in the quarter and years ahead.</p>
          <p>Savoury Dressings and Spreads, so underlying sales growth of 2.1% in the quarter with volume slightly negative at minus 0.4%. Our business in the emerging markets continued to grow strongly, but this was offset by volume declines in parts of Western Europe and North America, where a series of price increases were implemented, particularly in Spreads.</p>
          <p>Despite the short-term challenges, we remain focused on driving growth through innovation and new market launches. For example, the Knorr baking bag concept launched in Western Europe in 2010 is being rapidly rolled out to markets in all of our regions. Recent activity has focused on Brazil and Central and Eastern Europe, with plan to launch the activity for later in the year, including new markets in Western Europe, the Americas, Africa and the Middle East. This initiative is well on the way to reaching the incremental &#x20AC;50 million level we look for in our major innovations. A good example of the speed and bias for action that is driving the new Unilever.</p>
          <p>Finally in ice cream and beverages, we saw underlying sales growth in the quarter of 4.7% with 3.2% from volume and 1.5% from price. Emerging markets again delivered strong growth particularly in ice cream, where good performance in key Southern Hemisphere markets such as South Africa and Indonesia helped to drive double-digit growth.</p>
          <p>Tea performance was more mixed, but with continuing strength in most emerging markets, partly offset by more modest performance in Western Europe and North America. An exception to this was the UK, where share gains and healthy growth have followed the launch of a major new innovation under the PG Tips brand.</p>
          <p>This makes use of new technology to modify the taste profile of tea, giving more sensations of freshness. Tea essence is extracted at source and released back into the leaves before packing, enhancing taste and allowing us to cater for different consumer preferences. This innovation has come to market as a new range from PG Tips, the fresh one, the strong one and the delicate one. Initial consumer reaction has been extremely positive and shares have recently hit a 15 year high.</p>
          <p>We also continued to take our brands into new markets. For example, in quarter one we've taken the soya beverage concept, which has proved so successful in Latin America and extended this into India under the Kissan brand.</p>
          <p>We have continued rolling out the Lifebuoy skin cleansing brand, with new launches in the West African markets of Nigeria and Ghana and we have reached more than 50 markets with Cif after recent launches in the Philippines and Algeria.</p>
          <p>With that, let me return you to Jean-Marc.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, James. I will turn to the subject that I know is top of mind for many of you, that of commodity costs. First I would like to update you on the basic facts we see them today; what level of commodity cost inflation do we expect and why? Then I will explain why I believe we are better placed to manage in this environment than we were a couple of years ago, when we last saw inflation of this scale.</p>
          <p>And finally I'll demonstrate how this cost pressure is pushing us to drive cost out of the business ever more aggressively. How the new Unilever is more agile and responsive, fit to compete even in the most challenging of conditions.</p>
          <p>In February, we indicated that we expected commodity cost inflation in 2011 of roughly 400 basis points of turnover, around 11% to 13%. At the time, Brent Crude oil was trading just a above US$100 a barrel. Three months later, Brent Crude now trades above US$120. With this impacting many of our raw and packaging materials, specifically in HPC and the Spreads business, I now expect full-year commodity cost inflation of between 500 and 550 basis points of turnover. This equates to 14% to 16% of our base commodity cost spend.</p>
          <p>In this uncertain and volatile environment, the ability to manage cost fluctuations well is critical. Since 2008, we have made significant progress in this respect and are now better able to respond quickly and decisively to ongoing volatility in commodity costs.</p>
          <p>Let me just give you a few examples of actions we have taken to drive this. We have better visibility in our exposures, with simple effective forecasting processes globally standardized for the first time, and detailed tracking of covers for our entire global commodity cost base. We are more responsive and able to adapt more quickly to change in market conditions.</p>
          <p>Improved hedging tools in a number of areas and a widening range of commodities now actively hedged, and naturally, we continue to build expertise, out accountability within a single global team. As well as being better able to manage commodity costs themselves, we are also continuing to drive more costs out of the business by leveraging scale better, by doing things more simply and by focusing on the consumer and customer.</p>
          <p>We will address the additional commodity costs through a combination of judicious pricing and accelerated saving initiatives. I am confident, we can step up our cost reduction programs further, and now expect full-year savings of around &#x20AC;1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Let me describe the actions that drive these savings in a little bit more detail. In doing so, I will concentrate on our indirect costs and our marketing costs. Since these are the areas where I am personally most involved in driving for continuous improvement.</p>
          <p>Starting with indirect costs, let me share a few examples of the many actions we are taking to drive a continuous improvement mindset throughout the business. We are redirecting and will continue to do so our resources towards the consumer and customer, with fewer support staff in the business and more of our resources now in external facing roles. This will continue.</p>
          <p>We are accelerating the globalization of key activities to ensure we fully leverage our scale. For example in procurement we have moved to global contracts in profession services such as consultancy and in areas of IT such as global networking contracts. This is just to name two examples.</p>
          <p>Importantly, we are instilling much more rigor and discipline in all that we do by standardizing our business processes to a much greater extent than hitherto. No purchase order, no pay is just one simple example, driving discipline and efficiency into routine areas of our back office operations.</p>
          <p>Indeed we are now driving more standardization and centralization in many of our systems and processes than ever before. This is enabled by our new enterprise support organization, which was only launched to 12 months ago. In addition, by the end of this year, our three regional ERP systems will cover more than 80% of our business.</p>
          <p>Finally, we are also expanding our use of agile working around the world, reducing both travel and real estate costs more rigorously. These are examples of the continuous improvements I and we are looking to drive throughout the business. Although we are closing the gap to best in class benchmark levels, there is more to do so still plenty of scope to reduce cost further, both in 2011 and in the longer term.</p>
          <p>Turning now to marketing spend, our efforts are focused on a program we call 'return on marketing investment and how to drive it'. This is a global initiative and we are starting to see significant benefits from many markets around the world. It is a great example of what Unilever can do when aligned around a clear priority action from the compass framework.</p>
          <p>We have shown this in the past with working capital, which as you know, is now negative and has been for a while and now we are starting to do the same with marketing investments. There is much to do. In practice, this program includes a wide range of actions all designed to make our brand investments both more effective and efficient.</p>
          <p>So just to mention a couple of examples, we are accelerating in the following areas. Advertising; where we are reducing non-productive spend by leveraging our scale better, duplicating workless and getting more copy on air. This allows us to hold our overall media spend and remain fully competitive.</p>
          <p>In terms of media buying, where we are taking &#x2013; where we are making more use of our scale and buying power to drive savings, or when it comes to promotional evaluation, where we are broadening our coverage and increasing the value we get from our promotional spend or artwork, where we are optimizing our approach to both reduce cost and bring new products to market quicker. This to mention a few.</p>
          <p>These indirect and marketing initiatives alongside supply chain savings, where our track record is strong, be it manufacturing excellence, logistics, SKU reductions, where there is also substantial scope, are critical components of the virtuous circle of growth that we are striving for. Success in cost reduction will allow us to reinvest more behind our innovations and new market launches, which in turn, will drive higher growth and allow us to enjoy stronger volume leverage.</p>
          <p>So to conclude, it has been a solid start to the year in an environment that continues to be challenging. Commodity cost pressure has certainly escalated, but we remain confident in our ability to steer the business through this period of volatility. Although the moving parts in our gross margin may have changed since February, the overall position has not.</p>
          <p>The higher commodity costs that we will face will be balanced by improved savings and higher pricing, so that the net-net position is broadly unchanged. As we indicated previously, with pricing lagging cost inflation, we expect underlying operating margin to be down in the first half before improving in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>We are far from complacent, but look forward to another strong year for Unilever and to take another step closer to the virtuous circle of growth. This confidence we feel in the future of our business is reflected in the decision we announced this morning to increase our next quarterly dividend payment by more than 8%.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me stress that we remain unequivocal in viewing the brands as our most important asset. Whatever the rest of this volatile year may bring, we will not take actions that could damage the health of our brands over the longer term, nor will we slow down in our pace of innovation or in our new market launches.</p>
          <p>Our long-term focus continues to be the achievement of volume growth ahead of our markets, strong cash flow and modest but steady margin expansion. And with that, let's now move to the questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question today comes from the line of Michael Steib from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. I would -- have three questions if I may please. The first one is on pricing. You both made a number of references in your remarks about having priced early and perhaps in a short-term had to pay the price I think as you put in terms of some volume share losses. Given that your comments referred to the period ending in March, have you seen any substantial changes amongst some of your competitors in terms of also starting to take pricing? In other words, has that sort of corrected to some degree since the end of the first quarter? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question related to the cost savings that Jean-Marc, that you outlined. Some of the examples that you have given us, they sound like pretty fundamental changes to the business. My question is really how quickly can these be accelerated, given that it's now the end of April, in order to offset on a full year basis the commodity cost headwinds that you are now guiding to?</p>
          <p>And then just third -- a third question in terms of your outlook statement, steady and sustainable underlying operating margin improvement. I just want to confirm that, that also includes the year 2011. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Michael. Thank you very much. Let me just start off on pricing and let me make the following comments. Obviously we can't comment on a monthly basis or so, but what we are seeing is an overall trend of more responsible behavior in the competitive environment. There are always and they will continue to be anecdotes in some of our most competitive markets where sometimes behavior is not responsible and we will act accordingly give the importance of those markets.</p>
          <p>But overall, we are seeing more responsible competitive behavior and increased pricing. I mean, let me just remind you that the commodity pressures that we face, other competitors also face and so I think that you will see this positive trend throughout the year.</p>
          <p>Importantly, with the types of investments that we've made over the last two years, &#x20AC;700 million media spend and other, we've really focused on innovation, strengthening our brands and their qualities and so we're very focused on driving price as well as volume. And that's where we gain confidence if we look at our first quarter results, specifically in our D&amp;E markets.</p>
          <p>On your second question, in terms of the cost savings, and the &#x20AC;1.3 billion, I actually think that we have a good track record if you look at the &#x20AC;1.4 billion last year and the year before that, but there is a lot of change that has taken place and that will continue to take place. Personally I will say that my impression of Unilever after 15 months is that this is not only an organization that is open to change, but is able to drive change. That's why I mentioned trade working capital, which really is a multifunctional project. And so, I think that while we don't have a control over commodity costs, our ability to respond quickly gives us really the confidence that we are much more fit to compete.</p>
          <p>In terms of your third question on operating margin, let me just make a couple of points. Overall, if I just take it to the strategic level, we aim to drive superior volume growth versus our markets, steady, modest margin expansion and strong free cash flow. We will try and strive to do this each and every year. But let me just tell you, this is a volatile market. It is only the end of April, and I think the big 'but' is, whatever happens, we will continue to invest and protect our brands in any situation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions if I may. At the full year's results, you stated that you expect around 50% of pricing of your input cost pressures. Can you confirm that that is the case with the new situation of the 500 to 550 guidance that you are highlighting now?</p>
          <p>And the second question is a little bit more granularity on Western Europe. Could you highlight for us what the market share trends are in Western Europe, and which particular categories you have seen, let's say, the impact from your early pricing? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good morning, Marco. Let me take the second one first overall. If you look at Western Europe, there are areas which we actually have performed well, be it from a country perspective, the UK and France, be it from a category perspective, ice cream and tea are categories that we've done well.</p>
          <p>Now it is just the case that specifically in the first quarter, we have raised prices more in the categories that we call win differently, so be it spreads or dressings. And there obviously in the short-term, there has been some impact on market share. But I would ask you to take a step back and just look at the market share developments over the last four to five quarters, which overall, have improved in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>On the first part of your question, in terms of what we said in the our full year results, I think it's actually a challenge to really give a precise split, given where we are in the year and indeed, we mentioned 50-50. I think the most important is it there is an important increase in commodity costs today versus where we were at the beginning of February. So instead of the 11% to 13%, we are now more towards the 15%, 16% and it will be a combination of pricing, which again, will be judicious. We will make sure that we do it for the brands where there is a real value proposition, as well as the cost savings and so it will be a mixture of both. But I think that the actual contribution you should see is a dynamic one over time. James?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just make a comment on Western Europe, Marco, in relation to the point you are making about market share? I think when you look at these numbers, the minus 2.7%, I think you need to keep in mind also here that our Savoury business in the quarter was weak. This is not associated with market share losses. This is associated with the fact that Savoury volumes overall were significantly down in the first quarter of this year versus the first quarter of this year versus the first quarter of last year, when the winter was just really much, much more severe than it was. We had a pretty mild first three months of this year and that impacted the amount of soups and sauces and meals that people were having at home to stay warm and all that sort of stuff. So really, a big chunk of this is associated with that rather than market share loss.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Clear. Any guidance with respect to the delay on Easter? I know it's difficult to quantify, but do you have any guesstimate for us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me just make one point, which is what we want to do is not sort of provide excuses for performance and that's why we like to stay with the fact that our performance in D&amp;E markets has been very resilient despite what's happened there and not calling it out. But given that you've asked the question and given that competitors have also mentioned Easter, I would expect that around &#x2013; the impact of Easter is around 100 basis points in the quarter, but there again &#x2013; and that's for Western Europe specifically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But then again, that should reverse itself in the second quarter which, is the reason why it's so important to look at over longer periods of time than just 90 days. But the impact to give you the specific answer, is 100 basis points on our West European business.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Jean-Marc, good morning James. It's Warren Ackerman here at Evolution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Three questions also, can you give us more details on your performance in North American food? Many of your peers have been saying the market is quite weak. We interested in your take in terms of what the market growth is in food in your categories, what you are doing and obviously, what's happening to market share?</p>
          <p>The second one is at the CAGE Conference, Paul Polman was talking about some weak spots like Japan, I think he mentioned Egypt and West Africa. I just wondered whether you could update us on how those regions, geographies are performing?</p>
          <p>And just finally, given the input cost guidance moving up from 400 bips to 500 to 550 bips, just interested in terms of how you are going to offset that? I take your point on the restructuring savings of &#x20AC;1.3 billion, but obviously that had been &#x20AC;1.4 billion for the last couple of years, and I think you were previously saying that you felt that you needed around 2% pricing overall for the group in 2011. Given that guidance has moved up, are you able to update us in terms of what you can achieve, that, that number needs to move up by? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Warren. Let me just take first North America, specifically the U.S. I will say just to start off that the overall trading environment in the U.S. does remain very competitive and the consumer, no surprise to you, remains very sluggish. The U.S. business is winning share. It's driven by Personal Care, and we have done some very important launches. I referred to Magnum, Dove Men for Care deos. But next to that, it is a tale of two cities, and food is challenging.</p>
          <p>Some of our competitors have not yet followed in terms of price increases in spreads or to a certain extent, ice cream, and so we have lost some short-term volume in the U.S. The overall market, I think we are defining as flat with some negative volume growth offset by price. And so, again it's not too different from Western Europe, perhaps a little bit better, but it's on the margin.</p>
          <p>So that's where we are. A little difficult on spreads, ice cream growth driven by Magnum, but on the packaged side, we still need Nestl&#xE9; and others to increase their prices to the same extent that we are doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jean, would you be able to give us a number in terms of the underlying sales growth in your foods business in the U.S. in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think -- we don't go into that type of granularity, but I think that again, that's something to talk about over a longer period of time, but it's &#x2013; it's not spectacular.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you then go to your second question about Japan, Egypt, West Africa, I think the most important obviously is the impact to our business, our people, our organization and that's obviously most important rather than the contribution to our numbers. I am personally just amazed by our ability to so quickly respond to the impact on our people, plants, contractors, third party suppliers in an area like Japan, as well as the ability under the leadership of Pier Luigi to really resource supply chain in that region, which again, I think is a demonstration of Unilever's ability to act very quickly.</p>
          <p>Obviously, there is unrest. The unrest is unprecedented, it's either natural events in New Zealand, Australia, Japan or geo-political events in North Africa. What I can say and what I said in my speech is again, such positive surprise by the resilience of our overall performance. Now it is going to impact our business. We take it into account. But I think that the business really is &#x2013; is a resilient one. And that's why we are particularly pleased with the performance that we have achieved in our developing and emerging markets.</p>
          <p>In terms of your third question about the offsetting in terms of commodity costs and the like, I think just to give a little bit more detail, the areas where we are really accelerating, Warren, is in indirects. And while, as you know, there was a good improvement of 40 basis points over 2010, I really think that there is much more that we can do. Most importantly, the whole company is engaged. This is not just a finance effort. And that's what it takes to be successful.</p>
          <p>This whole concept of continuous improvement is one that's understood and hence the repeatability of our performance. But so a lot of the acceleration will come from indirects and quite frankly, we are away from where benchmark is. So there is no reason why we shouldn't close that gap and hopefully over time, one day, create gaps as well.</p>
          <p>I would also say in media savings, there is also a real acceleration. Sometimes there is some organizational complexity which needs to be dealt with to be well-positioned, but we really are driving more efficient, more effective media investment and we are spending behind the right categories. So what I see is an organization, despite it being large and global, much quicker in being able to react to what's happening the marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jean-Marc, the reason why I asked the question is obviously back in 2008, when commodity costs were quite similar to where they are now, your average pricing was around 6%, and I remember one quarter where pricing was around 9%. Now your guidance on pricing before the change today was kind of 2%, which seems to be a bit of a disconnect to me. It seems to me, given the 500, 550 bips, even though you've got accelerated cost savings, you also perhaps need a lot more pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me just make some overall comments to this. Obviously, we are going to take pricing and let me use the word again, judicious throughout the remainder of the year, obviously driven by how commodity costs will evolve as well throughout the year. So the pricing component will be an important one as part of our overall underlying sales growth.</p>
          <p>But for us, most important is to be able to do two things at the same time. It's pricing and volume. It's too difficult today to exactly tell you technically what the contribution of one and the other is, but thematically, we want to drive pricing, and we think that we will be able to do it properly, given the innovation, given the focus on quality, in-store execution and the like, and at the same time drive volume. So we really want to do both, and that is the major difference versus two years ago.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Our next question is now from the line of Martin Deboo from Investec. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Gentlemen, good morning. It's actually a very similar question to what Warren has just asked, for I think this decision's important. Can I just sort of ask it again in a different way? Jean-Marc, I think the question is just, how do you see your margin equation evolving for the, this is not a quarterly question, this is a full-year question. As your comments just now have emphasized, to recover 500-550 bips of cost inflation from pricing alone would require pricing of more like 7% to 8%. That clearly is more than you want to put into the marketplace.</p>
          <p>You have increased the cost savings target a bit, but I suspect it's a number that probably would be reflected in lot of people's forecasts anyway. So how are we going to sort of meet the aspiration of at least modest margin progression in the likes of those moving parts? So I assume you are not going to slash A&amp;P. So how is the margin equation going to work in FY'11, the year as a whole?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me make a couple of points. Firstly, let me just take the last words that you used. Absolutely not, we are not going to slash, to use your word, A&amp;P spend. I think really important is whatever happens to the financial performance of this business over the short-term, we will continue to invest in our business behind our brands, because that's the life blood of this company.</p>
          <p>And I think that is that needs to be absolutely crystal clear, each and every time, we are going to do the right thing for the business, which is driven by our brands. And we are going to spend competitively. Now obviously, there is inflation, but why is it so important that we are driving some of these media savings? It's because we are able to reinvest back into more productive consumer-facing spend. So the first point, just to be crystal clear, we will spend competitively and whatever the situation, we will support our brands and the like.</p>
          <p>Let me make the second point. There is a phasing that will take place between the first and the second half of the year. You had questions about our ability to price up a couple quarters ago. I think that you can see in the first quarter that we are doing this and this will continue and this will have a positive impact on our overall financial performance. And what you are also seeing is that we are able to drive the volume.</p>
          <p>Having said that, commodity costs will be hitting our financial performance before the overall impact of our pricing. So there is a phasing between the first half and the second half of the year. And let me also remind you that in the first half of last year, we were still getting what we call the commodity dividend and the prices only started to increase in the second half of the year. So there is a phasing element between one year and the like.</p>
          <p>So I let you do your models, but we believe that we have different levers to drive profitable growth. It's pricing, it's volume leverage, it's supply chain within our gross margins, it's rigor and discipline around marketing investments and our indirects. As a result of that, each and every year, we will strive for, as you know, superior volume growth, steady modest margin improvement and strong free cash flow. But whatever happens, we will protect our brands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One quick supplementary on that, is your conviction on indirects reflected in the &#x20AC;1.3 billion cost saving guidance, or do you think there are further upsides to go for there in FY'11?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think if you just take out FY'11, if you believe in continuous improvement, there is always more that you can do. For me, the most important is not just hitting a number, but making sure that indirect is part of our DNA, making sure that we can do it each and every year versus just in one year specifically.</p>
          <p>What I do see is that there is so much change that has taken place at Unilever. So it hasn't started a year or two years ago, but with the launch of enterprise support, just as an example, only 12 months, we are really going to start being able to leverage the globality of our business where it's appropriate. So there is substantial scope, but my primary focus is to be able to repeat the indirects leverage each and every year.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. A couple of questions for you. The first one is on your market shares. Normally you disclose the percentage of your business, which is gaining market shares. I seem to recall it was around two-thirds last time, could you just recap on that?</p>
          <p>And the second point is on your full-year A&amp;P. I know that you said you are not going to slash A&amp;P, but certainly your language in terms of those improving advertising productivity and the like, certainly suggests to me that your A&amp;P as of a percentage sales will probably be down in the year. Can you confirm whether that will be the case, or not? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me just take the second part and ask James to answer the first part. Just, what we have said I think in the past and not too different today is the absolute levels of spend this year will be comparable to last year. So I leave you make your top line assumptions on what that means as a percentage of sales, but we think that by, with the savings initiatives taking inflation into account, that can keep us competitive and enhance our competitiveness throughout the year.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jeremy, in terms of market shares, I think we'd be saying roughly about 60% of our turnover were either gaining or maintaining our market shares. If you break it down a little bit in the developing and emerging markets, we see those growing roughly 8% to 10%. We are growing at 10%. We think we are probably growing a little bit ahead of the market.</p>
          <p>In the developed markets, probably growing slightly less than the markets. Of course these markets are more subdued, probably they are flat to 1% at best. We are down a little bit in the first quarter, thanks largely to what we have been saying about the price increases that we have been putting through, and we think that's just a short-term effect.</p>
          <p>So overall, we think we are growing probably in line with the market overall, ahead of the market somewhat, in D&amp;E, slightly down, at least on a temporary basis in the first quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Fernand de Boer from Petercam. I have two questions. One could you say something about forward buying by the retailers, because, a couple of retailers, I have read that they have been benefited from forward buying. So that should also have been positive for your volumes, for instance, in the U.S. and also in Asia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Fernando, it's really difficult for us to hear you. We want to make sure that we are hearing your question properly. Could you just &#x2013; could you-</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, can you hear better now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's far better, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry for that. Could you tell me a little bit about effect of forward buying? I read from a couple of U.S. retailers that they have been benefiting from forward buying. So that should of also helped your volumes and maybe the same for Asia? And then the second one, given your step-up in cost savings, does it also imply a step up in restructuring charges? And then maybe the last question on your better hedging, what is difficult me to understand is if you are that much better in hedging, why should that have a impact of the higher oil price, have a short-term effect and not so much in the longer term effect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me take a couple of these. In terms of better hedging, what we are actually saying is, it's actually the tools that we are applying to make sure that we can act quicker in the volatile markets. Let &#x2013; make no mistake. We are not in the business of making predictions in such a volatile market. The whole point is to be able to be agile, responsive and to actually be quick, because that's what within our control. So thank for asking the question so that we can be clearer on this.</p>
          <p>In terms of your second question on cost savings and restructurings, no change there in terms of our view on restructuring, as per what we said at the beginning of the year. So no change, otherwise we would have mentioned that today. To tell you the truth, I do not know the answer to your question about forward buying of retailers and my impression from the body language is that James doesn't know the answer either.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we see no -- we certainly haven't picked that up at all in any of our discussion with our U.S. business colleagues. So I don't think it's impacting our business at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Hi, there. Just one question. I am sorry to go back on to the cost savings but you've increased your target for cost savings from &#x20AC;1 billion to the &#x20AC;1.3 billion and at the same time, you've increased your raw material inflation guidance. Jean-Marc, you referred in your comments to the fact that it's &#x2013; part of the raw materials inflation will be offset by pricing. So the question is, are you basically saying that you're now expecting to take more pricing today for what you see for the rest of the year compared to what your expectations were at the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, Sara. That is absolutely the case. We will be taking more pricing based on where we are today throughout the remainder of the year.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much for you question. Our next question today is from the line of Charlie Mills [Credit Suisse]. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning. I think you touched on a little bit on what I  wanted to ask about. But restructuring, as I understand it, you're guiding to 50 to 100 basis points of sales in underlying terms, plus the 150 from the Sara Lee acquisition and then presumably, there's another number on top with Alberto Culver restructuring. Wanted to confirm what that was, that all of those are correct? And those are presumably gross restructuring charges, then maybe some net credits against it? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Charlie, let me take that. The 50 to 100 basis points that you refer to is the guidance that we were giving, I think, couple of years ago about the ongoing level of restructuring that we expect this business to get to. We are not there yet. We are in a very competitive and volatile time and so, we have been saying now for the last, certainly for the last year, that we expect the level of restructuring in the company to be more around 100 to 120 basis points for normal ongoing restructuring.</p>
          <p>I think we probably guided it at the Q4 results to 2011 underlying restructuring or basic restructuring at a similar level to 2010, which I recall was about 130 basis points. On top of that, I think we have separated out the restructuring that is required for major acquisitions. And in that respect, we have called out and I think Jean-Marc has referred to it already this morning, that as far as Sara Lee is concerned, we expect to be able to drive cost synergies of around &#x20AC;75 million out of a business of something of the order of &#x20AC;500 million of turnover.</p>
          <p>That is going to require restructuring in total of the order of about &#x20AC;150 million. Probably &#x20AC;110 million, &#x20AC;120 million of that will fall in 2011, Charlie. So that's what we'd like you to put into your model for that. As far as Alberto Culver is concerned, clearly we want to complete that. Jean-Marc has indicated that we expect to do that before the end of the quarter. Then of course, we will get on with looking for the cost synergies in that businesses, as well as welcoming those fantastic new brands to our portfolio. And we will guide more at the half one point, Charlie, about the amount of restructuring that you should expect to see relating to Alberto Culver.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Our next question is from the line of Chris Wickham from Matrix. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you. Just going back to some of the specifics in here, I mean, where we have got this sort of weakness in volume and Western Europe and in particular, on the Savoury dressings and spread side. I mean, you've been quite clear that you don't want to see any major disposals in some of these certain areas, on the grounds that you firmly believe you can run these businesses better than other people could. But does that not mean we might be seeing an acceleration in overall initiative and a major sort of changes in some of those businesses or are we expecting just sort of business as usual over the next two to three quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me make a couple of points. The first one is that you know we are now in a position where we are on our front foot. And as a result, we are hoping that our financial performance today, we'll see an actual net contribution from M&amp;A rather than simply just disposing of businesses, because we want to grow the business, obviously, organically more importantly than M&amp;A, which we've always defined and continue to do so from a bolt-on perspective.</p>
          <p>If you take specifically some of our performance, I think that James described the slow start to Savoury, which is no reason whatsoever to come to any strategic conclusion. In actual fact, Savoury is one of our win globally categories and plays a very, very important role in our portfolio. You know, some of the brands like Knorr and others, which is really one of the strengths within our brands.</p>
          <p>When it comes to spreads, which in Singapore, Mike Polk defined as a win differently, it is about winning. But it's about emphasizing quality and taste and having a really effective organization. And those are the areas of focus that we're applying to that business and believe that this business within our ownership will be more valuable over time. So there is a lot of work to do, but just based on a quarter performance, no reason whatsoever to come to any conclusion.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Christopher, if I may so, I just want to make a point about the way in which pricing and volume has been working in these developed markets of ours. So we have been taking pricing, as we've been saying. But please bear in mind that when you do that, you do in a number of retailers, lose the opportunity to promote. That kind of exacerbates the volume impact that you see in the short-term.</p>
          <p>In areas where we have taken pricing previously, such as spreads in the UK, where we have already taken pricing during the course of 2010, in the first quarter of this year we saw excellent volume growth and excellent underlying price growth. So I just want you to keep that in mind when you are looking at the overall impact in terms of volume and price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And our last question today is from the line of James Edwardes Jones from Espirito Santo. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, morning guys, two quick questions, if I may. First, you mentioned you took the lead on pricing in food in Europe. And yet, your pricing in Western Europe was only up 0.1%. Can you sort of reconcile those two facts? And secondly, it's very clear that the business is operating at two levels. There is a fast growth developing market HPC business and the pretty moribund developed market business. And Paul Polman has been there 2.5 years, you, Jean-Marc, have been there over a year now I guess. Is it time to start reconsidering whether to spread the business out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just take the second one, because it's very clear that that's absolutely not the case. I think that the way we look at our business and to tell you the truth, it is not a question of Food or HPC. It's very much the categories in which we win globally. It's the categories where we want to win differently. And as a result, the historical definition of Food and HPC really does not count.</p>
          <p>Let me also make a second point that if you look at our developing and emerging markets business, there is absolute room and there is absolute opportunity and today, there is a lot of very good performance through some of our food categories. And so, if I take Brazil or India or Indonesia, there are lots of non-HPC categories that are really growing very, very well, and so, very important part.</p>
          <p>Now, also as you know, given our ambitions of doubling our turnover, this is also a very, very important ambition for all our different categories. So please bear in mind, as a result of that, the question that you ask is absolutely not on the table, and to tell you the truth, not relevant.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the pricing in Western Europe, indeed the underlying price growth is stable. But don't forget the pricing within the quarter as well as the trend if you look over the last two to three quarters. And when we are talking about leading on pricing, we are specifically talking about businesses such as spreads where again, there is much more exposure from a commodity cost perspective than there are from others.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So with that, let me thank you all for your questions and your engagement this morning. Just in terms of closing comments, as you've seen in the first quarter, we have continued to deliver solid growth. In fact this is the fifth quarter in a row where we have been broadly within our target range of 4% to 6%. We've been leading price increases in number categories as we've mentioned and we are seeing pricing starting to contribute to our growth again.</p>
          <p>Volumes are holding up, especially in the emerging markets. 6.5% volume growth in these markets is clearly strong performance. Innovation continues to be the key driver of our performance and we will see the pace quicken through the year, specifically in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>Our priorities remain the same; volume growth ahead of our markets, steady and sustainable improvement in underlying operating margin and strong cash flow.</p>
          <p>With that, I wish you all a good day. And for those of you listening in the UK, enjoy the royal wedding tomorrow and the long weekend ahead. Thank you very much.</p>
