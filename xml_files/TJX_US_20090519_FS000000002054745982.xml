        <plist>
          <p>Joining me on the call today with Sherry are Jeff Naylor and Ernie Herrman. We're going to start this call by having Jeff take you through our first quarter results, then I will share with you my thoughts on our first quarter performance, our outlook for the second quarter and our long-term view.</p>
          <p>Big picture, I am very pleased with our performance in these difficult times and the additional opportunities we're seeing as a result of the downturn from which we believe we will benefit in the long term. However, times are still uncertain and you're going to hear that we are remaining extremely deliberate in our approach and cautious about our near-term outlook. We'll get into more details about the second quarter, but in addition to continuing challenge &#x2013; the challenging environment, our comparisons to last year do not become easier until later in the year. We believe the right thing to do is to plan and run the business with conservative assumptions, as we did this past quarter, and strive to beat our plan.</p>
          <p>First, here's Jeff to recap the numbers for the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everybody. So I'll be recapping the first quarter results on a continuing-operation basis. So in the first quarter, net sales were $4.35 billion. That was up 1% over last year. Our consolidated comp store sales were up 2%, and that was on top of a 2% increase last year and it was also significantly above our plan.</p>
          <p>Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.49. That's up 11% over the $0.44 we reported last year. I should point out, however, that last year's results included a $0.02 per share benefit from FIN 48 tax adjustments. So excluding this benefit from last year's EPS, our numbers were up 17% over the adjusted $0.42 last year.</p>
          <p>The 17% adjusted EPS growth was achieved despite several items that impact the comparability of results and adversely impacted first quarter this year. First of all, foreign currency translation negatively impacted this year's results by $0.02 per share, which was about $0.01 more than we had planned. Second, marking our inventory-related hedges to market at the end of the quarter reduced EPS this year by $0.02 per share compared to a $0.01 per share reduction to EPS last year. And finally, results this year were adversely impacted by about $0.01 per share due to one-time costs related to our expense reduction initiatives.</p>
          <p>Consolidated pre-tax profit margin on a reported basis was 7.8%. That's up 90 basis points over last year due to strong merchandise margins and solid expense control, but partially offset by the restructuring costs and the mark-to-market hedge adjustment. And I'll provide some further detail on how this breaks out later in the call.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax profit margins increased significantly at all divisions, with the exception of Winners, whose merchandise margins were adversely impacted by sourcing, over half its merchandise, in more expensive U.S. dollars. You'll recall that we discussed this on our February call, and I will also provide more detail on Winners later today.</p>
          <p>The gross profit margin was up 90 basis points during the quarter. Merchandise margins were up 110 basis points over prior year, which was better than we expected, but was partially offset by the mark-to-market adjustment I just mentioned.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A costs were flat versus last year as a percentage of sales, and SG&amp;A dollar spending was slightly favorable to plan despite the above-plan sales, and that was due to our cost reduction efforts.</p>
          <p>In terms of inventories, at the end of the first quarter, consolidated inventories on a per-store basis were down 4%. We're entering the second quarter with fewer dollars committed forward than at this time last year on a per-store basis.  This includes the warehouses, the stores and the merchandise that we have on order.</p>
          <p>So now, let me turn the call back to Carol, and I'll recap our second quarter guidance at the end of the call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeff. It's great to be able to report such a strong first quarter, especially in such extraordinary tough times. The overarching message that I'd like you to take away from today's call is that our strategies for conservative approach in 2009 are working well. By planning conservative comps, keeping inventories lean and reducing costs, all with an extreme focus on execution, we delivered above-plan results in a very difficult retail environment. We will continue to stick to our knitting and proceed with the same strategies that just delivered strong results for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>On our year-end call, we outlined the three major strategies of our conservative approach to the business for weathering the difficult environment. Today, I'm going to tell you that how those major strategies led to our strong first quarter results.</p>
          <p>First, planning comp sales conservatively truly worked well. We planned our business around in an assumption of a 2% to 4% consolidated comp sales decrease, and by significantly exceeding this plan, drove excellent flow-through to the bottom line, achieving an adjusted EPS growth of 17% despite adverse currency impacts and one-time restructuring costs.</p>
          <p>Second, by running the business with very lean inventories in order to turn faster and increase merchandise margin, we topped our expectations by increasing merchandise margins by 110 basis points.</p>
          <p>Third, we are continuing with our aggressive cost cutting initiatives of $150 million for the year. At the end of the first quarter, we are on-track with our plan and we are also seeing expense savings flowing through to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>With great values and merchandise initiatives, customer traffic in the first quarter was up more than it was in the first quarter at virtually all of our brands as we continue to gain market share. Clearly, our value proposition is attracting and resonating with our customers. I've said it before and I'll say it again; we believe that value is key whether the economy is weak or strong, and our job is to deliver value beyond compare every day to our customers.</p>
          <p>I'd like to highlight some of the first quarter results. Marmaxx had the most profitable quarter, not its most profitable first quarter, but its most profitable quarter in its history, with segment profit up 19%, driven by very strong merchandise margins and terrific expense control.</p>
          <p>HomeGoods profit grew 75%, and they delivered a strong segment margin of 4%, up significantly over the prior year.</p>
          <p>With a 12% comp sales increase at A.J. Wright, they delivered $4 million in profit, more than it had cumulatively made in its entire history.</p>
          <p>Winners significantly beat its plan. Excluding the mark-to-market adjustment, Winners offset much of the negative currency impact on its merchandise margin through better buying and delivering even more expense savings than we had expected.</p>
          <p>T.K. Maxx generated a strong 6% comp overall, and in the UK and Ireland, more than doubled its profit, dramatically improving the profitability of the overall European business. Including our investment in Germany and HomeSense, TJX Europe delivered an over 190 basis point increase in its segment profit over last year.</p>
          <p>I also want to reiterate that while we have a short-term strategy in place to manage through these difficult times, we believe that our future growth opportunities are tremendous. The seeds we've planted are working, and I'm convinced that those seeds will only grow stronger in the future. I remain firm in my belief that with solid strategies and execution, we will emerge from this recession as an even stronger company. We will not get ahead of ourselves, however, and as always, we'll be very methodical in our approach.</p>
          <p>Now, let me share with you some additional details on how our strategies are working in this environment. First, as I've just mentioned, planning comps at lower levels enables us to drive more flow-through to the bottom line, as we exceed our plan. Let me highlight just a few of the ways we're driving sales.</p>
          <p>We're delivering extreme value to our stores every day, which is clearly being noticed by our customers. We are managing the business with much leaner inventories and buying very close to need. Fresh fashion at compelling prices are flowing through our stores faster than ever, and this is also helping to drive traffic. In strong and weak times, we see ourselves as a shopping destination for both moderate and high-end brands at low-end prices.</p>
          <p>Our strategy to shift our purchase dollars to the right categories and initiatives in order to drive sales is also working. We continue to be pleased with The CUBE, our junior department at Marshalls, and we are opening many new vendors in this category which is benefiting both T.J. Maxx and Marshalls. The performance of juniors at Marmaxx in the first quarter was phenomenal, as we bring in young customers for the future.</p>
          <p>Another category call-out is dresses, which continues to post outstanding comps throughout our divisions. Footwear also continued to outperform. We've also flexed more dollars into children's, which typically does better in economic downturns, and that has definitely been paying off. We are testing several new ideas, which we believe will also help drive sales to the back of the year.</p>
          <p>Lastly, on sales drivers, I told you on our last call how excited I am about our new marketing campaign. And by now, I assume most of you have seen what I'm talking about. For the first time ever, we are advertising T.J. Maxx and Marshalls together in the same TV spot. Our intervention campaign positions both brands as the better way to shop for great fashions, great brands in incredible value. This new network campaign is hitting markets that have never seen our brands on TV before, and we believe will attract even more new customers.</p>
          <p>Clearly, we are also getting more bang for our advertising buck with this dual-branding. We have tested our dual-branding strategy with very positive results, but as always, we will continue to solicit customer feedback, fine-tune and make our campaign even stronger. We have done a lot of work over the last several years to differentiate the shopping experience at T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, which has given the consumer plenty of reasons to shop both brands. This is a great time to attract new customers and gain share as the retail landscape is changing so dramatically.</p>
          <p>Second, in addition to driving traffic, our running the business with very lean inventories led to fast returns and stronger merchandise margins. We began the first quarter with more inventory liquidity and greater open-to-buy than I can remember, which for our buyers mean sweatier palms as they chase goods and buy even closer to need. Better buying and faster inventory turns, merchandise margins were significantly up for all divisions in the first quarter, with the exception of Winners, which while down year-on-year was significantly above-plan and we'll discuss this later in more detail.</p>
          <p>Third, we're on-track with our cost reduction plans and we're already seeing the bottom line benefits. We continue to be confident in our ability to reduce expenses by $150 million in 2009.</p>
          <p>Moving on, I want to emphasize that while we're taking a cautious approach during this recession, our vision to grow TJX as a global off-price value retailer is unwavering. I truly believe that with the right strategies in place, we will come out of the recession with an even greater competitive edge. We are taking advantage of opportunities that this environment presents, and as I've mentioned, are continuing to plant seeds for the future.</p>
          <p>First, the consolidation in the retail sector offers great opportunities for our businesses. We continue to gain market share and are growing our customer base for the future through our great value. With customer traffic up and average basket down, even a slight increase in the consumer spending should be very meaningful to our business. As we have discussed, we have found in the past recessions that once customers discover us, they tend to stick with us when times improve because they love our value.</p>
          <p>We've seen updated analyst estimates of bankruptcies and store closures to-date across apparel and home fashion retailers will result in approximately 1,300 closed stores and nearly $11 billion market share opportunity in the U.S. While consumer demand has decreased meaningfully, fewer players in the retail landscape bodes well for TJX as we play in both higher-end and lower demographics.</p>
          <p>We believe that this is also true for HomeGoods, which just delivered its strongest first quarter performance ever. HomeGoods has regained its footing with a better mix and flow, sharper value and improved in-store merchandising. In addition to better execution at HomeGoods, we believe that much of the consolidation in retail will happen in the home arena, which should provide HomeGoods a stronger competitive position.</p>
          <p>In terms of sourcing, the tough environment continues to open more and more vendor doors to us, growing our already-vast vendor universe. We are still being asked if there will be enough products for us to buy when the department stores bring their inventories in line as we get to the holiday season. So once again, I will say it as plainly as I can; availability is never a concern for us. Even when the marketplace becomes more disciplined, there is always more products available to us than we would want or could ever buy. To understand the magnitude of what we are talking about, in the first quarter alone, we opened more than 600 new vendor doors and that was just at Marmaxx and HomeGoods alone.</p>
          <p>We've tried many ways to explain this, but it's very important to understand that we have 500 buyers all over the world. We take a global tactical approach, sourcing from well over 10,000 vendors in 60 countries, moving and placing buyers in the most advantageous locations, as the dynamics of the markets change. It's also crucial to understand that once a vendor door is open, it typically stays open over time as we establish long-term mutually-beneficial relationships with our vendors.</p>
          <p>As we indicated on our year-end call, one of the biggest opportunities for the future from this downturn is the real estate market. We continue to see very advantageous deals for opening new stores, renegotiating leases and relocating stores to better locations. At the beginning of the year, we said that we had 65 net store openings planned and we were keeping our capital powder dry for great deals as they came to us. To update you on where we are with store openings, we now expect to open between 80 and 85 stores this year, net of closings, 15 to 20 more than we had initially planned. The additional stores are primarily in Europe as well as Marmaxx and allow us to take advantage of terrific real estate opportunities.</p>
          <p>Now, moving to our growth vehicles, which continued to perform well despite the weak retail climate. The strong performance of our newer and younger concepts is very promising to the long-term growth potential of our company. In the U.S., A.J. Wright delivered outstanding performance in the first quarter. A.J. Wright is executing extremely well, as its concept continues to gain traction. Store contribution levels continue to move up, which gives us confidence in this division's ability to achieve its long-term segment profit targets. Our store openings in Atlanta, our new A.J. market, were strong. We are very encouraged by A.J. Wright and continue to believe that the U.S. will ultimately support 500 or more A.J. Wright stores.</p>
          <p>Our test of our Shoe Megashop by Marshalls in the U.S. and STYLESENSE in Canada, our standalone shoe and accessory concept, continues to generate excellent customer response. We had strong opening for an additional Shoe Megashop by Marshalls during the quarter. If these concepts continue to be successful, we will have a real long-term growth opportunity here in the U.S. as well as in Canada.</p>
          <p>In Europe, our younger concept continues to significantly outperform our expectations in a difficult retail environment, just as they did throughout 2008. In Germany, our T.K. Maxx stores are achieving sales productivity levels that are comparable to the average of our existing stores in the UK, as virtually all German stores are exceeding our expectations. We are also seeing strong year-over-year results in stores that have been opened for more than a year.</p>
          <p>With these strong results, as I've just mentioned, we are increasing our store growth for the year. We now expect to have 15 stores in Germany this year, five more than the original plan. We believe our business in Germany will achieve profitability towards the end of calendar 2010.</p>
          <p>We also plan on opening three stores in Poland in the back half of this year. After a tremendous amount of research, we believe that a merchandise mix that combines what we have in Germany and the UK would resonate extremely well for the customers in Poland. We are taking a regional approach to expansion in Europe, as the stores that we are opening in Poland are very close to several of our stores in Germany. We believe the demand for great values, as well as the advantageous real estate deals in Poland, provide a really solid platform upon which to grow further in Europe. We will start slowly as we always do and continue to evaluate as we go forward.</p>
          <p>We are also very pleased with our new HomeSense business in the UK With the ongoing consolidation in the retail sector in the UK, we are seeing excellent real estate opportunities which are allowing us to open HomeSense stores in very good locations with extremely good terms. Both T.K. Maxx in Germany and HomeSense in the UK have improved their bottom lines and exceeded our expectations. Long term, we see T.K. Maxx growing to 250 to 300 stores in Germany, and HomeSense growing to 100 to 150 stores in the UK</p>
          <p>I believe that we have significant growth potential in our U.S. concepts and international expansion. There is no question in my mind that TJX is benefiting from being an international company and will continue to do so in the long term. We are very pleased with what we are seeing in our European businesses, but I reiterate that we will continue to proceed very carefully and methodically with growth.</p>
          <p>Now, let me move to our financial strength, which continues to be critically important in today's world. We will continue to manage our strong balance sheet and cash position to preserve our flexibility. Cash continues to be a big part of our story. We entered the first quarter with a balance of $1 billion. This includes $375 million we borrowed to refinance our convertible notes, which we plan to use to buy back the shares that were issued to the convertible noteholders earlier in May. Returning excess cash to shareholders remains a priority that we are balancing with preserving cash liquidity in these economic times.</p>
          <p>In terms of share repurchases, we bought back approximately $43 million of TJX stock during the first quarter. We're retiring 1.6 million shares. It continues to be our plan to buy back approximately $250 million of TJX stock in 2009 in addition to the $375 million to buy back the shares that converted for approximately $625 million in total. As we've said before, we may adjust this amount up or down depending on the environment. In addition, we increased the per share dividend by 9%, which is the 13th consecutive year of a dividend increase.</p>
          <p>I want to take a moment to mention that our strong financials continue to stack up well against our peers. In the recent Fortune 500 rankings, TJX ranked 131, one place higher than last year. In terms of financial ratio, among all Fortune 500 companies, we ranked number 34 in return on assets, number 28 in return on equity and 94 for 10-year EPS compounded annual growth rate.</p>
          <p>Moving to our outlook for the second quarter, although off to a good start in May, we believe it's prudent to remain cautious as the economic environment continues to be challenging and uncertain. We also want to remind you of the tough comparisons we have to last year's second quarter. First, it is our strongest quarter of the last year in terms of sales and earnings growth, and we are up against three consecutive years of strong second quarter comps.</p>
          <p>We also have difficult year-on-year hurdles in terms of the impact of foreign exchange, which will ease up late in the third quarter. We will continue to plan conservatively, while at the same time we will certainly take actions to drive sales and profitability beyond our planned level. We are planning EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.43 to $0.49 compared with $0.48 per share last year. We are planning comp sales to be flat to down 2% on a consolidated basis and at The Marmaxx Group. Jeff will provide more details in a moment.</p>
          <p>So in closing, let me say again that I'm very pleased with our first quarter performance. I believe that our prudent approach to 2009 is working and helping us do what we said we would do, which is to protect the bottom line. We will continue to plan comps conservatively, run with extremely tight inventories and significantly reduce costs. We will also continue to take actions to drive sales beyond our conservative expectations, which to the extent we are successful will drive more profitability as we did in the first quarter. It remains our financial strategy to manage our substantial cash flow and liquidity and to maintain our flexibility.</p>
          <p>We'll balance our financial strengths with the opportunities that we have in today's environment. We will pursue opportunities with a paramount focus on return on investments that takes full advantage of today's environment for the future. In other words, seize the day. Even more exciting, our growth vehicles are working in the face of challenging times, and I believe that growing this company in the U.S. and internationally have great advantages.</p>
          <p>We believe that TJX, a nearly $20 billion company today, when carefully and intelligently executed, has tremendous growth opportunities for the future. I'm confident that the strategies that we have in place are the right ones. And that with keen focus on solid execution, we are in an excellent position to be even stronger competitively when times improve. I truly believe that our great value equation plays well today, in the future, and in many countries across the globe.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll turn the call back to Jeff, to go through further details on the first quarter and our plans for the second quarter, and then we'll be happy to open it up for questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, Carol. Before moving to guidance, I wanted to take a moment to run through some first quarter items. First, let me give you some detail on the impact of currency overall and how it impacted our Winners business. Overall, currency translation and mark-to-market adjustments had a $0.04 per share negative impact on EPS in the first quarter this year, and that would compare to last year's $0.01 per share negative impact. So the take-away here is that Q1's 17% EPS growth was achieved despite some pretty significant currency headwinds which we won't anniversary until late &#x2013; very late, actually, in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>The mark-to-market adjustment on our inventory-related hedges also impacted our pre-tax margin in the first quarter. So while we reported a 90 basis point improvement, it would have been 110 basis points excluding the mark-to-market.</p>
          <p>Secondly, foreign currency translation and the mark-to-market adjustments significantly impacted the reported Canadian numbers. If you look at the segment tables that we've attached to the press release, you'll see that we reported a decline of $21 million in Winners' segment profit. This would have been only a $3 million decline if we exclude the impact of foreign currency translation and the mark-to-market adjustment. So when we look at it in local currency, we're close to having flat profit year-on-year in our Canadian business.</p>
          <p>Similarly, we reported a 370 basis point decline in Winners' segment profit margin, but this would have been down 130 basis points if we exclude these currency items. And the profit decline in our Canadian business is much less than we had planned, as the team at Winners is doing an excellent job of mitigating the cost of goods sold impact of the weaker Canadian dollar by buying better and generating above-plan expense reductions.</p>
          <p>I should note that we've provided a schedule detailing the impact of currency on TJX consolidated results, as well as the results of Winners and T.K. Maxx. That's on our website, and we'd encourage you to look at it because I think it's helpful to understanding and interpreting the results.</p>
          <p>The second item I wanted to cover is pre-tax margins and the components of the year-over-year change. Pre-tax margins for the first quarter were 7.8%, up 90 basis points over the prior year. This breaks down as follows. Merchandise margins were up 110 basis points, partially offset by the 20 basis point negative impact on the mark-to-market adjustment. SG&amp;A expense was flat, but it's levered by 10 basis points on the 2% comp excluding the restructuring costs. So we actually got leverage on G&amp;A if you back out the one-time restructuring costs that we had in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally, I wanted to briefly discuss the refinancing of the convertible bonds. In early April, we completed a $375 million debt offering and exercised our option to redeem the convertible notes. Since then, the debt, which should have an accretive value of approximately $365 million, was converted into 15.1 million shares of TJX stock. Now, this doesn't impact EPS as these shares have always been included in our calculation. And we're now in the process of repurchasing these shares in the open market and we'll now use the $375 million of proceeds from the debt offering to do so.</p>
          <p>At current stock prices, we would expect to buy back approximately 13.5 million of the 15.1 million shares that were issued, and the deal should be approximately $0.02 to $0.03 accretive to EPS on an annualized basis, which was not included in our original plans for the year. The benefit of the reduced share count more than offsets the approximately $19 million of incremental interest expense on the new debt.</p>
          <p>So now, let me turn to second quarter guidance. For the second quarter, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.43 to $0.49 versus $0.48 per share last year. You'll see from our comp store sales guidance that we expect the economic and retail environment to continue to be difficult.</p>
          <p>So, the assumptions: we're assuming a second quarter top line of $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion, with comp sales plan flat to down 2% on both the consolidated basis and also at The Marmaxx Group. It's important to note that while the first quarter was up against an average comp increase of 1% over the past three years, the second quarter is up against an average 3% comp increase for the same period. So the comparisons get meaningfully more difficult in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>For the month of May, we're planning an increase of 3% to 4% on a consolidated basis and also at Marmaxx. We're anticipating a 3% to 5% decrease in June and a 1% to 3% decrease in July, both for TJX and for Marmaxx. It's important to note that we believe June will be our most difficult month, as we're up against a very strong 5% consolidated comp last year and an average consolidated comp of 4% over the past three years.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax margins for the second quarter are planned in the 6.9% to 7.7% range. That's down 50 to up 30 basis points over the prior year.</p>
          <p>We are anticipating second quarter gross profit margin in the area of 24.3% to 24.8% compared to 24.3% last year, and SG&amp;A as a percent of sales to be about 17% to 17.2% compared to 16.8% last year. We expect SG&amp;A to delever in the second quarter due to the flat to negative 2% comp store sales we're planning, as well as the impact of the lower average ticket on cost ratios.</p>
          <p>It's important to note that we've taken actions to deliver the $150 million of cost savings and are on-track to meet this expectation.</p>
          <p>Finally, for modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.4% and net interest expense in the $7 million to $9 million range.</p>
          <p>So, we'll now turn the call back to Elon for questions, and we'd ask you &#x2013; to keep the call on schedule, we'd like you to limit your questions to one per person. So thank you, and we'll now open it up.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And congrats, everyone. I guess maybe to Jeff or Carol, just Marmaxx was significantly better than we thought. Maybe you could just break out how the 140 basis point margin improvement sort of broke out between merchandise margins or leverage and expense savings? And then maybe, just Carol, maybe update us on your intermediate sort of opportunities for segment margins in the younger divisions? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, margins were very strong, and it was really split between markdown and markup. And Jeff, do you want to go through some of the costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, the bottom line is we had a comp, up 1%. Ordinarily, you'd expect on a 1% comp increase to see deleverage. And in fact, we saw &#x2013; the merchandise margin was up significantly. It represents most of that 140 basis point increase, Brian. We also got a little bit of leverage from expenses, which speaks to the cost reduction efforts that we have in place. But I think if you look overall, being up 140 basis points, the lion share of that is merchandise margin, as Carol mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Brian, in terms of the other divisions, really, across-the-board, everyone had significant increase in merchandise margin and in pre-tax, with the exception of Winners due to the currency issue. But if you look at the UK, in terms of &#x2013; in addition to the investment, they were up 190 basis points. HomeGoods has had a spectacular quarter, and they were up pre-tax 153. And A.J., which &#x2013; a very, very strong comp, tremendous, again, pre-tax, over 300% increase. So we're really across-the-board. I'm very, very pleased with the execution of all the divisions.</p>

          <p>On the quarter as well. On the regional trends, can you tell us what you're seeing in California these past couple of quarters and in Florida specifically, and just what's happening there, if you could <mark type="ph" /> add in (34:21) Texas as well? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Texas has been pretty good for awhile. So we haven't seen &#x2013; we've seen a pretty positive trend there. And Florida is definitely starting to come back. So the trend last year was softening in Florida, and we're starting to see some increases there. And California is very slowly increasing. So the whole southwest region is getting a little bit stronger, but we are definitely seeing some improvements and that is over weaker comp.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Thanks, guys. One question on the spread at Marmaxx, it looks like it's a little bit larger than it has been in prior quarters. Is there anything that you could speak to there that might help explain that? And I'm talking of the spread between comps and total sales increase. And then, second, Jeff, I don't know if there is a way that you can give us a sense of the real estate deals that are getting presented to you today. Any way that you can frame that for us, maybe in terms of what you're seeing on a cost per foot versus what you've saw in previous years? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of the spread, I'm going to have to look into that, because when we look at Marmaxx's comp, it was up 1%. And if I look at the square footage growth &#x2013; quickly finding that here &#x2013; if I look at the square footage growth for Marmaxx, it's up in that 2% to 3% range. So, I don't think there's anything really going on. I mean, the store growth, that would be benefiting this year from stores we opened last year, was really no different. I think, Jeff (sic) [Paul] (36:14), we're going to have to take that one offline and just pull the numbers apart a little bit, because I'm not seeing the same thing.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think &#x2013; and in terms of real estate, you can see we're &#x2013; we've committed to opening more stores. We've got more in Europe than we have in the U.S., because frankly we've seen rates come down more quickly in Europe than they've come down in the U.S., so that's where we're putting the incremental capital at this point. And I would tell you over the last couple of monthly real estate cycles, we're beginning to see those rates come down in the U.S. But I'd rather not get into specifics in terms of dollars per foot.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. My congratulations, too, really on a great quarter. A question, I think, really, first for Jeff. The $150 million of cost savings, just so we're clear, that you're on-track to hit for the year in SG&amp;A, would we expect to see total SG&amp;A reported for the company down by that amount on a year-over-year basis, with most of the benefit coming in Q3 and Q4? And my follow-up, really, is with respect &#x2013; it's a little qualitative. Looking back at our notes, you talked about &#x2013; when you gave guidance before, I think it was back in April, it was really based on a, "deep recession continuing" and I'm just wondering, I mean, you've talked about it this morning, but would you characterize that kind of guidance to be using the same kind of language? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of &#x2013; why don't I take SG&amp;A? So in terms of SG&amp;A, no, you can't just take the &#x2013; assume it would be down by $150 million because baseline costs are up and we're also seeing increases in pension expense, employee medical benefits, et cetera. So what we said at the &#x2013; in our guidance, John, was that we would expect expenses to be essentially flat year-on-year, the total SG&amp;A...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (38:44) but actually down in Q3 and Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I would not be planning it down in Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now, I think the way to think about it is, and we're not providing guidance for the full year, but we said we thought that SG&amp;A would be flat for the year. Remember, that was based on a negative comp. So as we beat sales, we actually spend more in SG&amp;A in the stores because we have incremental people in the stores, and so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (39:14) that with payroll, those incremental transactions, so you have the interchange fees, supplies, et cetera. So there will be some costs that will go up. SG&amp;A will go up as we generate more sales. That's a good thing. In the first quarter, we had 10 basis points of leverage on a 2% comp, with our cost savings partially in. I think as we look at the second quarter and going forward, we would expect to see &#x2013; continue to see leverage at a 2% comp. But we're not going to see a $150 million drop in our SG&amp;A. A portion of that hits buying and occupancy, which is in gross profit, and obviously we have also cost increases across the whole cost structure but particularly some significant increases in pension and benefits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. And then, the follow-up on the language.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the other thing that you've got to consider, too, is we are running with lower retail, so that does put more units through the system in terms of cost structure. Yeah, deep recession, obviously, our first quarter was stronger. We planned a down 2% to down 4%, and obviously, we beat that with an up 2%, which is a positive trend which I can't say I'm not excited about. And we went into this year with a lot of questions. So I don't think we have the answer to the deep recession. We're just going to take one quarter at a time. I think we're planning Q2 prudently, and I think it's a very rational estimate. And I think we're going to take one quarter at a time and see what the back half yields.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. One quick one for Jeff, and then one for Carol. On foreign exchange, Jeff, can you tell us what your assumption is baked into that second quarter guidance? And then for Carol, I'm wondering if you could talk about some of the drivers that really have begun to accelerate the sales trend at A.J. Wright?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, the guidance, we're looking at it versus our plan for the year, Jeff. We set our plan based on currency rates that were in place when we began the year, which for the Canadian dollar was in the low $0.80s and the British pound was around &#x2013; sort of the mid-$1, around $1.50. So, those would be the rates that will be implied by the guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But on a cents per share basis, Jeff, for Q2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Q2, with translation, they'll have a $0.02 negative impact versus OI. These are all versus OI, Jeff. So translation is costing us $0.02. The mark-to-market, which hit us in the first quarter, we flipped &#x2013; it reverses, so we'll end up with $0.02 of positive EPS from mark-to-market, so those two essentially cancel out. I should also mention though, in sort of for calling those out, the interest and tax rate also cost us in the second quarter, $0.01 a piece. So translation cost us $0.02, mark-to-market benefits us by $0.02, and interest and tax each cost us $0.01 in the second quarter as you think of it this year versus last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the trends at A.J. Wright, Carol?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jeff, well, I talked about it before. We've had some pretty positive trends for several quarters now. And I think the big take-aways here are that we're really understanding the customer. Obviously, we're building on a stronger year. And we have a strong team in place, that all our top-level team as well as the next tier down has really been in place now year-over-year. We brought in a very strong head of stores. So, we've got a great team in place. We have figured out how to market to this customer. We're running leaner inventories. And the core is working, which we said we're focusing on basics and shoes, accessories, juniors and kids, and there are several other areas that we have opportunity in. But the transactions are very, very strong at A.J. Wright, and really they're continuing to execute extremely well.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. And I'll add my congratulations as well. My question is on the balance sheet. Jeff, you've got $742 million in current debt. I know that you've indicated the contingent convertible was converted in early May, so I'm assuming that piece goes away by the end of the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the other two pieces, the $200 million note due in December and the Canadian $235 million credit facility due in January of 2010, is your intention to pay these off, roll these over, or could you give us some sort of visibility into that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, you've just laid out the three components of the current installments of long-term debt, Kimberly. It's the convertibles and it's the &#x2013; those &#x2013; the $200 million in bonds that matures in December and then the $200 million roughly in Canadian debt that matures in January. On those latter two maturities, so we've already refinanced the convertible. Our intent would be to refinance those other two pieces of debt. We are managing our cash as if the markets will be closed to us, and I think we'll make judgments on that as we go through the year in terms of what happens in the credit markets and just how loose it is. But our intent, while we've set ourselves up in our plan and given ourselves the amount of liquidity and financial flexibility to pay them down, we would intend to refinance them at this point.</p>

          <p>With A.J. Wright performing better, I think it had its first profit in the first quarter, and obviously with the real estate opportunities, maybe, unprecedented at the moment, when do you think you'll start to ratchet up the growth to get better scale there? And then secondly, the UK business, which is now more than $2 billion, if you look at the rest of Europe where you're going into Poland, what do you think the revenue opportunity there is for the entire continent outside of the UK? Do you think it's as big or bigger than the UK based on your analysis? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>First of all, A.J. Wright, we have a very, I'll say, very pleasant situation today in that we have really all of our chains doing well. And in terms of the real estate, Todd, we're balancing, again, the best deal and the best place. So although today, A.J. Wright, we're feeling great about and we're feeling great about it for the future, we have to balance the real estate opportunity there versus the UK versus Marmaxx. So I think we're just taking one deal at a time and making the absolute best deal, and obviously, that's what we set aside that capital for. So we don't have any plans to suddenly go an additional 50 stores, that's for sure, and I don't think that's the smart way to do it. We've done things like that in the past, and we don't want to repeat them. So we will be careful and we'll be prudent. But again, we're trying very hard to make the best deal and sit tight. And the few times where we did that, where if we made moves six months ago, we would have regretted them, and we're pretty happy with the results of them today. So there's no fast-growth plan in place today to accelerate to a great degree.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, we have to balance the portfolio. We will probably next year increase our store count above the 85 mark. But to lay it out by division is probably not the right thing to do today, but we're out there very aggressively looking at deals.</p>
          <p>In terms of the UK, the opportunity is huge. Germany alone, just a number of people, we put out there, it's up to 350 stores. We are testing Poland with three stores. We're not going to put numbers out there, but it's a population of 42 million. And again, one step at a time, but we think Europe has tremendous potential, and we're understanding more and we're understanding how to go into new countries. So it's very, very exciting. And we're leveraging the European structure that they have really put in place over a year ago. And what's very &#x2013; what's tremendous in terms of the structure is that now that group has been in place for a little bit over a year now. So we're starting to really leverage the scale.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Congratulations. Carol, just a few questions...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Adrianne.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Carol. A few questions as it relates to near-term comps. I appreciate the conservatism as you head into Q2. It sounds like May is off to a strong start. But have you ever quantified what the stimulus did for you last year and how we should think about lapping that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We really haven't, Adrianne. We're really looking at the three-year trends from Q1, and we've taken the same trend into Q2 with a little bit of margin upside. But no, we haven't.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, because it does seem like the deterioration &#x2013; for May to June, it would seem like part of that was the stimulus anniversary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, June was &#x2013; we had a 5% comp last June.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we've had several years in a row of strong comps. So again, we were just taking the trend and we were &#x2013; obviously, we're into the second week of May and we understand May a little bit better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just two questions. As it relates to inventory, as you mentioned, made it very clear, availability is not an issue. But I'm just wondering, we're all hearing all the department stores ratcheting down inventory and being much cleaner. Is there &#x2013; understanding that clearly, you're still &#x2013; the availability of goods is out there. But is there any change in strategy in terms of how much you're buying in-season versus upfront buying in light of the fact that it does seem to be much cleaner this year versus last year? Any change in terms of how you plan your inventory?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not really. What we do plan and we do very strategic about is where our people are in terms of sourcing and looking at it by category. But we intend to be wide open. We're very &#x2013; we feel very strong that there'll be plenty of availability in the back half. And clean inventories are not bad for us because, again, it gives us a tremendous advantage in terms of our value against the rest of the world, so it's not a bad thing for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the offshoot of that, in terms of cleaner inventory, are you seeing a much more rational pricing environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've seen &#x2013; you know what, Adrianne, we have probably the most promotional environment in December and we weathered very well. So again, it's that matter of the degree to where we are versus everyone else, and we think we can more than sustain that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, just a last question as it relates to HomeGoods. We're seeing clear improvement there, and I think in part some of the consolidation opportunity. But give us a report card in terms of where you think we are in terms of the progress there. It seems as if there were some initiatives underway. Where we are, where you see continued opportunity in that division? And maybe following on to that, the dual branding you're seeing, the success of TJX and Marshalls in terms of the advertising together, any thoughts perhaps over time adding HomeGoods to that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, HomeGoods, I did speak on the last call that I did feel that a big part of the home business was the external environment, but also a part of it was our execution. And I think the guys there are doing just an absolutely phenomenal job. I think we have changed our way to approach the customer in terms of the store, in terms of the marketing. We are running with much leaner inventories. We have much more focused markets in terms of Florida and California and the Northeast. And most importantly, I think their values are tremendous and I think that they are really understanding the way to drive the business. So I think a big chunk of this is execution. So we're pretty excited about what's going on with HomeGoods and it's obviously showing in the numbers.</p>
          <p>In terms of the dual branding, I'm not planning on adding HomeGoods to the mix. As always, we look at something new that we're doing, and we want to measure it over time. We want to see if it works. If it doesn't work, what it means to the consumer. I think we've differentiated Marshalls and Maxx extremely well, and they're two very big brands. So we've got a huge campaign to work on right now, and then we'll see what we want to do in terms of other strategies for the future.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, guys. I have seen your ads, and I'm encouraged to see your steps into the network realm. I'm wondering how much it's going to cost and how much we should expect both in terms of cost and in terms of &#x2013; I guess, penetration over the next three quarters. Will it continue &#x2013; will it continue at the same rate we've seen, and what kind of impact that will have to SG&amp;A?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. While we have a year's strategy with it and we are covering about 35% of the market that never received TV before. And we are doing this combination of dual branding and individual branding, which is laid out through the rest of the year. We told you before that we would be leveraging the marketing costs, which we are, and we did a lot of testing last year. And I think the bottom line is we're just getting a bigger bang for our buck. So, we're not planning on accelerating our marketing budget. We're planning on pretty much staying on plan, and we're very happy with what we're seeing. And we have laid out our back-half numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we said on the year-end call, Richard, that the advertising spending would be down year-on-year, but we're still spending at a rate greater than what it was three years ago. And as Carol said, we're obviously getting leverage given the way we're approaching this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, you wanted to go back to Paul?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I want to go back to Paul Lejuez's question. I have enough information here to be able do some calculations offline. So what Paul is referring to is we had a 5% increase in the sales at Marmaxx. Ordinarily, you would have expected less than that on a 1% comp. Typically, on a 1% comp with about 3% square footage growth, you would have expected 4% sales increase. We have 5%. And the difference is all in layaway. We adjust layaway sales out of our numbers. And clearly, we had a lower level of layaway this year than we have last year, so we were adjusting more dollars out last year than we are this year, which is leading to about a point of incremental growth. So, that's what's driving that delta. So hopefully, I've answered Paul's question and we don't need to take it offline. I think we can go back to questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Hofkin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, very nice quarter. The &#x2013; I guess, thinking back to the general framework that you provided on the year-end call for hypothetically if you had a flat comp, you could, I think, do earnings including FX of around $1.90 to $1.95. And I'm just wondering, obviously, given the first quarter upside relative to your plan, should we be thinking about the balance of the year similarly to how you would have thought about it a few months ago or would you be thinking about it at a higher level than you would have at that time. And I guess to that point also, can you update us on your current CapEx and free cash flow thoughts for all of 2009 given the little bit of ramp up in store growth? And I guess I just wanted a little more clarification on how you're defining merchandise margin. Is it strictly sales minus cost of sales and you're saying that that was up overall about 110 basis points? Or is that &#x2013; I just want to make sure I'm thinking about that the right way. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So I'll take them one at a time. On EPS, Daniel, we recorded &#x2013; I'll kind of walk through the quarters. We recorded $0.49 in the first quarter against $0.42 last year, so we'd be up $0.07 through Q1, right? On Q2, we said if we did a flat comp in Q2 we'd generate $0.49. That's the high-end of our guidance. So if you take flat EPS on a flat comp, it would give you $0.49 in the second quarter. And then for the balance of the year, if we have flat comps then generate flat EPS, it would be $0.57 in the third quarter and $0.46 ex the 53rd week in the fourth quarter. So if we just look at the balance of the year, Q2, Q3, Q4, if we run a flat comp, we generate the numbers I just gave you and we'd be at $2.01.</p>
          <p>We haven't updated &#x2013; we've provided updated guidance on Q2. So we're now saying at a flat comp, we would generate a slight increase year-on-year, $0.49 versus $0.48 last year. But we're not at this point really prepared to say anything about the back half and probably won't until the second quarter call. So hopefully, that's clear. And every comp point &#x2013; on a full year basis, every comp point continues to be worth $0.08, so that's the sensitivity that people can plug into their models.</p>
          <p>In terms of CapEx, with the new stores &#x2013; I'm glad you asked &#x2013; we would expect CapEx to be $450 million to $475 million. Before, we'd said $450 million. So we think that'll be up slightly versus the prior guidance that we gave you. And in terms of the cash forecast, with the higher CapEx, we'd probably be closer to the lower end of the range. We said our range was to generate $500 million to $600 million before any debt retirements and after the buyback and the dividend. So we would now expect to be closer to the &#x2013; nearer to the low-end of that given incremental CapEx.</p>
          <p>And then in terms of merchandise margin, it's really a pure merchandise margin. We report gross profit on our P&amp;L, which includes buying and occupancy costs. However, when we talk about merchandise margin on these calls and in our public filings, that really represents mark-on, less markdowns, less freight expense and less shrink. So it's pretty much a pure merchandise margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And now, what you're saying was largely that was the majority of the earnings upside relative to your original guidance range, as opposed to just simply the expense or fixed cost leverage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. If you look versus &#x2013; I'd call out two things. One is that the overall gross profit margin was 90 basis points better. We said 110 of that was merchandise margin. 20 went the other way on mark-to-market, so you can infer from that the buying and occupancy costs were flat as a percentage of sales. In terms of how we performed against &#x2013; we had $0.11 of EPS upside against the top-end. We had $0.49 of EPS against $0.38 at the high-end. About $0.06 of that came from sales, $0.06 came from margins, and $0.01 came from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (59:07), and then we gave back $0.02 to $0.03 in the ForEx being a little higher than we planned it. So that's how you get to the variance from what we reported to where we set the high-end of the range.</p>

          <p>Hey, guys. Congratulations. Amazing quarter. So, this is actually a very small question and it's a longer-term question. But if you're looking into going to Poland, I have to believe you're looking at what's going on online, with things like Gilt Groupe and Rue La La and all those other smaller conversations out online. And your CUBE is doing very well, which kind of leads me down that path, and I'm curious what your thought is about some of these businesses and if it's possibly down your thinking, or Poland's your bigger fish to fry.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Several questions, sorry, Carol. Jeff, on the Winners margin, can you address for us how that pressure may have lessened in Q1 and sort of what's embedded in Q2 guidance, thinking about the segment margins? I'm kind of wondering, is &#x2013; how does Winners margin change here in Q2, and you can address the other margins while you're at it. On the cost reductions, can you share with us kind of what the base line cost reduction was in Q1 and what's embedded for Q2 and how we think about those growing for Q3 and Q4?</p>
          <p>And then, lastly, on the May comp, your guidance of 3% to 4% implies another acceleration in three-year run rate, and the guidance for the quarter suggests another slowdown. And so, I'm wondering, is there something in June and July that we should be thinking about because the stimulus last year, I think, was already happening in May. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Stacy, you're killing us. On Winners margin, I think if you go to the sheet we put out on the website, you'll see that whereas we had a 4.7% profit margin TY versus 8.4% last year in Winners, when you adjust out the foreign currency stuff, Stacy, that's an 8% this year versus a 9.3% last year. So if you block out mark-to-market, we're down &#x2013; Winners would be down 130 basis points. And basically, we've got merchandise margin decreases being partially offset by SG&amp;A leverage. And we're not going to get too specific on the amounts, but that's &#x2013; you've got merchandise margin deleverages greater than that 130 basis point decline. And I think the Winners team has done a terrific job of mitigating the pressure that they're seeing on the merchandising margins from having to source goods in more expensive U.S. dollar. We don't compete...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does that get smaller going forward, Jeff? I mean, isn't that less of an issue as the other &#x2013; as the competitors adjust their retail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's going to depend on two things. There's two ways that the pressure lessens. One is the Canadian dollar goes back up. Increases will obviously help merchandise margins because the U.S. dollar becomes less expensive, right, which drives down their cost. The Canadian dollar right now is up maybe a couple of pennies versus where we planned it, but not significantly, so I wouldn't call that out as a significant factor. The other factor is the Canadian retailers raise prices. And I think everybody's feeling the pressure but, I don't know, Ernie, we haven't seen it, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we haven't seen that yet, but there's a lag on that because they buy the goods six to nine months out. So, Stacy, we could see that more towards the summer and the third quarter. But again, we're trying to be conservative on that front. I do commend the Winners team, however, on really capitalizing on the market opportunities in this environment to mitigate that over. Roughly, a little over half the goods up there are bought in U.S. dollars, so I think they've done a nice job on buying better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Yeah, yeah. Profit in the second &#x2013; if you knock out the mark-to-market in the second quarter, that $20 million of profit, and adjust for that in translation, say, there's like $42 million, we're way above where we'd planned the business. And I think that speaks to what Ernie just mentioned about the Winners team. The second item you asked about...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, the segment margins, you were going to weave that in, and that's the cost reductions for Q1, Q2, and how to think about them for...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so the cost reductions, I think the way to think about the cost reductions is we had meaningful amounts in Q1. We're going to get &#x2013; most of the initiatives will be in place some point in time in Q2, which means we're going to get &#x2013; sort of have the majority of the dollars and we're going to have all the savings in place by the third quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You don't want to quantify for us how much in Q1 and Q2?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I really don't. I really don't. But we're &#x2013; I think the point here is that we feel...</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It works for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we feel very confident about the $150 million. Everything we had contemplated doing, we've done or are very close to having completed, and we're getting the kinds of savings that we thought we would get.</p>
          <p>In terms of the three-year comp &#x2013; in terms of May and the comp store sales, we looked at this as we set the guidance on a three-year basis. And I think if you take our guidance in the last two years, you would see that the second quarter is up an average &#x2013; it's an average growth of 2%. The first quarter was up 2%. Now, s you correctly point out, the three-year comp for May is up 3%, so clearly that's ahead of the 2%. But I don't think we want to be planning, at the current May run rate, as we think about June and July, because we're up against some big comps. But more importantly, I think there's a lot of uncertainties in this environment. So, that's why we set the plan.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We still look at the total quarter, right? I mean, there can always be a shift from one month to the other, depending on the weather patterns and everything else. So I think this is a very good logical plan for Q2.</p>
