          <p>Hello. This is the conference call operator. Welcome to the Husky Energy First Quarter 2010 Conference Call and Webcast. As a reminder, all participants are in a listen-only mode, and the conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Patrick Aherne, Manager of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our 2010 first quarter results. With me today are Mr. John Lau, President and Chief Executive Officer; Alister Cowan, Chief Financial Officer; Rob Peabody, Chief Operating Officer, Operations and Refining; and Terrance Kutryk, Vice President of Midstream and Refined Products.</p>
          <p>In today's call, John will discuss Husky's financial results and give an overview of the operational highlights. Terrance Kutryk will provide an update on the Midstream and Downstream divisions. John will then conclude, at which time we will open the call up for questions, starting with analysts, followed by the media.</p>
          <p>Please note that today's comments contain forward-looking information. Actual results may differ materially from expected results because of various risk factors and assumptions that are described in our quarterly release and in our annual filings, which are available on SEDAR, EDGAR and our website.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to John.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Patrick, and good afternoon to everyone. Results in the first quarter of 2010 reflected a stronger commodity price environment, although partially offset by a stronger Canadian dollar and lower product margins in Downstream. Cash flow from operations was up 58% to $895 million, or $1.05 per share, from $565 million, or $0.67 per share in the same quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Earnings were $345 million, or $0.41 per share, up from $328 million, or $0.39 per share in Q1 of 2009. Sales and operating revenues were $4.47 billion, compared with $3.65 billion in the first quarter of 2009. Husky's production in the first quarter averaged 296,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared with 2009 first-quarter production of 342,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is up from 292,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>Total crude oil and natural gas liquids production was 209,000 barrels of oil per day in the quarter, compared to 250,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2009 and up from 203,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2009. Liquids production in the first quarter was lower, compared to the same quarter in 2009, mainly due to peak production rate decline from the White Rose field. Total production levels at the White Rose field will ramp up when the North Amethyst satellite begins production in the second quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Average natural gas production was 524 million cubic feet per day, down from 551 million cubic feet per day in the first quarter of 2009. Natural gas production is tracking within guidance. However, some production may be shut in later this year if gas prices weaken further. The company remains in a strong financial position. Total debt at March 31, 2010, net of cash and cash equivalents, was $3.34 billion. Debt to cash flow and debt to capital employed ratios at March 31, 2010, were 1.4 times and 21%, respectively on a trailing 12 month basis. We are pleased to advise that Husky's Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, payable on July 2, 2010, to shareholders of record on May 21, 2010.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, Husky made significant progress on several mega projects, in line with our medium and long-term growth plan. On the East Coast of Canada, drilling, completion, and tie-in operations resumed for the North Amethyst project. The first well is being completed, and is expected to be on production in the second quarter. Production will ramp up as additional wells are drilled and brought on stream, reaching gross peak rates of 37,000 barrels per day in 2011, 25,000 barrels per day Husky's share.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, Husky and its partners extended the agreement with the GSF Grand Banks offshore drilling rig. This will enable Husky to continue the development of the White Rose and adjacent oil fields through January 2013. In February, Husky and its partner were granted a Significant Discovery Licence for the Mizzen discovery in the Flemish Pass Basin. In China, the Overall Development Plan for the Liwan 3-1 field is being finalized, with expected submission to partner and regulatory authorities later this year.</p>
          <p>Gas marketing arrangements are in progress, with agreements targeted for completion in time for project sanction later in 2010. Block 29/26 in the South China Sea continues to show excellent exploration potential. In February, Husky announced another significant discovery with the Liuhua 29-1-1 exploration well. Currently, an appraisal well is being drilled to delineate the new discovery. The new field will be tied into the planned infrastructure for the Liwan 3-1 field.</p>
          <p>At the Sunrise Oil Sands Project in northern Alberta, major contracts have been tendered for the Phase One project plant and field facilities. Construction work continues on the East Athabasca highway and with plant site preparation. A decision on project sanction is expected by the end of the year, with first oil in 2014. In the first quarter, three additional well pairs were drilled at the Tucker Oil Sands Project. Steaming is expected by the third quarter with production by year-end. In Western Canada, Husky continued to build its position in a number of gas resource plays and now holds more than 946,000 net acres around established assets in the Alberta foothills and northeast British Columbia.</p>
          <p>Terrance will now talk about the Midstream and Downstream divisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. Husky's midstream business operated at a high level in the quarter. Upgrader throughput averaged 82,100 barrels per day, and operating costs were $1.11 per barrel lower than in Q1 of 2009. However, earnings were down as a result of upgrading differentials that were $4.20 per barrel lower than in the same period of 2009.</p>
          <p>The Upgrader is scheduled for a 60-day turnaround in the third quarter of this year to undergo maintenance and enhancements. Husky's downstream operations performed well in the first quarter of 2010, compared to the same period in the prior year. Total U.S. and Canadian refinery throughput was 246,400 barrels per day, compared with 236,600 barrels per day in 2009.</p>
          <p>Financial results were impacted by lower product margins as a result of lower market crack spreads. In the first quarter, Husky moved forward to integrate its 98 retail locations in southern Ontario. Re-branding is underway and the first station was opened in early April. The remaining locations will be brought into the Husky network over the coming months.</p>
          <p>I will now pass the call back to John for his concluding remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Terrance. Husky produced solid financial performance in the first quarter of 2010 while making good progress on its strategic projects. Husky has exciting major projects, including the Liwan discovery in the South China Sea, the Sunrise Oil Sands Project in Alberta, and White Rose and its satellite developments on the East Coast of Canada.</p>
          <p>The Company also has an extensive portfolio of heavy oil, light oil, and natural gas assets in Western Canada. Husky enters the decade positioned to create shareholder value with a strong core asset base, and plans to grow in the near, medium, and long term.</p>
          <p>In February, the Board of Directors announced my intention to step down as the President and Chief Executive Officer of Husky Energy. I am very committed to managing Husky until a successor has been appointed, and to ensure an orderly transition.</p>
          <p>Back to you, Patrick.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. That concludes the formal part of the call. And we would be pleased to answer any questions you might have.</p>
          <p>I will now turn it back to the conference operator.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Patrick. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question is from Terry Peters of Canaccord Adams. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to talk a little bit about White Rose and about North Amethyst, and I just wonder if you indicated that you would expect to see a ramp-up as you drill and/or connect wells from North Amethyst. What is the base production at White Rose? How is that holding up, and could you just indicate how you see that progression over the balance of the year in terms for tying in wells is that fairly steady per quarter, or is it going to be biased through the year-end, just trying to get an idea to how that whole complex is going to perform this year in terms of production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Terry, this is Rob Peabody. Yeah, I mean, okay, so looking at East Coast production for the rest of the year, current production today grows at White Rose is between a 55 and 60,000 barrels a day, post the turnaround. That's actually quite stable at the moment, you may have noticed, I mean, we did see a reduction in production just half to the turnaround and since then we've seen pretty flat production.</p>
          <p>I think as we kind of look forward in the year that's we are anticipating that production to &#x2013; in fact, at the moment it gradually increasing at the moment. So, at the moment we are still anticipating that production the whole pretty well throughout the year. Although clearly, it's something we are watching.</p>
          <p>North Amethyst production is we'll start ramping up with the wells basically if you draw a line between the next quarter and the end of the year. As we add wells we see that production increasing as we said in this, the transcript to 37,000 barrels a day gross. Does that answer your question, Terry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and is that you can expect from North Amethyst to hold that rate for a period of time a couple of years, or is that a rather steep?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. No, I think you are looking at a similar sort of profile to the original White Rose field, but at a smaller scaled down level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one follow-up on the exploration in south Tennessee, you had I guess, it's the 342 complex there was, well that didn't encounter commercial reservoir is that mean that your development plans there, are going to be the Liwan 3-1 and 29-1 discovery, and those are two that you will be looking to pair up in a development project?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the exploration program haven't come &#x2013; finished yet, we still have an about three to four blocks for area to go and Liwan 3-1-1 and the subsequent two additional discoveries during the year passed the pre-appraisal well. They were all successful, from the evaluation of the resource base, that has confirmed our previous prediction about 4 to 6 trillion of cash, so there is no surprise from our reconfirmation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just if you can remind me that your the government, or I think it's CNOC, or some has an option to back in and do on this and have they indicated they would exercise that, or at what point do they pay prior exploration costs and then share the future development cost, or how can you just outline briefly how that works?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that CNOC actually under the sharing contract, they have a right to funding for 51%. Our timing on original cash in place already report to government in December, the overall development trend is ready to submit to CNOC and also, to government. Once this ODP being submitted and revealed that CNOC will exercise, I've been advised, they will be looking at the projects. Once they propose, or finally, decide the project, the cost sharing will be straight away on that basis. For the gas production, we expect we still on target for 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Okay. So, did they pay anything or back exploration costs or no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And not straight away that they pay for the previously one back through the production, but all the ongoing costs will be shared straight away.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. Thanks, John. That's good.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, John. Can you elaborate a bit more on the spin-off that you guys might have on your South Asian assets? And what timeframe you have. And if you have looked into it, any of the tax implications that you would have?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. I just wanted to follow up and see if you guys could elaborate a bit more on the spin-off of your South Asian assets, and if you've looked into the tax simplifications and any of that and give us sort of a clarification on that.</p>

          <p>Yeah. The Asia asset portfolio has now been revealed by the Board and we are looking to make sure their asset will be particularly independent basis once we put the regulations in place.

Our schedule still be the same, and the Board actually try to announce, as soon as they feel that independent reveal and the project will be before the end of the year.</p>

That has been done, and now they want to tidy up some of the professional side make sure we are &#x2013; we will be revealed by the Board members, so as soon as the Board of Directors confirm the appointment, we will make the news. And of course, I expect and I understand the Board will try to announce by say second quarter or early third quarter.</p>

        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is the Board of Directors privilege I can't speak on their behalf, but I think they did quite a thorough search, internal, external and even within the group. So, you have to be &#x2013; sorry you have to be patient, and as soon as we decide by the Board we will announce. Of course, there is a lot market speculation, but I prefer to say let the Board make their announcement themselves.</p>
