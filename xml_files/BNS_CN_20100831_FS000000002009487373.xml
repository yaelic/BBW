        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, and welcome to the presentation of Scotiabank's Third Quarter Results. I'm Luc Vanneste, Chief Financial Officer. Rick Waugh, our CEO, will lead off with the highlights of Q3. Next, I will go over the financial results, including a review of business line performance. Brian Porter, our Group Head, Risk and Treasury, will then discuss credit quality and market risk. Brian will be followed by our business line heads, who will provide an outlook for their respective businesses for the balance of our fiscal year. We will then be glad to take your questions.</p>
          <p>Before we start, I would like to refer you to slide number two of our presentation, which contains Scotiabank's caution regarding forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Rick, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Luc. A strong and straightforward quarter for the bank, Net income was $1.06 billion, which is an increase of 14% over last year. Our earnings per share at $0.98 are up 13% year-over-year, and all three of our business lines contributed to our success this quarter.</p>
          <p>Performance was driven by another record quarter in Canadian banking, which earned through increased pressure on margins, on strong asset growth and higher contributions from wealth management. This is the fifth consecutive record quarter for Canadian banking.</p>
          <p>Significantly lower provisions for credit losses, which were down 50% from last year and 18% from last quarter, aided results and demonstrate our consistent emphasis on prudent risk management.</p>
          <p>PCLs were down for the fourth straight quarter, a continuing sign that our credit portfolios are improving. Scotia Capital delivered a solid quarter despite very challenging trading environments and lower corporate lending volumes.</p>
          <p>We had positive performance and momentum in international banking, which earned through the significant negative impact of foreign currency translations, as it has had to do for most of this year.</p>
          <p>International banking benefited from widespread margin improvements, contributions from acquisitions made in selected strategic markets and a decline in provisions for credit losses. However, these gains and our targeted profitability were offset not only by the foreign exchange factor, but by lagging economic recovery in some of our markets, although we are now seeing encouraging signs of growth in these select markets. And we expect significantly less headwinds in foreign exchange going forward.</p>
          <p>Our return on equity at 18.2% this quarter continues to be strong and within our target range for the year. We've added a significant amount of internally generated capital to strengthen our capital ratios, which continue to be strong, both by Canadian and international standards.</p>
          <p>Our consistent and strong level of profitability from all three of our growth platforms, have allowed us to increase our capital ratios. At the same time, this high level of profitability permits us to continue to make acquisitions, maintain capital investments in the business and offset the challenges posed by adverse foreign exchange movements.</p>
          <p>The new Basel III proposals will be finalized within the next few months, and we will expect that this will result in a tighter and more consistent definition of capital, and higher capital levels internationally.</p>
          <p>We have completed multiple scenarios and analysis in order to anticipate the impact of Basel III, and we are confident that we will be able to manage our operations to satisfy these new requirements.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, with the strategies and the priorities we have in place, we are confident we will continue to achieve our earnings and productivity targets while maintaining our investment in people, acquisitions, meeting our customers' investment and credit needs and providing excellent total shareholder returns.</p>
          <p>We are obviously pleased with our results this quarter and looking at our year-to-date performance versus our targets, we are well-positioned to meet and in fact exceed our full year targets.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll pass over to Luc.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Rick. Our net interest income in Q3 was stable compared to last year, and our increased earnings were driven principally by growth in personal and commercial banking and wealth management, significantly lower credit losses and reduced write-downs of securities.</p>
          <p>These positives were partly offset by foreign exchange, which impacted earnings by $89 million, as compared to Q3 '09. Excluding FX, net income grew by $220 million, or 24%. Also offsetting were lower trading and securitization revenues, higher non-interest expenses as we continued to invest in our businesses for future growth and the impact of an elevated tax rate.</p>
          <p>Looking quarter-over-quarter, earnings declined $35 million or 3%. This quarter's earnings reflect growth in net interest income and wealth management revenues, lower provisions for credit losses and the impact of a lower effective tax rate. These items were more than offset by lower trading revenues, reduced net gains on securities and growth in non-interest expenses. Our ROE was strong at 18.2%.</p>
          <p>Moving to revenues on slide 8, total revenue at over $3.8 billion this quarter was up $11 million from the same period last year. Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency translation, revenue grew $198 million or 5%. Net interest income was flat as asset growth in Canadian and International Banking and contributions from acquisition of R-G Premier Bank in Puerto Rico were offset by compression in the margin and lower lending volumes in Scotia Capital.</p>
          <p>Other income was up as a result of higher net gains on securities and growth in wealth management revenues, partly offset by lower trading and securitization revenues. Quarter-over-quarter, revenue benefited from higher net interest income, strong mutual fund revenues and increased transaction-based fee income. These increases were more than offset by lower trading revenues and reduced net gains on securities.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expenses rose $64 million or 3% from last quarter. The year-over-year growth was due primarily to the acquisition of R-G Premier Bank, increased remuneration, advertising and professional expenses to support business growth, together with higher stock-based compensation and favorable impact of foreign currency translation. The increases were partly offset by lower performance-based compensation, reflecting the lower trading results.</p>
          <p>Comparing to Q2, expenses were also up 3%. The acquisition of R-G Premier Bank accounted for the majority of the growth. The bank's productivity ratio at 52.5% has returned to a more normalized level from the record low we reached last quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to capital on slide 10, you can see that our TCE and Tier 1 ratios strengthened during the quarter to 9.3% and 11.7% respectively. We were able to strengthen our ratios because of strong internal capital generation of $504 million for the quarter and approximately $1.5 billion year-to-date, as well as a contribution of $166 million through our dividend reinvestment plan this quarter.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the business line results beginning on slide 11. Our positive momentum in Canadian Banking continued this quarter. Q3 marked the fifth consecutive record quarter for Canadian Banking with net income of $604 million, up 21% year-over-year. Revenues were up 9%, driven by significant growth in both net interest income and other income. We saw particular strength in wealth management, where revenues grew across virtually all of our business lines. However, wealth management also included some adjustments to our equity pickup from associated corporations amounting to $22 million after-tax, which we do not expect to recur.</p>
          <p>Expenses rose 5% from the same quarter last year, largely due to growth initiatives and volume-related expenses, including brokers' commissions. Overall, expenses continued to be well managed and Canadian Banking reported strong positive operating leverage on a year-to-date basis. Compared to last quarter, net income was up 3%. Higher revenue in wealth management was mostly offset by a decrease in margin, which was due to increased competition and higher wholesale funding costs.</p>
          <p>Expenses increased 3% quarter-over-quarter, mainly due to three more days in the quarter, higher volume-related expenses including broker commissions, support area expenses and growth initiatives. Partially offsetting was lower incentive compensation. Notably, assets under administration and assets under management were at record levels. Scotia Funds ranked number two during the quarter in total net sales within the bank channel. As well, our Scotia Mortgage Authority business earned the number one ranking in the mortgage brokerage channel by market share for the six months ended June 30.</p>
          <p>Moving to International Banking on slide 12, net income was up 2% year-over-year. Excluding the negative impact of the stronger Canadian dollar, the increase was $34 million or 11%. Revenue was up 9%, mostly as a result of an increase in other income, largely reflecting higher gains on sale of securities including the effect of last year's $79 million write-down of an equity investment.</p>
          <p>Quarter-over-quarter, earnings rose $29 million or 10%. The quarter-over-quarter increase in revenue was due to growth in net interest income, which increased $158 million to $980 million, including an incremental $70 million from acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Including the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, growth reflected widespread margin improvements. We also benefited from changes in the fair value of financial instruments used for asset and liability management, most notably in Chile. This was partly offset by lower other income, which was impacted by lower gains on sale of securities.</p>
          <p>Expenses increased $73 million or 11% from last quarter, mainly from the impact of the acquisition of R-G Premier Bank. Our tax rate was adversely affected by a one-time adjustment for future tax liabilities related to certain international affiliates. This increased our effective tax rate in International Banking by approximately 5% this quarter.</p>
          <p>Overall, the results show that International Banking is earning through challenges. Over the last several months, we have seen modest increases in personal lending-related asset levels in select markets. We view this as an indicator that economic activity is improving in our markets.</p>
          <p>Looking at slide 13, Scotia Capital's net income for the quarter was solid at $305 million, but down $165 million or 35% from the record results achieved in the same period last year. The performance reflects both a drop in trading revenues and a $17 billion or 36% decrease in corporate loans and acceptances across all wholesale lending businesses. This was partly offset by significantly lower provisions for credit losses.</p>
          <p>Quarter-over-quarter, net income decreased $86 million or 22%. Scotia Capital continues to benefit from its diversification across product areas, with all businesses contributing solid and positive results, albeit at more normal levels than in recent quarters. Our global capital markets business delivered very solid results, although revenues were somewhat lower than the record level of last year and the second-best level last quarter.</p>
          <p>Revenues in global corporate investment banking were down due to lower lending volumes and slightly reduced spreads. There was also a reduction in fair value changes in non-trading financial instruments.</p>
          <p>A net recovery of credit losses of $25 million principally reflects the reversal of the auto industry sectoral allowance. Expenses were $267 million, 11% lower than last quarter, primarily reflecting lower performance-based compensation resulting from lower trading activities.</p>
          <p>Now turn to the Other segment, which incorporates the results of Group Treasury, smaller operating units and certain corporate adjustments. The Other segment reported a loss of $164 million in Q3, a significant improvement over the prior year and essentially in line with the last quarter.</p>
          <p>On a year-over-year basis, we benefited from lower write-downs and available-for-sale securities, and provisions for credit losses were nil versus $100 million increase in the general allowance a year ago. Expenses declined mainly due to lower issuance costs associated with asset securitization, and partly offsetting were lower funding net interest income, driven by lower volumes of bond securities.</p>
          <p>Quarter-over-quarter, funding net interest income declined from lower bond security volumes, and net other items declined mainly due to lower securities gains in Group Treasury.</p>
          <p>This concludes my review of our financial results. I will now turn it over to Brian, who will discuss risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Luc. The risk in our credit portfolios continues to be well-managed. We continue to see a steady and clear improvement in a number of our key credit metrics. We saw a significant decline in our specific provisions this quarter. With the automotive sector now stabilized, we reversed the remaining 24 million of the sectoral allowance we established in Q2 '09.</p>
          <p>Underpinning the decline in provisions is the trend in net impaired loan formations which remains quite encouraging despite a modest uptick from the exceptional results last quarter. We continue to main strong coverage ratios, our market risk remains well-managed and well within our risk tolerances.</p>
          <p>Our average 1-day VaR was 12.7 million, down slightly from 13.4 million in Q2. However, we did see greater variability in trading revenues particularly related to the volatility in credit markets in the early part of the quarter. Purchase credit protection at the beginning of the quarter was subject to this volatility. As a result, we had 16 trading loss days this quarter compared to two days in the prior quarter. The losses were well within the range predicted by VaR.</p>
          <p>Slide 17 shows the trend in specific provisions over the past five quarters. As you can see, the significant decline in specific provisions this quarter was primarily in the Canadian and international commercial books as the decrease in retail provisions was modest. As a result, our all bank PCL ratio dropped by 12 basis points in the quarter to 43 basis points.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows the positive trend in net impaired loan formations over the past five quarters. We are clearly seeing a downward trend in the total formations since they peaked in Q2 '09. The increase in quarter-over-quarter formations primarily reflects lower net fee classifications in Scotia Capital this quarter compared to Q2, as well as an increase in formations in the international retail portfolios. The increase in Canadian commercial formations was mostly offset by a decline in the international commercial formations.</p>
          <p>On the next slide we continue to have strong coverage ratios. In particular, our earnings provided a higher coverage of 6.4 times total provisions this quarter. Our ratio of total allowances to gross impaired loans of 79%, or 73% excluding the R-G Premier Bank acquisition, was slightly down from last quarter, due in part to the reversal of the auto sectoral allowance. And our ratio of total allowances to loans and acceptances of 147 basis points, or 102 basis points excluding R-G Premier, was also down slightly from Q2.</p>
          <p>To wrap up, we are very comfortable with the asset quality and positioning of our credit portfolios. Our portfolios have responded favorably to the economic recovery that is taking hold here in Canada and elsewhere in the world.</p>
          <p>With respect to our retail and commercial portfolios, they are performing as expected. We continue to expect the Caribbean to lag the rest of our international operations in terms of the economic recovery. Our corporate portfolios continue to show remarkable strength. Looking ahead, we expect credit trends to show modest improvement, given the current economic environment.</p>
          <p>That concludes my comments on risk, and I will now turn it over to Chris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brian. As Luc mentioned, Q3 was another record quarter for Canadian Banking. All of our core businesses performed well, and we expect that to continue. Our underlying wealth management business revenues are expected to continue to grow moderately despite a softening market. We have seen mutual fund market share grow in 41 of the last 48 months, reflecting our focus in this area, including our relationships with two of the strongest Canadian independent mutual fund firms. We're positioned well for a future market recovery.</p>
          <p>Our retail business also performed strongly, and to drive future growth we're continuing to reinvest in the business. For instance, on the delivery side we have opened nine branches this year and will do a further three in Q4.</p>
          <p>Our Scotia Mortgage Authority broker network became number one in Canada in market share for the six months ending in June. We've also recently launched our Let the Saving Begin program to help our customers focus on optimizing their financial portfolios.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we are bringing the same attention and focus on our deposits and payments businesses as we have achieved in our wealth business. For the remainder of 2010, we expect to see somewhat slower growth in mortgages and competitive pressure on both asset and deposit spreads. Commercial Banking also had a strong quarter with particularly good results in auto finance, and will provide a foundation for further growth going forward.</p>
          <p>As Luc mentioned, our expense base remains well managed, but we expect the usual uptick in Q4 from seasonality and from continuing investment in future growth. Operating leverage will be substantially positive for the whole year. While we have had good success in market share throughout our businesses, we are not chasing market share at the expense of pricing. As a result, we are pleased with our results, our market position and our prospects for future growth.</p>
          <p>I'll now pass it over to Rob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chris. We are pleased with our results this quarter, up 29 million or 10% over last quarter. Our markets are still feeling the effects of the global economic slowdown, and this has translated into lower-than-expected loan growth. We are, however, starting to see signs of growth in some of our major markets. We expect retail loan growth to average about 4% this year and improve into 2011.</p>
          <p>We expect higher loan growth in Chile, Peru, Central America and Thailand. The Caribbean was the hardest hit by the downturn, and its recovery is more dependent on U.S. performance. So we expect growth to be more tempered in this region. We expect corporate and commercial volumes to be flat in 2011 and improve in &#x2013; sorry, 2010 and improve in 2011.</p>
          <p>Slower loan growth has been offset by continued strength in margins, although margins could moderate somewhat due to high levels of liquidity and low interest rates in certain markets.</p>
          <p>Reasons for being positive going into Q4 and 2011 &#x2013; our portfolios are performing well. PCLs are down this quarter, largely due to lower commercial provisions in the Caribbean and Chile. Retail provisions were moderately lower this quarter, and we think PCLs will continue to trend well.</p>
          <p>We continue to review our credit policies to ensure they are aligned with market conditions. We also continue to focus on expenses while investing in initiatives that are going to drive growth and improve efficiency.</p>
          <p>So, so far this year, we have begun a major upgrade of our contact center in Mexico, started constructing a new contact center in Peru, opened 46 branches and offices and launched programs to improve overall sales force productivity.</p>
          <p>This quarter our results benefit from the recent acquisitions of R-G Premier Bank in Puerto Rico and Siam City International Bank, our affiliate in Thailand. These transactions give us good critical mass in each market and provide good platforms for generating revenue growth in the future. So, in summary, a good quarter, encouraging signs of renewed growth in key markets.</p>
          <p>So I'll pass it over to Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob. As Luc mentioned, while our Q3 results are down from the exceptional and record levels last quarter and from Q3 '09, this was a solid quarter for Scotia Capital. This quarter we had a much more challenging trading environment, and the lack of significant pickup in M&amp;A activity continued to limit loan demand.</p>
          <p>Trading revenues decreased in the third quarter due to more difficult market conditions and reduced client flows. We do not expect to see the strong level of revenues from the first half of the year returning in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Our loan loss provisions were quite modest in the first nine months. Exclusive of the auto sectoral reversal, PCLs were well below expectations and reflective of an improving loan portfolio. We have also seen a modest increase in the percentage of investment-grade loans and a decrease in our watchlist accounts.</p>
          <p>We expect to continue to benefit from very low loan loss provisions for the rest of the year. Average volumes have declined in all geographies for several quarters, as many of our clients have seized the opportunity to reduce debt. We expect this trend to moderate and ultimately reverse itself sometime in the next 6 months once M&amp;A activity picks up. But to date, we have only seen modest signs of an uptick in M&amp;A activity.</p>
          <p>Finally, while the capital markets will likely continue to be challenging, especially in the near-term, we have been able to invest in the fundamental parts of our businesses and to attract and develop top talent. This has allowed us to develop a broader base of revenues for sustainable growth.</p>
          <p>We have a number of initiatives underway to support this. For example, our enhanced fixed income platform in London and New York is contributing positively to our results. We continue to improve our equity platform to promote cross-sell and enhanced client coverage. The deal flow within our infrastructure platform is increasing, and the pipeline looks promising in most geographies.</p>
          <p>Working in partnership with International Banking, we are making progress in building our wholesale banking footprint around the globe, and we continue to look for suitable niche acquisition opportunities to add to our presence. And with that I will turn it back to Luc.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good afternoon. Luc, first, a quick numbers question, you mentioned the wealth management equity pickup change. Does that flow through mutual fund fees? Is that why it was up 21% quarter-over-quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us the pre-tax number of that 22 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's pre-tax/after-tax, one in the same.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then if I remove variable comp, expenses were up 7% quarter-over-quarter. I'm gathering from your comments that there was nothing unusual in that increase or, at the very least, nothing that was obviously non-recurring in that increase. Is that a fair comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is a fair comment, Rob. We continue to invest in future growth initiatives. We have brought additional people on board, so salaries have increased, and we've had a greater spend from a technology perspective, as well in several of the business lines, but nothing really unusual in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Your next question comes from Steve Theriault with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, first question for Chris Hodgson, loan growth continues to hang in there, but I think consensus is building that we may be heading for more difficult times ahead. So could you share with us some of your views on loan growth for the next one to 2 years versus what we've seen the last couple of years in Canada?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we are starting to see a bit of a slowdown, though over the course of the next 2 quarters we still have a pretty good pipeline. But looking beyond that, we are somewhat concerned about what is going on in the rate environment. It's a very competitive market on the mortgage side, as you probably know, with a tremendous amount of activity going in on pricing on the variable side. All of this is going to have a bit of an impact on flows.</p>
          <p>That being said, we have increased our sales through bringing on the Maple business, and we've done very well in the alternate channels. So in addition to our direct business, we have our indirect business, and there's a good mix between those. So while there will be, likely, from a macro perspective, slowing growth in the mortgage market, we've got good channel strategies that could offset that. But, we are expecting some moderate slowdown in that market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>Okay, and another question, for Mike Durland. I'm not surprised to see trading down in the quarter, but could you provide us with some color on a couple of fronts. One, if I combine the securities and derivatives lines, they were down approximately 40%, it looks like. Can you give us a bit of a split there between debt and equity? And separately, forex and precious metals, now, that has been a very defensive line. Is there any reason to think that won't be just as defensive as it has been going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, firstly, we were very pleased with the way all of the businesses performed in the quarter. Our foreign exchange and Mocatta business have performed in a very steady way over the past 6 to 8 quarters. And we are very, very pleased with the way they have performed. In terms of our fixed income business, you mentioned the fixed income side of the business. That's the business that we saw the biggest change in activity during the quarter, and that certainly was negatively affected by it. But having said that, we had an extremely solid quarter in fixed income in the third quarter. We had good debt capital market fees; we had a very good quarter in infrastructure. The sales and trading part of that business performed very well. Equities was much more of a normal quarter than fixed income. Equities also had a very strong quarter, so.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But is it fair to say that it was really the debt side that drove most of the sequential decrease, then, just on the trading line itself?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>And then, on the first page of the press release, Rick, you indicate that the Bank can undertake certain changes in its businesses to meet the Basel III requirements. I wasn't sure what you were referring to when you think book businesses would change. And if there are businesses that change, how might that affect the Company's earnings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't &#x2013; as we see it now, I don't anticipate any major changes. We were concerned in December when the proposals came out. But now, with &#x2013; the biggest concern that our Bank had and I think most Canadian banks and I think most banks around the world, well, at least let me say top of the Canadian list , was the definitions, not the capital levels per se because the Canadian banks are all well-capitalized. But what our concern was definitions, and there were some quite onerous initial proposals on the definitions which could have had an impact on our business models.</p>
          <p>From the discussions we've had in the press releases that have come out but are not yet finalized, so a little degree of caution there, but certainly have all gone in the right way so that, for us, it was all in the definitions. And they haven't all improved as much as we want, the substantial investments, the deferred tax assets, but they have moved forward in an international compromise. So I don't really see any changes, but until they issue their final communiqu&#xE9; or at least give up some more formal clarifications, a little hesitancy there, but, so until it's final, it's not final. So I don't see any major changes in our business model, and we are all looking forward to that being finalized and we can all move forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the reference you make to changes in your MD&amp;A, at most, you call them very modest?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I follow you. Finally then the reference you make to the Bank having the capacity to meet shareholder needs, and you refer specifically to raising dividends, what timeframe are you referring to in making that comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, our dividend policy is subject to, obviously, sustainable earnings; our strength of our capital, which is, of course, not only economic but regulatory and that is where the &#x2013; I guess, the uncertainty lies.</p>
          <p>Our reinvestment opportunities and our growth all come to bear in the shareholder preferences. So a little clarity on the regulatory front and this also assumes all those other factors come. So we're not going to give you a timeframe and we're not going to give you numbers because until it comes out I think that would be premature. But we are certainly looking forward to the future in that regard. Because certainly our shareholders have said and we certainly agree, increasing dividends is something they all look forward to.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I know, I know. But the timetable that the regulators have put out, of course, is a pretty good timetable to eliminate that uncertainty. And the rest takes care of itself based upon how well we perform as a bank. And we'll continue to &#x2013; confident in our performance. And so we'll see how 2011 looks and we look forward positively. But we're not there yet.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Just to follow up on this Basel III stuff, can you go into some of the elements you're stress testing? You're alluding to some thorough testing that you've done. Which assumptions have you made? I'm assuming it includes the market risk-weighted adjustments and some Basel II refinements as well. And when you say 'meet Basel III thresholds,' what's the timing, is that like now or December 2012? What's your &#x2013; how are you looking at it that way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the regulators have very definitely signaled a time period of when it begins. And then although they haven't confirmed the number of years that you will have to transition, but those time limits have been extended or the trend or the indication is. But again, it's up to them to tell you the years and not us and when they do that. And so &#x2013; I think we just got a technical problem here going on here. Pardon me.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; and in terms of our timing is &#x2013; and what we're getting from indications of the G-20 regulators in that, we think are very accommodative to what we can do, because we have such strong going-in positions and accretion on our return on equity.</p>
          <p>So the assumptions are moderate growth in our risk-based assets. We don't want to be too optimistic on anything, we want a realistic one. Because who knows, 2015 to 2018, where these things start to track in, will happen. But &#x2013; and we've run multiple scenarios, best case, worst-case and what have you. And I think these assumptions are &#x2013; you guys are in that business and these are all very realistic assumptions. And we can live with them.</p>
          <p>And what's very strong, of course, is we do assume we're going to hit our earnings targets, which we generally announce once a year and we don't see big changes in that. Our return on equity is solid, at 18.5%. If you just look at the quarter over quarter, how we added to our capital ratios over the previous quarter. And of course, the previous quarter we acquired. We made two big acquisitions. So it all depends how many acquisitions you put in your long-term forecast, which we do assume some.</p>
          <p>So it's a whole hodgepodge. But that's why we looked at scenarios and we looked at stresses, and that's why we said what we said. We managed through this, and because we and several of our Canadian competitors are at such high levels going in, I'm starting to view it as a world of opportunity. But we're not quite there yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Speaking of opportunities, on the acquisition side, if you're not in &#x2013; just for argument's sake, if you're not in compliance with Basel III right now, but you've got time to meet the standards, what's your view on the regulators' standpoint in terms of allowing you to pursue your M&amp;A strategy? Are you full steam ahead, or does the regulator say, okay, cool it until you grow in to your &#x2013; the Basel III environment, so to speak?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll just refer to our second quarter, where we made two fairly significant acquisitions, one in Thailand and one in Puerto Rico. We've made similar announcements. If you look even over the last three years &#x2013; which has not even a great year, I think we made about, what, $5 billion, Luc &#x2013; in acquisitions, and of course several of them this year. So I don't think it has held us back, whether it be with the regulator.</p>
          <p>What holds us back is we want to make good ones. We keep a very tight financial discipline on it and make sure that it meets our strategical guidelines. Those have been the constraints because our capital has been accreting pretty significantly, and I think our actions speak for themselves. We have been acquiring.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I have a couple questions for Rob Pitfield. I guess first, we saw some good expansion on the net interest margin this quarter, and I understand that we could see some compression from here. Could you help us understand a little bit better how much the R-G acquisition added incrementally to the net interest margin versus improving margins in some of the other countries that you highlighted, for example, Mexico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It wasn't much of a factor, Cheryl, at the end of the day. Really, the biggest margin expansion was from Chile. The rest of the markets held up very well. The one that has had trouble from a margin compression perspective is the Caribbean and notably Jamaica. So we'll expect some moderate margin compression in certain markets, but that would be sort of normal course of business, nothing major.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cheryl, it's Luc, just to amplify a little bit what Rob said. You'll recall in Q2 that we had a negative swing in terms of financial instruments in Chile because of the widening of the spreads relative to the earthquake that took place. And we indicated at that point that we expected that that would narrow. So the 23 basis point increase in the margin that we saw quarter-over-quarter in international is substantially all due to that coming back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. Thank you for the refresher. Just as a follow-on to that, as we move more into a global recovery scenario, can you give us a bit of an update on your thoughts on the margin in that scenario? And what typically time period does it take to benefit from a rising rate environment? Is it sort of a quarterly lag? Or if there is any additional color you could give there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think it all depends, Cheryl, in terms of indications from central bankers in terms of what they're going to do in terms of rate increases. We saw that in Q3, for example, that the BA rates went up before announced changes in anticipation of the changes. So we had compression of the spread between prime and BAs.</p>
          <p>If that continues to happen, effectively almost pre-announcements, we will continue to be under pressure from a margin perspective over a period of time. But I don't think it will be quite as pronounced as it was in Q3. As well, we continue to operate in quite a competitive environment, so margin pressure is omnipresent.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. A question for Rob as well. Rob, looking at the return on economic capital, 11% in the latest quarter, and the net income at 317. If I look back in the history of your division, back to the first quarter of 2007 just prior to the onset of the credit crisis; you happened to earn exactly the same amount, and the return on equity that you reported at that time was roughly double. So my question would be: where are we &#x2013; in your view, anyway &#x2013; in terms of the overall profitability of the international segment? And is there anything structural that has occurred through the acquisition pursuits, et cetera, that would cause one to think that you wouldn't get back to the level of profitability that you were pre-crisis? Or in fact exceed it, given that in some of your markets you're much larger and have greater scale?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brad, it's Luc. Let me just take your second question, effectively. Rick indicated the volume of acquisitions that we've done over a period of time. So you're talking about 2007 and prior.</p>
          <p>So subsequent to that, we have done some very major acquisitions in international <mark type="inaudible" />, which was in excess of $1 billion U.S.; we continued to do bolt-on acquisitions in Peru; we've done Thanachart, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So all of those &#x2013; the cost of those acquisitions, which are multi-billion dollars, get charged to international. So there is a direct correlation, cause and effect, between the ROE pre-2007 and the acquisitions that we've done post that particular era. And it takes some time before you get those acquisitions up to the double-digit return.</p>
          <p>Maybe now I can hand it back to Rob to give you some other color commentary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's been a big issue from an ROE perspective. We also have an issue where we are earning more in Pacific, which has traditionally had a lower ROE. It's a higher investment grade. And we have issues with the Caribbean at this particular point in time. But you know historically what the Caribbean, particularly the English Caribbean, has meant to the bank, and we should return to that.</p>
          <p>So all of those things will normalize in due course, and we're good with that. You know over the last two or three years that we've had to earn through not only the economic issues that have been going on and the PCL issues, major forex moves and that's been a considerable amount. And I think that the franchise has borne up extremely well through that, when you look at other international banks.</p>
          <p>So from our perspective, we've earned through all of that over the last couple of years. Our volumes are starting to pick up. The high watermark around 2007, 2008 was around 20%. We're at more like 3, 4, 5%. So will they be 20% next year? They won't. But even a modest pickup from where we are now will generate very good revenues for the franchises as well as we've been working through all of the integration activities, putting in platforms.</p>
          <p>So it's been a major, major work effort during a period of very difficult economic times. So I look at it and I look at the fact that the area that we're having the most trouble in, the English Caribbean has been the backbone of international for decades and decades and decades. That will return.</p>
          <p>And when you look at how well our new entities have performed during this period with all the work that's been gone on to get them up to speed in terms of good platforms, et cetera, I think it's a very good case for good growth, very good growth going forward.</p>

          <p>Hey, Rob. The few acquisitions that were made this year &#x2013; I'm thinking of Puerto Rico and Thailand, we were talking about $0.05 of earnings accretion, year one, fair to say we didn't see any of that in the quarter and that's more something we should expect in 2011?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andr&#xE9;, it's Luc. The combination of the two on a NYAD basis was in the 30 million to $35 million. So it was positive and it's tracking according to our expectations when we looked at doing both of those acquisitions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Hi, thank you. I'm interested in the margin at the all-bank level, which is, I think, the way you guys try to manage it. Can you talk about sort of a couple of things? One is, where is the pressure coming from predominantly? Is this a function of competition? Is it a function of greater use of the broker channel and mortgages? And can you talk about order of magnitude? What kind of compression should we think about for the bank at the all-bank level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Darko, it's Luc. One of the key factors this quarter is that we had a relatively large quarter-over-quarter swing in financial instruments. That was around $60 million negative. That on a mark-to-mark basis, impact on the margin was about 3 basis points. We were down on the quarter 5 basis points. I also mentioned that we had narrower spreads between prime and BAs, so that is also a factor. And we had a 3 basis point impact from higher volumes of low spread trading assets, which is supporting Mike's business. But that impacts the margin on an all-bank basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when I hear discussions of the potential for further margin compression, I'm wondering where predominantly that's going to come from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're in a competitive environment. So I think there's always pressure in the Canadian retail banking unit there. As Mike grows those businesses and we have a greater volume of lower spread trading assets, that will put, at an all-bank basis, pressure on the margin. Yes, we do talk about margin at the all-bank level, but there are differences in terms of the margins on a business line basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. I think I'll follow-up with you after the call, Luc. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Peter Routledge with National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just two relatively brief numbers questions. First, on your net interest margin in Canada, it seemed to be down a fair bit from the last couple quarters, wondering what's driving that? Is it higher costs coming from transfers pricing or is this something else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Canadian banking, yes, the largest single component, Peter, was higher wholesale funding costs. As Chris and his team grow the book and the increase in the 30, 60, 90-day BA rates, that impacted them negatively this quarter. But they also took their share of the swing in financial instruments, which cost them 3 bps in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>3 bps. And then on international banking, I noticed for international retail, formations were up quarter-over-quarter, but provisions were down. Is there &#x2013; and that seemed odd to me. Is there anything behind that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of international retail, in terms of formations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, slide 17 and 18, it looked to me like provisions went down a bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Peter, it's Brian. That's a function of FX to some extent, but it's also a function of reclassification of some loans that we had in R-G Premier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're not noticing any underlying concerns in international retail, particularly Caribbean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. What we've said before still holds. Peru and Chile are healing very nicely, as is Mexico. The Caribbean &#x2013; the two countries in the Caribbean, Puerto Rico and Bahamas, are going to take some time. The rest of the business is curing quite nicely.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from John Reucassel with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just following up a couple of the capital questions, Rick, you talked about the EPS target. You feel comfortable with that, 7 to 12%. What about the ROE target? You have a range of 17 to 20. Is that still a realistic target with the new ratios? And I don't know if you've run any tests on &#x2013; stress test on liquidity, but is there any thoughts you could give us on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We've run tests on liquidity and funding as well as capital, and our remarks still hold on that. We will give after &#x2013; we give the final &#x2013; for 2011 we'll give our guidance &#x2013; is it next quarter, Luc?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, next quarter, once we put the year to bed because we only give guidance once a year. So for this year, as I said, we'll exceed the financial targets that we've set. And we're going to look at next year based on how well we've done this year and the outlook and cautiously optimistic and actually feeling relatively confident, but we will give you guidance on that at the next quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I guess asked another way, would it be reasonable to assume, if there is not a big change in the business model, but you need to hold more common equity around that the ROE range would have to come down a lot or would that not be a reasonable --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I don't think that will have a big issue. I think it's going to be markets rather than the level of capital. We have going in at high capital levels &#x2013; the real change for us is the tighter definition of capital, which does require some more capital. But I think &#x2013; again, without pinning me down to an exact number, I don't see any significant change in return on equity because of the re-regulation, if the indications follow through what we hear and the key one now is the calibration, which is the actual level. But we went in with it with excess regulatory capital.</p>
          <p>Despite the 5 billion in acquisitions, we maintained very high capital levels on international standards. And now, as we come out of this, I think we will be able to satisfy not only regulatory concerns but our shareholders' expectations on total shareholder returns and all the other parameters. So we are getting through this, I think, in reasonably good shape. But let's not call victory until the regulators decide.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough, and just a question for Luc and Chris. Just, you talked about competition and the impact on spreads. I guess I'm particularly referring to Canada now. But a lot of it doesn't &#x2013; a lot of the spread compression in the quarter unnecessarily like it came from competition. Is that true? And are you expecting more pressure on spreads and competition coming in the future as opposed to in the present quarter? Or how &#x2013; I'm just trying to understand what your outlook there is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Chris speaking. The outlook on the margin for the Canadian banking business over the course of the next few quarters is for some slight compression, most of that though to come from competition. Of course, the rate environment will have an impact on our book of business, as you know. That being said, mainly we believe over the next quarter more from competition. And specifically in deposits, for example, it has become very, very competitive.</p>
          <p>As you know John, if you look at high-interest savings accounts, there's been some pretty interesting activity there over even the last few days. And in the mortgage market I mentioned earlier, the variable rate mortgages, the spread between that and fixed-rate mortgages is quite significant, so that there's a lot of competition in that space. So we are looking at some slight margin compression in Q4, not nearly what we saw quarter-over-quarter in Q3. Most of this will come from competition.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Luc, just a clarification. Your answer to Andre's question &#x2013; you said that the acquisitions in international added 30 to $35 million. In your opening comments, I thought you said something like 17. Perhaps &#x2013; if you could just help clarify that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, did you say 70, Mario?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>17. I thought...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>17 &#x2013; no, I referenced 70 revenues. Let me go back if I said something different. That's what I think it was.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no &#x2013; it was probably 70 and I heard 17.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's 30 to 35 on the NYAD.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On a NYAD basis, 30 to 35, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. And then, the RWA down 1% in the quarter despite the pretty strong loan growth in domestic retail and there was actually lower RWA in REITs and residential mortgages, which caught me off-guard. How did that play out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the decrease, we had forex actually increasing our RWA quarter-over-quarter, and then we had a $3.2 billion decrease in RWA. The lion's share, about two-thirds of that, was on the business loan side, and one-third was on residential mortgages, which was largely impacted by R-G Premier this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But residential mortgages in Canada, I thought were up significantly. Why would RWA and residential mortgages be down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because in Canada, we've got the insured mortgages, which have very little risk weighting. So the impact on an overall basis comes from outside of Canada.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
