          <p>Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's Oracle Corporation Quarterly Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to introduce Roy Lobo, Head of Investor Relations, Oracle. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to Oracle's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2008 Earnings Conference Call. This is Roy Lobo, Head of Investor Relations. With me on the call are Oracle's Chief Executive Officer, Larry Ellison; Oracle's President and Chief Financial Officer, Safra Catz; and Oracle's President, Charles Phillips. We will begin with a few prepared remarks and then take a few questions from the audience.</p>
          <p>Let me begin by reminding everyone that today's discussions may include predictions, estimates, or other information that might be considered forward-looking. While these forward-looking statements represent our current judgment on what the future holds, they are subject to risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect our opinion only as of the date of this presentation. Please keep in mind that we are not obligating ourselves to revise or publicly release the results of any revision of these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.</p>
          <p>Throughout today's discussion, we will attempt to present some important factors relating to our business that may affect our predictions. You should also review our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for a complete discussion of these factors, and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. A PDF copy of our press release and financial tables, which include a GAAP-to-non-GAAP reconciliation can be viewed and downloaded on the Oracle Investor Relations website at www.oracle.com/investor.</p>
          <p>So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Safra Catz for her opening comments.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Roy. Good afternoon everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q4 and fiscal year '08. I will then review guidance for Q1 and then turn the call over to Larry and Charles for their comments.</p>
          <p>As you can see, Oracle delivered again another exceptionally strong quarter and ended fiscal year '08 growing earnings per share 29% and improving operating income by 30%. We started the year on a high note with the strongest first-half new license growth in more than a decade. We continued that momentum into the second half, delivering license growth of 28% to 7.5 billion for the year, the highest license growth rate in any fiscal year in the past decade, including during the height of the Internet bubble. We committed at the beginning of the year to deliver 100 to 200 basis points of margin improvement, and we delivered on that commitment with our fiscal year '08 non-GAAP operating margin of 43% up 2 points from last year.</p>
          <p>In Q4, we also achieved the highest non-GAAP operating margin in the company's history at 49%. Our non-GAAP EPS grew 29% to $1.30 for the year, well above our EPS growth plan of 20% per year. At our size, fiscal year '08 would have been considered a great year when the economy is booming. The fact that we put up these results in these times demonstrates that our strategy is working and our team is executing across the board.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, new software license revenues were up an exceptionally strong 27% to 3.1 billion. We saw broad-based geographic and product momentum. Technology new license revenues were up 23% to 2.1 billion in Q4, and up 24% to 5.1 billion for the full year. Again, this is the fastest growth rate in our technology business in more than a decade. Geographically we grew technology license revenues 16% in the Americas, 42% in EMEA, and 6% in APAC. BEA contributed 93 million to new software license revenue in the quarter, exceeding our expectations significantly as BEA customers welcomed the closing of the transaction.</p>
          <p>Our Applications business delivered new license growth of 36% in Q4 and 38% growth for the full year, which is around three times faster than SAP. We turned in a strong performance geographically, growing 33% in the Americas, 41% in EMEA and 37% in APAC. Software license update and product support revenues were up 23% on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter to 2.9 billion, and up 23% on a non-GAAP basis to 10.5 billion for the year, exceeding for the first time the $10 billion mark on this highly profitable recurring part of our business. Our customer retention rates on this business are at a new all-time high.</p>
          <p>Our non-GAAP operating income grew 31% to 3.5 billion in the quarter, resulting in margins of 49%. EPS grew 27% to $0.47 on a non-GAAP basis. Operating cash flows increased to 7.4 billion for the year, while free cash flow increased to 7.2 billion for the year. In Q4, we bought back approximately 24 million shares at an average price of 20.76. For the year, we bought back about 97 million shares at an average price of 20.54, spending a total of $2 billion. The currency impact for the quarter was a positive 6 points on revenue. Now before I turn to guidance, I want to make a few quick points about Q1.</p>
          <p>First of all, as you all know we are up against very tough Q1 comparisons this year, since we delivered 35% new software license revenue growth in Q1 of last year, on top of a great Q1 the year before, and of course I want to remind everyone that Q1 at Oracle still ends in August. Second, we are aware of the broader economic environment in which we operate and we can't predict the economy from one quarter to the next. We are confident in our model and our ability to deliver earnings growth in fiscal '09 and beyond &#x2013; because of our broad-based highly diversified customer base, both by industry and by geography.</p>
          <p>Last, BEA's contribution this quarter exceeded our expectations significantly, proving again that customers prefer to purchase these products from Oracle. Now we believe our BEA acquisition came at precisely at the right time, financially and strategically, and the BEA support base will add to our cash flow, margin, and earnings story for the year. That said, I know everyone is aware that Q1 is our first full quarter with BEA as part of Oracle, and as with every one of our past acquisitions, there is always a short period of adjustment as people and products are brought together.</p>
          <p>Now, since it is hard to forecast, I thought I'd give you some specific guidance regarding BEA. And as you can see from our Q4 results, we're integrating BEA very well, and they have already assumed our seasonal pattern, which is a very strong Q4 finish and a sequentially down Q1. As a result, we expect them to sell no more than 50 to 60 million in new licenses in Q1.</p>
          <p>With that, our guidance for Q1 is as follows. New software license revenues are expected to be up 10 to 20% year-over-year. Total revenue is expected to be up 18 to 20% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis. Total revenue on a GAAP basis is also expected to be 18 to 20%. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be 26 or $0.27. GAAP EPS for the first quarter is expected to be 17 to $0.18. This guidance assumes a tax rate of 29.9% in Q1, versus 30 last year. Now if current exchange rates for the entire quarter, that will result in five points of positive currency impact for Q1. But as you know currencies are likely to fluctuate, and as a result the final result could differ significantly. With that, I will turn over the call to Larry for his comments.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Safra. Well we like our strategy and we like our ability to execute. Execution is all about the team, and this is a strongest management team we have ever had at Oracle and it's getting stronger. We announced a new head of Oracle Japan, Endo san, who joins us from IBM. He was one of the top executives at IBM Japan, and we think he really strengthens our overall management team and gives us very, very strong leadership in Oracle Japan going forward. Also Steve Au-Yeung is now in charge of Oracle Asia Pacific, and Steve joined us from BEA. Again, we are taking a strong management team who has delivered terrific results for the last several years and we are making it stronger.</p>
          <p>The strategy: our strategy in technology is to remain number one in database and increase our overall market share. And we're doing that because we have better products than the competition. The Oracle Database is faster than IBM's DB2 on the high end, more faster (sic) and more scalable, and we deliver better cost performance than Microsoft SQL server, and that's all documented by industry standard benchmarks. So we are faster on the high end and more scalable, more secure, and we actually cost less to own and run even than Microsoft's SQL server on the low end. We are not going to sit on our laurels. We have a major database innovation that we will announce in September of this year. It is going to be a very big, an important announcement for us, and we are not &#x2013; so we are not standing still in database.</p>
          <p>In the middleware business, the other half of our technology &#x2013; overall technology business, we offer a complete and integrated middleware suite based on industry standards. And that is conspicuously different than what our competitors offer. While IBM competes in middleware based on industry standards, their middleware components are not integrated into a suite. Microsoft competes in middleware, but they don't adhere to industry standards. They have their own dot.net architecture, their own C Sharp language, and again they are not adhering to industry standards. So we are differentiated from IBM in the fact that our components are complete and integrated, and differentiated from Microsoft in that our components in middleware are standards-based.</p>
          <p>In the applications area, we intend to compete over &#x2013; based, by developing applications based on modern Internet standards and service oriented architecture, Java language. I mean SAP's applications, our number one competitor in applications, still base their development of &#x2013; even their newest products uses proprietary ABAB technology and not modern Internet standards. To compete in the application business, we have to go beyond just ERP, where SAP remains very strong. We are the number-one player in the CRM and we're the number-one player in industry-specific applications.</p>
          <p>SAP continues to focus on ERP, where they've recently announced Business By Design, which is an ERP product suite aimed at small business. Our strategy is in contrast to that, where we want to sell more applications and more value to existing midsize and large accounts. And here we have dedicated business units in retail, in telecommunications, in banking, our newly announced insurance acquisitions, health &#x2013; our newly announced healthcare global business unit, utilities, taxation. Again our strategy to beat SAP in Applications is to focus on industry standards and go beyond ERP to CRM and industry-specific applications where they are really not &#x2013; often not competitive, often aren't &#x2013; don't even have products in those areas.</p>
          <p>We like our strategy and we believe we have the right team in place to compete effectively in the marketplace for this coming year. Charles?</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Larry. The field organization executed well in Q4 to cap off another year of outperforming. For the year, we gained market share against all major competitors. As we look forward into FY'09, the pipeline indicators look positive. Our year-to-year pipeline growth for Q1 equals the growth we had a year ago. In addition, the leading indicators for future pipeline growth are pointing in the right direction. There is just a lot of activity in the Oracle Ecosystem as developers, partners, and customers are excited about our products and strategy.</p>
          <p>Let me give you some of the other indicators we look at beyond the numbers that you've seen. One example is the Oracle Technology Network, which is our developer community. We now have 4.9 million registered members, that's up 19% over the last year and 22% in BRIC countries. We have 94% more postings on oracle.com forums, 2.2 million in total. This is where technical users discussed our more than 9000 products. These forums, by the way, use many of our social networking technologies. We had a 72% increase in podcast views, and in live events, which is the best qualifier of a likely buyer, we had over 6000 events last year and 340,000 attendees, up 10% from the year before, and we are getting more senior attendees.</p>
          <p>Our largest in-person event of course is Oracle OpenWorld. Registration is now open. Compared to last year at the same time, we are up 20% on registration numbers, and we had 43,000 attendees last year. OpenWorld will be held September 21 through 25th in 2008 in San Francisco, and the Financial Analysts Day we are planning is on Thursday, September 25th. Hope to see you there.</p>
          <p>Let me comment on some customers and achievements by product category. In Database, 11g continues its momentum. We have had over 300,000 downloads since the initial release of the product back in August of 2007. And we are pleased to see that the growth of 11g adoption is about the same as 10g at the same point in the lifecycle. Some key customers using 11g include Northern California Power Agency, Fair Isaac, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, Edmonds.com, and MobilTel, which is kind of interesting because they have more than 5 million mobiles customers in Bulgaria. They upgraded to Oracle Database 11g on Linux to get higher quality of service and respond to changing business needs.</p>
          <p>We have some additional enhancements underway for 11g that will broaden its audience, such as RAC support for Oracle VM. Real application testing will be back-ported to Oracle Database 9.2 and 10.01 to help people migrate applications forward. And Oracle ODABA release two will add support for some minor databases, including SQL Server, Sybase, and DB2.</p>
          <p>Additional note, IDC just released their market share numbers for last year. Oracle is at 44.3%, IBM at 21%, Microsoft at 18.5, and we gained share against those two competitors, and the other category. 30 years into the business, we are still gaining share.</p>
          <p>Middleware. In middleware, the acquisition of BEA was well received by customers and several have called to say it's pushed Oracle into the strategic category, since many of them had major deployments of WebLogic for critical applications. We also continue to see broad adoption of Fusion Middleware by partners. In FY '08, we signed over 90 new ISVs supporting Fusion Middleware, and over 30 in Q4 alone. BEA will help significantly here.</p>
          <p>Some key wins in the quarter. For our SOA Suite, provides and shares services using SOA to connect to legacy applications in conjunction with the move away from SAP to PeopleSoft HR. HUD, or Housing and Urban Development, decided on Oracle Enterprise Workflow after struggling with a lot of hand-coded workflow in Microsoft's SharePoint. Weyerhaeuser Real Estate, an IBM shop now using Oracle Fusion Middleware with JDE. And La-Z-Boy will use SOA Suite to innovate several applications to JDE. In Enterprise Performance Management, our Hyperion product line, American Honda Finance, we beat SAP and BASi there for financial consolidation and reporting, even though they already had a license of the product for much of SAP's product line; and Cooper Industries, we beat SAP in a mostly SAP shop.</p>
          <p>Business intelligence. Our BI products more than doubled year-to-year, both in the quarter and for the year, as we continue to take share because of our modern, proven, and integrated BI platform, which can extract information from multiple sources and deliver across multiple channels with a single semantic layer to track all objects and calculations. This is the same BI platform our applications use, which is unique in the marketplace. So we beat SAP and BASi at Wal-Mart, MasterCard, Hanover Insurance, USDA. We beat Cognos and IBM on Network Appliance, Merrill Lynch, and JC Penney, and Xilinx.</p>
          <p>Content management, the Stellent acquisitions, a big deployment at Beckman and Coulter for their external website for e-commerce, we entered Ontario Ministry of Health and British Colombia Housing, where we beat EMC and Documentum.</p>
          <p>Identity and access management. PR Newswire was a big win over Computer Associates; Cisco, we beat Sun and CA there; ANZ Bank, we beat RSA and EMC; and Seagate, we will replace Sun's IBM solutions. The Sun installed base looks like an opportunity for us.</p>
          <p>In the area of applications, in Q4 we released four new advanced supply chain planning products, a new version of Agile PLM, new integration center AIA or Applications Integration Architecture, linking Siebel's trade promotion management with Demantra's advanced trade planning. This makes 15 new AIA integrations we have delivered into the marketplace, and more are on their way.</p>
          <p>We also recently formed two new global business units focused on specific industries. The first one is for health sciences, the second insurance. Some key customers in health sciences that we had  wins across ERP, CRM ProPharma and clinical applications including Pfizer, Teva Pharmaceuticals, and United Health Group. The second and more recent global business unit is for insurance. We recently announced the acquisition of two companies, AdminServer and Skywire, with award-winning packaged applications for the insurance industry.</p>
          <p>This is a large opportunity just now beginning to move to packaged applications in industries that has been primarily mainframe and customer applications. When combined with our pre-existing Siebel for insurance, billing and iFlex access, we will have a product line that spans policy administration, reading, illustration, agent desktops, and billing for life and property and casualty.</p>
          <p>We continue to land strategic enterprise-wide design wins because of the breadth of our technology products, complemented by strong ERP, CRM, and vertical applications. For example, I met with Morrisons earlier this week, an $18 billion grocer in the United Kingdom with 120,000 employees. Morrisons has a vertically integrated business model because they produce and sell their own food products. Therefore, they need applications ranging from manufacturing to supply chain to retail to CREM. They have decided to replace 25-year-old mainframe systems and move to Oracle for pricing, promotions, merchandising, business intelligence, financials, manufacturing, human resources, because they need more flexible systems. Essentially, they are moving every key business process to an Oracle application.</p>
          <p>Some of the key wins in the quarter in applications: So ERP, Qualcomm, we deploy our EBS and EPM technology worldwide. The University of Texas purchased a full ERP solution along with campus solutions for student administration. U2S is one of the largest systems, university systems, in the country, and the largest in the state of Texas. This follows a large win at City University of New York, the third largest. We won the University of Montreal, ICBC bank in China, and Scandia.</p>
          <p>In CREM, we had a strong performance in the quarter, greater than 50% growth. Siebel remains the world's leading application for managing customer data. Key wins at Motorola; Enel, which is Europe's second largest utility; Farmers Insurance; American Airlines; and Southwest Airlines. We also had a good win for Demantra at Volvo for G-Log and Oracle transportation management; Toll Holdings, which is an expansion of our footprint at one of Asia's largest integrated logistics companies; JBC and First Quality Enterprise.</p>
          <p>In Oracle financial services, we won HBOS, which is the 12th largest bank in the world and parent company of Bank of Scotland. That was a win over Temenos and Misys. We won Banco de Chile, where we beat Temenos, and TBC Bank in Georgia, which is the second largest bank in Georgia and was a win over Misys as well.</p>
          <p>In the retail vertical, we have had a very strong retail applications quarter which more than doubled year-over-year. A key win there was Media-Saturn Group, it's the number one consumer electronics retailer in Europe, they are also based in Germany. They will deploy our retail applications across 1000 stores in 15 countries.</p>
          <p>In telco &#x2013; that's always been a strong vertical for us &#x2013; we won SFR, a French wireless company with 17 million subscribers. That's a big replacement win of a failed billing implementation from a competitor. We won India's largest mobile operator and LYSE, which is a Scandinavian operator.</p>
          <p>Tax and utilities, a big win at Ohio Department of Taxation. This is a joint bid with EDS where we beat SAP. This is the first top-10 state to go with commercial software product for taxation, it is going to be an influential reference for us. Energias de Portugal, where we beat SAP in an SAP-dominated account, and Constellation Energy, where we replaced their legacy billing system. Had a big win for Linux at Diebold, and in CRM On Demand against Salesforce.com, we won a large Australian bank which was hotly contested for over a year, Cypress Semiconductor, and a large satellite-based media company.</p>
          <p>With that, and it's quite enough, I'll turn it back over to Roy.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you and congratulations on a good Q4. Safra, I was wondering if you could comment on the rebound in the Americas this quarter, as well as in the App segment. Obviously, you must have seen a nice rebound in deal closures in these areas versus February. And I guess I was wondering if you could comment or elaborate a little on the environment thus far in Q1? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we spoke about in our Q3 announcement, which was obviously in March, we already felt very confident about how things were going, really worldwide, including in North America. And we have extremely strong pipelines again, both in North America and worldwide. And feel rather confident about our prospects in Q1. It is Q1 of course, and we have extremely difficult comparisons, really probably one of the toughest comparisons we've had in a long time, since last, year Q1 was a 35% growth quarter. And so we always look at that. But so far, things look very good. Deals are closing, deals &#x2013; Q4 did not close everything. So things have started to close already now. And North America is doing very, very well, as it has been really for the past few years, just consistently doing very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And any comments on the UK at all, if you're seeing anything change there in terms of the environment for deal closings or in Europe in general?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We're not seeing a market slowdown at this point from our pipeline numbers, but it's extremely early in the quarter, and as you know, we do a large amount of our business at the end. And so we'll really won't see significant issues until much, much later if they are there. What we do have right now is our pipeline, and what we've closed so far, and things look good for us in Europe.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks a lot, and I echo Heather's congratulations there. Safra, your goal over the past five years has been 20% earnings growth, and for at least the last four of those years you've over delivered. Given where you stand today, is this a reasonable goal for the company looking forward for say the next three-plus years? And as part of that, what type of margin expansion could we think of? And from an acquisition strategy perspective, will the pace continue as we've seen over the last three-plus years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think that we think that our strategy is in any way running out of gas. So, our model is such that we have so much leverage in it that when we sell, let's say, a retail application, invariably those customers also buy some of our other applications, whether CRM or ERP, invariably they buy database and middleware. And so as our global business units continue and as our product line continues to expand, these products are very synergistic, and we really feel that our strategy has a lot of time ahead of it. And in fact, as far as a nine-inning baseball game, I'm not sure we are even in the second inning at this point. So I think we're very optimistic long-term.</p>
          <p>Larry may want to comment on that also. As for margins, our model again has enormous leverage. The maintenance base continues to grow, it is extremely profitable. It means that our customers &#x2013; we have a very, very large customer base. And they continue to want our newest software, which is what they get when they pay their maintenance. And as that continues to grow, it brings our margins up. In addition, we benefit from the massive scale of Oracle Corporation worldwide, and we benefit from the economies of scale that we get. And either as we grow or through acquisitions, we benefit from that scale and invariably we end up with some margin expansion.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I ask one very quick follow-up, more to Heather's? As you've thought about guidance, you've spoken in prior quarters about taking a look at closure rates and trying to be more or less conservative based on some of the factors at play in different quarters. As you've thought about Q1, you've said pipelines look healthy, so far so good. But have you tried to be more conservative on closure rates to get to the guidance that you got to in order to leave yourself a little bit of cushion should the environment get worse, or just the seasonality factor play in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Q3, I informed all of you that were using extremely conservative closure rates, and were particularly cautious in our guidance because Bear Stearns was going under and all sorts of things were happening literally right around that time. We were &#x2013; we sort of changed from our regular pattern for Q3, and to our benefit things worked out much better than we guided to, simply because I guess using those very conservative closure rates, et cetera, turned out to be  unnecessary. However, now we are just using our regular closure rates, et cetera, and we're being really just right down the middle. The guidance that you're getting is what we actually think is going to happen, and we do it both bottom-up and top-down. And it comes out as it comes out, and those are the numbers I'm giving you at this time.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much, and I'll add my congratulations on the quarter. I guess, Safra or Charles, could you just comment on the apps business rebound? It sounds like you guys have a large volume of deals running through your pipelines right now. Have you seen any change over the last, I guess three to six, or three to six months on just the size of those deals, from an ASP perspective? Do you see anybody sort of cutting back on the larger deals to sort of have more modular deals, and could you just comment on sort of what your thoughts are as that applies to guidance going forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are definitely large deals still out there, they do take longer to close in some cases and more people want to look at them, but as you saw in Q4, we were able to get some of those done. The pipelines are there. I think as we ship more of the integrations each quarter, our story gets stronger and that actually leads to larger deals, because we can sell an integrated suite of products. And so the underlying driver that we've been talking about is still there, so the more &#x2013; a bit more cautious environment, but again we have a big enough pipeline hopefully to get through it all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could ask just one quick follow-up question, if I was going to nitpick I guess on any, and there wasn't much to nitpick on. But it looked like the Asia-Pac sort of tech growth was a little bit slower than you might expect from that area of the world. Is that simply just a function of that particular market adopting 10-G and some of the RAC options in that business, I guess &#x2013; what's your sort of expectation going forward for that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I'd say that it's partially some of those things, but we could have executed better. And we've made a management change, as Larry spoke about. And as you know BEA did very well in middleware, and that's one of the areas we need to do better in in Asia, that did not go as well as we had hoped for the last quarter. So we are hopeful and confident that we will execute better in the APAC tech business going forward. But the opportunity is there, it's not a lack of market demand.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Charles, you said that the pipeline growth for Q1 was equal to that of about a year ago. Just curious, are you talking about the percentage growth or the absolute growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The percentage growth year-over-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just quickly, I don't want to keep asking the apps question. But you've said in the past that it's a lumpy business and we've seen that had happen through time here, and that has been proven. But no one would argue with the apparent weakness of the macroeconomy. Regardless, you guys put up some really strong results here. And I'm just curious, do you think &#x2013; I mean, you have a good purview, or view of everything out there. You have a broad view of what's happening. Do you think the apps business, or the apps market, has returned, or seen a little bit of bounce-back here? Or do you think it's more to do with Oracle execution?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know, maybe Safra can comment as well. I think it's more a market share game than anything else, our strategy is resonating with customers. We also have tremendous up-sell and cross-sell opportunities because we have a lot of customers who are newly &#x2013; kind of new to Oracle, and at least on an enterprise-wide basis. And so they have a lot of Oracle products now, and the ability for us to come in and tell a different story, and the value they can get by adding to that is just different than it was a couple of years ago. So I do think we're in a different place than everybody else.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thanks. Can you guys give us a bit of an update on the Fusion applications? In the past, we talked about an '08 launch. We'd love to know what's going to get launched when, and how you think that starts rolling through the model?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Larry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Larry, you want to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I'll take it. I think no change in terms of our schedules. So we have actually launched some Fusion applications already. We have launched a variety of CRM applications based on Fusion technology, they are available, Software-as-a-Service. Maybe the most interesting one is one called Sales Prospector, which offers a capability not available with Salesforce.com. Specifically, it data-mines your installed base and tells you what product you should be selling to that customer next, and who your best references are for selling that product. So we have got a whole second generation set of CRM products to make salespeople more productive, versus the first generation, which really was to help managers do a better job forecasting their sales.</p>
          <p>So those Fusion technology based applications are actually already in the marketplace. We will continue to deliver Fusion technology applications until ultimately we have a Fusion version of every application that we sell. But it will take some time before we get all the way through, to all the different applications that we offer. But the big &#x2013; there will a suite of Fusion applications coming out this year, next year, and the year after.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Safra, there's been concern over sales cycles extending now beyond what we've seen over the last year. Can you just help us better understand if there has been any change to the duration of what you've seen in the sales cycle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We're not seeing that. We're the same as always. It's really business as usual at Oracle, if not better.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so Larry, the On Demand business is posting pretty impressive growth, 25% growth year-over-year. For the last three years it's been stuck in about 3% of your overall revenue. Where would you like to see that going forward, as a percent of overall revenue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, I missed the first part of your question. What's growing at 3%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The On Demand business grew at roughly 25%, had a nice clip in terms of the growth rate, but ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>... as it relates to the overall revenue stream, it's about 3% of your revenue, and has been for the last three years. If you just give us a sense of how you think about the --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, or again, I'll describe it again. We've been in the On Demand business for almost a decade, and we're the second largest On Demand provider in terms of sales, behind Salesforce.com. I'll say that in Q4 was the first quarter we actually made money in the On Demand business. If you look at the On Demand business overall, again &#x2013; and we're enthusiastic about it. We continue to get better at it and grow the business. As you point out, it's not really growing any faster than our overall business; it's staying at a constant small percentage. We think that's going to change over time.</p>
          <p>But the entire On Demand industry has to be better &#x2013; get better at making money in selling On Demand software. If you look at the leader, Salesforce.com, they don't make very much money. And they've been at it for almost 10 years. It is hard to point to any Software-as-a-Service provider that's doing a good job of improving their profitability. I think that's what we are focused on, before we scale the business. The last thing we want to do is have a very large business that's not terribly profitable and drags our margins down. So we've used, if you will, our first 10 years to figure out how to do this profitably, and now that we are profitable in On Demand, hopefully we will grow at a faster rate than the businesses as a whole.</p>
