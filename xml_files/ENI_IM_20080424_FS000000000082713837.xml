          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Eni's 2008 First Quarter Results Conference Call hosted by Marco Mangiagalli, CFO. My name is Wendy, and I'll be your coordinator for this conference. Throughout the presentation, you will be on listen-only. However at the end of the call, there will be an opportunity to ask any question. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I will now hand you over to Mr. Marco Mangiagalli, to begin today's conference. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Wendy. Good afternoon, ladies and gentleman, and welcome to our first quarter results presentation. Here with me is Stefano Cao and together we'll be pleased to answer your questions at the end of the presentation.</p>
          <p>The first quarter of 2008, the Brent price reached the new highs averaging $97 per barrel and increasing by approximately 68% compared to the first quarter of 2007. The European refining margins averaged $3.8 per barrel, increasing by 25% compared to the first quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>The margins realized by our owned refineries underperformed the trend of the benchmark indicator. This is the because our refineries yield are less geared to diesel product which performed strongly and more weighted on fuel oil which posted at a strong discount versus diesel. Finally, the euro showed an appreciation of 14% versus the US dollar compared to same period of last year.</p>
          <p>As usual, I would like to remind you that Eni's results are affected by several issues including the seasonal factors affecting the demand for need to our gas and petroleum product used for residential heating. The demand for which is a highest in the first quarter of the year, the coldest month and lowest in the third quarter, the warmest month. Therefore, in this operating profit and change in net debt in the first quarter cannot be extrapolated for the year.</p>
          <p>Having said this, I'm very pleased to announce record quarterly adjusted results. These adjusted net profit amounted to &#x20AC;3.1 billion up around 14% if compared to the same period of 2007. Dollar terms the adjusted net profit increased by 23%. This trend is mainly a result of the stronger operating performance. Adjusted operating profit increased by almost 13% compared to the first quarter of 2007, totaling &#x20AC;5.9 billion. Dollar terms, the adjusted operating profit posted a 24% increase versus the first quarter of last year. This result mainly reflects the stronger upstream result that was partially compensated by the weak performance achieved in R&amp;M and petrochemical division.</p>
          <p>Let's now look in more detail at each division's business performance. As regard, E&amp;P hydrocarbon production in this first quarter of 2008, increased by 3.6% compared to the same period of 2007. Averaging 1,796,000 barrels per day. The increase is a result of the contribution from the assets acquired in Congo and the Gulf of Mexico. The Burren Energy acquisition, the start-up of Mondo in Angola and Semmani and Denise in Egypt. These positive elements were partially offset by the impact of the production sharing agreement that accounted for 78,000 barrels per day. Net of PSA effect production was up more than 8%. I can confirm the guidance on production that we provided using this strategy presentation for the full year 2008.</p>
          <p>First quarter adjusted operating profit for this division amounted to &#x20AC;4.4.billion up 40% compared to the first quarter of 2007, mainly as a consequence of higher production sold and the higher realizations prices denominated in dollars. Furthermore, the result was negatively impacted by the appreciation of the euro versus the dollar, higher operating cost, and DD&amp;A, and increased exploration CapEx, which as you know, we treat as cost incurred in the quarter.</p>
          <p>As for the Gas &amp; Power division, overall gas volumes sold both consolidated and associated increased by more than 7% in the first quarter of 2008, totaling around 29 bcm. In particular, gas sales in Italy including sales consumption slightly increased to 17 bcm as a result of a higher volumes sold to power gen, and to each division due to the cold weather conditions as well as increased gas release. These positive developments were offset by the lower volumes sold to wholesalers and industrials also, as a result of increasing competitive pressure.</p>
          <p>International gas sales increased by more than 17% totaling 12 bcm. The increase reflects the higher volumes sold in Europe, also as a consequence of the colder weather as well as increased opportunistic LNG sales to the Asian markets.</p>
          <p>Gas &amp; Power adjusted operating profit amounted to &#x20AC;1.6 billion, down 6% for this same period in 2007. The decrease is due to weaker result of the marketing business that was partially offset by improved results in the regulated business.</p>
          <p>Starting with this quarter, we will present a breakdown of the Gas &amp; Power result in three segments. Marketing which includes the marketing activity in Italy and internationally as well as the power generation business. Regulated business in Italy, which refers to <mark type="inaudible" /> and retail gas activities, and finally, international transport. Gas &amp; Power adjusted pro forma EBITDA for the first quarter of 2008, amounted to &#x20AC;1.8 billion, this compares to &#x20AC;1.9 billion in the first quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Marketing result decreased by 9%. This performance was driven by the fact that the first quarter of 2007 benefited from the reversal of a provision of around 114 million, was related to the 248 resolution issued by the Authority.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, in the first quarter of 2008, we accounted for a weaker trend in energy parameters, the mismatch between purchase and sales prices in relation to the oil price that has affected essentially the sales to wholesalers and residential segments in Italy. These negative effects were partially offset by appreciation of the euro versus the dollar and the higher volume sold also as a result of the colder weather condition. The regulated business generated &#x20AC;477 million, up 11% versus the first quarter of 2007. The increase is due to the higher volume distributed as a result of the colder weather condition as well as the two efficiency gains and incentives provided on the new investment in the transportation network.</p>
          <p>Finally, traditional transportation showed a substantially selected trend versus the first quarter of 2007. The R&amp;M division adjusted operating profit decreased by around 75% as a result of the weaker refining scenario due to the appreciation of the euro versus the dollar, and the higher utility cost.</p>
          <p>As I was saying before, it's worth saying that the margin realized by our own refineries underperformed the trend of the benchmark indicators, because our refineries yields are less geared to diesel product, which performs strongly and more weighted on fuel oil which posted a strong discount versus diesel.</p>
          <p>Marketing, the greater contribution from retail marketing in Italy also as a result of the higher market share was partially offset by the weaker performance of the wholesale segment. The first quarter of 2008 the petrochemical business, overall posted an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;68 million, compared to &#x20AC;122 million profit in 2007. This loss is due to the negative base chemical margins resulting from higher feedstock costs.</p>
          <p>The oilfield services and engineering sector first quarter adjusted operating profit amounted to &#x20AC;214 million versus &#x20AC;176 million in 2007. The increase is attributable to higher results across all business line. The other activity segment reported an operating loss of &#x20AC;46 million substantially flat year-on-year. And finally, corporate activities posted an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;73 million. The weaker performance this is the first quarter of 2007 is due to higher ICT and Communication costs.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter of 2008, operating cash flow of &#x20AC;4.8 billion and divestment totaling &#x20AC;0.3 billion funded &#x20AC;3.1 billion is CapEx, &#x20AC;1.8 billion mainly related to the completion of the Burren acquisition and a share buyback of around &#x20AC;200 million. At the end of March, the financial debt decreased to &#x20AC;15.6 billion bringing our debt-to-equity ratio to 2.35.</p>
          <p>On the basis of our revised oil price for 2008 over $88 per barrel and no additional extraordinary transactions, the net debt-to-equity ratio at the end of the year will be in line with the December 2007 level, or below from the Gazprom exercise the options on the 20% stake in GazPromNeft and on the 51% stake in the former Yukos Gas assets.</p>
          <p>Coming to the end of my presentation, let me comment on CapEx. The first quarter of 2008 capital expenditure amounted to &#x20AC;3.1 billion up 55% on like-for-like basis. This was mainly due to higher expenditure in all our core businesses. In particular upstream showed a 55% increase mainly as a consequence of a higher exploration expense in the Gulf of Mexico, Angola, Egypt and Libya as well as increased development in Egypt, Kazakhstan, Gulf of Mexico and Angola. Furthermore, they accounted for &#x20AC;324 million related to the acquisition approved and approved properties there, following the agreement signed last October.</p>
          <p>Engineering and Oilfield services have showed a 70% increase related to the construction of new offshore drilling units and other vessels. Gas &amp; Power, higher CapEx are related to the upgrading of the Italian and international transportation network.</p>
          <p>Finally, R&amp;M posted an 11% CapEx increase as referred to the ongoing refinery upgrading program. For the full year, we expect an overall CapEx of approximately &#x20AC;13.3 billion. This level is fully inline with the 2008 budget. And the full year CapEx plan we announced at last February.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. Now Stefano and I are pleased to answer to any questions that you may have.</p>

          <p>[Operator Instruction]. Our first question today comes from Gordon Gray from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. It was a question around CapEx actually it was. Just to ask firstly, are you in a position to update us on the CapEx estimates for Kashagan. Secondly, two questions, what sort or levels for Kashagan are in those targets, bearing in mind that the 13.3 billion you've obviously said for this year is running above the kind average rate at 12.5 in the full year plan, so in sort of the implicitly we're looking at the decline in of CapEx going forward. And secondly, if you could just update little bit on the announcement today on the Norwegian discovery. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Stefano. Stefano Cao. The CapEx of course, the CapEx on the first quarter, they are impacted in a fairly marginal way from Kashagan, in particular, you will see any cost increase related to Kashagan, but for the only reason that as you know, we have been running slow in the first quarter of this year as well as in the last six months of the past year. In general terms, as far as CapEx concerned, we are fully in line with the figures which we have provided in the full year plan. And you are right, the profile is, let's say front loaded. So we expect around &#x20AC;7.2 billion in the first year. And then there will be a decline in the subsequent years. As far as the Norwegian discovery concern that is a field operated by us. So it is important as far after the operation -- the operatorship. On the Goliat field this is an asset which we have been -- this is an area which has been awarded to us, as an operator we, well of course is called Afrodite. And we are quite pleased with the discovery and we will provide more information going forward. This is the announcement which is related to the NPD, Norwegian Petroleum Directorate requirements. So, we've provided you the information in the subsequent period.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The overall CapEx profile that you might remember that, in addition to what Stefano said, the contribution of the Engineering and Construction division is suppose to be far of course in the first couple of years where the strong effort being made by Saipem in increasing its fleet will be carried out and then the contribution from that division is suppose to decline as you mentioned, looking at the available CapEx profile.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just as a further clarification, I was referring at the beginning for the CapEx -- expected CapEx, for the E&amp;P full year 2008. This is composed by 6 billion development and 1.6 billion on exploration expenditure, so overall a &#x20AC;7.6 billion.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Three questions, please. First, to Marco, could you just give us an update in terms of guidance on the tax rate for the full year. I know, this quarter in particular you had a slightly lower tax rate for a number of reasons, but I was wondering if you could provide an update there. Secondly, and just -- I know you reached a settlement with Venezuelans for Dacion. I was wondering if you could let us know what the net book asset value was for Dacion? And lastly, there was a significant discovery in Egypt at Satis? I was wondering if we could have an update on Damietta Train 2. And then, some commentary around the MOU you recently signed on the Egyptian Power? Thank you</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a reason, and as you mentioned, the first quarter reported tax rate declined substantially for two main reasons. One, the new Italian fiscal regime which reduced the overall tax burden. And also the fact that in the first quarter as a consequence of the disposal by Saipem of the stake in GTT, we realized the income on investment which are taxed at a lighter tax rate. On an adjusted basis the tax rate slightly increased to 47.5%. You were asking about a guidance for the overall year, I would say that we should stay &#x2013; this what we presently use in the range of 50% for '08 while on the basis of our going down in the oil prices while in the long run we expect to have a smaller contribution from the upstream division and consequently possibly a slightly lower tax rate in the range of 48.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Venezuela. As far as, Venezuela you are right. We have found a settlement for the Dacion dispute and we have discontinued. As a result the arbitration which we had launched and the agreement is a combination of recognition of past expenses which were due, but not paid yet. And the recognition of reimbursement against the Dacion, the loss the Dacion service contract. We have not been disclosing the value. But all in all, the comment which we have made a number of times is that, with the settlement we have recover what we had in our books with and as more plus. But against that we have also managed to firstly to agree on the joint venture, which we had on Conoco. And Conoco have started production at the beginning of this year. And we have agreed to make initially a study in order to fully access the Junin Block in the Faja and then jointly derived the best way to exploit in those resources applying the available technologies, which are the combination of what we have been developing in terms of oil upgrading the <mark type="inaudible" /> technology as well as what the Venezuela have been doing in terms of upgrading. Off course there is no firm decision yet on how to proceed, but we're setting up the joint teams in order to start the study so that we can have a clear indication of what is the way forward and certainly we can see that this very good opportunity in terms of entering in the field of non-conventional oil.</p>
          <p>Egypt saw this as a 50/50 partnership with BP. You are right. It's quite a satisfactory discovery. The gas is meant suit to be the supply for the Damietta Train 2. I'm sure you are aware that in order to get the authorization to export gas via LNG from Egypt, it is important to have sufficient reserves to cover for the duration of the export through LNG for this supply over the same period to the domestic market as well as for the -- what they called the future generation. So every barrel, every cubic meter or gas we export we need to have available two more cubic meters for domestic and for the and for the future generation. Obliviously future generation is meant to be something different from proven reserves, but it can be in the probable and possible reserve. As far as Damietta, things are moving on. We are developing the prefix studies. We shall then -- a word soon be received and the target is still to take the final investment decision by the end of this year. MOU, the MOU which we singed lately it's sort of side if you side business let's say, it's the utilization of the technologies we have developed in connection with our electricity business in Italy, but with the aim of improving the efficiency of the producers, in electricity producer in Egypt, so to have additional volumes or gas available for the count and indeed available, and maybe also for the experts or this is the main target for the study which we have launching with the singing of the MOU.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon gentlemen. I am, can I just ask question standing in relation to Distrigas because I believe you are just growing has confirmed that you have tabled a bit for Distrigas, that's the first question? And secondly just on the after-dated discovery press comments could at 50 to 100 bcm, which is pretty significant and I wanted to fix this, give us any observations in relation to bracketing all type of reserve size?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Colin, as regard to Distrigas, you all say, you will might know that we have been indeed in -- we are being short listed, let say together with two other. European companies you might also know that the intension of the seller is to have not necessarily cash as a consideration of the sale, but to have swap over assets in place. With the bidders, we have submitted to the seller at least all possible assets, I would say both upstream and mid gas stream and we are now working on that had having in mind that lets say within June, we it is supposed to have the choice from the seller about the winning candidate. As far as an additional comment on the discovery we just announced I think it's highly important to say, we prefer not to disclose figures, I know that in Norway we can be pretty quickly there are figures going around, we prefer to run all the analysis and then to say what is the amount we can count on, certainly it is a good discovery. It is not a discovery which changing -- substantially changing the quality of our operations in Norway, but all in all I confirm that we are quite pleased with it.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. On the upstream, can I ask a couple questions? First of all could you remind us how much of your acquired production, you hedged last year at $60. Secondly, if you could give us an update on Turkmenistan, that could press seems to suggest some problems after the Burren acquisition? And thirdly, just say something on E&amp;P cost inflation trends in the year-to-date, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Irene you might remember that as far as the hedging, which we've put in place, we have said that we have hedged something in the range of 125, 126 million barrels over the 2008 to 2011 period, and this was exactly in line with the acquisition of the assets in Congo and in the Gulf of Mexico. And in the first quarter of 2008, something in the range of 11.5 million barrels was settled, and if you want an economic impact, it has decreased by something like 4, $4.3 per barrel at the average for our prices in liquid realization.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of Turkmenistan, first of all let me say that operation are running absolutely as normal. We are producing and we are selling the production. We're reminding ourselves of the former Burren employees, which of course adding charge as they were before of the operation. And as a company, we are in process to get ourselves better known to the authorities of Turkmenistan, which of course seems -- we had never been aware before, they are going through a process of getting acquainted with ourselves. There is no reason to over-dramatize the situation, I think we are used at similar situation. We have gone through to similar exercises in our history, but all in all we are quite happy with what we have got through the Burren acquisition particularly in Turkmenistan and we look forward to have the possibility to further expand our presence there.</p>
          <p>Turning to cost inflation, the year so far, you probably remember what I was saying during the course of our Analyst meeting and the Investors meeting. And the impression is that, the curve of inflation is easing down a little bit and they quite frankly this is what we reckon is happening. Still the costs are extremely high and they still increase. All in all, we see that the 10%, which I had been mentioning is probably a good measurement on what is the expected additional inflation.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. It's Jason from ING. I just wondered if you could give us an insights on a potential due with Gazprom in Libya, and any possible impact for a nice operations there and the timing of any parallel to that deal. And secondly, if I may, I noticed you've show the impact on gearing of $88 per barrel and I wondered if you had change your 2009 oil price assumption and that we should be looking for changes in CapEx or production under new oil price assumptions in the next future?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I listen these -- I'll address the second question, normally when we make a conference call commenting the quarterly results, you ask about what we are projecting for the year -- for the whole year. And so, we thought that it could have been worthwhile giving you a guidance about what we are presently using evidently point turn on purposes as average oil prices for 2008 and it has nothing to do with '09 or with other parameters, which we gave you during the strategy presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the first question in Gazprom in Libya, of course, I'm not here to comment what is the Gazprom position in the country. And knowing that, of course, they have won in one of the recent bids some of the inspiration areas and I believe they are going ahead with the oil and gas activities related to those areas. As far as our relationship concerned, Libya is a matter which has to do with the so called -- with the assets which are part of the strategic agreement and with Gazprom. So these are agreement with Gazprom which are the sort of a combination with the assets which we are acquiring in the country, and the asset that which we are now offering in terms -- to Gazprom. And after having done, it's all in complete analysis of situation which might be of common interest to share with Gazprom. We have identified an asset in Libya. And of course with due respect to the Libyans who have in any case do fully approved, and underlying the agreement we are considered the Elephant asset as part of these negotiation with Gazprom and particularly 50% of the equity which we own in the asset. So we are in the process of negotiating these should then find an agreement, and the agreement will be subject to be legal authorities' approval and then we will move on those bases.</p>

          <p>Fair enough. And I presume there is still option for downstream assets going towards Gazprom as well with any power for instance, as part of that strategic agreement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In fact in this so called known rational transaction as they were defined in the strategic agreement there was -- how can we change it. It's sufficiently widened selection, which could be made by Gazprom and in fact there was the possibility to carry out joint exercises either in the upstream or in the power sectors. So this is just an implementation of what was -- a way to implement what was agreed in the strategic agreement with Gazprom.</p>

          <p>Hi. I'd like ask two questions. Actually, the first one is if you could give us an update on current Karachaganak Phase III and when you would expect to sanction that project. And secondly, going through several discoveries that you've had this year so far, so you talked about Satis and Aphrodite but also Kodiak and Timor-Leste were there. If you look at all the discoveries you have done year-to-date. Could you give us an idea of how much has increased your resource base? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the update on Karachaganak Phase III that we have signed, the gas sale agreement about a year ago -- about bit more than a year ago. And we are going on with front-end engineering and design and this is going on as normal and we expect to take the final investment decision by the end of this year, maximum early next year. In terms of exploration, you are right. You mentioned some of the exploration successes Aphrodite has been, a number of time referred to. Then we have the Kitan I and II in Australia and Timor Sea in particular. As you mentioned Kodiak and Stones in the Gulf of Mexico, and in particular Kodiak and Stones are both legacy asset that formally belonging to Dominion, and we have also other discoveries. Again in Egypt <mark type="inaudible" />). We are currently testing some of these well, first well in block 15, six in Angola and we will be coming forward with the information as soon as the test is completed. We had a discovery in Pakistan, call Sakib. In UK, Jasmine part of Jasmine the J blocker for the development. All-in-all we're talking a something in the range of 180, 190 million barrel of exploration resources as you prefer. So we are quite in line with what we target for the full year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just on the &#x2013; you gave us some guidance earlier in the year that cash again was going to have some costs and timeframe laid out by the end of March and I was just wondering if you could update us on that when we're going to hear something and if you got a timeframe for that basically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a more comprehensive of that as you probably remember, because we have also to finalize this the sale and purchase agreement for these shares and for the equity which has been sold to the Kazakh, we have also to redefine the governance structure for the joint venture going forward and as well as the new scheme for the development plan and budget. Of course, on top of that, the redefinition of the development plan and budget for the experimental program, this is being discussed in these days and once these discussion will be concluded, when I say discuss I mean of course formally discuss between the joint venture and the first party and the Kazakh authorities. Once this discussion will be concluded then of course we will make a full disclosure of the date and of the CapEx.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would look at that, as I said the discussion are ongoing, we prefer not to set too specific date because it depends on the how the discussion progress.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and good afternoon. Two questions please. One is on the margins in the gas business in Marketing in the first quarter. I understand what you're saying about the deliberate 248 and the mismatch in the gas contracts and the indexation. But if those things are back down is the underlying margin better or worse than last year. In other words, are these effects temporary or should we be looking at lower margins going forward in gas marketing? And the second question is on the potential joint venture with Gazprom. This thing was first agreed, I think towards the latter end of 2006, and it's still under negotiation. I just wonder why has it taken so long, is it a sign that this is a pretty low priority on both sides or is it a sign perhaps that the potential of this joint venture for new business opportunities is some what limited or am I wrong and we will see considerable business opportunities arising from it? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Barry, this is Marco speaking. As you regard to gas margins, I would say that cleaning the picture from what you rightly mentioned that we are for the time being experiencing a situation in which I can say, we have not yet effected by the erosions, which we are planning. At the same time in the second part of the year when the renewal of the contract will take place, you know that this contracts are renewed on a manual basis and I would say end of '08 or beginning '09 when additional quantities of gas are supposed to come into the Italian market, and then we might see -- I would say the expected erosion in margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably, referring to the second question. You call it a potential joint venture, probably it's the name which is not correct. We signed an agreement in November 2006, which was encompassing a number of situations where we were going to do things together. We are implementing each of them or one after the other. There was part of the agreement on gas, the extensions of the existing contractor, the delivery of certain volumes of gas from us to Gazprom and that has been implemented.</p>
          <p>There was an agreement on the participation to the offshore for the acquisition of the former Yukos assets. We have participated, we have won the asset together with NL and you know that Gazprom has the option expiring after two years, which means within April 2009, so one more year to exercise the option and enter into the ownership of the asset. We have acquired 20% of gas on net. And so again Gazprom has the option to enter within two years, so again with the April 2009. There was an agreement related midstream joint opportunities and as you have we are jointly launching the scheme of the south stream. So that agreement encompassed a number of different opportunities and we are implementing all of them. So it's going absolutely fine so far.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, thank you for clarifying that. So, would you say you were the partner of choice for Gazprom in these kinds of activities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is by definition. We are purchasing Gazprom gas since nearly 30 years, and indeed then that you are talking to the person who has been signing that particular contract, and we have a build the Blue Stream together.</p>
