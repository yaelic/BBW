          <p>Good morning and Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the H&amp;M Three Month Report Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And just to remind you this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to hand over to today's presenters, Nils Vinge, Head of Investor Relations; and Leif Persson, the CFO. Please begin your meeting and I'll be standing by.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thank you for calling in and welcome to this telephone conference on the occasion of H&amp;M's first quarter results. You'll find the slides we'll use during the presentation on our website h&amp;m.com. With me is our CFO, Leif Persson, and we're happy to answer your questions after the presentation. Please turn to the slide, "First Quarter 2008."</p>
          <p>Sales development in Q1 was strong with good comparable sales. In the first quarter, sales excluding VAT amounted to 19.7 billion, on an increase of 18% compared to the same quarter last year. The increase in local currency was 16%, and in comparable units 3%. In February, sales increased 24% in local currency and the comparable unit increase was 10%. A positive calendar effect contributed with around five percentage points.</p>
          <p>Profitability remained high, with a gross margin of 59.6% compared to 58.9% in the same period last year. The operating profit was 3.8 billion corresponding to an operating margin of 19.2%. Profit after financial items increased by 19% to 4.1 billion, and the net profit increased 28% to 2.9 billion.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, we opened 11 stores and closed four. Well composed collections are the major factor behind our strong and profitable quarter. International catalog sales outside the Nordic countries have developed very well and are contributing to the high activity. In Germany and Austria catalog sales were launched in January. So far sales have reached to our highly set expectations.</p>
          <p>The strong sales development in combination with the lower U.S. dollar exchange rate has contributed to a record high Q1 gross margin. The dollar resulted in lower buying costs, which were partly offset by marginally higher level of price reductions and transportation.</p>
          <p>Selling and administrative cost expenses to sales increased 0.7 percentage points to 40.4%. Following further strengthening of the organization to support their rapid and efficient expansion for many years to come.</p>
          <p>In addition, the regionalization of the store logistics has led to conversion costs. These measures create an even more solid base on future growth and make us well positioned for the coming years.</p>
          <p>Sales have developed nicely in most of our markets. In Germany sales have been good. Catalog sales, which started in January in Germany and Austria, have contributed as well. H&amp;M continues to grow in the Nordic countries where we have gained market shares. The H&amp;M brand is well established in the Netherlands and appreciated by customers. In Q1, sales increased 19% in local currencies, with Internet and the catalog sales continuing to contribute at the same time as store sales have developed very nicely. In the UK, sales were slow, in line with a generally weak retail market. H&amp;M sales increased 7% in local currencies in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Business developed well in southern Europe where France became the group's second-largest market. Sales in Spain and Italy were strong as well. Sales were good also in Eastern Europe as in the US and Canada. H&amp;M's fashion is also appreciated in the Middle East and the stores have sold well. In total, there are now ten franchise stores in Dubai, Kuwait and Qatar. The response in Shanghai and Hong Kong has been fantastic. We have sold for 189 million in the first quarter and just have been present in this region less than a year.</p>
          <p>Taking a look at some key figures, the stock-in-trade increased 10% to 7.9 billion. In relation to sales, it was 9.7%, down from 10.3% last year. The current stock is well composed with a high proportion of new arrivals. Cash flow from current operations was 2.4 billion. Investments were slightly below 1 billion. Liquid funds and short-term investments increased to 22.4 billion from 20.9 billion a year-ago. If the AGM approves of the proposed dividend of SEK 14 per share or 11.6 billion altogether, funds will be significantly reduced. The return on equity was further strengthened to 43.6% compared to 38.9% a year-ago.</p>
          <p>A high level of activity continues during the spring. H&amp;M group's expansion is realized to new and existing stores, new markets, new customer offerings, new sales channels with our internally developed store concepts and through an acquisition of exciting brands and stores at Fabric Scandinavian. Fabric Scandinavian runs the store chains Weekday and Monki; it also designs and sells young fashion through our own brands such as Cheap Monday, which is sold in more than 1,000 stores in 28 countries. For H&amp;M the deal means that we strengthen our position in the interesting and fast-growing young fashion segments contributing to our future expansion.</p>
          <p>The acquisition as such is small for H&amp;M, but we see great potential in developing the stores and concepts in other markets.</p>
          <p>As usual, the greatest number of store openings occurs in Q2 and Q4; when the openings takes place varies between years. In 2008, the majority of the openings take place in the second half of the year. In Q2, the net addition of stores will be 50. In June, the first franchise store in Egypt is to open in Cairo and during the autumn, franchise sales start in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman. Preparations for the openings in Tokyo, Japan this autumn and in Moscow, Russia in the spring of 2009 are progressing as planned, and the launch of the Home Textile range is scheduled for the turn of the year.</p>
          <p>Our aim is to increase sales while maintain profitability. In total, we expect the net addition of 190 stores in 2008. The expansion will mainly be focused on the US, Spain, the UK, France, Germany and Italy. We also believe that we can increase sales in our existing units. We continue to develop our Internet and catalog sales. In January, we started catalog sales in Germany and Austria, and the reception so far is very promising. And as always, we strive to continue developing our customer offerings with new collections, new concepts and new products. We are really looking forward to the rest of this year.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention and we're now happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Tony Shiret from Credit Suisse in London. Please go ahead your line is open.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, just one question in fact. I just wondered if you could give us some sense of how long your infrastructure build is going to last. I know that there is always infrastructure build going on, but in the sense that you're changing your warehousing system at the moment. I just wondered how long this is going to last for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually it's an ongoing process. First one was opened last year, and it's running of course. The German one will be open in December. But going forward, we will have to modify the warehouse operations also in the Western part of the -- Europe. So it is an ongoing process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How many more warehouses are you going to open after the German one, would you say at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>the plan today is another one -- one more. And that -- so going forward let's say five years in the future we will probably have to add yet another one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Or another one, yes. Okay. Fine, thanks so much; that's all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Ana Kritchlow from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale in London. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. Leif, I have a question on costs first of all.  Cost of sales was about 40% I think in this quarter and I remember you mentioned 37% as a kind of rough guidance based on positive like-for-like sales growth. I am just wondering if costs again continue growing at around 20% year-on-year, will there might be some easing of?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we guided to something between 37 and 38 but that is of course for the full year. The first quarter, the selling in the first quarter is obviously lower than the average quarter. And that's also the cost rate -- it goes up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see, okay. And that's for the cost increase year-on-year at 20%. If that's likely to continue at that rate or ease off a little bit for the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The guidance for the full year between 37 and 38 is what we are aiming for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. I have a further question about the effect of Easter in March? Is it fair to say that you will have one trading day left on average a month, year-on-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, absolutely but I think it's very important that you would always look at March and April and also May together because spring always -- Easter always come differently and the start of the season comes differently according to the weather. So, it's very -- it's impossible to draw any conclusions from a single month.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us an idea as what the net effect of Easter might be on March, say the presence of Easter in the month and the extra trading day missing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think it's very difficult. But it's surely negative this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Henrik Olsson from Lincoln Mail, Tramberg . Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a question on the very impressive February sales numbers; not only was the like-for-like growth very strong but also the non-like-for-like sales were a 14% sales growth. And when I look at the store expansion figures compared to Q1 for last year the growth in number of stores has been 13.2% both if you look end term numbers and average for quarter one this year and last year. And still the growth from non-like-for-like is 14%. So to me that seems that the online activities contribute at least 1% and normally you don't have full space productivity either which indicates that the online activities could contribute as much as two or even 3% of sales. Is that a fair analysis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I wouldn't really want to go into the percentages but we are all very, very pleased with the way that the mail order has developed. So it's a very nice development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Richard Chamberlain from JPMorgan in London. Please go ahead, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. Hi guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, can I just ask you about the US it looks like the underlying performance of stores in the US has improved relative to the last couple of quarters. I wondered if you could give a bit more color on what's driving that maybe. Is it the West Coast or is it the East Coast or any bit more color on the US performance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if we divide it, if we divide the US the West Coast is very strong -- stronger than the rest of the US for us now.  It seems that they are more fashion forward there, or whatever the reason. But actually the West Coast is selling very well for us in the US. And you're right that this quarter the selling in the US has improved and we are taking a number of steps in the US and working with the stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just another -- just following up on the online performance. Just wondered if you have to change your payment terms at all in the Netherlands market for orders -- I think it's orders over &#x20AC;100. Have you made a change there in terms of delivery or payment terms? Or is that the same as it always was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. It is on the invoice and you can -- either you can choose to pay it within I think 30 days and then there is no interest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you can also pay with a credit card and you can also choose to have a credit by H&amp;M if you don't pay within the 30 days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But there is no difference between larger and smaller orders by value or -- there has been no change to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a dead silence in the room.  I am not aware of that. I'm very, very sorry about that. But if you like we can call you up later.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, or maybe I need to learn some Dutch and <mark type="inaudible" /> myself. Can I just ask one more while I've got the line. Just a question on tax, I mean, obviously the tax rate has come down quite a lot. I just wondered if you had any sort of pushback or feedback from the German tax authorities on this change in transfer pricing. I mean, I just wondered if there is any risk that that might be revoked or that the German tax authorities get very upset about that? I just wondered --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have been &#x2013; so the company has been in contact with the tax authority in a lot of different companies. And so for we have no indication whatsoever that there will be any change there. <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, I had a question on online sales. I appreciate your comments on the sales uplift you get from the online channel. But could you comment on whether there is a significant change in mix relative to in-store sales via online?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mix regarding the assortment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, more regarding the average selling prices that you are achieving online versus in-store?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a very big difference between sell-in per customer between stores and mail order. It's much, much bigger on the mail order. Well, sorry or are you meaning -- does that answer your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I was looking -- the sale increases you reported of 16% in constant FX versus the increase of 3% in units suggests that there has been somewhat of an increase in average selling prices. I was wondering whether that is driven by sales -- online sales as opposed to across the board?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As to the 16% compared to the three, the 16 and then in total, that is also -- has also been driven by the increase on the opening of the mail order in for instance in Germany and Austria.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then regarding the ASP, that has been flat in the quarter compared to last year in the group.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Hi and congratulations on your numbers. I was wondering if you could give us some flavor on future rollouts of the online sales, specifically if you have more markets targeted for this year and next year, please?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, this year the target markets are Germany and Austria, and so there's no more markets being planned for this year in mail order.</p>

          <p>I think we have to wait a bit to announce. That it's very important for us to do a  very good job on the markets where we are today now, rather than go ahead and add a number of markets and not produce.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good afternoon. Just one follow-up on your regional remarks earlier in the presentation. You put together in terms of performance, Italy and Spain on your comments. Could you, if we work out the sort of the implied like-for-like, for the numbers that we have although there seems to be quite a wide range of between these two markets. Can you give us more color on, how distant the like-for-like trends are or sort of give us a bit of an idea of the regional performance between these two countries?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, I had a question with regards to the UK sales profile.  In this difficult market environment you have a 0%, -- or a 7% local currency sales. Could you give us a flavor to which degree that is like-for-like, what is like-for-like number or what do you see with regards to the market environment, markdowns and competition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The increase in the UK comes of course from the new stores, so that's the slight decrease in the selling in comparable stores in the UK. And as we all know UK is a tough market, but we think that we're doing quite okay to this tough market and yes, so. We simply have to try to adjust as well as we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that one of the markets where you face more of a markdown pressure than in other markets you operate in?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Henrik again.  I've a follow-up question and this time on the inventory level. The inventory is at a very low level and -- both in absolute terms and in potential sales. So you have to wonder how we should interpret this -- is this just because February sales were stronger than you expected, or is it a sign that you expect lower March and April sales.  Or is it just that you can run the business with lower inventory levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No it is that we can run the business with lower inventory levels. I don't think it's on a very good level, but it's not record low compared to the selling. If we go back a couple of years ago, you will see about the same ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would like to add that the level as such is not that important more the content of inventory that matters, and that we are very pleased with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent. But will you just follow up on the point on February sales, were you surprised over the strong sales figure in February or was that in line with what you are seeing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No it was a surprise, it was of course a very good figure, it was.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Thank you. My question regarding the UK has been answered, but I was also wondering if you could comment on what the like-for-like sales development was in Spain? And if there were any other markets that we should expect were difficult, where there are still issues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think that we consider any markets difficult, although we have to adapt to different circumstances in each market and of course there's always some market space which drags behind average and this quarter it has been the UK.  But another market as other markets like Germany, which has been dragging behind for a number of years. We've been performing very well on that market. I think it's a matter of adjusting.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I was just wondering what you made of the comments from Next the other day which I suspect you saw relating to future pressures in the supply chain particularly Asia, where they were implying it would be very hard to get bought-in margin gains out of Asia come the second half of this year. With the override of it, you were in a slightly more beneficial position regarding currency; do you think their underlying comments are fair and could you tell us what you are doing to try and mitigate against any regional pressures on pricing coming out of Asia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I don't think that we would like to comment on what they have said, but of course there is of course pressure on the prices in China and in markets, but I think it's up to us to cope with that and to try to find the right players and to negotiate the right prices. And once again I don't think this is something new.  This is something which we have been fighting against and been discussing for a number of the years, so I don't see anything new in the market today.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I could add is that even though the dollar is still very weak of course but Ramadeen has been strengthened. So, that move compensates and offsets the effects from the dollar going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are we seeing any acceleration in the trends within your business to redeploy your buying's to different regions of Asia.  Are you changing your supply base faster than you were?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not really. We have always being shifting around. But I would say that China today is relatively stable when it comes to the suppliers and that is also something which we wish to have -- a bit more stable relationship to the suppliers for many different reasons.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can I also ask about ranging; you are clearly outperforming a lot of competitors at the moment in Europe. What is it in your range selection that you think you got particularly right the season, are there any specific trends that you think you've really nailed in this season?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Thank you. Just a couple of quick follow-ups if I may, I just wondered what your long-term plans are for the H&amp;M Divided brand, the more sort of teenage brand. Is that another brand that you might be looking to develop for stand-alone stores or is that just still going to be used within H&amp;M stores?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that for us Divided is a very, very important part of the H&amp;M family.  So integrated together with Hennes and Mauritz and Children. I couldn't rule out that we will break it out and have some stores. But we do feel that it complements the rest of the assortment in a very good way.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much and just another question on staff costs. Can you say what percentage of your staff in-store are part time? Just trying to get a sense of how flexible the labor force is in the event of a downturn?</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Fraser Ramzan from Lehman Brothers. Just a couple of questions. First of all you mentioned that, you thought there was going to run a much tighter stock -- or a tighter stock position. At this point in time, do you think that sort of creates any kind of markdown opportunity for you this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we've said, the level of the stock going forward, we see that in a rather much longer perspective really. If that will have an impact this year, it could be, but that's not really what we are aiming for. We are aiming much more for the longer-term perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we are already on a very good level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, but there's an intention to try over the medium term to limit the markdown further than within the strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then if I might just ask one more follow-up, maybe I haven't understood it. Within your cash flow analysis, obviously cash from operations is down, which is against the 28% rate of earnings growth, one of the big numbers is the current liability line. What's led to that big swing at the end of the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we've said before, there are three things influencing the cash flow for us here. We have an increase of credits due to the increase of the selling on mail order and we're following IFRS rules making it impossible for us to net it out now.  And the third one is that there are some effects of the new model when it comes to VAT payments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we, it takes longer for us to get back the VAT payments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you. I just want to come back to the Far East and the purchasing in Asia, in China. Isn't it so that some suppliers have problem now in China, especially as you hear that some US retailers are canceling orders and so on. Isn't that -- make your world better and perhaps if we see higher supply and the demand is not as strong. Do you believe that this could prevent inflation and even the prices in China should come down later this year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Also coming back on the US performance according to my calculations, right or wrong.  I see that like-for-like probably picked up from 2% level in Q4, to 8% level in Q1.  You said something that you have taken some actions -- what are you talking about. Have you done any specific things or actions in US in Q1, who have paid out in better like-for-like?</p>

          <p>Hello, good day. I had one question regarding your tax rate and late last year you had introduced a new internal processing architecture that led to a now much lower tax rate. Did you experience any opposition from local tax authorities or do you see any points that could endanger this newly reached level of taxation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is our best judgment and we have been having talks with tax authorities in a number of our countries also and this is our best judgment of where will we land.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I just had a question on the SG&amp;A expenses and you made comments about two impacts on why it went up as a percent of sales a little bit at least. And could you just comment on which one was the strongest one of them; was it the sort of the expansion of your backload to open up new markets and initiatives or was it the change in cost for changing your logistics. Could you give us a feel for that?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I was just wondering with regards to your CapEx if you could tell us how much of that related to refurbs rather than new stores or DCs etcetera in the quarter. One of the reasons for asking is that I was aware that you had found a satisfactory or exciting refit opportunity -- could you tell us whether you've, or how far you are in rolling that out across the estate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually I don't have the breakdown between refurbishment and new stores to for the first quarter. I am very sorry about that -- we don't have that available.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us an indication of how far through the estate you are with the new fits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're talking about the way we refurb stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I was under the impression Nils that last year you talked about stepping out the CapEx in this area, having found the format that you are excited about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly and we've doubled the number of refurbs last year and we have said that this year we would plan to be on the same level, and increase even more with expansion. So that's still the case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when you say double, what was that in absolute numbers? How many stores did you do last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Around a 100 last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And to what extent should I look at your exciting refit in, or new store in Regent Street as a guide to where you are taking the look of the stores, or is that exceptional in nature?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is a flagship store of course and the flagship stores are a bit exceptional, but we're very happy and pleased with it and I hope you're impressed as well. It seems like the customers are pleased.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It looks very good. But it is quite a significant departure in some aspects of the fit and I wonder whether that's something you're going to roll out across the universe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is a flagship store but of course the flagship stores are the stores where we pick the ideas and use for a number of other stores as well, maybe not in exactly the same style, but we will use a lot of the things from the flagship stores.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
