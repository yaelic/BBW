          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the fiscal full year and fourth quarter earnings conference call. My name is Brittany, and I will be your operator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations of the Walt Disney Company. Please proceed.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Brittany. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Walt Disney Company's fourth quarter 2009 earnings call. Our press release was issued a few minutes ago. It's now available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast, and that webcast will be available on our website as will a replay and transcript of today's remarks.</p>
          <p>Joining me in Burbank for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's President and Chief Executive Officer. And for his 46th, and as it turns out, final earnings call as Chief Financial Officer, Tom Staggs.</p>
          <p>As I'm sure you saw, Bob made an important executive announcement this morning. He's going to begin with some comments about that announcement. Then Bob and Tom will speak about earnings. And then we will, of course, be happy to take your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob, and we will get started.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lowell, and good afternoon. As you know, we announced earlier today that on January 1 Tom Staggs will assume the role of Chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, while Jay Rasulo, who currently holds that position, will become Senior Executive Vice President and Disney's Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>Jay and Tom are dynamic, experienced, and versatile executives who have each been at Disney for around 20 years. They know and understand the company and its brands intimately and are very effective leaders whose backgrounds are well suited for their new roles. Since I've been CEO, they've been a critical part of the team helping implement the strategy that's led to our success. They're also ready for some exciting new challenges that will benefit both them and our company.</p>
          <p>Tom, I think you'd all agree, is one of the best CFOs around, and over the last decade he's worked closely with me guiding the company strategically and has played a big part in everything from the Pixar and Marvel acquisitions, to reconfiguring our management incentive system, to helping ensure our team does the best possible job for its shareholders. Throughout, he's done a great job of making sure our capital is put to the wisest possible use for long-term growth, as well as managing costs across the company. He's also played a key role in managing the Disney brand and leading a very successful implementation of our company-wide healthy food and environmental policies.</p>
          <p>Jay has had great success. He has great business skills and instincts and substantial creative experience as well. Under his leadership, the Disney park experience is reaching more people than ever before while enhancing its well-deserved reputation for quality. Even while overseeing major expansions in Anaheim and Hong Kong, Jay has done a fantastic job over the last seven years of taking our Parks and Resorts business beyond the theme park gates as we have built up our cruise line, vacation club, and family tour businesses. He's also successfully positioned our parks during the economic downturn through some really innovative marketing and smart management. Jay has also led our Shanghai park development efforts, and we're very proud of the work he and his team have done.</p>
          <p>From my perspective, it's incredibly valuable to a corporation like Disney to have executives gain experience in various parts of the organization. It gives them a new set of challenges, new perspectives, and a great opportunity for continued growth. Over the longer term, the practice of motivating and developing executives by providing new or expanded opportunities will help us attract and retain talented people and will serve the company well.</p>
          <p>Given that he's been CFO for over a decade, I know you'll miss Tom. As many of you can attest, Tom has done a great job providing information and perspective that has served both investors and the company well, and I know that Jay will continue in the tradition Tom has established, serving us all equally well. I'm really excited about continuing to collaborate with Jay and Tom in their new roles and feel these steps strengthen the management team that's already the best in the business.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to turn to our earnings. Over the last 18 months I've spoken to you about how we've sought to maintain our strategic focus while reshaping the company to both withstand the weak economy and to tackle the many challenges facing our businesses. We believe we've delivered on those objectives, putting Disney in a strong competitive position while enhancing the company's ability to deliver long-term value to shareholders. For the quarter, our earnings improved over a year ago, largely due to the performance of our media networks.</p>
          <p>While there are some signs of recovery, the environment remains challenging, and we're managing accordingly. Tom will speak in detail about our financial performance, but I wanted to highlight a few of the steps we've taken to advance our fundamental strategic goals of building on our position as a leader in the creation of high quality branded content, of using technology to make that content more compelling and to reach more consumers in more ways, and of making Disney an even more prominent provider of entertainment globally.</p>
          <p>As you know, last week the Chinese government gave its approval for a Disney theme park in Shanghai and we're absolutely delighted this significant milestone has been reached and look forward to finalizing a deal with our partners in Shanghai to build a world-class resort where the people of China will be able to enjoy firsthand an amazing mix of characters, stories, and experiences. With 1.3 billion people, increasing affluence, and one of the world's most unique and dynamic cultures, China is an important and promising country for us, and we will not only become more so in the years to come, but we feel truly privileged to have this opportunity.</p>
          <p>We're also working toward closing the Marvel deal. Since we announced the acquisition at the end of August, it's become even clearer to us just how well known and appealing Marvel characters are around the world. And we're looking forward to increasing the visibility and value of Marvel's characters and stories across our businesses, platforms, and global markets.</p>
          <p>As our numbers indicate, our studio had an extremely disappointing year in 2009. This is primarily due to the performance of our live action slate, but we also see challenges to the motion picture industry business model, and we are taking steps to address this. Our choice of Rich Ross as the new head of the studio is designed to both redirect and improve its creative endeavors as well as to immediately and properly address the secular changes we're seeing.</p>
          <p>This requires aggressive focus on the cost of producing, marketing, and distributing our films. It also requires challenging the status quo of a business that is already witnessing real change in how consumers use their time and spend their money as entertainment sources proliferate and access to them becomes significantly easier. The studio restructuring announced yesterday is in keeping with this approach.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the spread of faster Internet connectivity will increase global piracy threats, and it is imperative the industry address these threats with vigor, cohesiveness, and a real sense the peril is both real and immediate.</p>
          <p>By adding Marvel to our slate of Disney, Pixar, and Pixar films, we will in the coming year be making movies under three of the best known labels in family entertainment. These brands resonate with consumers globally and give us a competitive advantage in a world of nearly limitless choice.</p>
          <p>We'll also continue to focus our investment on franchise properties like Princess and the Frog, Cars 2, Toy Story 3, and Pirates 4. When our franchise films are successful, they create a wave across the company that can lift up all of our Disney branded businesses.</p>
          <p>While it remains a challenging time, it's also a very exciting one. Our Parks and Resorts business is expanding with the addition of attractions that bring together great creativity and fantastic new technologies at Disney's California Adventure and Hong Kong Disneyland and at the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World. Work is well underway on our new family resort in Hawaii and on two magnificent new cruise ships whose design we unveiled a couple of weeks ago in New York.</p>
          <p>At ABC we're off to a solid start in the fall season with several of the most watched shows, including new hits like Modern Family, Flash Forward, and V and favorites like Grey's Anatomy and Desperate Housewives.  ABC Family is a real success story as well, attracting a growing audience through terrific original programming while Disney Channel has been posting its highest ever domestic ratings. The launch of the boy-focused Disney XD has been successful in the U.S. and several key global markets while overall Disney Channel continues to show impressive international subscriber growth.</p>
          <p>Earlier this year ESPN also made a major move internationally with its purchase of Premier League rights in the U.K. and has deepened its relationship with its most avid fans by setting up local sports portals in key cities, including Chicago, Dallas, and Boston with New York and Los Angeles to come soon.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, ESPN posted its biggest-ever audience numbers, helped in particular by college and pro football. Now 30 years old, ESPN remains an incredible innovator, both technologically and in the quality and scope of its content, bringing more great sports to more fans around the world in more ways than ever before.</p>
          <p>ABC, ESPN, and Disney Channel remain three of the most creative and valuable brands in entertainment, and all three of them are finding ways to reach new audiences in new ways and new places. While it's been a very challenging period, the focus of our strategy has remained consistent, invest in great content and experiences, nurture an environment where creativity can flourish, and innovate aggressively to maintain relevance and meet the needs of our consumers. By keeping this focus and executing skillfully, we believe Disney's value can only increase over the long-term, and now I will turn things over to Tom. Tom?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we turn to your questions, I'll take a few minutes to highlight the key drivers for Q4 and touch on some of the factors that are likely to influence our results in fiscal 2010.</p>
          <p>At Media, cable networks operating income was up in the quarter driven by ESPN. ESPN benefited from the recognition of 128 million more in net deferred affiliate revenue in this fourth quarter compared to the prior Q4. ESPN's operating income was also boosted by an extra week of subscriber revenue and higher subscriber rates compared to the prior year, partially offset by higher programming costs associated with new deals with the FCC, U.S. Tennis Open, and the English Premier League football.</p>
          <p>ESPN ad sales came in flat for the prior year for the quarter. However, adjusting for the effect of the 53rd week, as well as the relative timing of major sports events, we estimate that ad sales would have been down by almost 3%. Despite the tough environment and the increased investment in programming, our combined cable networks delivered growth this fiscal year, which is evidence of their strong business models and position in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>At Broadcasting, results improved on higher sales of ABC-produced shows, including Grey's Anatomy.  At ABC favorable timing of pilot costs and the extra week in the quarter offset the impact of lower ratings.</p>
          <p>Q4 ad revenue at our TV stations, excluding the extra week of sales, came in just over 15% below the prior year, although the local ad market has shown some signs of improvement. We're seeing a number of encouraging signs elsewhere in the ad market as well. So far in Q1 network scatter pricing is running more than 20% above up front pricing levels. Moreover, option pickups for our Q2 are the highest that we have seen in the last 10 years. We've also seen some improvement in ad sales trends at ESPN. Q1 comparisons at our TV stations are made tougher due to last year's political ad revenue.</p>
          <p>Bob mentioned we're disappointed with the results at the Studio where operating performance was lower driven by film cost writedowns. Music sales were also off somewhat compared to last year's Q4, which included strong releases from the Jonas Brothers and Miley Cyrus. Looking forward, the Studio has a strong slate of upcoming films for 2010. Key releases include our animated film, The Princess and the Frog, coming to theaters nationwide on December 11, Alice in Wonderland on March 5, and Prince of Persia, Toy Story 3, and Sorcerer's Apprentice, all three of which are slated for release this summer.</p>
          <p>At our Consumer Product segment, operating results reflected the difficult retail environment's impact on our licensing, stores, and publishing businesses as well as the strength of Hannah Montana and High School Musical properties in Q4 of the prior year. Lower sales of merchandise across most categories drove a 20% decline in earned revenues at licensing for the quarter in part because the impact of the downturn was not fully evident in our licensing business until the beginning of calendar 2009.</p>
          <p>Turning to Parks and Resorts, whose results have recently taken on even greater significance in my mind, attendance at our domestic parks was up 10% in Q4, driven by the extra week in this year's fourth quarter and continued solid response to our promotional offers. Excluding the impact of the extra week, combined attendance was up 3% with a 15% increase at Disneyland offsetting a 3% decline at Walt Disney World. Walt Disney World's occupancy came in at 84%, five percentage points below the prior year,, while Disneyland's occupancy was four percentage points lower than last year, also at 84%.</p>
          <p>Not surprisingly, our promotional packages led to greater room and admissions discounting, which contributed to softer guest spending. Per capita guest spending at our domestic parks decreased by 10%, and per room spending at our domestic resorts was off by 7%.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, Q1 domestic bookings at our resorts are running roughly 5% behind this time last year. As we saw in the last few quarters, bookings are tending to take place closer to actual travel dates. It's difficult to predict how long the downturn will impact consumer spending and travel. We will continue to gauge the market and respond to promotions that we feel are appropriate, including our recently announced offers which extend through March at Walt Disney World and through April at Disneyland. These promotions have been well received, and there has been a pickup in the bookings pace since we announced them.</p>
          <p>Our Parks Management has done a fine job of managing costs throughout this past year, and those efforts continue as we enter 2010. At the same time we remain committed to delivering the premium guest experience people expect from our parks and resorts.</p>
          <p>As we enter 2010 we're pleased with some of the trends we're seeing, but we also expect that the economic environment is likely to continue to pose challenges. We expect our pension and post retirement medical expense to increase by approximately $270 million this year, driven in part by lower discount rates. Approximately half of this amount will impact our Parks and Resorts segment.</p>
          <p>The relative strength of our cash flow in 2009 provides evidence of our ongoing focus on closely managing our spending, especially during the current downturn. At the same time, we remain committed to allocating capital toward growth opportunities that maximize value for our shareholders. Our first priority is to invest in existing businesses or new growth opportunities that can generate attractive returns. These include selectively increasing our investment in sports programming and in other television, film, and video game content.</p>
          <p>In addition, we will increase capital expenditures in 2010 for key initiatives at Parks and Resorts, including the expansion of California Adventure at Disneyland Resort, the construction of our new ships at Disney Cruise Lines, as well as new attractions at Walt Disney World and at our parks in Paris and Hong Kong.</p>
          <p>We are also willing to pursue acquisitions to the extent we 're convinced that they enable us to sustain or build competitive advantage and deliver strong returns. The pending acquisition of Marvel illustrates well the type of opportunity that we believe can utilize our existing strengths to drive future growth from high quality branded content.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we expect to continue returning capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. We purchased only a modest number of our shares during Q4 given constraints imposed by the pending Marvel acquisition. However, we continue to believe our shares remain attractive at current levels and expect to continue our repurchase activity.</p>
          <p>Our strong balance sheet and diversified revenue base position us well to successfully navigate through the current economic conditions. More than ever we're focused on managing the financial discipline while we continue to invest in Disney's brands by creating high quality content and experiences that can be leveraged across our businesses to maximize shareholder value over time.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to thank all of you for your time and interest not just today but over the last 11 or so years. I'll miss my current position, but I'm excited by the prospect of my new role. Having worked with Jay for 20 years, I also know that he will do a fantastic job as CFO. As importantly, Jay and I both have the benefit of extraordinarily strong teams within our respective organizations, and that gives us great confidence and comfort in our new assignments.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the call back to Lowell for Q&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">

          <p>Okay, thanks, Tom. Operator, we are ready for the first question.</p>

      <speaker id="0">

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks so much, well, Tom, it looks like you should start your Chinese and Mandarin lessons right away. I mean, I guess, it's really not a question, but from the outside looking in, I would say this positions both you and Jay as potential CEO candidates down the road when Bob decides to hang it up in 10 or 20 years, so I'm just curious what advice you gave or would give to Jay and what advice he might have given to you as you guys trade jobs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm certainly not going to speculate on what the future hold, and I know that for the moment Jay and I are both focused on the roles that we are assuming. As I mentioned in my comments, Jay and I have worked together for 20 years and know each other well, and I think that gives us both great confidence in the future for both organizations. I'd just also reiterate that because there's such strong organizations in place, that makes this transition that much easier. And so I think that we're both looking forward to it. And I think that neither one of us is going far. We'll both be there to give each other advice as we go. And I think that that will serve us both well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could just ask a follow-up then, in the movie writedowns for the quarter, was this for only films already released, or does this include Rich having a chance to review the prospects for the pipeline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The writedowns that you saw in Q4 are principally for films that have been released to-date. There are some film costs for projects that were in the works that we had previously decided to not pursue. However, it does not reflect decisions that Rich has made since the time he took over. That was actually after the balance sheet date.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif-Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good luck everybody at your new jobs. Bob, when you think about fiscal year 2010, I was wondering if you could just give us some thoughts about where you think the bigger drivers will be. Will it be revenue, and if so, where, and can you discuss the outlook for cost? Is there further &#x2013; any room for further improvement?  And secondly, how different will the Shanghai theme park be, and can you tell us what your share of costs will be and what the expected structure will be?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the second part of the question, Jessica, since we've announced that the approval that we got from Beijing will enable us to proceed to conclude a long form agreement or formal agreement with Shanghai, we've decided with Shanghai not to release any more details about the nature of the park or the nature of the relationship until we conclude the final agreement. We are in a design and development phase, though, and are giving considerable thought to what the park will look like and will work closely with our partners in Shanghai in that regard, particularly once the agreement is finalized.</p>
          <p>In terms of leverage both on the cost side and on the revenue side for 2010, Tom cited some. Certainly on the movie side we're really excited about Princess and the Frog and Alice in Wonderland, Toy Story 3, Prince of Persia, and so you can expect that the titles we have coming into the marketplace for 2010 should outperform some of the titles we have in 2009. But the DVD release of a number of those titles won't come until the next fiscal year. So we won't benefit fully from that.</p>
          <p>We are going to watch, obviously, very carefully results in our parks. Although if you look back to prior economic downturns, we tended to lag recovery a bit. That has to do in part with just the way vacations are planned. We're hopeful that we'll see a strengthening economy and therefore a strengthening business. But as Tom also mentioned, we don't have great visibility there.</p>
          <p>I'd say the biggest area in terms of revenue, potential revenue improvement for fiscal 2010 will come on the advertising front where Tom mentioned that sales are generally good at our media networks for the quarter that we're currently in. Again, we're not making any predictions formally about the rest of the year. We're taking more of a cautious approach. And with that in mind, because visibility is still somewhat limited, although signs are encouraging, we're continuing to proceed, in terms of our vigilance on the cost perspective, as though this is going to be a challenging economy and environment for basically the duration of the year.</p>
          <p>I had the chance to speak with a few of our theme park executives this morning, and they talked pretty aggressively about continuing to look at costs, and I think that's a prudent thing to do. And as I said, we'll see exactly how the year progresses.</p>
          <p>I also want to remind you that there are some sports rights issues from the comparison perspective that we'll deal with in fiscal 2010. The purchase of European Premier &#x2013; English Premier League, for instance, will have an impact on ESPN. And as you know, we're investing in a fair amount of initiatives that are designed to create long-term growth, and the costs of some of those initiatives will also kick in in 2010.</p>
          <p>A lot of that comes on the Parks and Resorts front with our cruise ships and the expansions that we've mentioned, and some of it is in some other businesses as well, although the dominant expense increase comes on the Parks and Resorts front, particularly in an area like cruise, for instance, where there will be increased spending as the year progresses. But since the boat won't be launched until fiscal 2011, we won't see the benefit of that in the revenue coming in until fiscal '11.</p>
          <p>So we're looking at a year that at least at the beginning is showing some potential signs of improvement. But I want to emphasize that visibility is somewhat limited and we're going to continue to address the cost side, particularly with the economy being somewhat uncertain.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good afternoon. First, congratulations, Tom, on the new job. I just wanted to ask one question on the park margins and cost structure. It looks like costs were down about 4% or so for the full year, and I recognize that part of the cost structure is variable, but just given the pension costs that Tom, that you mentioned, if revenues at parks are kind of flat to maybe up a little bit in 2010, how should we think about the cost growth in that context?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Spencer, thanks. We've discussed a little bit the nature of the actions on cost that the parks have taken in the year, and really the bulk of it was designed to be the kind of thing, the kind of cost cuts that were structural and that could be sustained. And so I think that bodes well for us. Now getting something like half of this increase in the pension and post retirement medical costs, that clearly is going to have an impact on margins versus where they would otherwise be. I'd also say that this is a group that consistently looks for efficiency and productivity measures. But at the same time some of the actions that we've taken over the last year are in the way of cost deferral, and so as time goes on, some of those will find their way back into the cost base, including to a certain extent in 2010, a good part of the employee base did not take raises in 2009, et cetera. There were certain park hours that were trimmed back that we'll have to take a look at in the context of the overall demand. So there is a chunk of it that is variable and will come back in. There's a portion of the cost savings that are permanent, but there's also a portion that I expect will resume some upward pressure on growth just as time goes by in the natural course of things.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>My question is you mentioned that you expect further ad improvement at ESPN. And I know you don't want to give guidance, but maybe you could just give us some things to think about. Because I'm looking at it and saying, well, ratings look like they're just doing really well. Scatter pricing is improving. Auto is picking up, and I think NASCAR has been a bit of a drag. So I'm trying to just figure out the trajectory of how those dynamics play themselves out, and then recognizing there would be difficult comps in the last year with the loss of the extra week. Is there anything else I should be thinking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the numbers for ESPN from a ratings perspective, as you mentioned, Scott, and as Tom and I both addressed, are fantastic. They've just had a great quarter, and the numbers continue to be strong. And as &#x2013; obviously impacting them from a sales perspective, aided by a marketplace that is definitely showing some signs of recovery. But not only won't we give guidance, ESPN would be the first to admit that while they're experiencing a strong market now, there's still no guarantee that will continue, and we'd prefer not to predict that it will.</p>
          <p>They are seeing strength across multiple sectors. You mentioned Automotive. Men's grooming is up. Insurance is strong. There's good business from the movie studios. Retail also very strong. Those are all good signs. The other thing that's interesting is that ESPN's strength in ratings and the marketplace in general in terms of avails, particularly in prime time, is getting ESPN to compete for dollars beyond sports dollars, and that's a pretty unique position for a sports cable network to be in and a position that ESPN has not found itself in very often in the past. And so it's clear that the investment that ESPN has made in its programming and the strengthening of its brand is having an interesting impact, not just only on the ratings, but on the way ESPN is perceived from a marketplace perspective.</p>
          <p>The other thing I want to add that's also encouraging, and I realize I'm going to caveat all of this by saying again no guidance and don't necessarily take this to the bank for the whole year, but ESPN is showing some really encouraging growth on the digital front, both their dot-com performance, their mobile performance, also their ESPN 360 is all improving. And they're turning that into advertising revenue as well. And just a small example, but there are four million downloads of the ScoreCenter app on the iPhone. And of those four million downloads, two million of those users are using ScoreCenter regularly, and it's advertiser supported. And so it's starting to generate some real revenue. Small when you compare it to the total, but some pretty encouraging signs in terms of digital advertising growth there as well.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, the only thing I would add is that when you think about it, what ESPN has been doing is continuing to build out its position. So Bob mentioned ESPN 360 where subscribers have more than doubled in the past year. Similarly, ESPN new subscribers have more than doubled in the past year. And so these other businesses that they've been quietly building, I think, bode well for ESPN's future and for their overall position. So we're encouraged by the near term signs we're seeing that Bob said, but we're also feeling good about how they're positioning and investing for the long term.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. So retransmission consent and getting paid for the broadcast networks and stations is a topic that's been around for a while, but it's certainly heating up lately. Wondering if you can give us an update on your thoughts. You have fewer stations, of course, but still a pretty sizable footprint. Is seeking compensation for your network content through retransmission something that you are looking to explore, and is it something you'd rather do at the network level or at the station level?  And then just one other thing, Bob, you talked about with a little more emphasis I feel like on this call, the need for vigilance around protecting IP as broadband penetration increases. Is that something that you're kind of stepping up, and can you speak to any significance to comments on this call versus prior calls?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the piracy front, it's definitely something that we're more interested in and more worried about. And as we watch with great interest growth and penetration of high speed broadband connectivity, not just in the United States, but in markets across the globe, it's clear that while that creates some real opportunity for us in terms of robust means of distributing our content to consumers on new platforms, it also, I believe, raises the threat in terms of piracy. And in certain markets, South Korea is a great example, where broadband connectivity at really high speed is ubiquitous, the piracy issue is far greater.</p>
          <p>And I think that while this industry has talked a lot about piracy as an issue and has done certain things, needs very much to galvanize around this issue as probably not only its biggest threat, but one of its most critical and important strategies going into the future. And we are at the table with others in the industry looking for solutions, attempting to create a cohesive approach, and really trying to attack this on a multiple or multi-layer, in a multi-layer way. And I think it's the most important thing usually in dealing with a threat is to recognize its existence. And so our articulation of this issue is in part designed to do just that.</p>
          <p>On the retransmission front, look, we have 10 great stations and a very successful network. And have long believed that the value that those stations and that network creates not only for consumers but for multi-channel providers is significant. And we are intent on getting paid marketplace prices or fair market value, I should say, for those stations and that network. We've had a good relationship with multi-channel providers over the years that have created great value for us and paid us well. Just as while they've been paying us well we've been continuing to increase value for them by investing in our programming and our brands. ESPN's probably the best example of that, but Disney Channel, ABC Family, we could name a bunch.</p>
          <p>We obviously are watching very carefully the dynamic in the marketplace about retransmission consent and fully expect to participate in the trend, however it goes, and continue to work as closely as we possibly can with multi-channel providers to not only derive value and preserve and protect shareholder value for us, but to make sure that the business or the business model of multi-channel service continues to create a real value. It's very, very important for us.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks so much. I just had a question on the ESPN deferral for Mr. Staggs. Maybe I have this wrong. I always thought the number sort of trued up between what you deferred and what you recognized for the year. And I had a deferral last year of 390 or a recognition in Q4 of last year of 396. And I was sort of expecting something less than that in this quarter that you reported. Can you just elaborate on that a bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, the number that we cited, the 128, is the net differential in the deferred revenues that were recognized in this quarter versus the number of or the amount of deferred revenues in the prior year quarter. So as I recall, it was as you mentioned 396, something like that, in the fourth quarter last year. So we recognized net deferred revenues of 128 million more than that in this year. And that is driven by primarily the normal increase in subscriber rates. Now it was also driven this year by a difference in the timing of the recognition. In other words, there was a key threshold that we met in Q3 of last year that we met in Q4 of this year.</p>
          <p>So that made the differential in Q4 that much larger, but the differential for the year, by and large, is only going to reflect the changing rates. There's a very small anomaly this year that has to do with the 53rd week, because the calendars for accounting for us don't sync up exactly with the calendars for the contracts, and so there's a small amount of revenues that were in the 53rd week that were deferred that will in fact be recognized in 2010, but that is less than $10 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you just &#x2013; can you elaborate a bit just on the operating income losses at the Interactive segment?  In other words, I would sort of think that that &#x2013; that most of the revenues that were generated there were sort of paid for in some other part of the ecosystem, and therefore it'd sort of generate smaller losses or gains as a function of the crappy display market that we're in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no, there's two things to think about in this regard, in regards to Media group. Right now there's &#x2013; we're making an investment in video games, and that takes place there and that we've talked about the fact we're investing there. We're currently in a loss situation. It's something that we'd like to see over the next few years reverse itself as we build out to scale in that business. So that's going on there.</p>
          <p>On the other side you've got the online business and the multi-player games business. And in that I think that arguably there's some of that activity which is marketing other parts of the business in Disney in general. So surely that, a portion of the loss there is in the efforts to better market our properties broadly. But if you look at the online business, we've continued to see growth in advertising revenue there, especially in the video side of the equation, and we've also seen nice growth in the MMOG business driven by Club Penguin where the subscribers have grown quite nicely. So that's really how you break down the business and what's driving that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Tom, on the past few calls you've talked about weakness in the licensing business, and I just wonder how that market's looking right now and is perhaps your content cycle helping that market?  And then what's been the reaction of your licensing partners to the Marvel deal, and how have those conversations gone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The license business I would say this, I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we didn't really see the full effect of the downturn until we got to the beginning of calendar 2009. And so that's still going on in the backdrop. So on a relative basis, we still see some year-over-year softness there. Also, even though I think we've seen some encouraging news on the advertising side that Bob cited, et cetera, this holiday period, of course, much of it was determined by the extent to which people were ready to place orders over the last few months, and so that's going to impact us to a certain extent. Now the question is what will come in terms of reorders, the pace of that, et cetera, and so that remains to be seen.</p>
          <p>But the content cycle, I would say, we discussed a little bit of softness due to tough comparisons to Hannah Montana and High School Musical. Now as we look forward I like the trend in the content cycle. I like the refresh that's going on there, Toy Story being probably first and foremost, but also some of these other properties that we have high hopes for, and it'd be interesting to see whether we continue to go with fairies, which we like to do. We have Princess and the Frog, which is another princess to add to that lineup, which as I think you know is an important set of franchises for us. Cars coming a little bit later on, another year down the road, and Cars, of course, has been one of our most important franchises, and the prospect of a sequel to that film really bodes well.</p>
          <p>So we like the way the content cycle is going from here. Marvel clearly is an augmentation of that overall. And I don't know that we have any specific reaction from licensees at this point, but I think that as Bob said earlier, as we've gotten closer to it, we think the prospects for Marvel are at least as good as we thought at the time that we entered in the transaction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're right. We haven't gotten much direct reaction, other than to hear from certain licensees just how much interest there is out there both in the U.S. and in international markets about Marvel properties. And there's real excitement about the films that they have coming up or that are being made by others, including Iron Man 2 and another sequel to Spiderman and some of the other properties that they have in the marketplace. We think it's going to be a great opportunity for us down the road, and we're excited about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, can I just ask you a question that. Let me follow up with something different. In the past weeks you're starting to see some real discounting at retail for new Blu-Ray and DVD disks. And as someone -- and is your company going to invest in premium content and premium brands, I wonder how do you respond?  How do you view the heavy discounting going on at retail for DVDs?  And does Disney have anything in their deals that precludes the kind of discounting that could possibly hurt some of the franchises that you've invested in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, no, we &#x2013; the pricing is determined by retailers, not by us. We sell them our goods, and they determine how to price. And as we've seen in the past, typically when they discount, they discount on new titles anyway to create traffic, and there's some good titles in the marketplace to use to do that. However, there is discounting beyond new releases, particularly on library product. And I think that's a sign of what we've been talking about, which is both downturn in the economy and also real secular change in the business. One of the interesting things, by the way, is in talking with our home video guys, in prior economic downturns, library typically held up better than new release products, and this time around they're finding that library is down as well, which suggests to us that some of the secular change that we're seeing might be evidencing itself in how library is being sold.</p>
          <p>It's a pretty interesting trend, and we continue to believe that there's just greater competition for people's time and money in the marketplace, just more things for people to do. We don't see people building libraries as much as they did when DVD came along after VHS. A lot of those libraries have already been built. And it causes us to really reconsider not only what we're investing in our films but how we market and how we distribute them. And so all the changes that we've made in the studio are indicative of concerns we have about the marketplace that go beyond just the economy. They're not temporary.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Two questions, one on cable margins, which came in better than expected, at least on my end, this quarter. I think there was a Jetix rebrand and also the U.K. launch. Could you just help us, and Tom, if you could quantify how much of those two buckets were in the quarter and whether those two continue on into 1Q, and then on the film side, I wanted to ask about Christmas Carol and then Pirates 4. What's your reaction to A Christmas Carol box office numbers so far? How do you think about 3-D in that movie in future holiday periods?  And what's the timing on Pirates 4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll take, Ben, I'll take the question about Pirates 4 and Christmas Carol. First of all, on Pirates 4, we are close to naming a director. Johnny Depp is very much on board, and we expect to be commencing shooting with Pirates 4 sometime in the spring. And so that's all good news. On Christmas Carol, we believe we have a good film. We would be remiss if we said that we were elated with the results this past weekend. We actually would have liked it to have done better. But it's early in the season. We are very encouraged by the numbers yesterday. It did 5.3 million in the United States. It was Veterans' Day, but it's an interesting sign.</p>
          <p>There are many examples of Christmas films coming out in the early November period that have played extremely well for longer periods of time as you near the Christmas holiday, and we hope that this film follows that pattern. Also the cinema score or the results for people who saw this film in 3-D was quite positive, and in fact much more positive than people who saw it in 2-D. Not that the people who saw it in 2-D didn't like it, but the people who saw it in 3-D liked it even more. And we're fortunate that even though there's some competition coming in the marketplace, we think we'll have a pretty good hold on 3-D screens, at least until Avatar comes out in I guess mid-December. So this was a costly film, and obviously that has to be taken into account. And it got off to a slightly slower start the first weekend than we would have liked, but we're continuing to spend in the marketplace to support this, and as I mentioned we're pretty encouraged by what we saw yesterday.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, if I could quickly follow up, is there any plans with Christmas Carol on the home video front that you might go to market differently? I mean, there's some questions around 2-D, obviously you don't have 3-D in the homes. I don't know if you think about marketing there or how you go to market or what your retail position is or using digital downloads. Is anything different with this film, given the unique nature of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing that's different about this is that we're going to go to the market much later and wait 'til Christmas next year, instead of putting it out for President's Weekend or Easter. I was going to say Passover, but I don't know, that would have been a bad joke. We like 3-D in the home, by the way, but I think it's going to take a while for that technology to penetrate. With the demonstrations we've seen are pretty compelling, but it's way too early to predict or indicate just how far that will go and how valuable it will be. We do believe that we made right for the right film. 3-D offers the moviegoer a better experience which is reflected in the pricing and reflected in the reaction we're getting from moviegoers. And when you see a film like this in 3-D, it's a very good way to appreciate the technology, because I think it's quite compelling.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to cable margins, if you look at -- let's look at the year as a whole for a second, and then we can talk about the quarter. The year as a whole, we saw a nice growth at ABC Family. ESPN, despite the difficult ad environment, was able to maintain margins roughly, and in fact, they did maintain margins. But we did have this crossover from Jetix to XD and in some instances Disney channels, and there was some costs associated with that. And so what you're left with is that really the key driver of growth for the year was ESPN. But in the quarter itself, the lion's share of the cost for the changeover had been earlier in the year. So we had some of that left, and we're pretty much through that part of the equation. And so that helped the quarter.</p>
          <p>I thought ESPN had impressive performance. Now clearly the deferral of revenues, affiliate revenues helped us in that regard. But given the fact that they also absorb some start-up losses in England from the new service, ESPN over there, I thought that they turned in a strong performance, and that overall is probably one of the biggest things that might have led to a beat versus what you had expected, although having not looked at your model, I can't tell you for sure. And here again the Disney Channel worldwide in the quarter also saw some margin expansion, in part because of the 53rd week, but overall good performance.</p>

          <p>Yeah, hi. Congratulations on the stellar results. Tom, two questions for you. First of all, what was attendance at Disneyland and Disney World, including the extra week?  I apologize if you said it and I missed it. And then also, obviously over the last 20 years or so lateral movement of senior executives at Disney is nothing new. I'm wondering why you chose to go the way of the parks, and what opportunity you see to sort of make your mark at the parks that maybe Jay Rasulo has not made?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I tell you, I'm getting the chance to go over to the parks at a time when they have a very exciting period in front of them, in large measure because of the leadership Jay has shown over the last seven years there. And so my goal is to go in there, get down the learning curve as quickly as I can, and hopefully continue a lot of the great work that Jay has put in place. So that's what I'm focused on right now. By the way, to your first question, Disneyland was up 23%, including the 53rd week, and Walt Disney World was up 5%, including the 53rd week.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And David, this is Bob, I also &#x2013; I wanted to make sure you understand, I didn't give Tom a multiple choice in terms of where he was going to go. And I made both Tom and Jay offers that I felt they couldn't refuse. I also had the benefit with Tom and Jay of two executives that I thought would thrive in their new changed positions, and they were also both very right from a timing perspective to make this move having been in their current positions for quite a long period of time. And so I have great confidence in both of them, obviously, and their ability to accept and thrive in their new roles. Again, they weren't multiple choices. These were kind of perfect for both of them.</p>
          <p>And having benefited myself from being given new opportunities over the years, in some cases going to places and businesses I had not been in, I think I can particularly appreciate what a real opportunity this is for both of them and long-term what a great opportunity it is for the company, not only to provide these two executives with new and different challenges and responsibilities, but to continue to do that for other executives, as we just did with Rich Ross who had spent a career in television and as we did with Ann Sweeney years back when we gave someone who had been in cable broadcasting responsibility, and we recently moved an executive who ran Latin America to run Europe, et cetera, and so on. And this is a unique move in many respects because of its significance, given the importance of these jobs. But it's not necessarily the first time we've done this, as you cited, and it won't be the last time that we do it.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Kuna Amobi with Standard Import Group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I want to congratulate Tom as well. I certainly share the view that he is one of the outstanding CFOs out there. Well done. So I've got a few questions, as well. I guess, the first one it seems like you've got a pretty good bump, attendance bump from the promotions. And with regard to your decision to extend it, I think you said March and April next year for the two domestic parks. Have you kind of thought about &#x2013; talk about your thought process with that and why you kind of decided to &#x2013; it seems like the Easter holiday weekend falls in between those two dates for the extension dates for those two parks. So I just kind of wanted to get a more sense about the thought process there and why you decided to kind of end them on different dates?</p>
          <p>And secondly, I think, Bob, in your prepared remarks you talked about the sports rights, and I don't recall, I didn't hear you mention the Olympics, South American rights, which it seems like you just picked up for the 2010 Vancouver and 2012 London Olympics. Can you kind of talk about that in terms of the cost that you might expect to incur in 2010 and beyond, associated with those rights, and does that kind of presage kind of a wider Olympic bid. And lastly just quick question on your Keychest initiative and how that kind of dovetails into your studio marketing changes that you just announced. Any color there would be helpful. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Wow, Kuna, you're &#x2013; I'm sorry. I got to go to school to learn all...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hopefully they're quick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, the Olympics. ESPN has continued to look opportunistically at picking up rights for sporting events that they could distribute to markets outside the United States. They've done a good job of that. They distribute a lot of US-based sports to international markets. Recently the World Series is a good example of that. They had an opportunity to buy the rights to these upcoming Olympic games, I guess in London, to distribute on their Latin American channel. It's a very, very, very modest investment, and I won't get into specifics, but it's not material by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
          <p>The discounting at the parks in terms of process, first of all, I believe that the Easter holiday falls outside of the window to extend the discounting. The parks spent a fair amount of time watching the marketplace very carefully and waiting before they essentially implemented or extended a discount and also spent a fair amount of time figuring out exactly what the discount should be. And they ultimately concluded that the marketplace warranted maintaining the promotional offer because obviously the marketplace wasn't responding as much as it would have liked when we didn't have a discount in place.</p>
          <p>The point Tom made about bookings trends, booking trends have actually picked up significantly since we announced the discount, and they had been somewhat sluggish before we did. This has been the case in the past as well. We look at this very carefully. I would like to emphasize that in the past when we've had discounts, we have not had a problem weaning consumers of the discount. As economic conditions improved in the past, we've managed to maintain volume while reducing or removing the discount. I also want to point out that the discount that we have in the marketplace today is slightly less of a discount than the discount we had in the marketplace the last few quarters by a little bit, both on the room and ticket side, but also on the dining side, where it's been changed somewhat.</p>
          <p>By the way, the marketplace has reacted very well to it. There's also a strategic value to discounting and maintaining volume as we see it in that the park experience that we provide is unique and special. Guest experience and research we do suggests that people who come love it. That improves return visitation as well as extends word of mouth, and that's a very valuable part of our marketing process. And so when the marketplace is basically warrants discounting, we believe that it's a good thing for us to do. Even though it results in slightly less revenue, maintaining volume is very important.</p>
          <p>On Keychest, won't get into too much detail there, but what we're really trying to do here is serve the consumer with technology that we're helping to develop by basically giving consumer the ability to buy something once and then watch it on multiple platforms and devices and not face a lack of interoperability, not face barriers of basically managing IP that they've bought in a way that makes it much less attractive to buy. It's really -- it's a complicated technology, but the premise is as simple as that. It's really taking a look at the big picture from a consumer perspective, and the consumer faces a somewhat daunting task when they make a decision to buy something digitally, because often what they buy is not portable to other platforms.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would that be your answer to the TV Everywhere, would you say? On the Keychest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's a yes and no to that. Look, TV Everywhere is maybe an example of what we've talked about often, and that is digital technology providing us with more opportunities to reach consumers and consumers more opportunities to consume our product. And to the extent that TV Everywhere serves consumers better, we're in favor of it. However, when you serve consumers better, when you provide more convenience or more utility, you should be able to charge for that and charge an appropriate amount. And some of what we've heard about TV Everywhere suggests that interest in charging the consumer for greater access is not necessarily a priority, and we believe it should be.</p>
          <p>We also believe that we should still have the ability if we go to a world where there's authentication and TV Everywhere for the multi-channel subscriber, we should not be precluded from offering our product directly to consumers who may not be subscribers to multi-channel services, because we believe that would -- and even though there aren't many of them, that wouldn't necessarily be good for consumers, and while we realize we're trying to serve many masters, the master that is most important to serve for us is the consumer.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks. I wonder &#x2013; was wondering if you could talk about your distribution deal with Dream works and what we could see from them in the coming fiscal year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably very little in the coming fiscal year, because they're really just gearing up in terms of not only their development, but their production.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. So I think it's possible we'll have one film in 2010, although that's not a guarantee. And they'll start to hit in 2011. We still feel really good about this relationship. We're certainly encouraged by what we see in their development pipeline and certainly have great faith in their executives. And we thought this was a great way to use our distribution infrastructure to increase our revenue and to grow our company without a significant capital investment.</p>
