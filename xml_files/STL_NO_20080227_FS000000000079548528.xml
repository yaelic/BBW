          <p>Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's now 1:30 Norwegian time. Welcome to this StatoilHydro Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2007 Earnings Presentation. My name is Lars S&#xF8;rensen. I am the Head of Investor Relations. This is in fact the first time that the merge companies that are Hydro presents results.</p>
          <p>But before we go on, let's focus on safety as usual. We've got two emergency exits in this room outside there will be staff directing you to the emergency exit outside and the collecting point is outside the main entrance close to the highway E-18.</p>
          <p>A special welcome to all the audience listening in from the Internet. You can submit questions in to my PC here via the submit question button on your screen and I will, on your behalf ask the questions to management at the Q&amp;A session, after the presentation we are going to have, after I've finish speaking here.</p>
          <p>The presentation material we will use in today's presentation has been available since 8:00 AM this morning on our website. And could be downloaded from there, and the one who's on the internet can download it from using the download presentation button on your screen.</p>
          <p>I will also please ask you to note the Safe Harbor and disclaimer, statements in the back of the presentation set where we talk about non-GAAP measures and other expressions used in the presentation set.</p>
          <p>Today's presentation will be split in two. First, we have the Chief Executive Officer of StatoilHydro, Helge Lund, and then the Chief Financial Officer Eldar S&#xE6;tre. And then we'll have a Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>So without much further ado again, I will give the work to our Chief Executive Officer, Helge Lund.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars and good afternoon and good morning, wherever you are in the world. It's a pleasure for me to present for the first time results of the new company StatoilHydro. And I wanted to start by saying that the results and the underlying performance of our group is solid and in line with our guiding.</p>
          <p>We see however, that this quarter -- this quarterly result are impacted by, as we also said in January one-off costs related particularly to the merger and these costs are, of course, an investment in future benefits. And they confirm today that the annual synergies resulting from the merger would be around NOK6 billion in annual synergies moving forward. This is also inline to what we indicated earlier to you at the Capital Markets Day in London in January.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, results are also impacted by tax issues and other infrequent items that will be covered in detail, either by me or I think, even better by Eldar S&#xE6;tre, a little bit later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>I think it's fair to conclude, at least as we see it that 2007 was a year with many highlights for StatoilHydro. Of course, the biggest one was the share fact that we combined the two companies and in addition to that we have strengthened our group in several other areas around the world.</p>
          <p>We have established new positions in Canada and also in Russia through the participation in the Shtokman project. And we have further strengthened our long term position in Gulf of Mexico, deepwater through an active participation in the lease rounds there. In addition to that we have among other one new exploration licenses in Norway, in Brazil and also a few weeks back in Alaska.</p>
          <p>On top of that we have added production capacity, new production capacity from new quality projects in Norway, as well as internationally. I believe the -- from my first day in Statoil back in 2004 that in all and a very logical way to take the company forward was to merge with Hydro. Having worked with this merger for a year, I'm even more convinced that this was the right move to make in light of the changes in the industry environment as we see around us. So our key focus now, is to deliver on the roadmap that we presented to you in January and in London.</p>
          <p>It is no surprise for you that I start by concluding that the oil price development since 2003 significantly has changed and reconfigured the oil and gas industry. The supply side is tight and is affected by very tight supply markets increasing costs and also lead times on the global basis. I think still, it holds to say that the industry continue -- continues to work at almost maximum capacity levels in terms of hardware, but even more, I think profound in terms of human competence.</p>
          <p>We still expect a relatively tight supplier market and highly-priced input factors. But we start to see, and I think we can confirm that message also since we met last time in London, some flattening out and maybe a better balance between demand and supply partly affecting the, or impacted by the fact that new capacity has been built in the supplier industry. But also I think impacted by some more uncertainty around the economic climate and the development globally.</p>
          <p>To me increasing complexity is or continue to be the key feature of our industry, in the sense that, technically we are attacking more and more complex project developments, deepwater, harsher environment, heavier oils and more and more tough projects. Commercially, we see that those that are owning the resources are tougher and tougher in sort of negotiating it and therefore access, I think, for all of us is more difficult.</p>
          <p>And I guess it's close to a natural law that when rewards below ground increases as we have seen now recently, risk migrates above ground. And this is making an impact on terms and conditions generally in our industry. In this environment, some companies decide or have chosen to wait it out. Others continue to be active in exploration, active in business development in terms of building the future reserve and production base.</p>
          <p>To me an obvious response to these challenges has been to execute to the merger that we have already talked about. And I believe it has strengthened significantly the new company's competitive position in Norway, but more importantly outside Norway in terms of capacity, financial resources, technical resources and competence generally.</p>
          <p>At our Capital Market Day in January, we set out a strategic road map for value capture and growth towards 2012 and beyond. The strategy is simple. We will take out the full potential, the full profitable potential of the NCS while growing our international production.</p>
          <p>We focus strongly by fighting decline and add on new production capacity to grow production from 1.9 million barrels per day in equity production to 2.2 million barrels per day in equity production in 2012. We will deliver on the merger synergies estimated to be NOK6 billion per year in annual benefits.</p>
          <p>We will continue to maintain capital discipline and continue to deliver competitive shareholder return. A key to this to all of these factors is that we are successful in driving the operational improvement program at Norwegian Continental Shelf particularly related to -- due to production drilling and the uptime on our installations, particularly offshore. I think, development since the merger has, sort of, confirmed this picture.</p>
          <p>The organization is now fully operational and working exactly on the roadmap that we have presented. It is important, I think, for you as investors and for us that the merger has released new capacity to work on the high quality resource base and projects that we have in our pipeline. And I think also, that it is important that these cost savings will make us more competitive and strong. Therefore strengthen our long-term comparativeness.</p>
          <p>In terms of deliveries over and above the merger, it has been a very active year in the sense that we have 14 new projects in production and sanctioned another eight. We have completed 71 wells with 34 discovers, including the important discoveries in Shah Deniz in Azerbaijan, and the Julia well with ExxonMobil in Gulf of Mexico. We have exited -- accessed 22 new licenses and 77 new leases and we have a growth in our reserve replacement ratio of 86. This is a less that our long-term goal of a 100, but competitive with many peers.</p>
          <p>I think also, it is significant to underline also at this occasion that we have a very attractive portfolio of new project, which is also reflected in our high CapEx program going forward and we confirm the guidance that we gave in January. That is roughly one-third of this investment program will go to secure existing production, while two-third will to further grow production.</p>
          <p>Statoil has been and StatoilHydro will be in the future committed to pay a competitive shareholder &#x2013; direct shareholder return, and the Board of Directors of StatoilHydro will propose to the General Assembly that the dividend 1.5, sorry NOK8.5 per share in the combination of ordinary dividend and special dividend that I will come back to later. This is a payout ratio over 61 for the year and it gives an average payout ratio for &#x2013; on 51 since the IPO of Statoil in 2001.</p>
          <p>In our industry, the safety of our people is our first priority and HSE is our most important performance indicator as we are running an industry with a high degree of risk. We focus on both the integrity and robustness of our installations, as well as improving behavior of the leadership and our employees throughout the company.</p>
          <p>And it is very clear to me, and I think to you, that the good HSE performance has very much to do with quality, and therefore it's directly impacting on our bottomline. We try to approach this and other areas through a holistic performance platform that is defined by very strict regulations when it comes to HSE ethics, business integrity and also related to clear leadership principles and requirements. And we are progressing in many areas including the serious incidence frequency as you see here on the chart.</p>
          <p>We were able to move our performance just another step in 2007. But we see that we have not been able to break the curve and really make a significant additional improvement on this and other factors. And this is very much in line with the industry trend, that an extraordinary effort need to be done now in order to be even better. Our recipe there is to capture or utilize the best practice from the two companies in order to have a catalyst for further improvements.</p>
          <p>Also in 2007, we had some undesirable events in our operation, this is not acceptable. In our investigation of the large oil spill we had this December from the Statfjord A platform found technical and organizational weaknesses that we now have dealt with and put up a very forceful action plan. And we hope and assume that this will prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.</p>
          <p>We work hard and we'll continue to work hard to improve our performance. I think we are on the right track and I think that is also confirmed by the fact that we, for the fourth consecutive year, is ranked as the best oil and gas company in the world when it comes to sustainability. This is not proving that we're doing everything right, but I think it clearly proves that we are on the right track.</p>
          <p>The net operating income for the fourth quarter was close to NOK31 billion. The result is significantly influenced by one of merger related cost as I already discussed, and also some other infrequent operating items not related to the activities of this period. These pre-tax restructuring and other merger related cost of NOK10.7 billion, of course, bolster the after tax cost of 3 to NOK4 billion, that we presented in January and should therefore not come as surprise.</p>
          <p>Adjusted for total non-recurring items of NOK13.6 billion, the net operating income was NOK44.4 billion for the quarter. This is an increase of 24% from adjusted income last year in 2006. Adjusted for the effects of the same items, net income for the quarter is NOK12.1 billion, and as I've already mentioned, the financial items and tax are also impacting the net income negatively and more than the usually. And Eldar will give you a very detailed explanation on that later in his presentation.</p>
          <p>On the full year, both the net operating income and the net income fell. This was mainly because of merger related and other infrequent items in 2007 together with higher operating cost because of new fields in production, i.e., with the fuel cost base but not fuel production, higher startup costs on fields with startup problems and higher exploration costs and higher activity level in general. Adjusted for the merger cost of NOK10.7 billion before tax, we delivered a return on average capital employed of approximate &#x2013; approximately 20% and this compares well with our peer group.</p>
          <p>Moving then to the production part, average daily entitlement production for 2007 came in at 1.7 &#x2013; 1,724 million barrels per day. And this is inline with the guiding for the year, if you adjust for the PSA effects. We assume that the capital market there at $60 level. The level was $70 instead; if you adjust for that we are more or less exactly on the target that we communicated to the market in December and subsequently in January on 1.735 million barrels per day.</p>
          <p>The net debt as per yearend 2007 is around NOK25 billion. This constitutes of around NOK50 billion in gross debt and roughly NOK25 billion in cash. And the net debt to capital employed was 12% at the yearend.</p>
          <p>Our strong CapEx program in combination with high return to shareholders is stronger, linked to our current cash generating capacity. We anticipate our cash flows from operations also to be substantial moving forward, and as reported in January, we expect to be cash neutral at an oil price of around $50 per barrel before dividend.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned already, an important goal is to deliver a competitive direct shareholder return. And we have to balance between capital distribution and necessary financial flexibility in support of our growth strategy within sound financial targets. And our first priority is definitely to invest in profitable and strategic industrial opportunities. But if such opportunities do not exist or the company retains too much financial flexibility overtime then our priority is to distribute cash to our shareholders in line with our dividend policy. And that policy is unchanged it will distribute 45 to 50% of net income to shareholders and they are committed to nominally grow the ordinary dividend year-on-year.</p>
          <p>I mentioned already that we are proposing NOK8.50 per share. The ordinary dividend is proposed at NOK4.20 compared to NOK4 last year and the special dividend is proposed at NOK4.30 per share. The dividend is equivalent to a direct yield of approximately 5.5%. And as I mentioned earlier the proposal -- the proposals means that we will distribute 61% of this year's net income and 51% since the company was listed in 2001. Before leaving the floor to Eldar, let me briefly summarize 2007. We have in less than a year completed an enormously complex merger and it's fully operational. We have had a very high activity level in the organization building new growth capacity and we have delivered solid returns and protection on top of that. I believe, we are proposing to pay an attractive dividend for 2007.</p>
          <p>And by that, I invite Eldar to -- on stage to the see whether he can speak louder than this noise that we hear here. So the floor is yours, Eldar.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Helge and good afternoon to all of you. As you probably most likely already have noticed this quarter's results are I would say heavily, quite heavily influenced both from merger related cost and some other as mentioned by Helge other infrequent items to this periods activities. But also from a loss on financial items and I would say higher tax rate than we typically see in -- we'll see in this company. We also say that none of these factors or special developments for this quarter are in anyway direct the link to the performance of the company, or the business activities as such. So I will now go through all of these elements in logical sequence I hope and I would also add a few comments to our proved reserves and the capital expenditure and also the exploration expenditures.</p>
          <p>So this illustration or call it a roadmap that takes us all the way from the net operating income to the net income and is highlighting in a separate color. The items which I believe need some further elaboration in order to, for you to fully understand our reported numbers for this quarter. And I've said already adjusted for the non-recurring costs items of NOK13.6 billion which mainly is related to merger. The net operating income would have been 44.4 billion in this quarter. The after-tax effect is for the same items is calculated at minus NOK5.9 billion which implies that the -- again the net income would have been 12.1 billion without the impact from these non-recurring or infrequent items. Financial items, I'll come back to that is negative with approximately NOK700 million this quarter and the tax rate is also exceptionally high. So let me now first take you through some of the, all of the business areas and show you how they contribute to the net operating income.</p>
          <p>The net operating income for E&amp;P Norway in the quarter was NOK32.6 billion that is 4% higher than in the same quarter of 2006. The total infrequent items as you can see here for the quarter was the negative NOK4.6 billion for this business segment. Oil prices in Norwegian Kroner increased by 24% on a quarter-to-quarter basis and the gas transfer price increased by 3% the transfer price between E&amp;P Norway and Natural gas. Other income increased by NOK2.3 billion and this is mainly due to positive changes in the fair value of derivatives on the E&amp;P segment, which is basically linked to some earn-out agreements.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses were NOK7.5 billion higher than the same quarter last year. And again this is mostly due to NOK5.5 billion, which is related to directly to the merger, but also somewhat higher operating and maintenance cost, well maintenance activities and also NOx-fees on the <mark type="inaudible" /> share. Furthermore the exploration expenses increased by NOK600 million and also the DD&amp;A, the depreciations increased due to higher impairment or asset retirement costs. For the international E&amp;P segment, the net operating income was NOK2.2 billion in the quarter, compared to a loss of 3.4 billion last year. And the negative -- the total negative impact from the non-recurring items on this segment was NOK2.8 billion. There was an increase in the lifted volumes of 37% and a 32% increase in the realized oil price. And these were basically the main reasons behind the improved resource.</p>
          <p>In addition, there was a 2.4 billion decrease in depreciations and impairment expenses between the two quarters. We have in this quarter had impairments of Lufeng in China, Front Runner, Thunder Hawk and also the Gulf of Mexico shallow water assets that we have now sold down to the market value of those assets. And all of this added up to 800 approximately NOK800 million in impairments for this business segment in the period. And this is compared to in term -- impairments of 3.1 billion in the same quarter last year for the combined company.</p>
          <p>The total increase in the net operating income for E&amp;P and for the international E&amp;P was partly offset by merger related costs like for all the other business areas of approximately NOK1.3 billion. And in addition there was a decrease in realized gas prices, which contributed negatively to their resource development. Then to the natural gas, where we saw a net operating income in the quarter of a loss of NOK1.8 billion compared to a gain of NOK6.6 billion last year, a huge negative development. This quite significant decrease was mainly due to an 11% reduction in the price of pipe natural gas from the Norwegian continental shelf, the external price, combined with the 3% increase in the internal transfer price between E&amp;P Norway and natural gas. And this combination led to a reduction of the internal margin from NOK0. 57 in the fourth quarter of 2006 to NOK0.30 per standard cubic meter this quarter, that's almost 100% reduction -- 50% reduction. And consequently as a consequence of this, a 2.7 billion due to the margin EBIT reduction from fourth quarter last year.</p>
          <p>So in addition to this 2.7 billion impact from the margins we had a negative change in the fair value of derivative of 4.6 billion from positive development last year, fourth quarter last year, of 3 billion to a negative development this quarter of 1.6. So the difference is 4.6 on derivatives.</p>
          <p>Merger related cost was 1.3 billion in this quarter and obviously none of that in the fourth quarter of 2006. And we also had an impairment of one asset -- no two craft asset at Karsto of NOK0.3 billion. So total infrequent items as you can see on this list for the natural gas added up to a negative impact of 3.2 billion for this quarter.</p>
          <p>And finally the net operating income for the manufacturing and marketing in this quarter was a loss of NOK600 million compared to a gain of 400 in the same quarter last year. Again restructuring costs in connection with the merger contributed 1.2 billion to this difference, partly from the related retail business in Sweden of approximately NOK500 million, and early retirement cost allocated to this business segment of NOK700 million.</p>
          <p>Then we also had an impairment related to the Swedish retail business of approximately NOK600 million due to weak market conditions in Sweden and a need to restructure this part to our downstream business. Then I should also mention that the fourth quarter results last in the fourth quarter of 2006 was impacted by a gain of 600 million related to the sale of our retail assets in Ireland.</p>
          <p>So let me now summarize the non-recurring, one offs or whatever you call it, items for this quarter. As earlier mentioned restructuring costs and other merger related cost added up to NOK10.7 billion. Most of these costs came from the 58 plus as we call it, the earlier retirement scheme. But we also had additional costs related to transfer on the declined seismic data and as I already mentioned related to the restructuring of the Swedish retail business.</p>
          <p>And we also had some alignment of the accounting practices to use the right word for it between the two companies. Obviously we have had some differences in the way we have practiced this and we had to align that and it led to some adjustments, which is also related to the merger. And as mentioned by Helge and as you can see the after tax estimate of this merger related cost is 3.9 billion, which is in line with the 3 to 4 billion range we then had guided on earlier.</p>
          <p>And in this context I should also mention that a claim or a receivable on our joint venture partner, related to the restructuring, of approximately NOK2 billion has not been booked, it's not in the books. So 2 billion in potential revenues is not in the books. And the same goes for additional claims related to the Phase II of this restructuring process, which is going on this year in relation to the offshore, mainly the offshore activities for our business.</p>
          <p>Then in the first quarter we had total impairment and I think I've talked about most of them of NOK1.7 billion, which is related to the Lufeng field in China. It has to do with the increased cost of removing this asset, and there is basically not very many barrels to finance that so we have to expense that cost increase.</p>
          <p>An impairment of Front Runner, Thunder Hawk and the shelf assets in Gulf of Mexico. And the two craft as I mentioned, cost there and also some related to the Swedish retail business. And the total after tax impacts of these impairment is approximately NOK1.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Net derivative effects amounted to a total gain of 0.1 billion in the quarter compared to a gain of 3.7 billion in the same quarter last year. And again the after tax was not a gain that was a minus and that has to do with a -- minus 0.8 and that has to do with the underlying composition of these different derivative effects.</p>
          <p>Under lifting of oil and gas of 32,000 barrels per day in the quarter amounted to a negative effect of NOK1.8 billion compared to the value of the actually produced volumes for the same -- entitlement volumes for the same period. And then finally, in addition we had some other more minor infrequent item also with a positive net impact of NOK400 million</p>
          <p>So all in all this adds up to as already mentioned total impact of 13.6 billion, negative impact, which has an impact on the accounting and the numbers reported but which is not directly related to the operating activities of the company in this quarter.</p>
          <p>So let me now continue with the roadmap and I will add some comments to the firstly financial items and then the tax issue that has already been slightly introduced. Net financial items showed a loss of NOK0.7 billion in the quarter and that is compared to an income of 3.1 billion in the same quarter last year. So a huge change from last year when it comes to the financial.</p>
          <p>For the full year we had an income of 9.6 billion compared to an income of 5.1 in the 2006 full year. The financial loss in the fourth quarter was basically related to unrealized currency losses of NOK1.3 billion and this is related to internal loans that we do from euro functional currency subsidiary outside of Norway into US dollar functional currency subsidiaries.</p>
          <p>And basically what we have seen is that the -- this is the -- the unrealized loss is due to weakening of the US dollar versus euro. And this 1.3 billion is booked in the profit and loss as a loss on financial items. While there is actually a corresponding gain from the increased value of these US dollar subsidiaries in Norwegian Kroner, which is booked directly, not through the P&amp;L, but directly through the equity in the balance sheet. So basically there is no, if you look at the balance sheet there is no effect to value lost from this negative profit and loss movement as such.</p>
          <p>The increase for the full year was mainly due to currency gains related to the normal hedging transactions that we do in order to secure Norwegian Kroner for payments of tax and dividends as you heard about today, due to unrealized currency gains related to long-term funding and from the strengthening of the Norwegian Kroner that we have seen versus US dollar.</p>
          <p>Then to the tax. The tax rate for the quarter is an impressive 79 point -- is the best word I could find, it was 79.4%. And obviously that's quite exceptional by any means, and I will try to shed some light to this issue. Firstly, the distribution of taxable income in accounting terms between the business areas that is basically what is driving high tax rate this quarter.</p>
          <p>The net operational income related to the Norwegian Continental Shelf tax regime represents more than 100% of taxable income this quarter, and this is all due to the special circumstances that I have already been through in some quite detail. And then the marginal tax rate down in Norwegian Continental Shelf, as you know, is 78% while the tax rate in most of other -- all other tax regimes typically is lower at least if you look at the cash net income tax only.</p>
          <p>This means that the positive net income is taxed in the high tax bracket. While the aggregate negative results from other business areas, which has been impacted as I mentioned by special issues is taxed in the lower brackets, so cost in the lower bracket and income in high bracket. That gives a high tax rate that pulls up the average tax rate significantly.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the net financial items are negative as you have seen this quarter of NOK700 million. And tax on financial items whether it's income or loss is typically lower than the average tax rate. And do the arithmetic's here. It's a lower tax on net financial loss that also contributes to take up the average tax rate for the quarter. So this is really what explains a little bit on typical tax, high tax rate that you have seen this quarter, and this comment also actually concludes my analysis of the net income. So now I was planning to say a few words about the approved reserves development.</p>
          <p>Our StatoilHydro reserve replacement rate for 2008 was 86% and that is how it looks according to the SEC definition of proved reserves. The three-year average as already mentioned was -- from 2005 was 81%. As you all know we need to deliver an RRR above 100% over time in order to be able to grow the production consistently over time. And we believe with our large resource base and a continued high quality exploration program that we have in place, we're confident that we would be able to deliver necessary reserve and resource growth in the future to support our production growth ambition.</p>
          <p>The oil price has increased from US$59 per barrel at the end of 2006, the very last day of 2006 to approximately US$96 per barrel at the last day of 2007 and that is the criteria, which goes into the calculation of reserves. So given that the oil price had not moved during 2007, but has stayed at US$59 per barrel, the reserve replacement for the year would have been 94%. So the deference is mainly due to production sharing agreements, but also to some extent due to positive effects from longer tail ends of some of our fields.</p>
          <p>StatoilHydro now holds 40% of oil reserves and 60% gas reserves, although a total of approximately 6 billion barrels of proved reserves and 83% of the total proved reserves is located on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The production or the unit production costs are calculated this quarter at again at an impressive NOK44.1 per barrel this quarter. And not surprisingly and again as we have guided previously, this is significantly -- this is much higher than the corresponding quarter last year. And the main reason is obviously, the increase related one of restructuring cost related to the merger.</p>
          <p>Adjusted for these cost as you can see on this slide and also for the -- we have also shown the impact of gas purchase for injection purposes at the Grane field, our unit production costs for 2007 are NOK33.2 per barrel. And again if you translate this into equity volumes, the unit production costs would have been NOK31.2 per barrel. And this again, the 31.2 that is consistent with our guidance of the range of 33 to 36 that we have guided on for the period going into -- between 2008 and 2012.</p>
          <p>Then a few comments to our 2007 CapEx and the exploration costs. A total of 18 exploration and appraisal wells were completed in the fourth quarter. 71 wells were completed for the full year of 2007. 34 of these 71 were discoveries confirmed and 16 out of 34 that were discoveries on Norwegian Continental Shelf and 18 outside of the NCS. And we actually considered this to be a good exploration year for StatoilHydro adding significant, and I would underline valuable volumes to our resource base, which has grown by approximately 1.7 billion barrels since 2000 -- over the last three years since 2005.</p>
          <p>The total cost for our 2007 drilling program was NOK14.2 billion, which is slightly lower than the range of 15 to 16 that we have indicated for you earlier. And the GAAP is mainly related to currency effects as our guidance was based on NOK6 per US dollar and then there are variances in the activity -- combination of activities as well.</p>
          <p>Our capital expenditures for 2007 was NOK75 billion compared to 64.3 of 2006. Approximately, 40% of this was related to the activities on the Norwegian Continental Shelf and almost 50% was related to the International E&amp;P activities. Excluding total acquisitions for 2007 up NOK18 billion. Our 2007 CapEx was NOK57 billion. Again this number is somewhat lower than our guidance of around NOK65 billion. This is again partly due to the currency effects has already mentioned, but I would also add somewhat related to some uncertainties arising from the fact that we had not established our first set of consolidated accounts for the new company at the point in time where we actually establish this forecast.</p>
          <p>I should also mention that none of these developments that we have seen in connection with the first closing of our accounts has any impacts on the CapEx, nor the exploration guiding that we have given for 2008. And again I would just like to remind you that the guidance for CapEx and exploration is based on a NOK6 per US dollar.</p>
          <p>So that comment takes me to my last comments, is basically to remind you of our overall future guidance and the very short version of this is that, we maintain the guidance that we gave you at our Capital Markets Day in January. This means that our active production is expected 1.9 million barrels per day this year increasing to 2.2 million in 2012 CapEx program as already mentioned at 75 billion at NOK6 per US dollars. We planned to drill approximately same level of wells, 70 wells at the cost of NOK18 billion. And finally the units production cost is estimated in the ratio of 33:36 going forward based on equity volumes.</p>
          <p>So with this comment, I thank you very much for the attention. And I guess, I'll revert to you, Lars to takes us through the Q&amp;A session.</p>

          <p>Now, I have the Q&amp;A session, I'll just remind the audience on the Internet that you can send in questions to me here, and I will read them aloud on your behalf to management, just use to submit the question button on your -- on your screen. In addition to our CEO and CFO of Statoil, we also have the Head of Corporate Accounting, Mr. Carl Thomson, to answer questions. And I take questions from the floor here in Oslo.

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Eldar. And it's a lot of special items included this time, but if we exclude these special items for some &#x2013; from E&amp;P Norway. Still we see that it's unusually high operating cost per barrel. Is it some other special explanation behind that? On the opposite side, if you did the same, exclude special items in E&amp;P International operating cost per barrel is actually rather low compared to the normal level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I should be very careful not to comment on what you have made up all the assumption in the calculations. What I can refer to you is basically what we have said, I think for a long time now, we have indicated that the unit production cost for 2007 would increase gradually. We have been through a period where we have seen impacts from the cost inflation also getting into our cost base, our operating cost base. As we have seen on exploration and CapEx numbers for some time. We saw now gradually over the last couple of years coming into our operating cost number. And in addition to that, as I said we &#x2013; we have seen an increase in related to summer activities sort of increase in maintenance cost and in particular as we see decline on some of our fields from the Norwegian Continental Shelf. We are also investing more in well-related activities to maintain the production capacity of our wells. And in addition, this year we also had &#x2013; last year we had an impact on the NOx fee. So as I said, we have &#x2013; these are the elements basically, we also per barrel, I also mentioned that we have, you know, several of our fields have operating costs included in this calculation while we haven't seen the full effect of the volumes yet in 2007 like the Ormen Lange, like the Sn&#xF8;hvit and so on and we &#x2013; pretty much have full operating cost going for the whole of 2007, but the full barrels haven't been in place. So there is an up side when we get &#x2013; these assets <mark type="inaudible" /> we'll get this asset into full production capacity.</p>
          <p>So these are the elements and we have warned you that we would climb above NOK30 per barrel and we did that, we came out at approximately 31 on our equity terms and suppressed this is more or less exactly as we have expected and as we have tried to guide you on.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the international, there are no particular &#x2013; it just goes through the &#x2013; whether it's a current &#x2013; might be a currency impact taking the Norwegian Kroner per barrel cost down, but there are no special items or anything additional that I'd like to mention or can come up with that will have explains whatever you are after on the international production cost.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the best guidance we can give is the one we gave at the Capital Markets Day and I don't think we will go any further than that. We added that you know the commercial resources we have that we anticipate to develop in the clauses you can get to be sort of approach. We have indicated that we have 15 billion barrels of oil equivalent resources in addition to the oil sands and the resources that we might access at the Stockman field and you can add roughly, if you include both of those assets, you can include additional 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent, so 18 all together.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Given the high oil price we have at moment, are you considering any more tail-end production of some of the key fields or some of the fields which are supposed to come off production over the next couple of years, like for instance the Glitne field, use that as an example. The current oil price says you will be profitable to do one more production well and expand production for a year or two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will not comment on individual fields, but of course, there are two factors that have led to the fact that most of our oil fields have had a longer lifetime than we anticipated. The first one is of course, that we have been more effective in living resource management, and the second is of course, the oil price level that you have seen in the last few years. That is also partly what Eldar covered earlier related to the cost base that of course, in such a circumstance you have to invest more into the fields. You had planned for them to be retired, but you continue more years because you see that there is profitable production, and therefore, we have had to invest more into this. And this is probably a feature that you will see moving forward also, if the prices stay at the high level.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just to follow up on that, in your portfolio, do you have any fields in particular where you are now discussing potentially extending the lifetime of those fields? You don't have to be specific on the field, but do you have examples where you currently, due to the oil price, are considering expending the lifetime of the fields, which is supposed to close down in the next few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we do that all the time. And I think most of the &#x2013; also the bigger field, you will see similar project like we are executing our on Statfjord Late Life, where you see that there are new opportunities both in terms of reservoir strategy as well as opportunities driven by the oil and gas prices. You'll probably see the same at Snorre, the same, at Gullfaks, the same, at Tjeldbergodden, so on and so forth. And also &#x2013; of course, some of the smaller field will the same opportunities.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, actually a follow-up on that. Do you consider hedging outputs or anything in connection with considering longer life on some of these fields?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well generally, I think our approach as you know, Arnstein is that we feel that our investors, they invest in StatoilHydro due to the oil and gas risk and they can diversify their portfolio in a different way. So we have only done this in a very small-scale and more related to sort of a production from the downside and they are no changing our &#x2013; in our thinking related to sort of the bigger design on the way we are running the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Before we take one here, let me just me ask you a question from the Internet. There are actually, at least three analysts here that would like an update on Sn&#xF8;hvit. So, could you please provide us with an update on Sn&#xF8;hvit? This is by Barry MacCarthy from ABN, Iain Reid from UBS and Christine Tiscareno from Standard &amp; Poor's.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will do that. We are more or less exactly where we indicated we would be at the Capital Markets Day. We started our production again on the 25th of January. We are roughly running at 60% capacity as we indicated in London and subsequently. We have also been able to learn from the last time in terms of having a more efficient start to procedures so that we can flare less gas and therefore, emit less CO2, which is commercially important, but also in terms of environmental protection. We will be dependant on running the plant for a while in order to get data information, in order to determine what is the best way of bringing there the plant up to 100% capacity. So there will still be uncertainty around the production for Sn&#xF8;hvit for 2008 and into 2009. But I'm pleased to say that those actions that we have taken so far have had the impact and effect that we anticipated. And there is, of course, unnecessary to say that there is a full focus on this from the teams at Sn&#xF8;hvit but also the corporate management team.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you also elaborate on Sn&#xF8;hvit, the fact that you put it on stream again? You said that that would be offset by some lower production on other fields and is it still the plan to fix the pipeline in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is still the plan. We had a very, very careful evaluation on whether to do the repair immediately or do it later. We decided to do it later and the plan is still to do it within the timeframe that we have communicated, and also within the production impacts that we have indicated. We indicated to you that it will have roughly 30,000 barrels per day in impact, of which 18,000 of those are gas volumes. This is of course included in the 1.9 million forecast for 2008 on the equity level.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll just take a question from the internet. Now there's a question from Iain Reid at UBS. Can you give us any guidance for the unit depreciation rates for the MCS and International E&amp;P business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, basically, we have seen very little developments. There is obviously, variations in the unit depreciation rate depending on lifting volumes. But if you look at this in terms of unit production cost, there is very little developments going forward, so we have had seen some impacts from the increase to asset retirement cost, which has influenced the depreciations. But beyond that, I think this is pretty much stable longer term as I said variations on a quarter-to-quarter basis, it will gradually increase, obviously overtime as we are replacing lower cost asset base with gradually higher a cost base, but I cannot give anymore numerical specific guidance than this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Before we take Gudmund Halle, I have a follow up question from Christine Tiscareno. What is your guidance for the 2008 and 2009 retirement asset costs? Do you have any guidance for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The retirement asset costs, we got -- we had an increased now in 2007 based on the evaluation we did, end of 2006. But, we see that for 2008, with the evaluation we've done now, it's more or less stable as we had it one year ago. So now, increased depreciation due to the evaluation of the asset retirement end of 2007, and there is good research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Could you please give us some flavor to or roughly indicate that CapEx levels for stage one of Statfjord? And number two, what would you feel is robust start of dates on Statfjord. And number three, how should we calculate the income from the field?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>How should we calculate?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first on the investment or CapEx forecast, I will not give any guidance at this point in time, and because this is exactly the purpose of the field place, the first phase of the project to determine a robust project execution plan and our robust budget. So, we have to come back to that, but clearly and given the magnitude or the first phase of the Shtokman project and the environment, this is a big potential investment. As you know and I think most of you know, we have not exposed at this stage more than the costs of our planning phase, our share or that costs until 2009. The plan is to make an investment decision based on the figures at the end of 2009. Gazprom as the main owner have indicated that the plan for the first piped gas production would be in 2013 and LNG one year after. I have no other update and that to provide at this stage. In terms of the ownership structure or the access to the underlying resources and economics, I think, it is clear for all of you that we will now physically own, not physically owned resources. The Shtokman Development Company will be responsible for planning, executing and running and owning the assets related to the Shtokman projects for the first 25 years of the project and we will then get our share of the costs and the income from that field and we have a 24% share. I think the best way at this stage you can think about it, is that we will take the risks on our efficiency in developing the project compared to the budget that we are establishing in 2009. And secondly, we will be exposed as in all upstream projects to the future development of the gas prices. So, I cannot go any further then at this stage.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can only say what I have read in the papers. And that they have said that they are planning to increase their investment up to 67 according to the Parliamentary decision taken as in connection with acceptance of the merger. I don't know how they will do it? When they will do it and within which timeframe? So, I take the view that as the Management and Board of the company, we have to run the company, we have to inform about our activities and then each shareholders have to decide for themselves whether they want a buy and/or sale and they have to also determine themselves, how they want to do it? And I'm not expected -- expecting to be informed about that. I don't want be it either.</p>

          <p>There is a question from three people here on the internet actually, James Hubbard at Deutsche, Huw Williams at Bear Stearns, and James Betty -- Batty sorry, at Energy Intelligence. Can you tell us the amounts of reserves rebooked from your reserve figures as a result of the adoption in your Sincor equity stake in Venezuela?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you know, the migration into mixed company hasn't formally taken place by the end of 2007. So, we haven't booked any impact from reduction in ownership related to the Sincor project associated to these numbers.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of exploration drilling, we have said that roughly 30% of the 18 billion that they have indicated for 2008 will flow into the CapEx numbers. And the exploration will be roughly as I have indicated 70 wells, 50% of those in Norway, 50% outside Norway.</p>

          <p>A quick on conventional oil sands general and oil reserves. When can we potentially see the first bookings from the oil sands reserves here or resources you have in Canada? You say you are going to start in 2010 with some small scale test production. But when do you think we could see some of that &#x2013; those bookings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're correctly implying that we haven't booked anything so far. Even though we actually have approved the first demonstration plant the Leismer plant, so that was approved before the year end. But we concluded that we've could not book that one and this is related to the fact that this is a demonstration plant. But for these type of resources we need to actually demonstrate that the &#x2013; that it works. So, we have to go through that and make sure that it really works. So I think basically you are into a positive conclusion on the first demonstration from this plant by 2010. So, I think that's the best indication of when we will be able to book the first reserves from this project. But the resources are still there, on the Antarctic.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, two weeks ago you signed an agreement on this Trans Adriatic Pipeline. Could you say something about your equity share and the CapEx and is the investment decision linked to Shah Deniz Phase II and will it allow you to market your own equity gas into Italy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the background for this &#x2013; at this stage rather small investment and involvement. It is together with BP and the other partners have this current significant additional resources in attracting this in a deep reservoir. So, we believe that there are sufficient resources developed second phase of the project. Therefore, we need access to markets and we have determined that Western Europe is an attractive market. We feel that the investment that we take &#x2013; took in TAP will sort of be a catalyst for moving this project forward and as you all know, we have extensive experience in building gas value chain &#x2013; chains and we are the commercial operator of Shah Deniz and Shah Deniz II, so therefore this is our responsibility as well. At this first stage, it is relatively small investment; it is more like a project to develop it. I think the first, the final investment decision must be linked to the fact that we have a market and that we have clients in Europe and that we have sold the commercial arrangement in Azerbaijan as well as you know transit arrangements that we need to get in place among others through Turkey in order to make it happen. So I guess the investment decision will not be taken eventually before you know at the end of 2009 and perhaps could be a good guidance. And of course the share, our share in that investment will ultimately depend on the commercial model with our partners at the project.</p>

          <p>Well, let me say first of all on Statfjord Late Life, this was a project that was decided in 2004, and it's a resource management project, where the idea is to turn a big oil producer into a predominantly gas producer over many, many, many, years. So there are modifications being done on the platforms, but the most important part of the project is that you have to do a lot of drilling many years into the future. And as you know, all of you that are working with this industry on a global basis, high oil prices incentivize increased activity, increasing demand and you see higher costs and then we're looking at this for the long term, taking into effect the impact of the current market circumstances, and we will drill a lot of wells over the next many years. Of course, the cost will be impacted if we continue to see the same pattern. But you know the wells we are drilling, we are making decisions all the time whether these are profitable or not. I can only confirm that this project is much more profitable today than it was when we approved it in 2004 due to the changes in the marketplace. On Sn&#xF8;hvit, you know the costs associated with the modifications that we have to do eventually. I cannot speculate at this point in time as we do not know exactly what we have to do. We have to come back to that later.</p>

          <p>We will take a couple of more questions before we end this Q&amp;A session. There's couple of questions from Oswald Clint from Sanford Bernstein and Huw Williams at Bear Stearns. They both want to know updates on the Gulf of Mexico portfolio. Oswald Clint wants to know if we've got any more updates on the Julia discovery, and Huw Williams wants to know sort of more general, what are the updates and when do we expect more information about the discoveries there?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are pleased with the portfolio that we have built up over the last three to three and a half years. It is very much focused on the deep water areas. That is the reason why we sold the Shallow Water business. As we felt that our rig had more capabilities of taking the full value out of that. I think we have a good balance in the portfolio in the sense that we are working with Chevron on the Tahiti development. We have a number of other discoveries including Jack, Julia, West Tonga that was released right before Christmas. And a number of other discoveries and a quite active plan to develop these resources further. I cannot comment on the source potentials beyond what the operators have done already. We have been active also in the lease runs recently, and we see how we can through these lease runs also complement our portfolio even further.</p>

          <p>Two more questions before we end. Kjetil Bakken at Fondsfinans. He wants to know. You've been very busy building your portfolio and continue to acquire licenses in existing and new areas. Is there a limit to how many business development activities a company can handle? And what is your view on potential asset sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, our ability to mature more business development options and doing more exploration are one of the key drivers of the merger that we will be more effective in combining the forces of Hydro and Statoil. I think there is clearly a limit to how many projects we can involve ourselves into. We are not taking on more responsibility than what we can execute and we are extremely determined to try to balance the importance of industrially developed, the company profitably grow it, while we are returning borrowed cash to our shareholders. And I think based on the track record we have the last few years, I think there's a certain performance standard in that. Finally, a final comment, I think you're right now, I think the industry in general and also StatoilHydro is more constrained by people and human resources than they are related to cash and physical equipment. And you know, you need all of these parameters at the same place in order to do a safe, secure and profitable development.</p>

          <p>And today's last question from Iain Reid at UBS. Is the TAP pipeline, a competitor to the Nobuka and Gazprom south stream? And if so, how does this affect your relationship with Gazprom in Russia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you know we have an excellent relationship with Gazprom. They know that we are a big gas supplier, they know our positions. We cooperate on gas, on Shtokman. We compete elsewhere, what we are -- we are not taking part in any other sort of involvement and trying to make the most value out of those resources. We have and we feel that that is also the approach that we have to take and we'll take together with our partners at Shah Deniz to projects and a key to making a value out of the gas discovery is of course to attach the resources to their marketplace.</p>

          <p>Well, ladies and gentlemen, this was the end of today's session. We have got a couple of more questions on the internet that we haven't answered yet because we didn't have time, but we will make sure that you'll get an answer via email after this presentation. Thank you very much. Good bye.</p>
