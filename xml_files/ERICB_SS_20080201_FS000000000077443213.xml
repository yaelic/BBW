        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator, and hello everyone.  Welcome to our conference call for the fourth quarter of 2007.  This is Gary Pinkham, Head of Investor Relations here at Ericsson, and with me here in Stockholm is our CEO, Carl-Henric Svanberg and Hans Vestberg, our Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call today.  These statements are based on our current expectations and certain timing assumptions.  The actual results may be different due to a number of factors.  There are risks and uncertainties associated with these timing assumptions, and we encourage you to use caution when considering such forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to hand over to Carl-Henric.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and I will start here.  Ericsson in 2007, the first slide there, it was -- from some points of view, it was of course a good year.  We had 8% organic growth in constant currencies and we took more market share gains than in many years.  At the same time we saw a disappointing margin decline that you are all aware of in the second half which I'll come back to, which was due to the shift in business mix.</p>
          <p>The operating income of 30 billion was obviously strong, still 6 billion below last year, and the trend was negative in the second half.  We had a good cash flow, actually better than last year.  Hans Vestberg will come back and talk more about it, but it was accelerating during the year, was strong in Q4 due to a lot of focus on the cash flow activities.  This means that we have a compounded average growth rate of 12% over the last four years, less than obviously in 2007 but the dollar decline is significant.  The impact of the dollar decline is significant.</p>
          <p>If we then go to the next slide and look at the Network's infrastructure market, what happened actually, well it started in mid-single digits but it ended flattish.  We are affected by the operating consolidation and the hold-back of operating expenses; this is all known to you.  We also saw as we talked about in Q3 and in New York political unrest in some emerging markets, which led to sales being 45% down in Bangladesh and Thailand, and for the full year about 40% in Pakistan.  Of course that added to the difficulties.  Hopefully that will soon go away.</p>
          <p>We're also seeing a change in the competitive landscape.  We see the big mergers going on, we see weaker players gradually disappearing and we see our Chinese vendors growing in importance.  What is important in this market outlook or market development for Networks is obviously the fundamentals haven't changed.  The number of subscribers, the growth rate, the number of wide density main subscriptions is accelerating now 4.5 per month, 6.5 per month, and we're seeing continuously a lot of fixed broadband as well.  So, there's really nothing in the fundamentals.  We see a lot of strong base organic growth and that we already commented on.  And like we've said before, that this continues and it accelerates further, but we don't expect any upgrades in particular for 2008.</p>
          <p>We will then look at the next slide on Q4. In short, flattish sales, but still growth when taking the dollar effect into account.  Operating income I guess, very much where everybody expected it, knowing what we went through in Q3.  Better cash flow, that we'll come back to, and then the market comments that we have there you've all heard.  Reminding you of the two slides from before, on one hand we have the makeshift that goes on with a much higher proportion of new Network rollouts with initial lower margins, and at the same time that takes from lesser expansions and upgrades.  And what is more important there I would say, is the right slide there, where we talk about the value creation circle.</p>
          <p>Everything we do always starts with a new product with low volumes and less maturity and fighting for a new installed base, leading to lower margins, eventually ending up as an upgrading product, an installed base and a healthy business.  And, of course, every product goes through that cycle through its lifetime.  And what happens specifically to us now is the acceleration of the switch technology where we are going from circuit switching to soft switching, where we're going from upgrading traditional circuit switches where we have -- where every vendor has its captive position, to a fight about a new footprint and rollout on soft switch.  So that accelerates and that puts pressure on the margins.</p>
          <p>So, where do we want to be longer term?  Well, we have outpaced the market and grown fast in the market now for five years, and we expect to continue to do so.  Profitability, we are determined to have best in class margins.  We've had that through the five years.  Of course, last year was a year when all the competitors were in lawsuits so the comparison is less valid.  But still, we intend to be there irrespective of where the market is going to go.  Cash flow, we have an ambition to be over 70% and we got closer to that than we expected already in 2007. And if we then look at what we call our planning assumptions for 2008, we are &#x2013; we have pounded through them to plan for a flattish Mobile infrastructure market knowing what we learned here in the second half.  Professional Services, we expect to continue to grow, show good growth.  In this flattish scenario, we mustn't forget that there's nothing changing in industry fundamentals and the consumers support a more positive longer-term outlook.  But now our focus is on 2008 and what we need to do to live with the flattish infrastructure market.</p>
          <p>And therefore, we did announce this morning cost reductions of 4 billion.  These should be seen in context of our operational excellence program that we'll now accelerate in all areas.  We are looking at 4 billion in cost cuts to safeguard our competitive position, and of course on one hand, that's a lot of money, it will affect people. On the other hand, it should be seen in the view of &#x2013; in the light of a cost base of some 150 billion or so in the company.  So, this is an adjustment for a flattish market.  It will affect all areas throughout the company; SG&amp;A sourcing, supply, service, delivery and so.  We will be more cautious when it comes to R&amp;D because that is the muscle that builds up our technology and leadership and our market leadership throughout the world.</p>
          <p>Some thousand people will be affected in Sweden.  We haven't given a clear number for the whole world, but as a rule of thumb, it will probably be around a thousand per billion, so, maybe 3 times as much outside Sweden.  In Sweden, we will do it through voluntary programs as far as possible.  We expect full effects from the program in 2009 and we expect one-time charges of 4 billion during the year.  We're not taking them now in the quarter.  We will take them through the year, as each quarter, as each activity is launched and decided upon.  So, I will now hand over to Hans that will take us through the financial figures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Carl-Henric.  So, let me briefly go over the financial highlights of Q4.  We ended on the net sales of 54.5, which is a year-over-year growth of 0%.  Full year ended 187.8, which is a growth of 4%.  As Carl-Henric mentioned, in constant currency that is an 8% growth.  And just to be clear on that what we have down, we have excluded acquisitions so we can compare apples-to-apples.  And then we used a constant currency between the years and then you can see the growth.  So the conclusion is, of course, that we have an impact of the dollar decline that has been happening during 2007.  And as well said before, we have some 50% of our revenue in dollar-based revenues.  So that's how it pans out.</p>
          <p>We ended with operating income of 7.6 which is up from the third quarter, we were at 5.6.  However, given what will have been lost in the Q4, 2006, so SEK 12.2 billion.  It's a significant reduction, and as we previously explained, the reason for that is the different basis makes, and the technologies that we have on-going in Networks, that is what is coming through.</p>
          <p>An additional comment is the OpEx, the Q4 OpEx was 15.2 billion, which was higher, much higher than in the third quarter.  The main reason for that is seasonality, as we had much higher basis activity in the fourth quarter as well as we have also full impact of the acquired company in the fourth quarter, both from an intangible point, intangible dispensation point of view and also their OpEx coming into the results.</p>
          <p>If you then look at the net income, it landed on 5.6 versus 4.0 in the third quarter and last year 9.7, and that is of course a reflection on the business mix but also that we had somewhat better tax rate, which means that we have a little better result for the full year on net income.</p>
          <p>If I then comment on cash flow, we have 12 billion in cash flow in the fourth quarter, last year 11.  If we take the full year, we ended at 19 and then basically we had the same in 2006, 18.  We had a strong cash flow in the fourth quarter, with a favorable outcome on the working capital where inventory were down and accounts receivable fairly flat and then on the other current liabilities we had a favorable development as we had a lot of projects that came to conclusion, we added accrued expenses as well as accounts payable and VAT which is reflecting a higher level of projects.  And as you can note as well, we had a sequential, sequential growth of the Network rollout services above 60% and that, of course, is a reflection of the higher degree of projects.</p>
          <p>We also had a one-time effect for payment from Hut UK that impacted operational cash flow on SEK 1.6 million.  I will come back to that.  That ended our cash conversion of 66%, which is vested in 2006 and for those that have good memory, remember that I said that I told you it would be difficult to reach 57.  We passed it, and of course one of the reasons are the Hut's payment, the other is that we have -- also had -- the good focus in the organization on initial long term improvements that we can do on cash flow that somewhat exceeded expectations, at least mine.</p>
          <p>If we then go into the segments, starting with Networks, minus 4% growth in the quarter and 1% growth for the full year.  Here of course we have had significantly increase in market share in this challenging market that we have mentioned.  And of course the dollar impact is quite -- is big here -- and when we talk about constant currency on the Network side, that's why also we have somewhat of an impact there as well.</p>
          <p>If we talk about the margins, the operating margins in the fourth quarter for Network ended at 10%, with 8% in the third quarter and we had 21% in the fourth quarter 2006.  Of course a sharp decline since last year, and again the main reason is the business mix and the product mix that we've had now since the third quarter and that will continue. Just a short mention on the LTE. LTE has now been decided by a couple of the major operators in the world, DoCoMo, Vodaphone, and Verizon, which is a very positive sign and an important sign.</p>
          <p>If we then take Professional Services, Professional Services up 19% in constant currency, continued to show good growth and a good margin, stable on 15% operating margin, despite that of course it's going in and out.  Quite a lot of projects here.  I think that was positive. Two highlights; we are now 185 million subscribers in the networks that we are managing in the Managed Services area.  We also made an acquisition of an IPT, the company in Spain, in order to support our positioning in IPTV and we also need system integration resources.</p>
          <p>Finally then, you have mentioning the 3 UK contracts that have been renegotiated.  And this is the Managed Services contracts that were announced in 2005.  Here we are renegotiate the contract at 3 UK, have announced and will enter to a network sharing with T-Mobile UK, though we had to renegotiate parts that needed to be brought back in order to make the Network sharing.  The main activities in the Managed Services, they remain, that's the operations of the Network and ISI to Network, that will remain with Ericsson.  It will be a sales decrease that will impact our sales for Managed Services, but it will not have any margin impact.</p>
          <p>We will then go to Multimedia.  Multimedia growing 7% in the quarter, ended up SEK 4.9 billion, and on the full year up 14%.  Here we need to remember that we all are talking about the mix of businesses, some that are in very good shape, good growth and healthy margins, and we have areas where we are building a position where we have less sales at the moment.  There, as we are building a position, of course around IPTV, which we see as a very important area going forward, and around IMF and IMF applications.</p>
          <p>If we then just look into the acquisitions, LHS, Mobeon, and Drutt have been sort of performing well, even though LHS came in in the fourth quarter, so it's a little bit early when it comes to the full P&amp;L.  We acquired them a little bit earlier.  Tandberg on the other hand, have had a good progress, since they came in to the Ericsson family, had a challenging time as the bid process was almost for three-quarters, where they actually had some slower pace due to that.  But since they came in, they have been performing well.  Important here, I think is to point out that maybe there are going to be variations in quarters, but if we look at the full year, we have a -1% operating margin on the full year, and that is where we are, on the break even, with some areas, on the investments we're building position, and some areas which are performing well and being healthy.  So, that is how we look at it.  So, I will hand back to Carl-Henric to talk about the regions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>So, thank you Hans.  Couple of comments around regions, in general, for 2007.  If we look at the compounded average growth rate for Europe, it's been 10% over the last four years, it's basically flattish this year, and that are due to the consolidation effect that we have talked about, and you'll see the effect in Q4 more, more sharper.  If we look at the same region where we have grown stronger through the years, we have this year a growth rate of 5%.  This is a little bit lower, but is coming from lesser activities in the Middle East and to some extent also in Russia, where we are between two-year rollouts and three-year rollouts.  But, generally this is an interesting region of growth.</p>
          <p>Look at Asia-Pacific, we've been 24% up over the last four years, obviously get increasingly challenging with such percentage growth numbers.  We have been somewhat less, seen lesser growth this year, 14% partly due to, here the dollar effect has an impact.  And also at the end of the year, where we saw effects from the political unrest in Bangladesh, and Pakistan, and Thailand and so on, I'll come back and comment on that in the next slide.</p>
          <p>Latin America has turned up quite well.  We are there seeing continued 2G rollouts, also 3G.  North America has had a challenging year with comparable numbers from before, but also more so.  This is where we have the very clear dollar effects.  If we then look at Q4 as such we have in Western Europe, there we really saw a sharp decline in UK, 45% down, 47% down, due to network sharing, consolidation discussions that put things on hold, which affected the whole of Europe obviously.  We have the same things with consolidation effects on the market data in Italy as an example.  The CEMA region, we were flattish much for the reasons I said.  Middle East, slower and in between in Russia.  But generally good underlying this momentum and Central Europe and Africa is just continuing strongly there.  Asia-Pacific, this is in Q4, where we were affected by basically a 45% drop in Bangladesh and Thailand.  Pakistan was -- looked flattish with better comparable numbers from last year, but Pakistan is overall, year, is down 40% for the full year.  So this political turmoil, and state of emergency is making it difficult to roll out networks.  Hopefully this should go away here soon.</p>
          <p>China ended up strongly as we anticipated.  In fact, we have grown market share slightly through the year, in a year, where the Chinese numbers have grown their positions quite a lot on account of the other international vendors.  In Asia we also have had, but we have has so through the year, a tough comparison in Australia with last year's big rollout, 2006 year's big rollout for Telstar.  Latin America has really accelerated, strong growth there, for the reasons I mentioned.  For the full year, North America actually turned out positive, not because upgrades fall into the market easy, but rather strong expansion in the T-Mobile networks.  So that was just some regional comments.</p>
          <p>When we talk about Sony Ericsson, that is well known.  They have communicated the results.  We passed the 100 million mark for number of units sold.  Our market share is now over 9%, obviously stronger if you look in the GSM wideband CDMA track and in value.  The company's keeping the margins strong and healthy even through their shift to broader portfolio and penetrating further down into the entry segment.  The leading position they have in music is strong, 145 music in every phone sold year-to-date, and if you add to that their imaging position, they have built in Sony Ericsson a good position in the more richer phones in the high end of the market, and successfully penetrating down.</p>
          <p>So in summary, I would say that it's on one hand a good year considering market share gains and overall profit, but obviously a disappointing second half with the Network margins coming under pressure from the mix shift.  We're all planning for a flattish Mobile Networks market for 2008, and we're taking actions as a consequence of that.  We continue to see the competitive landscape evolving and obviously we must make sure that we do everything right in order to keep our leading position intact, and that's what we intend to do.  We mustn't look away from the fact that the fundamentals support a more positive longer-term outlook.  We have a few things that is going against us in the market right now, but over time there's no doubt that the need for communication is just increasing and creating exciting services for users and spreading also internet and communication and mobile telephony to emerging markets.</p>
          <p>We have as our last bullet here the Board will propose to the General Shareholders Meeting an unchanged dividend of SEK 50 per share.  With that said, I'll hand back to Gary to guide us through the questions.</p>

          <p>Hello, operator, we're ready to start our Q&amp;A session.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will begin the question and answer session.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  Detailed information is provided in the reports and Ericsson's Investor Relations and Media Relations team will be happy to take additional questions and discuss further details with you after the call.</p>
          <p>We will take our first question from Rod Hall from JPMorgan.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, thank you for taking my call or my question.  I just have a couple of questions, Carl-Henric I guess for you from a strategic point of view.  The first one is, just generally if you can help us understand, you talked about actions to safeguard your competitive position, if you could elaborate on those in more detail that would be helpful.  And the second one is with regards to the strategy on the margins.  I guess in Q3 what we learned here anyway, is that you're bidding a lot more aggressively, and I think that goes for the industry, not just Ericsson on these new network deals.  So the margins are coming in very low, and that's why the mix shift is having such a severe impact on your margins.  I guess the question I've got is, it's a technology-oriented industry, a lot of things can happen in two or three years, it's hard to tell how things are going to develop, and you're the market leader.  And I guess what I'm wondering is, why not go ahead and leave the prices up for the market now and try to make more money on those new network roll-outs as you install them, as opposed to trying to wait and make money on the upgrades later?  So those are my two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, to start with, the actions to set our competitive position.  What we're doing here, considering that we see a flattish scenario, of course then we have ambitions to outpace the market there and continue to take market share.  But you'll see from looking at a flattish market, we need to adjust for that so it means that we will trim the costs in all parts of the company with being a bit more cautious in R&amp;D.  But this will be right through SG&amp;A, and supply and sourcing, and administration, and so on.  So that will be done and even if we think that the market could return to a better growth rate, this is just an acceleration of the top operational excellence work that we continue to do.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the strategy for margins, it's -- you are, I think partly right in what you are saying.  I think we, it is so that the new networks, they always come at the lower margin because that's where you have the toughest competition.  That's where everybody is ready to go quite far to get a position for the network that then they will continue to live with for quite a while.  And it's not necessarily so much of a choice that you make there.  What we have seen in 2007 is that because of the turmoil on the vendors' side, we have won more new networks and got more break-ins because operators have gotten nervous about the vendor choices.  I guess that will gradually stabilize.  So, I think we will come back more to where we have been in the year before 2007.  But certainly we have ambitions to grow fast in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And if I could follow-up just on the R&amp;D point.  Are you -- you're trimming R&amp;D, but then we hear people like Verizon pushing faster on LTE trying to move that technology forward if they possibly can and probably others, as well, that we haven't heard about.  Are you worried at all about that?  Do you think you still got plenty of technological leadership, you've got LTE in the pipeline, not going to slow you down in that respect at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on one hand that what you're saying is right.  I mean there's a push for more rather than less and we have to maneuver that in the context of the market.  But at the same time, we have the biggest R&amp;D budget of all. So if we suffer, everybody else suffers more.  So I think this is part of data management.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will take our next question from Peter Dionisio from Morgan Stanley.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Just a couple of questions, the first one is on the competitive landscape.  Now it seems to us that Wowway continues to gain market share and continues to be very aggressive on price.  Do you think that the competitive environment today in wireless infrastructure is actually getting worse instead of stabilizing or instead of getting better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think it's different ingredients here because generally I think we are -- we have prerequisites for a more balanced market with fewer stronger players.  On the other hand, of course, Wowway is getting increasingly stronger and I think we need to realize that they are just one of the vendors today and they're not just coming in there for grabbing a first initial bridgehead or something.  They are a vendor in the system.  They have got vested in technologies and so on, of course they still have things that they need to develop before they are a maybe a fully-fledged partner for an operator.  At the same time, their cost advantage is not as dramatic as people think.  So the more business they take on, the more they're put under pressure to also make profitable business.  I would say it has been -- it is quite intense. It hasn't gotten less intense, and it's hard to speculate exactly how it's going to play out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just as a quick follow-up.  Could you comment as well on the impact that you have observed so far on Telco CapEx and in fact, just general business activity on your side on the back of general economic slowdown?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it's in fact -- we haven't seen -- it's not in the -- I wouldn't say it's in a dramatic difference if you look at operators worldwide.  But what we do have is that we have things going against the market right now, like the operating consolidation in Europe and the effects that that has.  That will go away.  But at the same time, others may start to consolidate.  But you may come into more of a balance situation, 40, 50 operators not consolidated in Europe.  So it's, I wouldn't say that there is a dramatic difference, but enough to put us down to a flattish market.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  Carl-Henric, maybe if you can give us your qualitative comments on just the growth opportunities in North America, perhaps the moving parts at AT&amp;T, and also the prospects with T-Mobile?  And I'm asking, since the initial CapEx indications from these carriers are actually -- it actually looks okay.  So any further qualitative comments would be helpful.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think we were a little bit -- we would have expected their ambitions to be somewhat more aggressive considering what kind of technologies they have at hand, but they have been slightly more cautious, I would say in 2007, and more so in the second half than maybe we expected in the first place. And I think to some extent also impacted by the whole discussion about the recession and where things would be.  And so AT&amp;T has been more cautious.  On the other hand, their other competitors have been more aggressively building out their networks, and so we have actually had good growth in all other accounts.  We're actually following the big rollout last year and the year before.  We have actually been down on AT&amp;T, and also for other operators.  Looking now into the year to come with the spectrum auctions, that should lead to new initiatives and other technologies.  And people's desires to actually get mobile growth then I think things should start to move in US.  The question is of course, when?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Hello.  I've got in fact two questions.  Could you shed some light on the difference of growth between the fixed and mobile markets you can expect for the current year?  My second question was about this pay-time mobile -- mobile data, sorry.  We had good pieces of news recently when -- from Vodaphone yesterday.  When do you think that this could start to kick in terms of more CapEx needed in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the latter question and I'll hand over to Hans to talk about fixed mobile here.  We have a dramatic increase in data traffic in Europe.  I think everybody sees that.  I think it was interesting just to note that in Sweden alone with nine million people, that we sold half a million of PC laptop cards last year.  That was just beyond any expectation.  We are coming however in new DSL efforts with quite some capacitors. So we have said that it will probably take beyond 2008 before we start to see any bigger expansion.  You have a couple of operators that are already expanding and pushing very, very hard with mobile broadband propositions that are well on par with ADSL or any other broadband connections.  It is also interesting to note that in the 3G efforts in Europe that we have delivered and monitored, data traffic today exceeds voice traffic.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> we're installing them in 2007.  We can conclude that we have internal vested roles in the fixed business and in mobile business, but that is of course coming from a lower portion of fixed business.  That's why -- given that we have been investing in fixed business and we have a good product portfolio coming with some of the acquisitions we have done we have been growing faster there.</p>

          <p>Hi.  With Motorola announcing it's exploring its structure and strategy, can you talk about whether that presents you with any strategic advantages, and also whether any aspects of the Motorola business itself would be of any interest to Ericsson?  And then on balance sheet, following Bristol-Myers' announcement yesterday in relation to short-term investments, can you just give us some comfort over the SEK 29.4 billion of short-term investments that you've got on balance sheet, just so that we have comfort that these aren't in CDO-related triple-A rated assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if I start off with the Motorola question, see if the other captures your second question, I'm not sure we got it right.  But on the Motorola side, they are -- we all know the difficulty they have ended up with, and they are now taking -- seem to be taking steps of the kinds that we did five years ago when we separated mobile business and the other businesses, so that we can see the logics in it.  We're not sure what their intentions are.  I must say that we have &#x2013; we are probably the comparable of all our competitors that have acquired the least because we do base our strategy on our own internal work, R&amp;D and organic growth.  Any big mergers always in this industry, is quite cumbersome and has a price so the benefits of it must be quite strong before you move in that direction.  So with that more cautious view, I think that we will have answered your question there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just confirm, are you saying that you would look at those assets if they were separated?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We, I mean as professional business leaders, we look at everything, but we would have a very cautious view on such a thing because we do believe you are better off doing it on your own, as you are faster to market the new ideas then.</p>

          <p>Hi and thank you very much.  I've got a question &#x2013; early in the press conference, you mentioned that you were renegotiating some contracts and I was trying to understand what your renegotiating, I'm assuming perhaps payment terms; and if you could talk us through perhaps some of the issues in trying to get operators to renegotiate those contracts.  Do you have to take any margin hits, any cost hits and how do those pan out?  Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we are doing is that we are focusing obviously a lot on cash flow related activities as we've had such growth on turnkey and in early markets along with payment terms, what we are pushing there is, we're pushing terms and conditions in new contracts. There could be one or two exceptions where we can go in and also discuss in one contract if there are other reasons for negotiations.  But generally that is not the path forward.  This is something that we'll penetrate to over a time with new contracts wins.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes thanks very much.  You said at the time of the third quarter results and again I think in New York in November that there was hope for improving mix in the second half of the year particularly with European operators, spending patterns improved, and I guess the bottom line is we were hoping for an improvement in gross margin as we go through the year.  How confident are you now compared to say back in November or October that we could see this improvement and what are the key swing factors that we should be looking for?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We &#x2013; well we're not guiding on margins and so on, but the comment that we made, it was related to the fact that we should have such -- everything else equal.  We should have the mix stabilizing as we went through the year and then it would lead obviously to better margins but in this dynamic industry other things may come in as well and we're not going to guide on that but it is -- we have no new view on the -- neither our performance or the market than we had at that time.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question.  First of all, could you maybe provide some additional detail on the huge swing that we saw in Q4 in your cash flow statement in the line item Other Current Assets?  I think if I did the numbers right, there was a swing in Q4 of SEK 11.5 billion.  Can you maybe, given the size of that, break it down into the key components?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would answer on that and yes we had a favorable development on Other Current Liabilities and that reflects our higher level of projects that we completed in the fourth quarter, as you have seen also if you follow the line on network rollout within the segment networks, that was up sequentially over 60%.  That made us to have a favorable outcome there, especially on accrued expenses, VAT and accounts payable.  That was the three main areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how has that developed at the start of the year?  I mean, could we see a similar swing in the other direction in Q4, in Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that VAT, of course, that swings back when you have that type, but...</p>

          <p>Given the focus, investor's focus on cash conversion, I think it might help if you were to provide maybe some additional detail here.  Maybe just a quick follow-up, the market has been waiting for 3G in China for three years now.  Any news?  My understanding is that 3G licenses will be issued, finally, in April.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well.  I'm not sure whether it's April, but what we are -- what we have also added to that picture is that we expect the structure reform to happen first.  Where China is looking at how their four big and two smaller operators eventually will be structured and I think we have reasons to believe that that should happen rather soon.  Then about the 3G licenses, it is, of course, a matter of how they see the Chinese standard mature.  And the general expectation is that they will follow licenses after this structure reform, however, I would at least bet that it would take beyond the Olympic Games.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Thanks for taking my question.  First, just a clarification, why was SG&amp;A up so much this quarter?  And how should we think about it going forward?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we wrote in the report, the main reason for OpEx being up is seasonality and also that we have now full impact of our acquisitions in our OpEx.  So where there are seasonality affects in it, it's in the OpEx.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see.  And second, could you give us some more detail on the 3 UK negotiation?  How much of the revenue you were receiving are we going to be getting going forward?  And is there any potential for key mobile revenue there?  And I would have thought that you -- like what's the return on capital at this point on that deal?  Is that pretty much impaired because of this shift?  And are other deals at the risk as well?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I think we have been very detailed in the discussion on the separate customer contracts.  We cannot go in all details, but as you said, first of all, the scope has been changed in order to meet the ATOR, in order for them to be able to do network sharing.  That will have an impact on the Managed Services growth sequentially, because it's going to be less.  However, it's going to be somewhat compensated for T-mobile UK, where we now will do the field operations.  That came in in fourth quarter, so we have that already in the figures in fourth quarter.  So, that means we have both in the fourth quarter.  And then, the risk of other being the same.  I think this is a very special one and it's the broadest scope, that we've had so far on the Managed Services team.  So I'm wouldn't say it's a trend or something like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think also one should say, because listening to the tone of some questions here, we, this is not a negative development for us.  When we get the Managed Services deal somewhere one of the up sides is that you also get some other Managed Services deal in that country, which means that you have further synergies that you can share and explore.  And this is exactly what has happened, but of course you have to adjust your contract so that that Managed Services can take place.  So from our point of view, this is a logical and positive development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and again, just to follow up on the SG&amp;A, can you give us an idea of what the ramp quarter to quarter was in terms of seasonality versus the new acquisitions?  It sounds like SG&amp;A is going to stay fairly high, and I just want to make sure that I understand correctly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I will not give you any specifics there.  But again, the main part is seasonality, and their portion of all of these acquisitions and there'll be some pieces all over.  So, you shouldn't see that as a running rate being 15.2 off the top of OpEx.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Hi, thank you.  I just wanted to go back to how the profit shortfall in Q3 took you by surprise, coming really at the end of the quarter.  And I wondered what processes you put in place to prevent this being such a surprise should it happen again, and what metrics you should have been tracking back then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we are doing because there's nothing that we are lacking in information as such in either the systems or the company.  But, this is more a matter of whether we can get even closer to our customers and be more updated on their immediate plans for operating expansion.  Such tend to happen with a high degree of regularity and follows traffic growth.  So, the main focus in most customer discussions that takes place is around new projects and technology choices and so on.  We are putting a much tighter focus now especially since we have a slower growth scenario, putting a much tighter focus on office expansions and software and upgrades and we are doing that in a structured form throughout the world.  So that we can see the path and see if we can explore customers thoughts and planning before it actually goes into action.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks, just a couple of questions.  The first one's for Carl-Henric, with respect to market shares gains are growing faster than the market, when I look at what you said you seem to be implying that you're going to be a bit more selective on contracts going forward. On top of that, it seems that -- you've been quite clear that the Chinese vendors are as aggressive if not more aggressive than in the past.  And then finally, there is a good chance that  Nokia Siemens and Alcatel Lucent are going to be more aggressive than in the past as well.  I can't square that with how you're going to grow faster than the market in 2008.  That's my first question.  The second question is that, would you comment on the flexibility of your business model now compared to three or four years ago, because you obviously -- the outlook has deteriorated over the last three months, so the revenue growth of the industry is going to be flat now. What if the revenues were down 5%?  What is your ability to react now versus the past? Is it quicker and if so why?  Thanks.</p>

          <p>If you look at the competitive landscape you're mentioning a number of things that have happened and a number of actors here in the field, remember though that first of all, all the changes and mergers and so on are not yet done.  But remember also that, that there are still quite some market shares from all the other vendors that were once a dozen and they are gradually shrinking.  And if you look at our market share gains in 2007, has been more on such accounts because that is where the worry is the biggest of course, for an operator on this vendor choice. On other vendors it is just a matter of being the most attractive partner for customers with a better technology and lead position and so on.  If it comes to our flexibility, I do believe we have a fairly good flexibility and have built up that too in the last years.  We have a fairly high degree of temporary workers and so in our supply chain and even somewhat in some areas of R&amp;D where we can work with that way.  And I think our ability to adjust I think is quite good.  Any major cost adjustment is always painful and takes time.  But I think we have a pretty high preparedness and we have, I think we have shown that within the company at different times, that it is an industry where all the time bits and pieces, some parts grow fast and others shrink.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just one follow-up, and I wasn't clear on your previous comments.  Do you expect the business mix to improve as we go through this year or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not guiding on where things will be.  What we said in Q3 was that the reasons for the shortfall of expansions and upgrades from operators in Europe and so, they should gradually go away. And all then equal, that should improve our margins. But of course, other considerations could take place, other things could happen. But certainly what hit us in Q3 was to some extent temporary and will go away.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks for taking my question.  I don't want to flog a dead horse here, but I want to come back to the SG&amp;A line, and okay I understand there's seasonality and I understand you made some acquisitions, and of course OpEx go up, but sales should also, gone up. And I just want to better understand what's going on in Multimedia.  Is it fair to assume that an increase, especially in selling expenses is related to the Multimedia division, which at this stage is quite small in the overall context, but of course could be, or could drive also growth in other access segments. I would like to understand if the weakness in Multimedia is related to higher selling expense because you have to, let's call it, invest in new revenue streams.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good comment.  As I said at the press conference today, I mean if we look into SG&amp;A of course there's a certain amount of investment there as well in our market unit in order to meet the new growth portfolio that we have when we had made the acquisition in 2007, so yes you can say that. That is somewhat right, and then of course Multimedia has launched four acquisitions this year, which are in new segments where you need to develop your SG&amp;A qualities as well, but then we come back to what we discussed earlier about the cost of adjustment program. We will focus there as well on SG&amp;A so it is sort of a balance of still investing on SG&amp;A resources that can tell our broader portfolio at the same time see that we can take away other things so it's all balanced.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I just can maybe add one more question to that, I understand that in wireless infrastructure, you are top notch and you have <mark type="inaudible" /> margins, okay that's fairly clear and understood but in new segments at least for Ericsson such as IPTV and IMS of course is new for the entire industry. I mean, do you see this as new adjacent markets you want to enter that will incur further costs in 2008? And when do you think you will reach a stage where you could reasonably believe in double-digit margins?</p>

          <p>In the Multimedia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Multimedia is as we say -- it is a mixture of healthy businesses with good growth and healthy margins and it is these investments. There is -- if you want to invest, as we do, in IPTV which as you're saying is new for everybody in this industry, if you want to build a position there, this is not something you do in a year or two. This is a long-term buildup for the position. But on the other hand, if you look up any large operator, if you look at their plans for the next five years, the largest growth in multimedia services to the customer base is, and traffic, is IPTV and so on. And remember then that IPTV is not just the TV part of it, it drives fiber investments, it drives transmission investments, it drives router investments and even mobile broadband.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Two questions. One for Hans Vestberg. After you've restored the EBIT margin by division, or EBIT by division disclosure, could you go through perhaps what further concrete steps Ericsson might be able to take in improving disclosure? And maybe what prevents you from publishing a target business model, or some margin targets, the way pretty much all of your major competitors do even if they're several years out, and then you mark off the progress towards them? And one for Carl-Henric Svanberg. When we look at the handset business and what Nokia and Samsung and others are doing it's clear that the value is shifting towards content and consumer services. Would Ericsson be open to altering the JV structure of Sony Ericsson to realize maybe the positive value that doesn't seem to be reflected in the Ericsson share price? And also prepare Sony Ericsson a bit more for moving into the other realm, which moves away from sort of  Ericsson's core strength and more towards Sony and other content companies? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question, on disclosures, and as you mentioned yourself, we have taken some steps to improve it, and of course I've been listening a lot to all of you out there, what we can do, and that it has just to make sense for all of us. So we continue to work on that and see what we should disclose and what will beneficial for your understanding, and for shareholder's understanding, and that's, those steps we will continue to take. But nothing new that I can announce today. But, as I said, I'm working on it, and we have taken some steps already now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to Sony Ericsson they have a strategic importance to us, and gradually more so I would say. The more the handsets get richer, and we're getting more and more communicating devices, this is also strengthening the relationship, not just with Sony Ericsson but also with Sony, because most of their products becomes communicating pieces, and part of an old communicating multimedia world. It gives us, Sony Ericsson, also a better understanding for the consumer and what works or not. When it comes to whether the value of that is actually recognized and appreciated, I think you are, as analysts, are better to judge that. I don't know which, if there is an unrealized value I'm not sure which part that people haven't realized. But certainly Sony Ericsson is of importance to us.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, this is Anders Sandberg from RAM. Just had a follow-on question regarding the money you received from Hutchinson Whampoa for the service contract. Exactly what was it booked against, and I've heard different things that it's booked against accounts receivable, and it's booked against the property company <mark type="inaudible" />. If it's booked against receivables that's definitely that it's already been invoiced earlier in the year, or how should we see it? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The portion that is impacting operation cash flow, that has been booked against our asset side especially on accounts receivable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that would imply that it has been invoiced earlier this year but the customer hasn't paid yet, but are paying in Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have had, there's been an accounting treatment here, a percent of completion, so we'll add them onto, we'll take the books down and then we have some other items as well, and that's where it ends. And, we cannot go in any further in because now we're into very detailed customer relations and contract and I cannot comment then any more.</p>
