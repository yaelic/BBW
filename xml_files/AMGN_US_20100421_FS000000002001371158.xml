          <p>My name is Christian, and I'll be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's First Quarter 2010 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&amp;A session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Christian. Good afternoon everybody. I would like to welcome you to our first quarter results conference call. All with a 9% gain in revenues and a 20% increase in adjusted EPS, I would say we are off to a pretty good start this year. This year is already shaping up to be one with remarkable changes. I'm referring of course to the passage of the healthcare reform bill which is a major development for our company and our industry.</p>
          <p>I'm joined today by Kevin Sharer, our Chairman and CEO. Kevin will address our strategic priorities for this year and also provide his perspective on the healthcare reform legislation. Our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Bradway, will then discuss our first quarter results in greater detail and address how healthcare reform is expected to influence our growth outlook for the full year.</p>
          <p>George Morrow, our Executive Vice President of Global Commercial Operations will then discuss our product performance in the United States and our strong performance in international markets together with a description of how different components of the healthcare reform legislation are expected to influence our business and when. And then finally Roger Perlmutter, our Executive Vice President of R&amp;D will provide an update on recently completed studies with denosumab in the treatment of skeletal related events and our regulatory interactions regarding Prolia in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
          <p>We'll use slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you separately by e-mail. I would like to remind you that our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement. In other words, through the course of our presentation today, we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results could vary materially.</p>
          <p>We'll use non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business performance although the GAAP reconciliation's are provided in our press release.</p>
          <p>So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Arvind. Good afternoon, everyone. As Arvind mentioned, we're pleased with our first quarter results and I want to thank all of Amgen's staff who worked so hard to deliver them on behalf of patients and shareholders.</p>
          <p>As you'll see when George talks, our base business of marketed products in the U.S. is performing well and we note the continued strong growth from our international business. Arvind talked about healthcare reform and we will provide you with granularity today about how healthcare reform will affect us. George will with Bob's help, talk about that, but I'd like to give you some perspective.</p>
          <p>Healthcare reform will come at us in basically three ways. One is, cost to our marketed products that George will outline, another will be a fee later, almost a tax like thing, and the third thing is the preservation of the framework for innovation and importantly, the new follow-on biologics framework, which we believe is fair to innovators. It lets new entrants come in, and it gives patients and doctors the right framework. We think that's a particularly important development and good for our industry and good for patients.</p>
          <p>When we provided our guidance for 2010 in January as you recall, we did not include the impact of healthcare reform. And now that we can see the details, we've got a better sense of the probable impact and I'm pleased to note that we will be able to stay within the previous guidance range although at the low end, but I consider that a prudent move. As I also said in my quote, we will take steps over time to address some of the new costs in healthcare reform and we'll have more details on that as time goes on.</p>
          <p>Obviously this year, we're all keenly anticipating the launch of Prolia in the United States and in Europe. Roger will give you more color on that. I'm sure it will be part of our conversation. But I must say, I'm in a very optimistic place right now. We're not going to predict any timing. But I feel very, very good about where we are around the world. We have in the U.S. a world-class sales force. We've retained the people we hired. They are busy working. In markets outside the U.S. and Japan, we have a collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline that we are increasingly pleased with. We're also enthusiastic about denosumab's potential to help people with cancer and we'll file for that indication. Roger will talk about that.</p>
          <p>So when I think about what we're trying to do here, it's a fairly enduring set of objectives. We want to deliver financially; I'm confident we will. We want to advance the pipeline that features of course right now most prominently Prolia and denosumab, but there are many other things in the pipeline we're interested in. Expanding internationally has been a priority for us over the years, and we continue to do that. I'm pleased with the progress. And as always, we want to create value for shareholders as we try to advance the business and serve patients.</p>
          <p>With these introductory comments, I'll turn it over to Bob who can begin to talk more about the detailed financial dimensions of this quarter. Bob?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Kevin. On page 5, I'll walk you through the adjusted P&amp;L for the quarter. And as you can see, year-over-year revenues were up 9% in the first quarter to $3.6 billion. And in terms of the geographic mix of our revenues, let me point out a few things about our U.S. sales which were up 7% to $2.7 billion for the quarter.</p>
          <p>First note that, excluding Aranesp, which was down for the quarter, U.S. sales were otherwise up 9% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting the strength of our core franchises. Second, with respect to wholesaler inventories, note that we exited the quarter in the U.S. with overall wholesaler inventories at the mid to low end of our normal ranges. And finally, in the first quarter, U.S. revenues include a $33 million accrual for healthcare reform. We expect the full-year 2010 impact of healthcare reform to be in the range of 200 to $250 million, and George will speak in some detail in a moment about healthcare reform and its impact on our business.</p>
          <p>Shifting now to international revenues. We posted a strong quarter with sales of $851 million, which represents an increase of 16% versus the prior year. Changes in foreign exchange positively impacted the first quarter sales by $39 million. Without that benefit, international sales were still up a strong 10% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Turning now to operating expenses. On an adjusted basis, our total operating expenses were up 8% this quarter versus last year. And in terms of the components, let me walk you through them. Our cost of sales margin decreased 0.3% this quarter primarily driven by efficiencies and lower royalties. That together with the higher average net selling prices and favorable foreign exchange largely offset the impact of the less favorable product mix for us in the quarter, enabling us to drive up our gross margin.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D expenses were up about 2%, primarily driven by higher staff-related costs and lower partnership expense recoveries which in turn were partially offset by the lower clinical trial costs for the quarter following the completion of our denosumab skeletal related event studies.</p>
          <p>Shifting to the SG&amp;A, you can see our SG&amp;A expenses were up 13% versus the same quarter last year. This increase includes higher staff related costs and spending for activities in anticipation of the launch of Prolia. Once Prolia is approved, we expect Prolia related expenses to further increase as we begin promotional expenditures as well.</p>
          <p>And recall we are looking this number that in the first quarter of 2009, we had not yet hired the U.S. Prolia sales force, and that explains part of the difference you are seeing this year. In addition, SG&amp;A expenses were higher due to the higher expenses associated with our Enbrel profit share as well as higher litigation expenses, which in turn were somewhat offset by expense recoveries associated with our new collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline in connection with Prolia. Excluding expenses associated with the Enbrel profit share, adjusted SG&amp;A in the first quarter increased 15% versus the same quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the tax rate, our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 20% compared to 21.5% for the prior year. This reduction was primarily due to the increased manufacturing and profits in Puerto Rico, and the favorable tax impact of changes in our revenue and expense mix, which were partially offset by the lack of benefit from the federal R&amp;D tax credit in the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>In terms of earnings per share, our first quarter adjusted EPS were $1.30, which is an increase of 20% versus the prior year. And on a GAAP basis, we earned $1.18, which is up 20% versus the prior year. As you can see on page 6, we once again ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and strong cash flows. Our global first quarter ending cash balance was $14.1 billion, and we ended the quarter with $12.2 billion of debt. And to remind you during the quarter, we issued $1 billion of debt, which will in part help us retire our next debt maturity of $2.5 billion in February of 2011.</p>
          <p>With respect to our cash flows, we generated about $900 million of cash flow from operations in the first quarter, which was an improvement of about 6% versus last year. Our cash flow from operations for the last 12 months is about $6.4 billion.</p>
          <p>CapEx for the first quarter was $94 million, and on a weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding basis for the quarter, we had 988 million shares after repurchasing approximately 29 million shares during the first quarter at a cost of about $1.7 billion.</p>
          <p>We have 4.3 or we had $4.3 billion remaining under our board authorized stock repurchase programs as at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Shifting now to guidance on slide 7, taking into account our first quarter performance and the impact of healthcare reform, we now expect as Kevin said earlier, revenue to be towards the low end of our current guidance range of 15.1 to $15.5 billion, and the guidance range for 2010 now includes the expected impact from healthcare reform of some 200 to $250 million.</p>
          <p>Before I turn to EPS, I'll address operating expenses, and let me remind you that our typical spending patterns are weighted towards the second half of the year and that will be particularly true in 2010 as we make additional investments to support the launch of Prolia globally.</p>
          <p>Compared to the first quarter, you should expect operating expense to ramps up for the remainder of the year. And on a full year basis, we expect an increase of operating expenses in the mid single digit range for 2010 versus 2009 due to the anticipated global Prolia launch. In light of healthcare reform, as Kevin also noted, we're looking at the appropriate changes to the growth in our expenses and we'll have more to say about that later in the year.</p>
          <p>We now expect adjusted EPS to be towards the low end of our current guidance range of 5.05 to 5.25 for 2010. And with respect to the tax rate, we continue to expect our 2010 adjusted rate to be in a range of 20 to 21%. And just as a reminder, this assumes that the R&amp;D tax credit will be retroactively extended for 2010. And finally we expect capital expenditures to approximate $600 million in 2010.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to George.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Bob. And let's go right to the commercial highlights on slide 9. Product sales grew by 290 million or 9% year-on-year, aided by several factors. Global demand increases for all products except Aranesp with particular strength in the Filgrastim and EPOGEN franchises. Our more recently launched products contributed 79 million in year-on-year growth with more than half of that coming from our international business; 99 million in favorable year-on-year inventory benefit as wholesalers moderated their quarter four to quarter one draw down versus last year; 39 million in favorable foreign exchange effect; and finally we booked 33 million in accruals for government rebate increases due to the recently enacted healthcare reform legislation, and I'll have much more to say about that in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Sequentially, global sales declined 6% or 215 million, influenced significantly by lower sequential sales for our EPOGEN and Enbrel franchises. As we've seen in the past, these quarter four to quarter one comparisons generally reflect a seasonal effect, particularly in the U.S. market.</p>
          <p>The next slide graphically illustrates the components of year-over-year growth in the first quarter excluding foreign exchange gain. As Bob mentioned, U.S. Aranesp was the only component of our product portfolio to decline in the first quarter, though it was offset by 9% growth in our other products. I'll discuss each of the product results in more detail in a few moments.</p>
          <p>Slide 11 shows the effect of inventory changes on our quarterly sales. In the fourth quarter 2009, we experienced an inventory draw down versus the inventory build seen in prior years. As expected, this reduced the depressing effect of inventory burn off in the first quarter 2010 that we experienced in the prior year. The result was a contribution of $99 million in growth year-over-year for the quarter. Having said that, end of first quarter inventory positions were at the low to midpoint of the normal range.</p>
          <p>Next slide. Okay, I'll take a few minutes now to provide some insights on how healthcare reform will impact Amgen. This is intended along with comments on guidance to give you a way to assess the overall impact healthcare reform might have as we move forward.</p>
          <p>First it's important to recognize that although the new law begins to impose costs in the pharmaceutical sector in 2010, it does not begin providing appreciable increases in coverage until 2014. As a result, costs to the industry will be recognized for several years before appreciable revenue is recognized from coverage expansion.</p>
          <p>Aside from a potential revenue lift from the insurance mandate within the legislation, there are seven additional components to healthcare legislation that may have a meaningful impact on our financial performance over time, and I'll briefly touch on each one of these.</p>
          <p>Note that there are a wide range of effective dates for these elements and that must be considered in estimating the evolution of financial impact to Amgen. The first item shown here is the increase in the statutory based Medicaid rebate from 15.1 to 23.1% on the current Medicaid book of business. This rate is applied to the statutorily defined average manufacturers price or AMP to establish the minimum dollar value of rebates that Amgen pays to the states. Note that an increase in Medicaid rebates also reduces public health service or PHS pricing. The effective date for this item is January 1, 2010 also, so we have already booked a quarter one accrual for the estimated cost of this item.</p>
          <p>The second item on the list is a definitional change in the calculation of average manufacturer price. In the healthcare reform bill, this price definition was refined to exclude clinics and hospitals, effectively making it a measure of retail pricing, historically our lowest discount segment. The effect of this is to raise AMP, thus raising the dollar value of Medicaid rebates and reducing PHS pricing for certain products. This item has an effective date of October 1, 2010, so it did not impact our quarter one accrual.</p>
          <p>The third item here is the extension of rebates to Medicaid reimbursed business and managed care organizations. The Medicaid rebates will be extended to 15 to 20 million additional Medicaid beneficiaries, now in managed care organizations that do not receive statutory rebates. This one is effective as of March 23, 2010, so it had a small increment to our healthcare reform accrual for quarter one. The annualized impact of this item may be double that of the increase noted in Item 1.</p>
          <p>The fourth item on the list is the expansion of Medicaid eligibility to include those below 133% of the federal poverty level from the prior cut-off that in general was about 100% of FPL or lower. When effected, this will increase the Medicaid beneficiary base by an estimated 16 million people. Because this provision is not effective until 2014, there is no 2010 financial impact.</p>
          <p>The fifth item on the list is the mandate for manufacturers to provide a 50% discount to Medicare patients who reach the Part D share coverage limit and enter the so-called doughnut hole. For Amgen, this impact is limited to our two current products that are reimbursed in pharmacies, that would be Enbrel and Sensipar, and eventually will have some impact on Prolia.</p>
          <p>There should be some benefit offsetting the costs due to more patients successfully getting through the doughnut hole into catastrophic coverage, but this is very difficult to project at this time. It has a January 1, 2011 effective date, so no accrual will be taken this year.</p>
          <p>Item 6 is an expansion of the Public Health Service or PHS eligible hospitals. Additional children's hospitals, freestanding cancer centers, critical access hospitals and rural referral centers will now be eligible for PHS pricing for their outpatient purchases.</p>
          <p>The PHS price approximates the Medicaid price. This item is one of the more modest factors on the list, and the effective date for this item is January 1, 2010. So our quarter one accrual contains a full quarter's impact of this one.</p>
          <p>Finally the last item is the annual pharmaceutical industry fee. This is one of the more straightforward items conceptually. There is in the legislation an annual dollar amount that must be assessed across the large companies in our industry. This amount is apportioned to each individual company based upon a calculation of that entity's share of total public plan sales. This item is also one of the largest on the list, and additionally is not tax deductible. It has an effective date of January 1, 2011, so we will not be accruing for this in 2010.</p>
          <p>On an individual product basis, it's important to consider the highly variable difference in exposure to these seven items. The key driver of these differences is each product's exposure to the affected public program.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we had seven important elements of healthcare reform that will impact Amgen meaningfully. Two of these items have a full first quarter impact in quarter one and one has a very small quarter one impact. Thus the $33 million quarter one accrual represents largely the impact of the base rebate increase and the PHS program expansion. On a full year basis, we expect the impact from healthcare reform to be in the, as Bob mentioned, 200 to $250 million range for 2010 or roughly 2% of domestic sales. As of the beginning of 2011, two more elements will begin to affect our sales line. We expect to provide additional information on the ramp-up of the sales effects of healthcare reform in future calls.</p>
          <p>Next slide. Worldwide, Aranesp sales were flat in the first quarter versus last year. In the U.S., Aranesp sales were down 8% year-over-year, while internationally, Aranesp sales were up 7%. Slide 14 displays actual weekly U.S. Aranesp sales going back to 2008. As a reminder, the sharp peaks and troughs are largely a result of inventory buildups and depletions, not fluctuations in actual patient utilization.</p>
          <p>The red trend lines indicate average weekly sales over the past five quarters. These lines exclude returns and discount accrual true-ups as well as the effects of wholesaler inventory fluctuations, which serve to distort the quarter-on-quarter comparisons shown on the previous slide. As you can see, average weekly sales for Aranesp have declined slightly in the fourth quarter of 2010, reflecting a trend towards more conservative use of ESAs.</p>
          <p>In late March, we launched the REMS and CMS held a MEDCAC meeting to gather information on the use of ESAs in the nephrology setting. We cannot rule out a further decline in Aranesp sales as a result of these events.</p>
          <p>Next slide. EPOGEN grew by 10% in the first quarter of 2010 versus the first quarter of 2009, driven by patient growth, higher doses, and wholesaler inventory. During the year, dose fluctuations may continue as healthcare practitioners refine their treatment practices in order to maintain hemoglobin levels in the 10 to 12 range. And we still expect to receive the final bundling rules in the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>Next is slide 16. Neulasta and NEUPOGEN combined grew 10% in the first quarter of 2010 versus the first quarter of 2009. In the U.S., sales grew 8% year-over-year driven by inventory and price offset by a slight decrease in units. Neulasta wholesaler inventory levels exited the first quarter below the normal range while NEUPOGEN exited at the low end of the normal range. Internationally, Neulasta and NEUPOGEN grew 14% year-on-year with 9% growth excluding foreign exchange effects.</p>
          <p>Enbrel is next on slide 17. Net sales were up 6% versus the first quarter of 2009. Half of the growth was driven by wholesaler inventory with the remainder coming from demand. Within demand, price growth was offset by a slight unit decline. The unit decline was primarily in dermatology, where we lost some share year-over-year to new competition.</p>
          <p>On a sequential quarter basis, Enbrel net sales were down 12%. As we've highlighted on prior calls, both rheumatology and dermatology segments had historically been impacted by seasonality, with softness typically seen in the first quarter. On our last call, we described our stepped-up efforts to assist patients working through financial hardships with specific new offerings in our Enbrel support program and enhancements to our co-pay program. During the first quarter, these programs had solid uptake, and give us confidence that we're if fact helping appropriate patients start and stay on therapy.</p>
          <p>So on to Sensipar on slide 18. For the first quarter, worldwide Sensipar sales grew 21% versus the first quarter of 2009, primarily driven by global demand and U.S. wholesaler inventory. Once we learn more about how oral drugs such as Sensipar will be handled in the 2011 ESRD bundle, we'll be in a better position to comment on any potential effect on demand.</p>
          <p>Next is Vectibix on slide 19. U.S. Vectibix sales remained flat versus the prior year, while international sales grew 50% in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 20 summarizes our international sales performance. Internationally, sales grew 10% excluding the effects of foreign exchange versus the prior year. Growth was driven by Neulasta conversion, new product launches and expansion into new territories.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, we'll look at share data for Aranesp in nephrology. Consistent with previous commentary, Aranesp nephrology share remains steady as biosimilars continue to take share from EPO-alpha and EPO-beta, and Mircera growth continues to derive largely from NeoRecormon.</p>
          <p>My last slide provides comparable data for the G-CSF market. Again very consistent trends, as Neulasta share grew slightly in the face of biosimilar in our major markets. Roger?</p>

          <p>Thanks, George. Slide 24 outlines the topics that I will address this afternoon. During the first quarter, we obtained important new data regarding the use of denosumab to delay skeletal related events in patients with advanced cancer. I'll provide an update on these results. I'll also describe the progress that we're making in discussions with regulatory agencies regarding the use of denosumab in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis.</p>
          <p>The first quarter has been an extremely busy period for our development and regulatory affairs groups. And I want to highlight some of their activities as well as providing a preview of our presentations to the American Society for Clinical Oncology meeting in June. Finally I'll recap the slate of clinical trials that will yield data later this year.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 25, during this quarter we obtained results from our head-to-head study of denosumab administered at a dose of 120 milligrams subcutaneously every month compared with the Zometa administered through monthly intravenous infusion according to the label instructions in patients with advanced prostrate cancer and bony metastases.</p>
          <p>Denosumab was superior to Zometa in delaying the time to the first onset of these skeletal related event, which is compositive fractures, the need for surgery to bone, the need for radiation therapy for bony tumors and spinal cord compression and the first and subsequent skeletal related events. Hence, denosumab in this patient population proved superior to the best available therapy, the standard of care.</p>
          <p>The hazard ratio for the time to the first SRE was 0.82 which is very much in accord with what we have seen in our two previous Phase III trials. Adverse event rates were generally similar between the two treatment arms. I should note that in this study there were 22 cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw in the denosumab arm and 12 cases in the Zometa arm, a numerical imbalance that did not reach statistical significance. Summing over our entire advanced oncology program, we've had 52 adjudicated patients with ONJ in denosumab treated patients compared with 37 in Zometa treated patients.</p>
          <p>The 103 study is the third major Phase III study that we've performed with denosumab in advanced cancer patients. As shown on slide 26, together these studies involved nearly 6,000 patients. These studies along with our Phase II dose ranging studies form the basis for filing for denosumab in the advanced cancer indication. We have now completed pre-filing interactions with the regulatory agencies around the world and we are well along in assembling all of the data for submission.</p>
          <p>We expect to complete U.S. and European filings in the second quarter of this year. Denosumab as employed in the advanced cancer indication is administrated at 12 times the dose used to reduce the risk of fracture in women with post-menopausal osteoporosis or in men receiving hormone ablation therapy for prostate cancer.</p>
          <p>We continue to make progress in gaining approval of denosumab as Prolia administered in this setting as a 60 milligram subcutaneous injection once every six months. On slide 27, you'll see that in the United States we submitted our complete response document to the FDA in January this year and have had several productive discussions with FDA reviewers since then. I'll remind you that the PDUFA date for our Prolia submission is July 25.</p>
          <p>In the EU, because new data became available including those related to the occurrence of osteonecrosis of the jaw in advanced cancer patients receiving denosumab and in one case in a woman with post-menopausal osteoporosis receiving denosumab in our long-term extension study, we decided to update our statement of product characteristics, which is the European label. The Committee on Human Medicinal Products reviewed this information and issued a revised assessment report on March 18 that was again supportive of the Prolia marketing application in both post-menopausal osteoporosis to reduce the risk of fracture in those at increased risk, and to reduce the risk of fracture in men with prostate cancer receiving hormone ablation therapy who had a high risk of sustaining a fracture event. We still expect approval of Prolia by the European Commission in the second quarter of this year. Reviews in other jurisdictions are ongoing with advanced discussions being held in Australia, Switzerland and Canada.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide 28. The first quarter has been an especially busy one for our regulatory affairs group. We worked closely with the FDA to compete the risk evaluation and minimization strategy or REMS for erythropoietic-stimulating agents. Already in just the first month enrollment by prescribers and hospitals in the APPRISE program, a key component of our REMS, has been very brisk.</p>
          <p>We also made substantial progress in other areas. Our marketing application for the use of Vectibix in the first and second line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in patients whose tumors contain wild-type KRAS genes was submitted to the European Medicines Agency, and will be submitted in the United States sometime later in the year.</p>
          <p>Also, we supported our partner, Takeda Limited in the submission of the Vectibix file in Japan. Last week, Vectibix was approved by Japanese regulators for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer with wild-type KRAS genes in all lines of therapy.</p>
          <p>Many of you will have seen our recent presentation at AACR in the use of next-generation DNA sequencing to identify patients most likely to benefit from Vectibix therapy. On slide 29, I note that our targeted approach to cancer therapy, which benefits from advances in the understanding of mechanisms underlying the progression of malignancy, will be very much on display at the meeting of the American Society for Clinical Oncology at the beginning of June.</p>
          <p>We expect to have the opportunity to discuss in much more detail the recent results obtained using denosumab to delay skeletal related events in patients with bony metastases. And we will also provide information on our therapeutics pipeline including Motesanib, AMG 386 and AMG 479 among others. Indeed, because of the strength of our programs and to place the information presented at ASCO in an appropriate context, we have decided to hold an investor event on June 7.</p>
          <p>Finally, on slide 30, I note that the acquisition of important clinical data will continue at a rapid pace throughout the rest of the year. We've already shown that denosumab delays the progression of bony pathology in men with prostate cancer and metastatic bone disease. In the second half of the year, we will review data from a study testing whether denosumab can delay the appearance of bone metastases in prostate cancer patients with less advanced disease.</p>
          <p>We will also have the opportunity to review Phase III data for Vectibix in the treatment of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, Phase II data from a number of new-targeted cancer therapies and Phase II data from our IL-17 receptor antagonist, AMG 827 in the treatment of psoriasis. For those who wish to see a preview of the latter, we will be presenting Phase I data for AMG 827 in psoriasis patients at the American Society for Investigative Dermatology meeting in May.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey guys. Question for you on Prolia launch costs. Aside from active promotion, what investments are really left to make for this year, either personnel or manufacturing, things like that on a global basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No real, other than variable costs with launching the product, none really.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So that's all baked into the numbers for the first quarter and for second half of last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask two things. One, we've been getting lots of questions, as for the recent CMS panel which looked pretty benign, it wasn't clear whether CMS is going to do a national coverage termination for EPO or not. So what was your sense there? And then secondly, just how do you look at Hematide from Affymax as a potential competitor in the market, and what can you do to make sure, maybe pricing wise you can lock them out? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, with regard to Hematide, we'd like to see the Phase III data before we basically react to it. So we'll see that hopefully in the next few months. And we never really, Yaron, discuss our pricing strategies, but we have great relationships with most of our customers and hopefully that's meaningful. We also think we have some fantastic products with great safety and efficacy track records for the most part.</p>
          <p>So your first question relates to the CMS, and it was very clear I think leaving the meeting that the CMS was not intending to do anything right away and they haven't. Having said that, they are not exactly going to share with us when they do plan to do something necessarily. So I think it's not clear whether or not they will do something this year, but we remain ready. And I thought that was a pretty good discussion particularly some of the other patients who actually had a chance to speak at the MEDCAC meeting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thank you.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Eric Schmidt with Cowen &amp; Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Question on expenses for 2010, probably for Bob. It sounds like to achieve the revenue guidance for the full year; you have to see quite a bit of increase from the Q1 levels in the subsequent quarters. But to get to the lower end of the EPS guidance, you have to see a very dramatic increase in expenses. So I guess I'm just wondering if you could provide some expense guidance or margin guidance for us. It just seems like the spending's going to escalate at quite a rapid rate here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't we answer that in two parts. George can talk about the sequential revenue pattern and I can talk about the operating stuff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the sequential revenue pattern, just look at our bar chart that we have in, up for the various products. You can't see &#x2013; well I guess you can see Europe in the aggregate. But first quarter tends to be our lowest quarter and then it tends to ramp up. So, I think you can use those percentages roughly in previous years and that's probably a pretty good proxy for going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And with respect to operating expenses Eric, the guidance I was trying to provide is that again if you look at our historical patterns, our first quarter has typically been our lightest quarter. Our expenses typically ramp in the second, third and fourth quarter and that reflects the nature of our business and the conferences and so forth that we participate in in the second half of the year. And with respect to 2010, as I noted in my remarks, we're expecting mid single digit growth this year versus last year and that accommodates our plans for launching Prolia globally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, just a follow-up then on the tax rate. You didn't have the R&amp;D tax credit going for you in Q1, yet you are already at the low end of your guidance there. Are there other issues that are going to lead to an increase in taxes beyond Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think as I said in my remarks, we expect the range is consistent with what I said in January and in January, we expected as well that we would have the retroactive or that we would have the R&amp;D tax credit this year. So we're still hopeful that we'll have it, and we think when we do, it will be retroactive for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Say, it's Kevin, if I can just ask so everybody gets a chance to answer or ask questions, if you'd hold your question to one, then if you got others, you can get in queue and ask that later just to help us get to more folks. So next question please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question is from Steven Harr with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, one of the things, I know you tried to give as much granularity as you could, and we appreciate that around healthcare reform. But one of the things I think all of us are struggling with is that gray or black box of 2011 and beyond, and how that will impact your business. Are there any back of the envelope rough pencil scratches that you could give us as to what the impact of healthcare reform will be in your business beyond this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I want to let George give you some detail, but Steve, let me share a little bit philosophically here. Healthcare reform at an economic sense is going to come at us in more or less two ways. One way is a fee, I look at that as just a tax. And as an operator, I don't see cutting costs because we got a new tax. If you look at all the other things that George is going to tell you about in a minute, I think it's appropriate that we do take some steps to mitigate some of it. I'm not promising that we will mitigate it all. But I think it's something as responsible stewards of shareholder money, we've got to take into account. And so we'll make plans to do that. It will probably become a little bit more clear later. But what we're going to talk to the board about is a five-year plan that we think has attractive performance dimensions in it. And George you might answer some more details on kind of what's hitting us on the revenue line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So Steve first of all, you should recognize we are still working out the specific numbers. And that's why we're not going to give more specific guidance on products, but here is the way to think about it. You cannot calculate this bottoms up. You just don't have all the information, and so that's not even worthwhile doing I would say. Having said that, maybe to frame it for you, the accrual in the first quarter was about 1.2% of domestic sales. It will be 2%, roughly 2% for the entire year.</p>
          <p>So ramps up a little bit as some of these things kick in. And then for next year, the industry looks like it's going to be in the 5 to 6% range, and I think we're going to be roughly in that range as well. That's the best we can do at this point, and as we get more specific information and describe that to products, we'll be in a better position to help you. But I'd stay at the macro level. I don't think you can go down into the weeds on this one and get anything that's particularly accurate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>George, is that 5 to 6% ex of the tax, or is that inclusive of the fees?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's inclusive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And with that, our next question comes from Geoff Porges with Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. And just to sort of follow-up on that question a little bit. Kevin, have you seen any pricing pressure in Europe, and do you anticipate additional pricing pressure in Europe over the next 18 months or so? And related to this whole thing, I mean how does this all affect the bets you make in R&amp;D and for that matter in M&amp;A? I mean, would you have done Prolia PMO studies in the current environment for example?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me, Geoff, I think I hear the sense of your question. Let me try to answer the sense of it which is, how dramatic do I feel that this new dynamic in our environment is. Short answer is, it's meaningful, but it's not dramatic. We would still see the same basic investment profiles, the same opportunities. Yes, we certainly would have done the Prolia work, and I don't see this as having a day turn to night in the industry. And when I look out five years at an EPS level, I'm quite optimistic we'll perform well, and that integrates in everything we know now. So I appreciate the interest in trying to get as granular as possible. The customers you work with and other investors want to know that. But I'd tell you we can handle this and it will play out over time.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Geoff what we're seeing is, places like Turkey, Greece there had been some rebates to the government. Germany's talking about it. These are things that we deal with almost every year and usually factor it into our planning and certainly our guidance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Question on Aranesp, you cited a low double digit unit decline segment share loss. Can you sort of walk through what was going on there? Is that oncology, pre-dialysis or is that something specific in a country, sort of talk through that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so that was really in the U.S. and first of all we only lost about a share point year-on-year. So I think it's just a general more conservative use in both oncology and nephrology with regard to ESAs given everything that's happened around them.</p>

          <p>Thanks a lot. I really appreciate all the detail on the healthcare reform and I understand you can't give us any or much detail on product-by-product. But can you at least tell us maybe which of the products are more or less exposed to the Medicaid rebates?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I ask a different question then? Can I ask about your cash position and what cash you're using to repurchase shares so aggressively? I guess, have you started to repatriate ex-US cash or at some point do you consider doing that to continue the share repurchase program?</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a question on healthcare reform again. I think you spoke to potential offsets to the impact of the healthcare reform. And I guess I'm looking for an answer to that that's not specific to maybe being more judicious in your spending. But what other offsets are there to the potential rebates as well as the excise fees that we're looking at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the way to think about it is, the fee, we conceptualize as a tax, and don't imagine that there is something we're going to do operationally about that. All the other costs, we've got a very large expense base, it grows a bit each year. And within all of that, there are various opportunities to make choices, and we'll be smart about that. And over time, we'll make those details known.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Are there any comments you can make on the Prolia review, I guess with respect to REMS, whether that's been ironed out, and when we think about labeling if this is something that we should just expect it to be labeled as a second line indication? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rachel, the discussions with the agency are all along the lines of simply getting the appropriate labeling that would provide a basis for prescribing Prolia to women at increased risk of fracture. There is no specific definition of lines of therapy in post-menopausal osteoporosis. And this is an agent that as you know, based on studies in thousands of women has a very, very good profile. So we don't anticipate that there will be per pound restrictions on use of Prolia. It's very effective, it's the most potent antiresorptive agent ever introduced. It reduces fracture and it has a very favorable benefit risk profile.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, not to argue with you, but I guess the comment at the panel meeting of wanting to roll this out slowly, one can interpret that to mean that you need to fail prior lines of therapy before going on this drug, so you just.</p>

          <p>Why don't we wait until the label comes out, and then we can have the conversation. That panel happened quite a while ago. We are optimistic. And I think it's just best to just wait till the label comes out, then we're happy to discuss its implications.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. On Vectibix, can you talk about how your competitive edge might be different in Europe than in the U.S.?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I guess there are different competitors, or different competitors have different success rates over there. I think Avastin's not as well entrenched in colorectal cancer and that probably provides a bigger opportunity for us down the road. But we're still penetrating basically the more severe end of metastatic colorectal cancer and I think the team over there is doing a terrific job with that.</p>

          <p>Understood. Our final question comes from Aaron Reames with Wells Fargo Securities.</p>

          <p>Thanks for taking my question. I just had a question on the pipeline. I was wondering if AMG 386 would move into Phase III trials this year. And if so, is there one particular lead indication that we should be focused on out of the data set that will be emerging at ASCO?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, for AMG 386, as we've said the ovarian cancer indication is the one where we focused most intensively, and you'll have a chance to see some of the data at ASCO on 386, and that and other settings and to hear more about our plans in terms of how we're going to invest &#x2013; advance that program at the registration labeling trials at the ASCO meeting.</p>
