          <p>Good morning or good afternoon. I am Moira, the Chorus call operator for this conference. Welcome to the Zurich Financial Services Half Year Results Reporting 2011 Analyst and Media Presentation. Please note that for the duration of the call, all participants will be in listen-only mode, and the conference is being recorded. After the introduction, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> This call must not be recorded for publication or broadcast.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mrs. Debra Broek, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, madam.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and welcome everyone. Thank you for joining us. I am here today with Martin Senn, our CEO; and also Dieter Wemmer, our CFO. And so I would just like to now turn it over for some opening remarks from Martin and then we will turn to Q&amp;A. Martin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Debra and good morning, good afternoon everybody. Welcome to this call. Before opening up to your questions, let me just give you some additional comments to the business developments. Over the past months, we have continued to successfully execute in our strategy. I think we have progressed very well in our diversification into higher growth markets.</p>
          <p>We have maintained our strict focus on margins, on pricing, and portfolio management. And the outcome of all these actions and the outcome of this focus are probably today's strong numbers which have been delivered in a very challenging period.</p>
          <p>We believe that there is a good step forward but let me be very clear, me and my colleagues also believe that there is more to do. I am very pleased with our strong second quarter results. They were driven by an excellent underwriting performance, by improved top-line growth across our three business segments, and by continuing progress in implementing our strategic initiatives.</p>
          <p>Our businesses still continue to generate strong cash flows and our capital base and solvency position remain strong. We've been anticipating that the environment &#x2013; I think you've heard me saying that already a year-and-half or two years ago, that this environment in which we operate would remain challenging, that the economic growth in many of our core markets would remain below potential and that volatility in the financial markets would remain high if not going higher and that obviously, as well, low yields, as we them now and continue to see them, are affecting investment income.</p>
          <p>Now unfortunately this is proving to be correct and while we navigate these challenges, we continue to look ahead to be optimistic with how Zurich is positioned and with that we will stick to our targets, we remain focused on the successful delivery of our strategy.</p>
          <p>And with this introduction, I would like to now open the floor for any questions and Dieter Wemmer and myself are very happy to take your questions. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Mr. Spencer Horgan from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, thank you very much. Can I go maybe straight to the probably embarrassingly predictable question, which is around the dividend in the context of the strength of the Swiss franc? I think in previous quarters, you've tried to get a fairly strong message in terms of the dividend, but obviously the Swiss franc is moving at quite a remarkable pace. So I understand the normal caveats about it being a Board decision and a year-end decision, and so on and so forth; but could you maybe at least give us your thoughts on that one?</p>
          <p>And then the second one is, you've obviously pointed to the improvement in the combined ratio, and the improvement in the accident year loss ratio before natural catastrophes is quite significant, year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter; I think it's 63% in the second quarter. Is that a sensible base for us to be thinking about from here, or are there any particular special effects in the second quarter, accident year loss ratio? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Spencer. This is Martin speaking before. Dieter is responding to your second question, let me give you our views on the dividend consideration.</p>
          <p>First of all, in the past, we have never given any guidance with regard to dividend throughout the year and we will not do that today either. Now with regards to the policy itself, you have seen in the comments this morning that the policy remains unchanged, our dividend policy is to pay a sustainable competitive dividend, but I should stress that as we always set the dividend in January and February the following year, we take into consideration, not only the results of the prior year, i.e., in the coming January of this year, but we would also look at facts such as solvency position, our medium term earnings outlook, our cash generation power, future growth expectations, and obviously as well the macroeconomic factors in setting this dividend, and as well &#x2013; also we have done that in the past, we will do that in the following year and that is then going to drive the proposal we put up to the Board of Directors and to the &#x2013; to our investors at the Annual Shareholder Meeting.</p>
          <p>The movements, now let me just make more of a macroeconomic comment with regards to the currency developments we have seen. What we have seen in the past month with regards to the strengthening of the Swiss franc in our view, and by all means in any economic consideration is not sustainable. We have now a situation where the Swiss franc is overvalued depending on the currency pair anything between 20 and 40, maybe even more percentage points which will lead if not correct it to a situation where the Swiss economy will substantially slow down. The respective currency flows will adjust to these economic changes, which will as well bring the currency then back to a more of an equilibrium position, i.e., to fair value.</p>
          <p>Now the challenge of such a movement is clearly the timing about it, because as we all know, a currency can undershoot from a fair value consideration and purchasing power parity for three, four, five years at the most and this obviously can also be the case with the Swiss franc, it can still stiffen further. Having said that, the Swiss National Bank has made a clear point now that from here on they would not anymore accept any sort of acceleration of the trend but rather see the reverse.</p>
          <p>I do make this comment just to make as well a point that we are not making strategic decisions on currency consideration only and dividend is a part of it, but we look at all factors such as that I have mentioned before. With regards to the results in the first six months, we are very pleased to see that our cash generation power is more or less equal to the last year, and with that we feel comfortable in the outlook once we get to the point on the dividend discussion as well.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Spencer, good afternoon. So your second question regarding the underlying loss ratio, it was 63% in the second quarter. There is some seasonality in the underlying loss ratio, because although we are trying to show the big volatilities under catastrophes and large losses, there is still some smaller seasonality left in the underlying loss ratio, but on the other hand certainly the re-underwriting actions continue throughout the next quarter and also has achieved rate increases of the last quarter <mark type="ph" /> have not yet earned in (9:04).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, I just wanted to clarify, Dieter, your comments you made on the video on cash flow; and Martin, I think you mentioned it as well. You are basically saying as far as you are concerned the cash flow in dollars is more or less equal year on year, in terms of where you expect to be by the end of the year. And I'm trying to understand, I think the implication from the commentary, Dieter, was that you convert the cash flow from subsidiaries over the year into the currencies you need it for. And I'm guessing &#x2013; I am just trying to understand the timing of that. Does that happen equally through the year? Are you trying to steer, therefore, that we should think about the average Swiss franc rate, not the spot Swiss franc rate as the kind of &#x2013; the chief consideration in terms of converting cash from some subsidiaries up to Swiss francs at the center?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on SST, I know you can't give us a number as of today, can you give us any feel for sort of sensitivities in terms of what's happened with the market moves in the last week. Within that, I'm particularly interested in the Life EV, where the sensitivity to a fall of 100 basis points in interest rates now appears to be positive. Is that actually the case and at what point does it become negative again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Andrew, that is a very difficult technical question. Let me start first with the cash flow. As this cash flow picture is made up of mainly dividend payments from subsidiaries, so we don't have a daily cash flow there, <mark type="ph" /> in the end (10:55) a number of bigger cash flows, therefore it's not truly equally spread over the year. But at half year, we are pretty much on six months and in general we are on track with our own rolling 12-months forecast which we are always doing. So we are converting it when we receive it, so it's probably fair to say if you use average exchange rate that is the best proxy I can give to you.</p>
          <p>I have given in the video a short summary of what we received, so the first half year was 50% dollar, 30% euro, 10% pounds and 5% Swiss francs and then a couple of other small currencies. So on the Swiss Solvency Test, it's hard to do this stochastic modeling on the back of an envelope, I think I had this debate with <mark type="ph" /> Ryan (12:05) some quarters ago on this call. I would &#x2013; best guess I can do is that it went a little bit down over the last two weeks because euro swap curves came down in particular at the long end. Some downwards movement on the dollar curve actually probably has improved EV, because our dollar EV has reversed currency &#x2013; interest rate exposure, sorry. And our hedges, we have put in place for the EURO STOXX 50, have certainly helped to limit the loss in solvency ratios. So that are &#x2013; so on balance I guess a small movement down but it's really a very detailed calculation, and who knows where all these numbers are on September 30 when we do the next proper calculation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, and on the Life EV, the sensitivity has changed from &#x2013; at the end of the year a fall of 100 basis points was negative, now it seems to be positive. What &#x2013; I'm guessing, it's positive up to a point but...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that is true. It is a very complex scenario. It's not linear. As I said, the U.S. portfolio had always this positive sensitivity. The one with the big negative sensitivity was the German EV mainly and we have done quite some action to de-risking this situation on one hand buying swaps and on the other hand getting into a much deeper understanding of the exact nature of the liabilities when tail events would really happen in practice. So, we feel much more comfortable with our risk position in our German Life portfolio.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Farooq Hanif from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just want to focus back on the underlying combined ratio and the rating environment. Going back to what you said about the seasonality, could you give us a little bit more direction on how much the improvement was, just lower frequency, lower experience, how much was mix, because you've had lots of high growth in some of the international markets and improving growth in Europe? And how much of it is your pricing actions? So if you could give a little bit more guide to that, because when you look historically it's kind of hard to see that seasonality in the underlying ratio. That's question number one.</p>
          <p>And question number two is the fact that you're actually now seeing decent growth in your European business, and putting in very good personal lines rate increases, is that basically a reflection of the competitive environment now getting much better in some of your core markets? And could you comment on that as well please? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks &#x2013; thanks so much Farooq, and let me start with the second question first. I think in particular in the German market, all pricing actions led to exactly higher premium volume which means that the customer that has no option to go somewhere else to renew at a cheaper price, that gives an indication that the whole market has shown some hardening and in particular I think we saw the growth through our direct channel in Germany and our distribution joint venture with Automobil-Club. So these are certainly positive contributors in this picture in Germany and therefore the combined ratio also improved nicely.</p>
          <p>On the general question of the underlying loss ratio, well, the mix change, the pricing actions, that is all summarized under our underwriting actions. I think Mario has shown to all of you the three by three matrix, how we tackle each of the sub-portfolios and how we cluster the existing customers into A, B, C and how we do specific actions on the clusters.</p>
          <p>I think it is very hard to say how is the individual effects are building up, that would be an analysis for each of the sub-portfolios. We have not aggregated this action under these factors because our focus is to move the sub-portfolios from the red box to the green box and then really to say how it is on average weighted, who created what, that is not at the moment our focus. The focus is to deliver an improved underwriting result.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess &#x2013; I mean the reason for asking the question is that you emphasized seasonality, a bit of seasonality in the number and I just wondered how &#x2013; what impact that in fact was because if it was a little bit then actually it means for the rest of the year actually the numbers could be pretty good?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, I think the seasonality I only mentioned because it is always the best to compare the same quarters against each other. So, it is hard to compare the third quarter against the first quarter, because one is winter, one is summer at least in the Northern Hemisphere. And therefore I think you can compare Q2 with Q2 and that was more why I mentioned seasonality.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Andy Broadfield from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Two questions. The first, a little bit more around the group cash flow, because I was just wondering how the internal reinsurance programs worked. And the timing from those contracts, I think the significant one with the U.S. and I think you also have a reasonable sized one with the Irish entity on the P&amp;C side. So just a little bit about understanding that cash flow, whether that helps or hinders or influences the overall Swiss franc, dollar, euro debate at all?</p>
          <p>Second question, just on the Life Reinsurance, we heard that one or two of the reinsurers have said that, especially in the U.K., Life Reinsurance has been pretty &#x2013; pricing has been coming under quite a lot of pressure and there's a number of primary guys reinsuring an awful lot of their mortality books. So I was wondering where you were seeing that given that I think 50% of your portfolio is now protection, which I guess a chunk of that would be mortality, or most of it if not all of it, just whether you're seeing anything there and how that's developing for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Andy, first of all our cash flows, when we talk about cash flow for dividend, are completely de-linked from the reinsurance programs in the sense the insurance and reinsurance premiums are paid to us in a legal entity who is writing business. And the cash flow I'm talking about is the dividend sent from this legal entity's subsidiary to the center and is therefore really on a corporate level and not anymore in the insurance business as such. Therefore, I &#x2013; at the moment I don't see any link between our reinsurance program and our central cash pools.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just on that Dieter then, so there's been no &#x2013; the cash streamed from, for example, the U.S. into the Zurich entity, would that remain in dollars during that period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If it's a reinsurance coming from there which goes to Zurich Insurance Company, the liabilities are being &#x2013; of course, being invested in dollar investments and  <mark type="ph" /> they're (21:08) matching this reinsurance liabilities and that I consider still as insurance business. What we measure in the cash flows is really &#x2013; really run by the Treasury department, that means we talk about dividends, inter-company loans, external loans, whatsoever, disposals, acquisitions, that is what &#x2013; how we manage the free cash flow of the group. It has nothing to do with the operational cash flows, the operational cash flows are much bigger numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, very clear. Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And now the U.K. Life Reinsurance question, we are not reinsuring mortality. Yes, I have heard in the market that there is some discussion that some of the reinsurance offers are offering such low mortality assumptions that they go below your own best estimates then you could consider whether you want to arbitrage your own assumption setting, but we have not taken any decision like this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so is that as always was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Michael Huttner from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. And I had a couple of questions. The first one is why are you leaving? I ask myself the question, because I'm roughly the same age as you, not &#x2013; a bit younger but not much, and I was thinking big salary, nice company, lot of &#x2013; obviously, well liked. So I couldn't quite get it. And then we thought, well, which &#x2013; what company is missing a CEO where I would like to go to, I couldn't think of a single one. And the reason I think it's relevant is the timing is so odd. Resigning just before the end of June kind of implies that you're not party to the dividend decision, which is kind of &#x2013; and you might say, well, that's very selfish, but there you are.</p>
          <p>And the second is at what stage in the Spanish business would you have to look to a goodwill impairment? I see volumes are down quite a bit. And then the last if maybe you could just touch on the Deutsche Bank deal, was there any special payment or change in conditions? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you very much, Michael. So, to your question, why I am leaving and the dividend decision, I can only tell you I am still a shareholder and I have moved the stock to my personal income fund. So, I'm counting that they continue with this. So, it's always a question what you expect from Life and what are you going to do. I have 25 years completed with Zurich this month and somehow I felt that is a good decision to look at the world from the eyes and the angle of another corporation. So, it has really nothing to do with Zurich directly. I just &#x2013; I'm still curious and young enough, as you said Michael, to really be a bit more adventurous. And, talking about our Spanish business, actually the goodwill is certainly a point we have always to look at. We have our standard processes to validate the quality of the goodwill numbers, and the goodwill is not driven by the volume of business we write; the goodwill is driven and justified by the cash flows or future earnings and I think that is best expressed in the new business value, and when you look how the new business value for our Spanish business has developed, it is actually holding up quite nicely. Therefore, our efforts to move more to higher-margin risk business to keep the generation of new business value in line with original business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Roger Bank deal is &#x2013; yeah, well, I think that is &#x2013; we announced already the extension of the MOU actually much earlier this year. So, we completed the documentation with unfinished terms compared to the MOU. We are not disclosing the financial details because it isn't commercial agreement around commission schedules and this is commercially sensitive and therefore we would not like to announce this to our competitors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe if I quickly can step in; good afternoon, Michael. Following up from your question regarding Dieter's departure and your question being party to the dividend decision, I assume that I am going to be party to the dividend decision unless I become also more adventurous in the course of the next six months, which I don't think will be the case. The point I want to make really is to all of you that the financial discipline and the operational excellence Zurich has excelled on all the many years in the past is not subject to one single colleague or to one single executive in the company. This is very much the Zurich way. This is very much embedded in our way we are thinking and how we are acting; it is in our genes. I just wanted to give you that comfort that while we all will miss Dieter terribly, it is not going to change the way we are looking at things. It's not going to change the way our discipline is being executed. I am not planning to have now a dedication for Dieter, as Dieter is with us throughout the rest of the year and supporting as well very effective and proper handover to his successor, but I want to say thank you to Dieter for their great cooperation we had so far and we continue to have that until he takes up a new challenge wherever that is.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have two questions please. The first one, during the recorded presentation, you went over the changes you made to your reinsurance program, and you concluded by saying that you eventually will be seeing a bit more volatility to earnings. I don't think there is a tremendous change but have you quantified the additional volatility. Could you provide some more color on your comment please? And, the second question has to do with Farmers, so in orders that the surplus issue is now down to 38% and the exchange that's still within your range of 30% to 40% which is in target, can you better help us understand this target and how should we read it and when this make sense to get a bit more concern about the need to and the exchanges surplus base? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon, Jean-Francois. The reinsurance program volatility was referring to the fact that we have taken up, in particular on the international, program a little bit more net retention and we have also changed some of the top cover, so from an expected value perspective, we actually see a small improvement coming out of all the program changes, however, with field events that would create a bit more volatility, but none of these changes are dramatic numbers. So, probably they are below the sensitivity of your specific spreadsheets around it. I think the Farmers' surplus ratio, 38% is still at the upper end of our range from 32% to 40%. Therefore, I mentioned this target range exactly to take away concerns about the surplus ratio. And, we are also expecting that the company continues to build surplus. I think I have to remind maybe everybody that the second quarter 2011 with the hailstorms and tornadoes in the U.S. was the worst quarter since the Northridge earthquake that was substantially worse than a Katrina or other big hurricanes you all remember.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have two questions. The first one is on the reserve releases. Maybe you could give us a bit more color on this happening. You mentioned that in Switzerland motor book there was something &#x2013; there was a U.S. liability, maybe &#x2013; can you give us some more detail in terms of claims frequency or claims inflation where basically the releases happened. And, the second question just a small one on Farmers Re, I reckon that the business operating profit was only a small $4 million in Q2, compared to maybe a $40 million last year and I think here basically your tornadoes had no impact. Maybe just explain why that result was rather modest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so good afternoon, Stefan. Well, the reserve releases in the second quarter were very much in line with &#x2013; for the half year of 2010 anyway, but also I think they were pretty stable compared to the first quarter. We have only mentioned the two biggest contributors as single numbers, but it is actually quite a long list of pluses and minuses as every quarter. So the two big plus numbers was the Swiss motor book and some lines of the U.S. liability business. Workers comp was pretty neutral in the second quarter, and maybe I can refer here also to all the actions we did this last year where some of you were a bit surprised that we took reserve strengthening for our workers comp business because we saw stronger claims inflation there. I think we were ahead of the curve with the industry, leading to some of our peers' announcement in the second quarter. you could see that other people have now recognized the same and our 9% rate increase in worker's comp is also a good evidence that more people than just us are recognizing the claim inflation in worker's comp, and therefore, I am quite pleased that the two things, reserve management and pricing recognition works very much hand-in-hand, and I think that is really a good development. Therefore, we feel actually &#x2013; put the growth about our reserve levels in general. So now, Famers Re, well that a very simple story. We had 95 million hits from the &#x2013; our 12% share in the tornado and hailstorms. So, the normal profit of Farmers Re, if you look at Q1, was roughly $50 million. So, 90 million hits you would assume a minus 40 result, but we got a little bit more than 40 million prior year reserve releases and so the reserve releases throughout in absolute terms is strong because they came out of the 35% quota share we had a year ago and now they are hitting the accidental losses of 12% quota share and that was also been in the 4 million net number for the quarter.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Good afternoon. So, we have been trying to watch and observe on the underlying combined ratio which we've finally seen an important so that's great news and I understand it's because of the pricing actions and a lot of re-underwriting. What I would like to hear from you is your tone was much more positive on the volumes and on the retention side in the second quarter versus first quarter. So, it does &#x2013; yes, when you increase prices, people will tend to try to look elsewhere, but if they can't, they stick with you. But, is that what is happening or is there something else or is a just those captive corporate deals in global corporate. So, retentions in P&amp;C is the first question and basically &#x2013; yeah, that's really it. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Vinit, good afternoon. Yes, the tone was small positive because we're at Farmers now flat at the half year, where we had minus 2% in the first quarter. We are flat at our general insurance business where we had a small reduction in the first quarter and also our APE is in the &#x2013; more in the positive for the half year than it was for the first quarter. So, therefore, I think it's really important to highlight that also, in volume terms, all three segments are showing a better picture.</p>
          <p>And then, I commented on rate change monitor slide in the video on all the specific retention movements and the subsections which I don't want to repeat here, But it is true, in general, across the board retention is slightly up, but also new business. A driver in global comp was indeed, that we have written some more captive business. Therefore, when you would neutralize for the captive business our Global Corporate business is not 5% up, it is only a little bit up in total volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just following up, you also mentioned the 9% increase in workers' comp in 2Q, and even when I read the review I see that you're still saying that loss claims are pretty bad in workers' comp. Is the 9% just offsetting that or is it a real rate increase you're achieving there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, 9% is certainly an improvement because we are booking the loss ratio based on, so to speak, on the old rate level so whatever you get an additional rate will improve your loss ratio going forward. So still I think that the loss ratios in workers' comp are not yet &#x2013; they are moving in the right direction, but they are not yet there and there will be more fight for where it's needed going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, good afternoon. I have one question relating to your stake in New China Life. You released the press release some time ago saying that your 20% stake in that company has been revalued to $1 billion, which would, therefore, imply a valuation which is not in line with what we've recently been hearing in the press, talking about a potential IPO more along the lines of $3 billion to perhaps $3.5 billion. So my question really relates to this: do you believe that your stake in &#x2013; your remaining stake of 15% in New China Life is now potentially overvalued and at what point may you choose to write this down?</p>
          <p>And the second question is would you just be able to give us some of color, some of your interpretation on &#x2013; of how you see the pricing, the rate development in North American P&amp;C? So not in the short-term, which we've seen in the presentation, more your reading of where the rating environment is going to go medium-term. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good afternoon, Ralph. Well, we just sold five percentage points of our 20% stake in New China Life. It crystallized a realized gain of $441 million, which is slightly more than the book value we have in &#x2013; for the business in our book that shows you that our valuation is careful and really satisfying fair value calculation. I'm reading the same newspapers as you are doing and therefore I don't think that I need to comment on newspaper articles because that is not our business to do this. If the company decides something to do in China then they should do this. So on &#x2013; but we are not concerned &#x2013; I am not concerned about the valuation of our stake in our book to put this very clearly.</p>
          <p>The pricing outlook in the U.S., well I think we have seen that it starts to move in the right direction if I &#x2013; I can only look at the recent history, but we had for North America Commercial business, 1% plus in the fourth quarter, 2% in the first quarter 2011, now we are at 3% to 4% in the second quarter 2011. So directionally I think it is feeling good. Will it continue like this? I think it &#x2013; I hope the industry keeps its discipline here and that we can continue also this. We will, certainly, be keeping our discipline on the pricing but how the pricing will look like next year and two years, I think I don't know more than you know.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Ben Cohen from Collins Stewart. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to ask just a general question in terms of your outlook. As we see equity markets and bond markets starting to reflect maybe slower growth in the U.S. and in Europe, I was just wondering if you could talk through how you see your different divisions. Where you see maybe some vulnerabilities both in terms of volume and margin and also where do you think the resilience would come from in your portfolio? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is a very good question, Ben. And I think actually when we start with the U.S. topic we have now touched on several times, I think we are living the Commercial business as well as Farmers in a pretty poor economic environment since 2007 and I think we are fully adjusted to work and live in this environment. So I wouldn't actually see any bigger changes coming even if the growth outlook is a little bit reduced further at the moment. I think in the end we have not seen a huge recovery in the last three years on construction business, nor on the automotive business, which is selling cars nor did we see a lot of increases in employment over the three years. So therefore I think it is &#x2013; we got pretty much used to it.</p>
          <p>Europe, I think you all recognize that our business operating profit for European General Insurance is up 60%, mainly driven by underwriting and pricing action and this also &#x2013; and we're making good profits in markets where the economy is already in a difficult situation so therefore I am not expecting big movements. I think it's also here the advantage that in the end general insurance is a very defensive industry and not swinging too fast up and down with the economic environment.</p>
          <p>So now let's come to the Life business. I think our Life business is becoming more and more resilient as we are dealing at the moment already with the downturn in markets like Ireland and Spain and have replaced it by really great growth in more emerging markets. I think that our Life new business value is already 26% coming from Latin America and, mainly, Middle East Asia. It's already a dividend for the resilient development. Plus, I think we have developed the Corporate Life &amp; Pension business as really a great niche, which is matching the general capabilities of Zurich as an international player and a strong player on the P&amp;C side in this field, so that certainly gets more upside even when the economy is not proving to be this good. And that will be I think supported by the strategic acquisitions being done and I would expect next year a substantially bigger amount of new business value coming from emerging markets.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Most of my questions have been answered, so just one question on the North American Commercial business. Obviously, the pricing environment is improving. You have made some comments in terms of the outlook. What I would be interested in is, you mentioned that you have re-underwritten some of the business, so these underwriting actions have had some impact in terms of the top line, in terms of retention. Can you give us a little bit more details which lines of business, you mentioned the specialty markets, and when you think this is going to be finished?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. I think that the re-underwriting actions will continue still for a number of quarters, so at least for one program, you need to do 12 months to hit all renewals at least once. But, certainly, during this re-underwriting programs we have new ideas we learn new things so there will be enough stuff to do also in year two and thereafter.</p>
          <p>I think we have exited some unprofitable books in the specialty area, which were also small for us and therefore we really want to focus on more relevant portfolios and also in Commercial market, it's not always a question of unprofitability from an underwriting perspective, also where your sales are inefficient, because the portfolio, as such is too small and that is part of the re-underwriting. On the other hand we move also to selective growth in mid market Commercial and energy casualty business, which adds very well to our global energy business and where we have not enough exposure on the casualty side that would also balance a bit our property exposure sale.</p>
          <p>So that is the best I can explain it, otherwise I think you should pay a visit to our U.S. organization and they could show you how our pricing and portfolio management tool works that is much easier to see it in action than going for a long list of theoretical explanation.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everyone. I haven't asked many questions in the past, so I'm going to use my carry forward questions and I'll ask four, if possible. Now, how much of the $4.4 billion, assuming it's the cash flow the same as last year, has actually been received by the half year?</p>
          <p>Secondly, in terms of the dividend, you mentioned a competitive dividend. Now you're yielding 11% versus about 7% for the sector. If that's the situation at the year end, does that become a factor in actually determining its competitive dividend? So would you actually take that into account?</p>
          <p>Thirdly, on potential relocation, does the Swiss franc at these levels, make you think about relocating head office to, let's say, the U.S.?</p>
          <p>And the last question is, like everyone else, we're very sad to see Dieter go, and I'd like to thank him for all the efforts he's made on our part. But, just to say, where are we currently with a current CFO? Are we &#x2013; where are we with hiring a new CFO? And is Dieter getting involved in this hiring process to make sure that another good one is hired? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Rob, and good afternoon to you. With regards to the dividend question, it's very difficult, Robert, to really give you a firm response and a positive as well as satisfactory response, because, again, you will have to go through this evaluation at the end of the year considering all factors that we have then with regard to the macroeconomic situation, our earnings powers, our solvency position; and as well the comparison obviously, where the market altogether stands.</p>
          <p>With regards to the costs of the head office, costs and cost management for us is not a project, but this is an operational principle. With the $500 million efficiency program we have announced at the last Investors' Day, obviously, currency movements are all in the considerations, but it should not be the only driver.</p>
          <p>At this point, there is no plan to move the head office to the U.S. To be very specific and concrete, I would doubt that we execute such a consideration. But if we have a situation where we're looking at the opportunities because of currency alignment, to move operations and this critical mass from one, say, currency regime to another, and we believe that this is sustainable and practical, we would definitely consider any such move. And that has been done in the past and we will continue to do so if there's a merit.</p>
          <p>On the basis of today's currency alignment, i.e., the Swiss franc's strengths standalone that is somewhat risky, because, as mentioned, the current overvaluation of the Swiss franc, we do not consider sustainable and over time there will be, I think more of a normalization and move back to the mean.</p>
          <p>Your last question with regards to the succession process for Dieter, yes Dieter is involved clearly. He will remain involved and we will do everything possible to not only get as good as a CFO &#x2013; well, it's tough to now say to get a better one. Dieter has been, indeed, an outstanding CFO, but we will do everything possible to get one to bring to the same level, if he's not there yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There was another question, the $4.4 billion, how much of that's actually come to the &#x2013; assuming it's the same as last year, how much of that &#x2013; I already asked that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, what &#x2013; we have &#x2013; we are very well on track and I think I am not going to the details because then you automatically double the number and that would be misleading.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, I'm just saying, is it &#x2013; so I'm just trying to use an average rate. So the $4.4 billion, will 50% come now, 50% second half or that sort of thing, just to give me an idea?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, as you also know from the public listed company, the second quarter, it's certainly more of a dividend quarter than the other quarters and that is in the end to normal process in corporate life, you close your books, you declare your annual result, you have your shareholder meeting and you pay your dividends, that is the subsidiaries, in the end not really different than with a big company.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think we have time for one more question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question for today is from Mr. Atanasio Pantarrotas from Cheuvreux. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon to everybody. Just a few questions left from my side. First one is on the ForEx effect on the book value. I am a bit puzzled, because I suppose to see a positive effect on a valuation reserve on currency &#x2013; a valuation reserve in your book value, year-to-date while I noted a negative factor, despite the weakening U.S. dollar compared to the euro, Swiss francs and also versus UK pound.</p>
          <p>Second question is on dividend again, if I may. Do you think that your decision could be just on your economic position or maybe also on payout ratio, because you paid &#x2013; your last year payout ratio was already very high, close to <mark type="ph" /> 8% (54:41)? It could be possible to see a further increase? Or you have a sort of cap for your payout ratio? Just to understand when you will be involved in the dividend decision, how you will deal with this question? And that's all from my side, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe &#x2013; <mark type="ph" /> Bon journo, can answer you (55:05). Maybe I'll take the second question first then Dieter comes back to the first one. In the past, we have made a point that our dividend consideration is not subject to any payout consideration nor to any dividend yield consideration.</p>
          <p>As it stands, that has not changed. But again, it's way too early, Atanasio, to talk about a dividend. We're just about halfway through the year, there is no merit now in trying to finalize this discussion. And we will, obviously, come back then next year on the proposal. And rest assured, we always look at the investor consideration is taken very serious, and that, in any way, we can generate value to the shareholders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Yeah, I think, it's &#x2013; we have only a small cumulative consolidation adjustment, because that is still the impact of many currency movements and that is not a big number in the second quarter actually. And in the first quarter, the story was a bit more complex, because we paid a part of our dividend out of the CTA, because as we redeemed &#x2013; paid in capital, because it was a tax-free dividend as you all remember. In accounting terms, the dividend cost split between the dividend account and the CTA account. And I think on &#x2013; we have on page 23 in our analyst presentation, you can actually see the split effect of this. And, so then maybe I should also to add to Martin's comments, for the half year, our earnings per share is CHF12 more or less unchanged to last year's number, so let's look where we end up at the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much everybody for participating at today's call for our half year 2011 Q&amp;A. And as we said, we are very pleased with our strong second quarter results, which we believe demonstrate the underlying strength of our business. We continue to have a strong capital base, we believe we have a very strong solvency position, and so in today's market environment, this is clearly a very strong asset, as we have truly volatility in the market, which has not been seen by any &#x2013; from us before.</p>
          <p>I can assure you that me and my colleagues will remain focused on what we can control. We will continue to execute on our strategy towards achieving the delivery of the announced targets at our last Investors' Day.</p>
          <p>And with that, we all look forward to see you again, latest, at our nine months results. I hope, there is going to be many interactions with you over the phone or personally before that. And I want to thank you again also in the name of Dieter. We both wish you a great day and good luck in the markets. Thank you very much.</p>
