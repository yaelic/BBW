        <plist>
          <p>Welcome to Sberbank conference. You may now begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Dmitry Zhdanovich and I'm Head of Investor Relations of the company. I am pleased to welcome you to the presentation of Sberbank's Consolidated Financial Statement Results in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards for the second quarter of 2010. The format of the presentation is straightforward. We will first provide an overview of the main highlights of the half-year 2010 financial performance, Sberbank's competitive position and operating environments. This will be followed by Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>The main speaker today is Anton Karamzin, Deputy Chairman of the Board and CFO of the company. But for Q&amp;A session, we will be hosted by Mr. Alexander Morozov, a member of the Board, Vice President and Head of Financial Department. We will provide guidance on conducting the Q&amp;A after the main presentation. The presentation would be accompanied by the PowerPoint slides that were sent to you earlier. Anyone who doesn't have the slide can find them at our website. The presentation will be conducted in English with simultaneous translation into Russian on a separate slide. Please know that the presentation may contain forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>With that, please allow me to pass the microphone to our CFO, Mr. Anton Karamzin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Just a little correction, Mr. Morozov will join us for the Q&amp;A session but I will not be available so he'll be hosting.</p>
          <p>So with that, we present the results to you, as we have said, for the first half of 2010. A very brief highlight, as I'm sure you've had a chance to have a look at the numbers. The net profit for the first half of 2010 has totaled to RUB64.3 billion, which is RUB2.95 per ordinary share. The second quarter has been much closer to the planned average quarterly results as per our earlier outlook for the full year than the first quarter. The first quarter was a bit unnaturally high, as we were discussing when we were giving the results, with the full year outlook remaining pretty much unchanged on the net profits from the management. We are saying that it will be somewhat about RUB100 billion for the full year under Russian Accounting Standards, and IFRS technically shouldn't be very far from that number.</p>
          <p>We have seen continued reduction in net interest margins, as we have been expecting. And our outlook is that the slowdown may continue because of the time lag between the pricing steps taken in the first half of the year will be filtering through to the P&amp;L bottom line with a lag of a quarter or two. So with respect to P&amp;L that we will be reporting in the second/third quarter, it is likely to see somewhat continuing compression of the NIMs but our earlier suggestion that the industry environment is approaching a trough after which it should, more or less, stabilize, although with some volatility, still remains valid.</p>
          <p>The other highlight is that our outlook for corporate loan book growth for the year has somewhat reduced and we were seeing that it's going be just around inflation. If we're lucky, the demand for corporate loans is still weak in the country. The retail level loan book on the other side has been showing very good dynamics, positive growth, part of it was expected. It is as a result of the pricing restructuring that we've done by canceling lending commissions for retail loans back in April. We were discussing this on the previous quarter call results.</p>
          <p>We're happy with this step; it has shown a growth even despite bad weather in July/August. We are still seeing good pace of growth in the retail loan book. And we're looking that the retail loan book should show somewhat close to double-digit growth on the full-year basis. We're very happy with the fee and commission income. It has grown by 24.4% compared to the first half of 2009, contributing to the P&amp;L nicely.</p>
          <p>We continue to control our cost base. We've done some alignment of the pay levels of our employees closer to the market, which has resulted in some indexing up of payrolls, which was done for the first time since early 2008 when we worked on the basis of 2007 results doing the similarity size. It's a bit of a catch up to catch up with the inflation of the preceding two years. However, as we have promised we have kept our cost-to-income ratio well within the limits of best practice. The cost-to-income ratio for the first half is 40.2%. Our full-year plan is still keep within the low-40s as we continue to invest into the strategic initiatives that we set ourselves in our 2H plan.</p>
          <p>Our securities portfolio grew, as obviously we have been experiencing some excessive liquidity like all the players in the market, well, especially in the top segment. And our approach to forming the security portfolio has not changed. We continue to pursue defensive strategy, very liquid and reliable issues and debt securities that are represented in this portfolio. And our capital adequacy remains very strong. We have paid back RUB200 billion of subordinated debt in the second quarter and our total capital adequacy ratio is 17.3 under Basel I. Under Central Bank, it's 18.8. Both are very healthy ratios, which we're pretty happy with so far. I guess, these are the main highlights before we switch to the Q&amp;A session. Again, we would like to host you. Please ask your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Ma'am, we are ready for Q&amp;A, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Alex Kantarovich. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, it's Alex Kantarovich from JPMorgan. Thanks for this opportunity. I have several questions. The first one is on net interest margin progression. You've mentioned that an erosion of net interest margin continuing this quarter. And so can you give us some sense in terms of when we can expect <mark type="inaudible" /> so to speak. You did mention <mark type="inaudible" /> additional interest rate -- you did mention some lag. So shall we assume that Q3 will be the trough for net interest margin.</p>
          <p>And my second question is on <mark type="inaudible" /> outweighing these provisions correlated by the end of this year and definitely in 2011, if we can get some more color on this concern that this will be the case. And my last question is on loan growth estimates in the region around -- for 2011, of what sort of <mark type="inaudible" /> so to speak can you expect looking forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alex. The first question on NIMs could Q3 be a trough or would it be Q4? The <mark type="inaudible" /> is probably somewhere between them, according to the timeline, we experience that our steps our repricing steps on that system liabilities roughly take effect on the P&amp;L, within three to six months, depending upon which terms we change, lending rates, corporate or retail and deposit rates, corporate or retail.</p>
          <p>Now we have changed pretty much all of them in the past month. So the effect is going to be there and it will take a prolonged effect like we will start seeing the effect from the year from &#x2013; already from August and September this quarter and for the following four, five months after September as well. So this is the effect of our pricing steps.</p>
          <p>Now, the second half of the year is also going to be somewhat a &#x2013; probably a joining point in terms of the inflation and rates environment out there in the market. Because there's some <mark type="inaudible" /> various signals of what's the news of inflationary pressures emerging sometime in the second half of this year or early next year. How and when they're going to and whether they're going to crystallize is unclear, I guess, to pretty much all of us. So that is a significant factor in the NIMs.</p>
          <p>So there's a little bit too much uncertainty for me to be as precise as to whether the trough is really quarter three or quarter four. Or maybe there's something that's going to be happening that would make it quarter one or something like that. God knows. No region &#x2013; clearly Icelandic volcanoes or other things as we know impact various industries quite rapidly. So I am not yet ready to give at that level of decision. Provisions...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, just to finish on net interest margin, the guidance calls for erosions in 100 and 150 basis points from what you've taken. <mark type="inaudible" /> the reference period or the base period for this is 2009 or is it year-on-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Full year, yes, year-on-year 2010 on 2009. And we've already gone through first 100 points out of those 150 reduction. So we still stick by that outlook. We think that the second half of the year, if it shows the full 150 then we cannot pinpoint as to where the bottom point is going to be, but we stick by 150.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now provisioning. Provisioning continues to grow as we have highlighted. The only change in our outlook is that while remaining on a slow-down pace of provision growth, it will still probably be increasing mostly throughout 2010. And even if we -- there's this certain plan on releases on a number of situations on kind of largish &#x2013; not the largest but largish but we will work on the recovery that may turn the point because it's dependent on individual situations and then some of the statistics of smaller numbers.</p>
          <p>We cannot be more certain than just saying, yes, possibly we will be doing some net releases in the late months of the year. The color behind is, yes, some recovery strategies are starting to come to fruition and some of their restructurings that have been made in the earlier part of the year are also starting to give us the basis to lower the risk level on a certain method. But also there's some new ones emerging. And there's some provisioning that is being created on the new issuance of loans, just your standard 1% or something that you created on the growth of the new <mark type="inaudible" /> portfolio. As the retail loan is starting to pick up obviously it carries some new provisions on those as well. So that's about the color.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then we can assume that this is what you said that this is more 2011 on a net basis then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's really pretty much all set, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And loan growth, <mark type="inaudible" /> difficult question, we do see growth. There's some beeping going on, actually. Alex, can you hear me?</p>

          <p>Hello, Alex, can you hear us again? He's probably going to disconnect. Okay, so for everyone who's on the line, loan growth, cruising speed, bit of a difficult question, '11 and '12. I don't have a guidance for that far to be honest, too many variables. Sorry for that.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from the line of Paul Formanko. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, Paul Formanko from JP Morgan London. Just a couple of questions to follow up, could you please comment on the status of your management option program and the vestings of the ADRs, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have any updates on either, actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When do you expect to have an update?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are actually working on that. On the options plan, I don't know. On the ADR program, we are bringing it up to consider to the Management Board within the next month, month-and-a-half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My second question, could you please clarify the overlap between non-performing loans and the restructured loans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The number of the volumes of the restructured loans are somewhat reducing overall as the structure of the portfolio changes a little bit. In terms of how much &#x2013; because you remember at year-end, we were closing a number that's only 1% of the restructured loans have gone.</p>
          <p>But again, we have since looked deeper into the analysis of these numbers and there's various parameters, how many renegotiated loans have we had? How many of them involved prolongations? How many of those prolongations have been required? Another prolongation, how many of prolonged loans have gone into non-performing so there's loads and loads of detailed statistics but I'm afraid our competition is not really showing that granularity in their reports. And I don't think we will be prepared to give all of our results.</p>
          <p>But what I can tell you is some color behind this and the color is that the quality of the restructured loans have somewhat reduced and there is a perfectly logical explanation for that. Because before we start talking about restructured loans, most of the restructuring has been relatively recent and relatively fresh. So as we can expect, that was, I remember the first time we've mentioned this number was on the annual results this Spring that we were publishing. So we were about a year and something, year-and-a-half into restructuring. So we were pretty happy at that point with the numbers that we were reporting on how many restructurings have gone. But we are just pretty happy with that number as it looks now, three, six months later on. And it is natural, that the number of restructured loans that have <mark type="inaudible" /> gone bad again has somewhat increased.</p>
          <p>The one reason I have mentioned is because it takes time for them to realize the risks. And the other reason is that the crisis recovery of the economy is still relatively slow. And it is difficult for many companies to pull themselves out only with long fundamental restructuring and sometimes the decisions that we may have been taking have been perfect but then again the overall color is that we are happy with the dynamics. If they were faster significantly, then we would have been much more worried.</p>
          <p>What I can also tell you in terms of the color is that pretty much all material situations and I'm talking about &#x2013; I'll give you some numbers. Pretty much all of our material situations have been individually analyzed. A strategy of recovery developed, approved by relative respective management or <mark type="inaudible" /> decision, and are being executed. We are out of the central office. We are controlling everything on individual basis, every step of the plan from the Central Management Unit and everything that is more than RUB170 million. Individual plans exist for amounts much, much lower than that. These are controlled with the same rigidity through our 18 regional offices.</p>
          <p>So pretty much all the way down to &#x2013; I think just a few million rubles. We have individual plans for recovery of loans and these are thousands of transactions. So we are comfortable that the situation is under control. In terms of new materials from the standpoint you'll be using the financials. We are not expecting any material surprises from our problem for the full year popping up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just one more question, if I may. We have seen very strong deposit growth year-to-date, 7%, so shrinkage of the <mark type="inaudible" /> the deposit growth dynamics will continue in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will see it continuing. Although we have taken steps to protect ourselves from the kind of ridiculously high excessive liquidity; we have taken pretty drastic pricing adjustments in the past four, six weeks to reduce the savings, the retail deposit rates and corporate deposit rates in rubles. The market &#x2013; so that should slow it down a little bit but again because it's a very recent decision, we'll get to assess the results of this trend. But the thing is that the population sentiment and the business community sentiment is still much more in the savings mode rather than in investment mode. So people are continuing to bring the cash into the banking sector.</p>
          <p>And the other factor is that the market is reciprocating. By now, we have been two or three weeks apart taking the price downshift on the deposits. Most of our competition have done the same. So with all the propensity to save and the quick adjustment by the competition, there would still be inflow of cash into the banking sector.</p>
          <p>Also as we have mentioned earlier in terms of retail deposits, for Sberbank, the main competition is not really the other banks. For us, the main competition is the mattress. And people are still continuing to take the money out of the mattresses and then bringing them into the banking sector.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of <mark type="inaudible" />. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. I can understand how it may be difficult to say what the increment is going to be going forward. But in terms of the NIM and when it will trough and the extent to which it has to go, I mean, based on how much of the loan book has already re-priced, how much is still to reprice? How much of the deposit base has re-priced? How much is still to reprice? Based on the current rates that you are offering on deposits and loans, do you have any more update on sort of how you see NIM developing over the next couple of quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I probably will not be more specific than just saying that our estimates of year-on-year NIM reduction of 150 basis points stays unchanged.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. But I thought previously, it was 100 to 150 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>100 to 150 but it will be stupid of me to say that it'd still be 100, if we already traveled all the way through the 100 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I'm saying is that the remaining bps is going to be not more than 50 and that's the estimate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I may just ask two more questions. I think previously there's been comments on the <mark type="inaudible" /> coverage ratios, NPL coverage ratios. You were comfortable between 80 and 120%, and it's now 136%. And you're said to be provisioning in excess of your NPLs without which you would report a significantly higher second quarter results. Can you give some guidance on when or sort of how your treatment is going forward and what you might see &#x2013; when you might see normalized provisioning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, normalized provisioning is a bit of a non-traditional term as applicable to Sberbank overall. If you look at the history of our financial results back into 8, 12 quarters, so we put it at that, we've historically been showing very big provision coverage ratios and that is not because of particular states of management. That is because of the level of risk that are overall in the economy and the fact that we still continue to practice what we've always been preaching on these conference calls is that if we see an asset in a particular situation with an increased risk profile where we talk to the management and see that &#x2013; the management of our borrower and see that there's a problem, we'd provide adequately and as objectively as we can against it. And until such time that we can still afford it, we will be continuing to do that.</p>
          <p>So therefore in our case, it continues to be the reflection of our assessment of risk and individual cases. We ourselves still pay it out of net profits as a management team and there's no point for us to artificially increase provisioning rate. But on the other side, there's no reason for us to underprovide against specific cases where we sense the risk level require such a provision. So this is much more a mechanical exercise for us, rather than an attempt to somehow manage it top-down from the financial results perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very helpful and my last question is, if I take your loan rate guidance and your NIM guidance then backing out annual cost income guidance then that would basically imply that there will be little seasonality in the fourth quarter of this year, as we've seen in prior years or a lot less seasonality. And that is something you've mentioned before that you'll be trying to more actively accrue costs throughout the year. Does that sound accurate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, accruing costs and seasonality in the P&amp;L, yes, direct link in terms of <mark type="inaudible" /> we are trying to be more and more accurate as much as we can, but also there's <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

          <p>Hello, ladies and gentlemen again. We were disconnected but didn't even realize it. I kept answering the question but I'm not sure at what point have we been disconnected or how much have I answered. So the brief resume is that there will be still be some remaining seasonality because of the large number of strategic changes that we'd go through. And some of the external parameters that are unpredictable.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I wanted to just clarify a little bit more on the margin drivers as you see them. First I mean in my view there are four major drivers. The worst one seems to be corporate pricing on the new lending. And just to clarify the 11% yield on your book now, how does that compare to new prices you're getting on corporate lending? On the wires, we see new prices being granted at 8, 9%. Is that a fair representation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we've talked about one year money for a very strong and high-quality borrower. Then 8, 9 is something that we will be prepared to lend then. You have to remember that there's not that many of them, good strong ones. So it is still closer to -- it's not 11, it's a bit lower but it's probably closer to 11 than to 8, 9 on average rating but this again this is just a bit of a feeling. The situation is still dynamic. Alexander would want to probably comment a bit more on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is situational for deficit of course, the demands for corporate lending we have to choose let's say the cherry picking really competing for best spot in the markets. And so this liquidity of the markets pushed price down. So yes, for best customers our rates actually are pretty competitive. And they prefer to choose better quality rather than higher yield capture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ok, we just saw CBR data for July and that suggested another 100 bps drop in corporate loan prices. Hence the question, because if your new business is done at 9% then we will see quite a bit more margin compression. Then the other drivers I guess you can't do very much about is the liquidity as you mentioned the asset mix. On re-pricing deposit, could you give us some feel for how this will flow through and how much have you done?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have reduced the ruble rate by between 50 basis points and 200 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's such a substantial gap, a gap between all the seasons. As a reaction of customers as the average yields on our deposits are already of size. So not all our actions that we're taking are really pricing and reflected properly in our interest rate expense on the retail side. So we expect that third quarter and fourth quarter will bring us some more noticeable, feasible results in economy &#x2013; I mean, on the interest expense side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we will see some lowering in the cost of our funding, primarily on the retail side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As a rule, our retail book re-prices down much lower than it re-prices up because of the &#x2013; quite a bit of the deposit, the turned deposits that people aren't particularly rushing to withdraw them in a reducing rates environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As part of our principal decision, we decided to <mark type="inaudible" /> retail market share <mark type="inaudible" /> and from corporate deposits primarily. So in favor of net interest margins. So we believe that in case of further deterioration of market conditions and in <mark type="inaudible" /> level, we may see further decrease of our market share in corporate time deposits and maybe a small decrease in retail customer deposits. But at the same time we also believe that we will see noticeable raise in cost of funding and technical fees as a result of some decisions taken in the first half of this year but already reflects in our P&amp;L accounts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay so to confirm, this 50 to 200 bip decline are across the board, just not just to retail? Because I was surprised your corporate term deposits, the prices came down just 10 bps, which given the liquidity in the market strikes me quite odd. Why would you pay corporate so much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because we can have long <mark type="inaudible" /> from customers and see if you look at composition for our liabilities, you see a dramatic decrease of corporate time deposits in our order book. So yes, we have some long-term corporate deposits except the previous year, last year, and we cannot change interest rate from that deposits previously rejected.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now actually and then moving through this force, the driver, could you talk about the spread on FX business? Because you have increased prices on deposits in FX and my sense is your spread on FX business are smaller than in ruble?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the level of rate is, in national terms, lower than in ruble and therefore you can extrapolate this business spread is a little bit lower especially when it is actually more similarly low in the native countries of those currencies in which we were talking about, dollars and euros et cetera. So, yes, it naturally is somewhat lower spread.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it seems you are increasing the prices on deposits in USD?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. But we equally have been increasing the prices of the loans in USD.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. How are you doing? I just have a question on wholesale funding and your plans for the rest of the year. Were there any? And a follow-up question on lending growth. I know you don't have an outlook for 2011 and '12. Could you just give an outlook for the rest of the year, what you project in light of <mark type="inaudible" />? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Sorry, the second question on loan growth, I didn't quite get that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Loan growth; your projection for growth for the rest of the year, the whole year 2010 growth, I know you mentioned before that you do not have a projection for 2011 and '12. I'm just wondering for this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, again for this year, full-year double-digit growth on retail loans, as I've mentioned in my foreword, and corporate loans roughly in line with inflation, if we're lucky.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of wholesale funding &#x2013; or maybe it is again &#x2013; in rubles, we're excessively liquid. In foreign currencies, it depends upon the market conditions and the supply and demand equilibrium within the country here. So we don't rule it out, but we are not also saying yes, with high certainty we're going to do that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, if I ask a question that's been asked. I was disconnected four times from the call now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have been disconnected three times ourselves. So, you're not alone, but let's try to make a dialogue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I wanted to ask a couple of questions. One, you already commented on corporate loans in light of CPI, but if I'm not mistaken, you said retail loans, double-digit growth, if you could quantify that, does that mean 11% or 20% or &#x2013; and then...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, definitely low-20; it's much closer to 10.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Much closer to 10, thank you. And then a second question; you already addressed expenses. Again, I was disconnected, so sorry if I didn't hear everything. One of the things that I noticed is, this is page 15 of your presentation, Q2 other expenses RUB28 billion. And then when I look at your breakdown in the footnote of the MD&amp;A, it looks like Moscow and Siberia accounted for a big chunk of the increase. So outside of compensation, what other forces are for &#x2013; how should we model or what expectations should we form for this other expense category? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't apply much significance &#x2013; much specific significance to, say, Siberia, which I assume you're just talking about anything east of euros, yes. I can give you a few drivers behind other breaking expenses other than stock costs that have took place in the second quarter. Some of it's seasonal constructional work and we would be building some of our data ventures and doing service centers for the client service. We have increased somewhat our marketing effort and some strategic project investments.</p>
          <p>For example, in the first quarter we worked at opening the projects and in the second quarter starting the expense flow on that. And the main projects are consolidation of the operational and back office function; building the universal contact center; rolling out our credit factory technology to the remaining regions of the country. <mark type="inaudible" /> is our new platform for doing mass retail lending; implementing large CRM systems. So at every given point in time we have between 70 and 100 strategic projects running at various stages with various types of spending associated with them.</p>
          <p>So in terms of the &#x2013; because of this so much strategic change going on, to your question how you should in your model try to build some drivers behind this, I wouldn't be able to add much systemic things because it really is much systemic pressure now that you can use because it really is an amalgamation of a large number of big projects, each with individual timelines. So we do have this clarity, we do see that. But it's not something that you will be able to integrate into your modeling. So, unfortunately, in practical terms I wouldn't be able to be very helpful to you, giving the color that I've just given on which particular projects have impacted the dynamics in the second quarter, I will be happy to do every quarter for your clarity and understanding but not for modeling.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand, thank you. If I could maybe just follow-up here; you said seasonal construction work. So let's say, if we were to take out the kind of the seasonal items, roughly what percent of that 28 billion is seasonal and what percent is ongoing activity projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Difficult question. The reason I'm kind of pondering before I answer is, again in the bank throughout the five-year period is going through overall increase, each and every functional aspect of it work. We're basically doing huge revolution with the bank, at the same time keeping it stable and reliable. There's very little value in trying to segregate seasonal and other strategic ongoing projects because the mix is so intertwined. Some of the strategic projects have their seasonality, some of them don't. And we actually don't manage it in these terms, even when we're administering the cost programs, it is kind of bottom-up and monitoring is bottom-up. So analysis like seasonality doesn't really give that much value even for us when we manage our share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then one last question, has there been any clarity from the government in terms of when there may or may not be a share option program for management instituted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>None. Well, there's one piece of color that I can probably add. On previous calls, we have been mentioning that the press was saying that the President of the country has given an order to the government to develop recommendations on how the compensation in the state-owned companies should be structured, long-term, short-term, etcetera, and how the interest of the shareholder in this stage is linked to the interest of the management. So the deadline for that recommendation has been &#x2013; it's kind of somewhat &#x2013; partly, I'm afraid because nothing has yet been published, but what we said the work is still continuing.</p>
          <p>The governmental mechanisms are working on this because every once in a while the banking community &#x2013; I'm not talking about Sberbank, the banking community gets specific questions to help work out some details on how this might be working. That's what we hear from other banks. So I guess the work is going on. Maybe there'll be some results. When is it going to be, I'm not sure. I cannot promise.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from the line of Mikhail Shlemov [VTB Capital]. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good evening, gentlemen; a couple of questions from my side. The first question is basically on the quote of your loan book and actually your exposure to agriculture, which is around 10% of your loan book. How do you actually estimate the effect of a possible drought and should we expect some additional expenses quoted <mark type="inaudible" /> and provisions from this to stem, i.e., in the second half of the year?</p>
          <p>And the second question is basically of a more general nature, over the last I think six quarters the loan deposit ratio has been -continues to fall, it's already on the &#x2013; close to 80%. What would be the target that you might have in your mind when you're planning over the &#x2013; just like medium-term, one to two years? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, I'm just jotting down the question. Okay, agriculture if you look at slide 19 of our presentation, which shows these should break it down of our loan portfolio -- of</p>
          <p>the total loan book &#x2013; this is not just corporate but total loan book. Food and agriculture is 9.6. There's much more food in there than actually agriculture, although we remain to be the biggest agriculture &#x2013; no, I'm wrong, my guys are saying to me it's about &#x2013; okay sorry, my fault, it's about &#x2013; 70%, 80% of that is agriculture. We are the biggest lender to agriculture in the country.</p>
          <p>So there's 9.6% for this category and overall state of this sector suggests that yes, there will be some impact but then we are in the middle of a very constructive dialogue with the industry and the representatives of the government. So it's tripartite dialogue between the lenders of the industry, the industry and the government in terms of finding the constructive solution to the issues the industry is facing.</p>
          <p>I don't think in &#x2013; we haven't yet fully quantified the issue for two reasons. One is that the harvesting season is not actually over yet, and some of the cultures that could have suffered haven't suffered and the industry is still figuring out the extent of the problem &#x2013; the exact extent of the problem. And the second reason is, some of the bigger agricultural groups that we're talking to are actually sending us early signals that they themselves have thought that the impact could have been a bit worse. So, we're expecting some numbers from them. And that signal is a bit counterintuitive but okay, we want to see what comes out of it.</p>
          <p>So hopefully, in terms of materiality to our P&amp;L and balance sheet, it is not going to be very painful. Let me put it this way, we're definitely comfortable that we can handle it in terms of our own financial performance and digest it, and this is not the biggest trouble that we have been facing in terms of the quality of the loan book on the horizons of the past two years. So we're not in an emergency mode of operating ourselves <mark type="inaudible" />. Yes, we're focused; yes, we're considering solutions, but business as usual on our side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, excellent. Thank you. And can we then move to the target loans, deposits ratio <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you see, it is much more external factors driven that &#x2013; our own targets. And this is getting back to the factors that we've discussed already in this call. This is the propensity of the corporate community and the retail public to save and the demand for loans. So we are managing our balance sheet for quality and profitability and sometimes happy to give away market share to find the right balance for those two parameters. So it's therefore, the ratio is secondary as compared to reacting to the changes in the risk profile and changes to the pricing. So we don't set ourselves very precise and specific targets for the nearest future for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but just looking, for example, trends in the retail was &#x2013; demand for retail loans obviously picking up and hopefully the share savings going down. Could we expect at least this ratio to stabilize around current levels, I would say, by the end of the year?</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Andre Simov from Goldman. Could you please suggest, what was quarter-on-quarter growth in the SME loan book in Q4, Q1, Q2? And as far as I know, the share obviously you logged in gross corporate loan book is currently at 10%, 11%. So, do you see this share growing this or next year? And generally, what's the bank's strategy regarding the segment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The strategy is that we are focusing very much to try and configure the best product that we can for the SME Segment. Unfortunately, the segment in the &#x2013; whilst it's a very perspective one, and it's going to be the main driver in the future years starting from somewhat &#x2013; next year for the whole of the banking sector in terms of volume and profitability. Unfortunately, there's still a shortage and we're not much different than anyone else or good convenient and accessible loan product on offer to this segment. This segment is still &#x2013; most of the banking sector hasn't yet figured out how to comfortably and on industrial scale to lend to this segment. And net flow, that's the problem that &#x2013; probably that all the banks including us are trying to address, but we see that through the end of this year the sustainable demand, the right closing demand for loans in the comfortable zone outside that each of them were not happy to venture is still going to come from medium, large and largest client segment, much more than out of SME. So, however much we want to explore the SME segment, it remains to be a pretty difficult task and not only for us. We are not disclosing the specific growth rates on a segment-by-segment basis, on a quarterly base. I don't think many of our competitors in Russia actually do that either, but we do it on the annual basis. So, we'll show at our year-end results with the same precision as we did last year.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, It's Geoff Elliott from Autonomous Research. Just had a question on provisioning. At the end of last year, you were talking about the 80% to 120% NPL coverage range. You were also already talking about net provision releases possibly at the end of this year. I just wondered, if you could explain what's changed and what happened in the loan book that has meant that you have to seek more provisions in NPL coverage and had to go higher than expected?</p>
          <p>And then coming on to 2011, just to understand correctly, you now reduced the &#x2013; through your prospect of net provision releases next year. So a positive number for provisions in the P&amp;L, do I understand that correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you understand that correctly. Most of the material releases are going to start happening from 2011. Not obviously all of them are going to be packed into one year. It's much more of a three-year horizon, if not longer. Yeah, material &#x2013; most of the recoveries on the existing bad long portfolio are going to be &#x2013; well we're planning to happen within '11, '12 and '13. What I've changed here so far in the portfolio, I've already given a pretty detailed account of what went on earlier in this call.But just to re-summarize it again, there's some new situations that are coming on because the economy is slowly getting out of the crisis.</p>
          <p>Much slower at least than everybody was hoping for, not much slower than reasonable heads were forecasting. But emotionally it still feels too slow to all of us as we all know. And some of the more new good lending is coming, which brings some of the minimal provisioning that we normally create against it. But there's also some releases and recoveries that are happening, but again with the critical masses yet really to come. So we cannot outrace the natural creation of the provisioning.</p>
          <p>I would remind you that we were, in early this year, late last year we were saying that we hope that provisioning will peak at 12%, 14% of the loan book. But we're already close to 14. So and what's changing is that what is &#x2013; we're actually now 12.5, yes. But what has changed is that we're seeing that the growth is probably still going to continue pretty much through the rest of the year at a continually slowing down pace, maybe some net release in November, December on a monthly basis if you compare month to month. But again it's dependent on individual transactions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, as I mentioned earlier, it would depend on market conditions and not though so far the pricing that we can get off of the market for our borrowings. We have been on two occasions demonstrating record levels both in our history in terms of best pricing for borrowings and as compared to other comparable credits.</p>
          <p>But it's rather more on the balance of supply and demand in particular currencies such as dollar particularly. No ruble borrowings on the wholesale markets for us because overall liquidity and particularly ruble liquidity we are heading &#x2013; had the access of liquidity as you can see from our...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Magdalena Stoklosa at Morgan Stanley. Just two very quick questions. I suppose, one, has there been any changes in your last given default assumptions or the collateral assumptions, sort of this year that would impact the assessment of your loan impairments for particularly the remainder of the year? So there's one.</p>
          <p>And two, is the CIS expansion sort of postponed and the BTA decision is not yet sort of taken? Are you contemplating any acquisitions of the domestic investment banking to build upon your existing corporate franchise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Already no material changes and expectations. Again, as we've mentioned earlier, pretty much all of the situations are under individual control and recoveries on things that have gone bad. In terms of the healthy portfolio and our monitoring efforts, we're not seeing anything material on the horizon that would surprise anyone. In terms of M&amp;A, no particular thoughts on the table.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just confirm the &#x2013; no changes to your collateral valuations either?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>More so that market pricing have been already taken into account and yes, the &#x2013; some of the re-pricing continued in the first half of the year and it hasn't been particularly favorable to the values of those collaterals. But then again, this is rather gradual and controlled process rather than anything big a chunk.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And to &#x2013; just to follow up on the sort of &#x2013; on the IB angle. I think, pretty much on the previous call, you've talked to us, indicated that you might be sort of developing the IB on the top of your corporate banking. If it's not inorganic, would it be sort of done organically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Definitely not halting on our plans to develop IB. We're still pondering what pace it should take and inorganic is clearly a practical way to do that.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Maciej Szczesny from Nomura. I have two questions. The first one, in your strategy you have outlined quite ambitious plans to reduce head count. Yet, when I look at the first-half release, your head count is actually up, perhaps because of small acquisitions, Belarus. But I'm just wondering are we going to see any head count reduction in the second half of this year? And if not, then when should we factor in a more visible head count reduction in the bank towards realizing the strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In which numbers have you seen the increase? Yes. You're absolutely right. In December, we have bought a Belarusian bank with 4,500 people. But still, we have been offsetting the reductions quarter after quarter after quarter and yet you will see staff reductions in every quarter all the way pretty much in the next couple of years at least.</p>
          <p>Maybe &#x2013; yeah, people are saying to me that maybe when you're looking at it in terms of averages, the averaging effect in the second quarter could have, with the time lag, shown the impact of the acquisition of the bank in Belarus.</p>
          <p>But, look, I refer you back to 2009 when we have reduced about 25,000 people in just a single year and we're continuing to proceed at a bit slower pace, but continuing to pretty aggressively proceed with staff reductions in this year as well. So we're pretty happy with the pace and in fact we're pretty proud with the pace. I don't think many people can afford that pace in a controlled manner. We're comfortable with what we're doing in a controlled manner, too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand. So that's the pace you're happy with basically. And you think that could be on target...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We'll continue through the next five, six quarters at least.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I understand. And just more a technical question, I know that you created a held to maturity portfolio within your securities book. Do you have any strong reason or backing for putting some of these securities in held to maturity or is it just purely a technical exercise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's technical exercise. We didn't have investment portfolio for about three years and that was due to IFRS portfolio &#x2013; investment portfolio changing rules due to the decisions taken by the previous management team back in 2007. So we technically couldn't have an investment portfolio under IFRS for three years. Now, the changing period is over, so we're coming back to natural portfolio structure.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, it's Marta Czajkowska from KBC Securities. Two questions. On the fee income, could you please share with us the drivers in the fee income from corporate and individual clients especially that in corporate that there was no volume drop and in corporate &#x2013; and in retail clients you mentioned a conservation of some commissions. Would it be re-pricing or any new fees introduced?</p>
          <p>And just related question to that on the fee income last quarter, we heard that the satisfactory level of trough would be 15% year-on-year, while in the first half of this year it grew by 25%. Would this 15% would be still valid or there appear any positive triggers that would allow you to be more optimistic with the outlook for the remaining of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hopefully, full-year gross price is going to be more than 15, yes. This good figure gives us good basis for revising the outlook out. And as usual, the fourth quarter is better on fees and commissions. Now, looking at &#x2013; back to your first question, looking at the slide of our presentation number 12, I'm not sure which primary you're referring to when you talk about reduction in fees.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I'm talking about increasing fees, actually...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In cash and settlement transactions with legal and individuals, right? And I just see that volume drop in corporate is not so good. And you mentioned that this is below your expectations. On the other hand, I believe at the very beginning too, you mentioned, maybe I just misunderstood something that you cancelled some commissions on the retail portfolio and the trough of retail portfolio. That is why retail portfolio grew at a faster beat. So I just...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. But there has to be one clarification. The slide that you're looking at doesn't include lending commissions for retail lending. So &#x2013; and yes, we have cancelled them back in April. So, we &#x2013; as I've been mentioning earlier, for retail loans, the fact of the canceling loan commissions, fees and commissions should have been compensated with the volume. And yes, it is starting to be compensated to the volume. We're happy with the pace that the retail loan book is growing. So that's positive, so far so good. We're yet to see how it performs on the full-year basis, but &#x2013; the pace we like.</p>
          <p>In terms of how fast or slow the fees and commission income on actually government transactions with legal entities is growing. Yes, well it kind of is slow, and I guess it is -it is caused by two parameters, one is that the overall bank fees and commission spend, the legal entities, the clients prepare to do in this kind of slow recovering economy is still remaining low.</p>
          <p>And the second one is that in that &#x2013; in that type of a situation you have to realign your product line to make sure that you deliver the fees and commission-based products that your clients are prepared to consume and pay for. So you have to do some changes in your offer, in your product offer, which in the post prices environment, which is not necessarily done instantly, it may take some time.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; but that is not to say that we're not focusing on that, we're putting a lot of effort and in all of the components of fees and commissions income. In &#x2013; not only on the product actually, product offering itself, but also in terms of the direct costs associated with generating those fees and commissions. And in terms of fees and commissions margins, we are putting a lot of effort. So the 24.4% growth in fees and commissions is also on our books accompanied with improved cost parts. So we're pretty happy with it, but we're not resting on laurels, you can be assured we're putting very, very intensive effort into this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So this cancellation probably has an impact on net interest that you charge on your client. So just a follow-up on costs and wage costs. You mentioned the indexation for three years of the wages, I just wonder whether it had already been visible in the second-quarter results, fully?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it hasn't really been a single-pointed exercise. It actually spread almost seasonally throughout the three, four quarters of this year. So the bigger part is probably already been behind us. But still is a significant <mark type="inaudible" /> ahead.</p>

          <p>Good evening. Thank you. My first question is about the ADR program. Do you think that the program will be or should be in line with the sale of state stake? Any thoughts on that?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We &#x2013; well, let me tell you &#x2013; let me put it this way. We ourselves are thinking about good timing for an ADR program, not in link with potential sale of the state stake. We're just think that, as we have always said, ADR program well timed on its own marriage is a good thing to do. And we're just looking for the right time and moment. And in the meantime, the news of a potential government thinking about selling some of our stake is &#x2013; we're not ourselves particularly thinking this when we're making our plans.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see, good. My second question is about the net income for 2010. I just wanted to come back <mark type="inaudible" /> on the outlook for the full year. Given that the bank received RUB77 billion for the first seven months on the Russian Accounting Standard, this means that you're probably looking at 20, 30 or probably slightly more than that within ruble and I think consider as five years of this year.</p>
          <p>And I'm just wondering where does this &#x2013; the comparative come from? Where do you think the figures for the next five months will be <mark type="inaudible" /> than first seven months? There will be no expiration of provisioning, the margin erosion will be well manageable, you said. Will this come from lower fees due to the cancellation of commissions from the sale lending. Will this come from higher costs due to <mark type="inaudible" /> or will this be a combination of all these things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a little bit of everything, I guess. Yeah, the overall composition of all those things that you'd mentioned and the ones that were mentioned before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my last question is about &#x2013; again about provisioning. I understand your reason why the coverage is above the guided range, 80, 120%, but do you think that you will come back to this range? You will target this range of provisioning coverage from 90 to 120% in 2011? Or this is a longer-term strategical target, let's say, for the next three years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the answer to that question comes from how the economy really feels. Again, as everybody's keeping &#x2013; stating you publicly, the recovery has been slow. There's other macro threats to the economy on both global, regional and local basis and still some uncertainty overall as to what the macro outlook is going to be for 2011.</p>
          <p>So the answer to that question will determine whether we really actively are going to be starting to manage the coverage ratio as the main driver as opposed to us just now focusing on other key parameters that we already discussed today.</p>

That's actually page 10, I think. Yes. So your corporate rates went down year-over-year by 300 basis points, yeah?</p>
          <p>And as far as I understand, I mean you've been cutting corporate rates and retail deposits rates, which obviously is the main funding for your loans head-to-head. But at the same time if I look at the retail deposits rate, they only went down by 10 basis points. So there were 6.3% in the second-quarter '09 and they're now 6.2% in the second-quarter 2010.</p>
          <p>So is it fair to say that what we have here is that your corporate loan book is re-pricing much, much faster than your retail deposit book? Those companies are actually coming to you and negotiating lower rates where obviously depositors are not taking money out of the bank. And what we're going to see is a sort of a further pressure on the corporate rates going forward as you indicated, but then we will have a tailwind from retail deposits re-pricing as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The way you put it, the logic is right. But if you perceive what you're saying outside of the context of the proportions of different parts of our funding and different parts of our loan book on the balance sheet, then what you're saying, they look very scary.</p>
          <p>But actually it is pretty manageable -- this is understanding our proportions of all these moving parts between retail and how much of retail is really time deposits, how much is current accounts that are paying virtually nothing. What is making us comfortable that 150 basis points reduction in NIMs on the full-year basis is something that is reasonable &#x2013; that makes sense as a reasonable outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm not only talking about time deposits just for us to be clear because you put the other separate line for the current account, so that's a different story. But just for me, also, as far as I understand, your current &#x2013; the current price, average rate that you give to your retail depositors is probably around 4, 5%, right? Is that true?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sort of, yes. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. So it's a fair assumption that over time and probably it's going to take you four, five quarters. This is 6.2% that we have here will come to this like whatever 4.5, 5%. That would be a fair assumption, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah, it would be. It would be &#x2013; again unless there's more frequent changes in pricing policy over this, five, six-quarter period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very good. And the corporate rates, which are now already, I mean relatively low, the level of percent and you said that top-notch borrowers will get 8, 9% rate, so I guess probably the average will be maybe 9.5, 10% given that you also have obviously lower-quality borrowers.</p>
          <p>So we have a relatively small incremental pressure on the corporate rates. While we have a pretty substantial gap between the deposit rate that you're paying right now and the ones that you effectively report. This is the right logic just to check with you. Did I make myself clear?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually not much, sorry. Not very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. So what I'm saying is that, the rate you reported on the corporate deposit is 11%, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you said that the top corporates, like MTS and other guys are probably getting the loans at around 8, 9%, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. So the other guys who are like not &#x2013; you said that the this is the strongest guys in the country obviously &#x2013; the not that strong guys, obviously getting like loans like 10, 11, 12% so on and so forth, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the average &#x2013; okay. So the average probably should be, I don't know where it is because you're not disclosing the front corporate rate, the average corporate rate right now in this very day. But the average should be higher than 8, 9%, should be maybe 9.5, 10%; that's probably the average rate, corporate rate that you're charging right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On page 10, we're saying corporate loans average is 11.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but that's including the sort of legacy corporate loans, which are still high yields and which are still re-pricing, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it also includes some of the legacy corporate loans that have actually been lower rate than that all the way throughout the crisis because they've been performing well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There were some other companies that weren't really impacted by the crisis as well, bizarrely but &#x2013; so you see today funny mix in terms of tenders, date of issue and changes in the rates in the process. So the average of 11 is actually pretty good net I would say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But you still say that this number should probably fall again in the third and fourth quarter, right, as far as...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A little bit. Yeah, a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the only thing that I'm trying to understand is that, so these numbers should fall a little bit further, but then the defaulted rates should fall pretty substantially maybe around 100, 150 bps, when the whole book re-prices. So that will be helping the net interest margin in some point in 2011. Is this a fair logic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's fair logic, absolutely. Fair logic, yes, it's true.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry for us, getting a little bit tired and not picking it up from the first time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That was the key thing. Then now, just again to clarify this completely. I mean, will you maybe just tell us clearly that we should like deviate completely from this 800 to &#x2013; well, 80% to 120 in the coverage ratio, because obviously you gave it in some time and people sort of fixed to it and it's clear right now that you do not really use it as an important measure. <mark type="inaudible" /> like forget about it for a while and just think about you as provisioning as much as you think is necessary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for wording it so clearly actually. This is the message that, yes, we've been trying to send for quite a time, yes. It is a bottom exercise for us. Yes, we are trying to be as objective and as adequate in every single loan provisioning situation and whatever the amount stacks up to is not of a particular concern to us, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So your coverage ratio is consistently going up...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And actually, I would like &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; it is important, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I see the newswires somewhat misinterpreting probably what I've said early on this call. The Interfax line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, 10, 14% NPL.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think that NPL is not more than 14. As we all know, we will -- 12, 14 number, we've been talking about only provisioning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And your peak NPLs because I think that was the question from the lady from UBS. I mean, do you have the peak NPL estimate or you don't...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We never actually gave out any outlook on the NPLs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I don't think we're going to be at this point ready to give it out. It's 9.1 now and obviously, saying that it's going to be 14 by the end of this year is I'm saying out of this world. Sorry if I may have lead the wrong term there or didn't sound very clear, but obviously 14 peak is about the provisioning, not the NPLs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just very last question for me. Do you think that it is reasonable to assume that next year your RE level, which this year most likely of &#x2013; quite probable given all your guidance will not reach 20%, would actually come back to 20%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay, yeah. If you have anything to add I will...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm more than happy to listen.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's pretty mechanical exercise, isn't it? You know our profit outlook...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just for this year. I don't know for the next year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think probably it was the right time for us to take the last question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. Thank you, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So we're ready for the last question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of <mark type="inaudible" />. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the presentation. Some of my questions have been answered and this might have been answered as well because I was cut off. But, I have one question in terms of your own forecast of deposit growth in 2010 full year and 2011. And do you see any change in the mix share of demand deposits in total deposits this year, next year? And by making your deposits forecast or in your budgets, what kind of GDP growth you're using for Russia in 2010-2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For this year, we're expecting clearly full-year double-digit growth. As you can see, we have been showing from &#x2013; for the past 12 months 15.1% growth in deposits and liabilities. The GDP number &#x2013; well, for 2011, the business planning exercise is you have to take a couple of months more.</p>
          <p>So I'm not really ready to put out a particular number range. In terms of GDP outlook that we're putting out for 2010, I think ours have been standing for quite long. What's the number, 3.8, 4 for this year or maybe 4. &#x2013; have they changed it recently? 4.4. Our micro think tank, I think, was &#x2013; we're reworking it recently. And for 2011 &#x2013; do we have a number?</p>
          <p>I don't think we should &#x2013; an outlook yet, but our Micro-Analysis Center, I think, issues regular overviews and forecast of micro-parameters. I think, they should be available on our website. If not, you could actually check with Mr. Zhdanovich, who's our IR. I think you can get subscribed to them. So whatever they put out, we actually use internally as well for our outlook. Sorry for not having the numbers handy, but I think we can get &#x2013; whatever we have, we can get to you through our IR.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So clear with around 4.4% GDP growth, do you expect around...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think 4.4. I think, yes, that was the number if my memory doesn't fail me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And for the full year...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For quite a long time, we were saying 3.8 and already people were saying, "Oh, why so high?" and then, "Oh, why so low?" But I didn't think we'd deviate very much away from it subsequently, so it's...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But your deposit growth expectation for the full year is currently reflecting the current trends rather than your GDP growth forecast anyway, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, because &#x2013; well, there obviously is a link between the two, but I don't think it is as direct as in many other models that you may be using for other countries.</p>
