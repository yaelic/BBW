          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call hosted by the Bank of New York Mellon Corporation. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Mr. Steve Lackey. Mr. Lackey, you may begin.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Wendy and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us to review the first quarter financial results for the Bank of New York Mellon Corporation. Before we begin, let me remind you that our remarks may include statements about future expectations, plans and prospects, which are forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>The actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those identified in our 2008 10-K and other documents filed with the SEC that are available on our website bnymellon.com.</p>
          <p>Forward-looking statements in this call speak only as of today, April 21, 2009. We will not update forward-looking statements to reflect facts, assumptions, circumstances or events, which have changed after they were made.</p>
          <p>This morning's press release provides the highlights of our results. We also have a supplemental document, the quarterly Earnings Review, available on our home page, which provides a five-quarter view of the total Company and our six business segments. We will be using this document to review our first-quarter results.</p>
          <p>This morning's call will include comments from Bob Kelly, our Chairman and CEO and Todd Gibbons, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, there are several members of our executive management team to address your questions about the performance of our businesses during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Steve and good morning, everyone and thank you very much for joining us. EPS in the first quarter was $0.28 and on an operating basis $0.53. The bad news is revenue is down 14% year-over-year. Now we have been talking about revenue eventually slowing for about six months now and it has finally happened. As you know, our Company has benefited tremendously from financial market stress in late 2007 and all of 2008. We saw a flight to quality in deposits and higher spreads in NII, FX and securities lending. In Q1, interbank lending spreads declined, deposit levels have finally started to moderate and volatility has come down in FX.</p>
          <p>The good news is that this is of course a positive for the financial markets overall. We're starting to see some improvements in the money markets, with fixed-income activity and in some of the equity markets. Part of the NII downdraft represents a conscious decision by us to manage the investment process very conservatively over the past six months. We're now beginning to take a little more risk, placing term money in the interbank markets over quarter end versus just keeping it at the Fed. In other words, we could have earned more, but we didn't. This was a quarter for conservatism.</p>
          <p>The good news is firstly, we continue to gain market share in our businesses. In Asset Management, stronger investment performance is leading to improved market share in the U.S. and Europe in most of our long-term strategies. We're seeing positive inflows into equity products for the first time, since our companies were merged in 2007, which is very encouraging.</p>
          <p>Prime money markets were strong as well. We saw outflows of low-yielding government and treasury funds for four months in a row. During the first quarter, we saw inflows of prime funds of $13 billion and outflows of treasury and government funds of $27 billion. This is a huge improvement since the Lehman bankruptcy.</p>
          <p>In Wealth Management, we had our 13th consecutive quarter of net positive client asset flows. In Asset Servicing, we posted strong new business wins. Over the past year, we won $1.9 trillion in assets in new assets under custody and that's over 300 billion in the most recent quarter. In Issuer Services, we're maintaining a strong number one position, and we're seeing continuous success in Corporate Trust and in the DR business.</p>
          <p>In Clearing, we continue to enhance the number one market position by <mark type="inaudible" /> introducing Broker-Dealers, and Broker-Dealer and Treasury Services are also bringing in a lot of new business. In fact, Issuer Services, Clearing and Treasury Services all posted good revenue trends.</p>
          <p>Now as a result of the revenue challenge, we're aggressively managing expenses. Operating expenses were down 10% year-over-year. We have reduced staff expense by 15%. We held the line on non-staff expenditures, and from a merger synergy standpoint, we're continuing along as expected. We also built capital, Todd is going to review this in better detail and in more detail, but just a couple of key points. Both Tier 1 and TCE were up this quarter versus the fourth quarter. On a Tier 1 basis, we're in the first quartile of banks with or without TARP money. Our Tier 1 was 13.8% and 11.2% without TARP. Our TCE was 4.2% versus 3.8% last quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, we are currently median versus our peer banks, but there's a clear reason for this. We have of course a large exposure to the value of securities relative to loans versus traditional banks. Hopefully, most of the problems in that class of assets are now behind us. And you should know that excluding OCI, our TCE is above 7%. That would be first quartile versus peers. This should eventually provide a lot of capital upside, as securities prices recover.</p>
          <p>Finally we decided to build capital more aggressively by reducing our dividend, and in fact we reduced it from $0.24 to $0.09. This will generate approximately $700 million per annum in common equity. It also provides us with more flexibility for ongoing investment and growth, both organic and inorganic.</p>
          <p>Very importantly, we believe it also strengthens our ability to repay TARP in a very cost-effective way, once we get permission from our regulators. We fully intend to return to historic payout ratios as soon as practical, and we would also note that the new dividend yield of 1.3% based on yesterday's closing price is now in line with the average of our peer banks.</p>
          <p>Overall, based upon business trends we see and recent client actions, it feels like we are at or close to the bottom. We are very well positioned to manage out of this recession and we're going to continue to gain share.</p>
          <p>Now I'm going to turn it over to Todd, so he can provide you with more color. Todd?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bob, and good morning. As I take you through the highlights of the quarter, please note that for comparative purposes, I will exclude the impact of investment securities and asset write-downs from our results.</p>
          <p>Before I get into the numbers, let me offer metrics around some of the key drivers of our businesses. During the quarter, we continued to enjoy strong new business wins, increasing our global market share in every business line. Nonetheless, global equity market values were down between 40 to 48%. Activity levels in our servicing business were lower than we have seen in recent quarters, and to protect our balance sheet in an uncertain environment we kept a larger percentage of our assets in low yielding, very short-term liquid instruments.</p>
          <p>That combined with the historically low interest rates and the normalization of client balances, affected NIR. This led to a 14% decline in operating revenue. With that as a backdrop, let's get into the numbers. My comments will follow the quarterly Earnings Review report beginning on page 3. Our continuing EPS was $0.28. It was reduced by a total of $0.25 including $0.21 per share or $246 million from investment and goodwill write-downs and $0.04 of merger and integration expenses. The decline in market values and volatility impacted Asset and Wealth Management and Asset Servicing. So our success in winning new business offset a portion of these declines.</p>
          <p>Our other servicing businesses performed very well. You can also see from the chart on page 3 that all our businesses showed great expense control, particularly those most impacted by the market environment. Total Company operating revenue declined by 14% year-over-year and 21% sequentially and we reduced operating expenses by 10% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. Our operating margin for the quarter was 33%.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 5 of the Earnings Review, you can see that while U.S. equity market values were down 40%, and global equity values were down 48%, our assets under management and assets under custody held up relatively well, reflecting the benefit from product diversification and new business. Over the past 12 months, we have won an incremental $1.9 trillion in new business in Asset Servicing, with 335 billion of that coming in the first quarter. The benefit of this new business has helped to offset the impact of lower market values and a stronger U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>An example of our success at gaining market share has been with hedge funds. Over the past year, hedge fund assets have declined significantly, as most of you know, from a peak of 2 trillion to 1.2 trillion. Over the same period, hedge funds administered by the Bank of New York Mellon remained stable at approximately $200 billion.</p>
          <p>Our long-term flows of assets under management were positive again in Wealth Management and based on stronger investment performance, improved significantly in Asset Management. Another example of this improvement is one of the goals that we established at our Investor Conference last June. That was to improve the Morningstar rankings for Dreyfus. In the most recent survey, Dreyfus's products averaged 3.4 stars compared to three last year.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 6 of the Earnings Review, which details fee growth, security servicing fees were down 20% year-over-year. Even with the continued strong new business wins over the past year, Asset Servicing bore the brunt of this decline, due principally to lower volumes and spreads in securities lending as well as lower market values, transaction volumes and the strong U.S. dollar. As you may know, one of the impacts from the markets' deleveraging process is a reduced demand for securities lending. Securities lending fees decreased $155 million year-over-year and $97 million sequentially, reflecting the reduced demand as well as lower spreads and lower market valuations.</p>
          <p>On a positive note, in Asset Servicing for the second year in a row, we ranked number one among all global custodians in the R&amp;M Survey. And we now have the number one quality ranking across all three major custody surveys.</p>
          <p>Issuer Services fees were down 3% year-over-year, resulting from lower levels of fixed income issuances globally. The sequential decline of 6% reflects lower depositary receipt fees due to the timing of corporate actions and lower shareholder services revenue, also due to lower overall corporate action activity and the impact of lower equity values on stock-option plan fees.</p>
          <p>Clearing fees declined 4% over the prior year, primarily reflecting lower asset values and lower money market related revenue. During the first quarter, we continued to benefit from new business and the introducing Broker-Dealer segment, where we maintained a strong number one market share.</p>
          <p>Asset and Wealth Management fees were off 28%. In Asset Management we enjoyed positive flows in equities, fixed income and prime money funds, offset by outflows in very low yielding government treasury funds and in certain alternative products.</p>
          <p>Wealth Management continued to benefit from strong organic growth, particularly in the family office segment and the Northeastern wealth markets. Wealth Management has had positive client flows for the 13th straight quarter. FX and other trading revenue increased 19% year-over-year and 40% -- and it actually declined 40% sequentially.</p>
          <p>The increase from the year-over-year quarter reflects the benefit from higher volatility of key currencies, partially offset by lower client volumes. The decrease from the record fourth quarter reflects the impact of both lower volatility and client volumes. With approximately 85% of the FX revenue driven by our Securities Servicing clients, lower volume and values negatively impacted the trading revenue.</p>
          <p>We're pleased once again however to be recognized for our quality service in the Global Investor Magazine's FX Survey, rated the number one FX provider and we won best FX service overall. Investor and other income -- excuse me, investment and other income was down 124 million compared to the first quarter of '08 and down 112 million sequentially. This decline is principally due to a decline in the carrying value of certain equity investments.</p>
          <p>Turning to net interest income, which is detailed on page seven of the Earnings Review, NIR and related margin continued to be influenced by the size of the balance sheet, mix of earning assets, historically low interest rates and our conservative investment strategy in this uncertain environment. Net interest revenue increased 3% year-over-year, principally reflecting a higher level of deposits offset by narrower spreads, driven by the asset mix. 49% of our earning assets were in liquid investments. On average, cash and interbank placements were up 78%, while loans and investment securities were actually down 12%. NIR was lower sequentially by 278 million due to the drop in short rates globally, which decreased the value of our non-interest bearing deposits. Additionally the size of our balance sheet has declined from 238 billion at year-end to 203 billion at the end of the first quarter, reflecting the stabilization of the short-term credit markets.</p>
          <p>We believe our balance sheet is likely to remain at current levels, unless conditions change once again. The mix of earning assets together with the historically low rate environment resulted in declines in the net interest margin of 25 basis points compared to the prior year and 45 basis points sequentially. Our decision to maintain a highly liquid investment strategy was based on a very uncertain environment, leading into and during the first quarter. The approach actually improved liquidity and it strengthened our capital ratios at a cost of approximately 0.03 to $0.04 per share. We are now in a position to invest in high-quality assets, with slightly longer durations. These actions should keep the net interest margin in the 180 to 200 basis point range even in this current low rate environment.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 8, you can see we reduced operating expenses by 10% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. Strong expense management response to the operating environment and the continued impact of merger-related synergies drove year-over-year expense and sequential declines in non-interest expense. The 10% year-over-year decrease was driven by a 15% decline in total staff expense, resulting from lower incentive and compensation expense, a 33% decline in business development expense and a stronger U.S. dollar. Partially offsetting these declines were higher net occupancy and professional, legal and other purchased services.</p>
          <p>The sequential decrease includes declines in nearly all expense categories. In the first quarter, we incurred a $50 million goodwill impairment charge related to Mellon United National Bank and we also recorded another $10 million restructuring charge on top of the 181 million charge we took in the fourth quarter. This is related to the fourth quarter announcement of a 4% reduction in staff. Recall that this restructuring will lower our expense base by 160 to $170 million annually.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter the FDIC proposed a 10 to 20 basis point special emergency deposit assessment for all depositary institutions. The charge if approved is expected to be recorded in the second quarter, and based on average assessable deposits in the first quarter would be approximately $75 million assuming 10 basis points. This is in addition to last year's increase in the assessment, which increased our costs 15 million year-over-year and 7 million sequentially.</p>
          <p>Page 9 of the Earnings Review shows the investment securities in our portfolio. The unrealized net of tax loss of our available for sale portfolio was 4.5 billion at March 31, an increase of approximately 400 million compared to the prior quarter. This increase primarily reflects a decline in the value of the Alt-A securities. We have again included a breakdown of investments that are on our watch list. This is now approximately 39% of the portfolio, a slight uptick from the end of the fourth quarter. These types of securities are under more credit stress and are generating the majority of the negative marks and impairments. Since the end of the fourth quarter, the housing market indicators and the broader economy continued to deteriorate. To properly reflect the declining value of homes in the current environment, we adjusted our loss severity assumptions to decrease the amount we expect to receive to cover the original value of the securities.</p>
          <p>As a result of these adjustments to our assumptions, a larger number of securities, which were primarily Alt-As, generated an expected loss and consequently we recorded an impairment charge. Combined with the write-down of the structured tax investment, we recorded a total of $295 million in pre-tax securities loss. Effective March 31, we adopted two new accounting standards that impacted the securities portfolio. The first new standard, FAS 115-2, changes the accounting for impairments. Under the new standard for securities we do not intend to sell. Only the credit-related portion of an OTTI is required to be recorded through the income statement. The remainder is recorded in other comprehensive income.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, the credit loss component of 295 million was recorded as a securities loss on the income statement and the non-credit-related component of 1.2 billion remained in OCIs. As a result of adopting the other accounting -- also FAS 115-2, the transition rules required us to record an adjustment for previously recorded impairment charges. This adjustment increased retained earnings by 681 million and also increased the loss in accumulated OCI by an equal amount. All of our regulatory capital ratios strengthened compared to the prior quarter. Tier 1 of 13.8 compares to 13.3, total capital 17.7 compared to 17.1 and the leverage ratio was 7.8 compared to 6.9.</p>
          <p>We're conscious that the market is also focused on the tangible common equity ratio and it improved to 4.2%. As I noted earlier, we did adopt the new FASB guidelines related to valuing securities and the benefit was approximately 28 basis points. However, that ratio would have been up whether we had adopted the new accounting or not. We recognize that the investment community does not look at the various capital ratios in isolation. So relative to the eight banks in our peer group, we rank in the top quartile for Tier 1, median in TCE and median in our dividend yield based on the reduced quarterly dividend of $0.09. I would also point out that among those peers, we have the lowest relative amount of TARP to be repaid.</p>
          <p>Now turning to our loan portfolio. Our loan portfolio continues to be of high quality, mostly short-term and investment grade. The deterioration that we have seen is primarily limited to the portfolio of the Florida bank, as well as some other residential home loans.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we raised the provision for credit losses to $80 million. Charge-offs were less than provision at 50 million, non-performing assets increased by 129 million to 429 million, virtually all real estate related. The effective tax rate was 27.2% in the first quarter of 2009. If we exclude the impact of the non-operating items, the effective tax rate was 32.6.</p>
          <p>Turning to the integration front on page 12, we achieved 186 million in annualized revenue synergies, we reached 173 million in expense synergies during the quarter, which is 16 million higher than the fourth quarter. We are now almost 85% of the way through our M&amp;I expenses, and we are meeting or exceeding our operating commitment in Asset Servicing and that's where most of the overlap occurred.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we are confident. We'll be among the first banks to recover from the global recession. Bob has frequently talked in the past about the three waves of the downturn for banks. The first is the mark-to-market declines and write-downs of securities. Second is consumer debt losses and the third is commercial and commercial real estate loans.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet is obviously most impacted by that first wave and the good news is we appear to be emerging from this part of the cycle. We have a strong balance sheet, excellent capital ratios, tremendous liquidity and the earnings power to withstand an even more severe recession. During the current downturn, our businesses have gained market share and as the market environment improves, we're extremely well positioned to benefit. Our fee revenue is leveraged to any improvement in the equity and credit markets and as Bob indicated, we're seeing some early signs that are making us a little more optimistic.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it back to Bob.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question today is from Mike Mayo. You may ask your question and please state your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Mike Mayo with COSA. Hey, Bob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to the expense reduction, that's good news and I guess it stems from the merger savings. But my question is, given the revenue environment and the decline in revenues, how much more leverage do you have to reduce expenses, so as to prevent negative operating leverage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a good question. The revenue obviously was our primary issue in the quarter, and we worked pretty hard on the expense side and what I would say is our expense reductions are firstly sustainable and largely permanent and repeatable. And also I want to say that -- so in other words there's not any one time stuff in there. It's a combination of the restructuring that we did in the fourth quarter and you're starting -- you don't see the full run rate of that, but it's there. The merger saves, we are being tougher on compensation, quite frankly on bonus type schemes.  And we have other programs that are underway. So what I would say is that at top of the house, there is other things we can do. The only thing I'm going to be careful of though, is that we're not going to impact quality or level of service in the Company. We want to continue to gain market share throughout this process. But I do want to emphasize we have more flexibility from here if we need to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As a follow-up, what percent of the expenses are variable versus fixed? I know at legacy bank New York the number -- if I'm correct, it was close to like 80% or so and at Mellon, I thought it was more variable. So what percentage of expenses are variable and what are some additional levers you have in addition to compensation should revenues continue to decline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let Todd handle that, but let's remember that all expenses over the medium term are variable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In the long run, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, Mike, the largest expense that we have is compensation expense and with the actions that we took -- we took in the fourth quarter and the synergies that we're going to continue to grind out of the Company, I think we'll continue to do better there. We are seeing opportunities to improve operating efficiencies as well. We're creating utilities that a number of our businesses can use and I think it will increase efficiency and lower cost. We're also running a little hot on our consulting expenses right now. I think we're starting to see that phase down a little bit from where we were in the fourth quarter. But I think there is more room for us there. But most of the leverage comes with -- how we're doing in the incentive side, that's relative to -- it's all related to revenue across the Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In the short-term, what percent would be variable, is it like a half or two-thirds or -- ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's hard to say. I would say, it's probably within that range of 50 to 60%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the other thing I'd say Mike is, given our mix of businesses and the scale we have in each of our businesses is that there are other things we can do in the medium term as well. So there is short-term actions and there is medium-term actions. And we're starting to think about medium-term things as well. So if you want to believe that there is a structural change in financial services, you can do that and -- but we're not going to take the chance in case there is. I don't -- at some point these markets are going to return. But I think we have some great medium-term opportunities in everything from real estate to more fundamental ways of reducing paper and getting common activities at a much lower unit cost and we're going to be working on that as well and that just talks to the advantage of scale here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just curious, the reduction of dividend, why didn't you just reduce it to like $0.01, if you have any interest as to kind of repay back the TARP money, if you can kind of talk about, why you didn't just cut it more than you did?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Tom, it's Bob. I guess there's a couple of reasons. The first one is, it kind of gets back to that three-wave type comment, is that we would like to think that the majority of the issues on our balance sheet have been identified and on a relative basis, we should outperform in terms of asset quality over the next year.</p>
          <p>Second thing is, I think dividend is actually pretty important in companies, whether they be financial or industrial. And we should pay a dividend. And I am a believer in having a competitive dividend rate. We were certainly much higher than our peers. And so our view was let's go to a peer-type level or peer average and that puts us in the middle of the pack and generates us a lot of free capital that we can do other things with. So that's why, and I don't think we have to reduce it that much in the end. So it will be interesting to see as things progress here, but we all feel pretty comfortable at this level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. And in your comments, you kind of feel like we are at or close to bottom, is that a view for the revenue side, or is that also talking about kind of the credit division, you think that's also at or close to bottom?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's -- I'll start with the revenue side. We spend a lot of time obviously talking about the numbers. We do it every quarter and we do it every month as well, but I'm getting more of a sense, Gerald and I both are, and we go around the table to our business heads, that we could be here or close to it, and, which is somewhat encouraging, although what I would say to you is let's be cautious and conservative here. And, but we're seeing some encouraging signs, and the asset management ones were a good example, I pointed out and I'm sure Ron could talk about it more. But on the credit side, Brian, what would you say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. It's Brian. We are going to -- we are at the high-end of our range right now. We see this -- similar numbers for the next couple of quarters at least until we see some real signs of the macroeconomic recovery. But I think as Todd mentioned the important thing is we don't have credit card loans, we have minimal consumer loans and we stopped making LBL loans in 2006. So we think we are at the higher range, but it should continue probably for a couple of quarters.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ron, what would you say, kind of interesting to think about the Asset Management business and some of the changes you've seen in the last few months, is there any color you could add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's Ron O'Hanley here. What I would point to a little bit is asset flows. What we saw happen in the first quarter was quite strong flows in long-term funds. I mean there were inflows and outflows, and I'll come to the outflows in a second, but the inflows start at the beginning of the quarter with institutional money coming back in. But what was very positive for us is we started to see as the quarter progressed, retail money. And that's a combination of two things.</p>
          <p>One is some of the retail money is starting to move, but us capturing a disproportionate share, because investment performance has been so strong. We're seeing that at Dreyfus, as Todd talked about the Morning Star rating, now that's quite close to 3.5, up from 2.7 at the end of '06. In our European fund sales, we were third in overall sales in Europe for the quarter, and just in our overall shift in share. So we feel quite positive that as investors start to move into the market, given our performance and given our distribution capability, we will enjoy disproportionate share.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Bob.</p>

          <p>Hi, Gerard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Getting -- coming back to that answer you just gave about the bottoming -- possible bottoming in businesses, what should we look for as outsiders that could actually push -- well what do you guys, I guess are most worried about that could actually -- the bottom maybe is not in the next three to six months, but could be in 2010? Is it a global economic decline or -- what are some of the tell-tale signs that you guys are watching to make sure that this does not get pushed out into 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's talk macro and then a little more micro on markets and then finally to us. And if anyone else wants to jump in, please do. I mean clearly we're going to see unemployment rates in this country rise for some time yet. And we don't see a near-term end to that, and but hopefully we will see it by the -- see some peaking unemployment by the end of the year, start of next year.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we are all watching Case-Shiller and say, the top 20 cities. It would be great if we could see two or three cities at some point by the end of this year that flatten out in terms of house price declines and maybe start to turn a little bit and we're watching inventories as well. I can't help but think that those are the key things that I am watching and just the employment data generally, and I would say that I think we've got a pretty good shot here, of turning it around faster than Europe for example.</p>
          <p>If you looked at some data, I don't know if you've been watching this at all, but if you look at bank loans or bank assets as a percentage of GDP, the U.S. is pretty low compared to Europe. And we don't have the Central and Eastern Europe issues that Europe is currently struggling with as well. To some degree, our problem is a little bit easier to fix here and of course we went into this earlier.</p>
          <p>Getting a little more micro, when you get into the financial markets, you got to think about the fact that firstly the markets tend to see all that of its turns six to nine months in advance. We're certainly watching interbank market spreads, the lending spreads are really coming in nicely, we've seen corporate bond spreads start to come in, and we're starting to see some high-quality bond deals getting done and eventually that's going to lead to more higher yield stuff getting done. And you can't help but think that at some point here, hopefully later this year you're going to see more banks being able to do five and 10-year unguaranteed bond type issues and ultimately with more activity in the capital markets, that's going to be good for us as well.  Gerald, or --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gerard, I'd just add a couple of points, from a financial markets perspective, and Bob started to allude to, we're seeing the financial markets open back up. In January you saw very high grade companies be able to issue debt securities, you're now seeing lower grade companies issue, issue in size. You're seeing some degree of leverage companies issue, HBA last week, had a big new issue. We're seeing some structured notes in the corporate trust areas start to come to market as well. We're not going to see CDOs come back, but we are going to see structured notes come back to the marketplace. Ron commented on long assets being invested again in the Asset Management area. So you're just seeing a general pickup in financial market activity and I believe that deleveraging in the broker-dealer community and across the world has essentially occurred. We're clearly deleveraged now to a more sustainable rate and from here we can build upon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's good to see that consumer saving rates now are up around 4%. And they probably would go higher than that, 7 or 8%, and that's probably a good thing for the nation as well. So we're not saying that for the industry, that loan losses have peaked. You're going to see lots of losses this year and next. But you think in terms of those three waves, but I think at some point what you're going to see is over the next 12 to 18 months, you're going to be able to see, I hope with an opening up of the financial markets, you're going to see the ability of most of the banks to be able to start issuing debt as well as equity and of course that's a great thing for the tax payer and for the country, because that means TARP is going to get repaid and get repaid at a very nice profit to the taxpayer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Speaking of TARP, I missed your opening comments, Bob. So I apologize if you addressed this. What's your view on paying back your TARP and did you make any comments about the stress tests that  -- what you are hearing about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gerard, I didn't actually make any comments about it and we don't know anything about the stress tests more than you do. We've been providing data. All I can say is I am not losing any sleep on it, and I think we're as well positioned as anyone in terms of our ability to repay, just using the simple measure of the amount of TARP as a percentage of our market capital, probably number one in the industry here.</p>
          <p>And so, we will see and I like our relative strength of our balance sheet, I like our liquidity, the general earnings power, these are all positive things. And we will see what happens here in coming weeks. Hopefully, we will get some information relatively quickly from the regulators, and we will take their lead and obviously we won't do anything without their permission, but it's certainly our hope that we will be in the -- one of the earlier waves of being able to repay TARP, if that's allowed to occur. The way I kind of think about it is, we have a lot of excess Tier 1, and frankly it's served its purpose.</p>
          <p>The markets have returned to a much better liquidity than they were in the fall when we had the crisis and we've actually generated a couple of hundred basis points of Tier 1 in the last couple of quarters. We are good generators of Tier 1. We have more than we need. And the thing to think about too is this TARP money is pretty expensive money, it's 5% after-tax. We could find alternative instruments that are a lot cheaper and therefore earnings would go up. And ultimately, I think it is a really strong message to our clients around the world, and also to the financial markets and indeed to the taxpayers.</p>
          <p>And lastly, and I think about this all the time, this continues -- I want to make sure that we continue to be a destination for the most valuable and talented people around the world. We have outstanding people, and I would never want to jeopardize us on the recruiting side or people being worried about payment structures or whatever, in terms of longer-term competitiveness. So I think there's a lot of reasons why the healthier companies should be allowed to repay TARP eventually, but of course we still have a lot to learn about the process and I look forward to hearing more in due course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And one last question. Have you found with new business wins, companies that don't do any business with Bank of New York? Have they asked you more recently than, if you guys think back a couple of years ago, about capital, about the capital ratios, or is that part of your conversation more today with new potential clients versus a year or two ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it has been a big change, frankly. Last year, I would say that it was a non-issue at the beginning of the year and in the post Lehman bankruptcy and the TARP money being received. I think it was a big positive and it clearly identified particularly to non-U.S. clients and potential clients, that here's the survivors. I think it has subtly changed though, over the past three or four months and outside of the U.S. and increasingly inside the U.S., now it's kind of viewed as negative and certainly when I travel in the Middle East or Asia or in Europe, I do get more comments about capital levels generally and TARP generally as well. We never would have had those conversations six months ago.  And let's face it, as you've become &#x2013; as you, the market, the supply side and the sell side have become very much more sensitive to it, so have clients. So it comes up regularly and frankly, we view it as a selling plus when we're pitching outside of the country.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, let me just -- if I can just add to that. And we also enjoy very high credit ratings as well as strong capital ratios. And I think maybe a few of the other business leaders here could comment, Jim, Palermo, maybe -- how is it helping your business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, Todd. Gerard, as Bob indicated, the competitions that we are involved in now, at the top of the list is the capital and the financial strength of our organization, vis-a-vis the competition and that's come up more readily over the last few months.  That used to be somewhere in the 8, 9, 10th on the criteria list a year or so ago. So it's absolutely led to new business opportunities, it's led to expanded relationships, and it's actually caused some clients to think about the different models that they have, where we're seeing in the past where a very large financial institution had multiple custodians. Now they're looking to see if they shouldn't in fact reduce their number of custodians and be much more careful who those business partners are.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Usdin from the Banc of America Securities. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, everyone. My question just revolves around the business model. Obviously, revenue diversity has always been a hallmark of the Company. This is the type of quarter, where obviously just things are challenging across-the-board and you feel that on all the revenue lines. I am just wondering, as you look forward on &#x2013; and to some of the comments you made about starting to see the hopes of some improvement, how do you think the business model will react on the positive side, meaning that we've had a lot of businesses that had kind of "over earned", but then kind of this quarter, kind of everything had its own challenges. So I guess what's that prospect of things going directionally all the right way when things improve as opposed to how they've kind of come in on the downside?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, one of the things to remember is, on that, Ken, is we actually did have some positives, like Karen had a great quarter in her business mix and Karen, why don't you just talk about it for a sec?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Really all of Issuer Services had a terrific showing for the first quarter, mostly off new business wins, as we talked about, we have the number one market position in all three of those businesses. And particularly corporate trust had a pick up in issuance, as well as deposit growth with great expense control. So we had a terrific quarter in Issuer Services.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. When you take a look at the P&amp;L, Ken, by business line, you'll see Karen's businesses had a very nice quarter and Rich also had a very good quarter as well in Pershing.  Anything you'd add, Rich?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Bob. I'd say we had a good quarter in the sense of fixed income trading was very robust. And I would say looking forward, the pipeline is very strong too. It's 20% over what it was a year ago. So I feel very good about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So -- and most of our peers don't have that and frankly that's probably -- I would expect at some level we would probably outperform the debt in this revenue story which is not pleasant this quarter, but it is what it is. Where the over earning was was in Asset Management and Securities Servicing, put it down on the custody side. And that's where it showed up in the P&amp;L when you look at that. Our other businesses are -- continue to be in pretty good shape here. Jim or Tim, is there anything about outlook or pipeline at this point -- and the model?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Bob, I think just a couple of points.  Tim Keaney here. There's actually a little bit of a good news story in here. Year-over-year, with equity markets down 39%, we actually converted in 1.5 trillion in new assets. That's a 6.5% increase in assets under custody, that's a good news story especially when you couple it with the quality. We actually picked up 2% market share in a declining market. In terms of the new business pipeline, Bob, we have about 4 trillion in pipeline, that's up a little over 30% sequentially. We still enjoy a very high new business win rate, about 63%. And as Todd mentioned, we won 335 billion in new wins and converted 371 billion in new conversions into the organization in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have -- I think we are really levered to the upside in both asset management and asset servicing. I love the platform we had, it's just that we're reflecting right now the incredible stress that we've seen in the equity markets. So at some point that's going to turn. As Tim pointed out, the pipeline, I think decisions are being made. They are big, big pipelines, but the decision have been made a little bit slower than typically and that's not surprising, given what's going on out here. But I love our model and it will turn here eventually.</p>

          <p>Hey. I'm sorry if I missed this. But if you could just talk a little bit about the trends in sec lending, I know you indicated that you think we're close to a bottom for the overall organization. Could you just give us your thoughts and color on the sec lending business, both on margins and volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably the best person to do that, Betsy, is Jim <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Betsy, as we've been talking about, Gerald mentioned, and I think appropriately, we really do believe we're at or near the end of the deleveraging process. So that in concert with the market value declines that we've seen, we're actually, our on loan balance at the end of the first quarter was reminiscent going back to as far as 2004, so we clearly have a reset base in the securities lending from an on-loan standpoint. I think that's the bad news. The good news is the pipeline is very strong on securities lending side. We, in fact, added 10 new securities lending clients in the first quarter and we've got a pipeline that includes 83 different prospects for securities lending. So we really think that there is brighter days ahead on the securities lending side and we're looking forward to &#x2013; to reel in some of these new prospects and bring them in as clients.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Betsy, what I would say is, I'll have to be a little careful here, is that it's encouraging, but it's early days. So let's see what happens here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've had about just over 2% of the number of clients in the program actually fully exit. Some have capped their programs, Betsy, and now we're beginning to see some of those caps coming off. But as Bob said, I think it's going to be a slower process as we look ahead over the next few quarters, until we get some more confirmation around the stability of the market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">

          <p>Yeah. It's actually a mix of what you just described, Betsy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the gross margin here, or on the margin on securities lending, I mean clearly part of it had been a function of -- benefited from a function of dislocation and spreads at the short end of the curve. Could you talk a little bit about the margin outlook here for the product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Spreads on a linked basis are actually down over 40% and down about 17% year-over-year. And we would expect that they'll be at or near the levels that they're currently at for a period of time. But we are coming into the international dividend season, so we're seeing a little pickup in the on-loan volumes and we would expect that spreads will widen just a little bit during this period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But the negative drag from LIBOR OIS normalizing, is that pretty much <mark type="inaudible" /> through the pipeline now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think so, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, Bob, just -- I understand that, and <mark type="inaudible" />, so that your view on capital is that you are more than adequately capitalized, but you did cut the dividend. Can you give us a sense as to where you anticipate your capital levels to go, and at what trigger point you might be able to pay back TARP?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have thought it about a bit, Betsy, and the way I think about it is we want to outperform our peers on a competitive basis in everything we do, whether it's revenue growth or long-term shareholder value creation. And so we watch an awful lot of measures, and we are clearly easily first quartile in Tier 1, we're probably number two of the top 20 banks, or something like that, it's -- with or without TARP.</p>
          <p>On TCE, we are -- which I know a lot of people care about, we are median. And so you say, okay, well, let's do a little better than median here. But given our mix of business, I don't think we have to be a lot better. So we will see here. And I think the dividend solution helps shore up that even further. I guess the thing I'm looking for at this point is some evidence of the financial markets being stabilized or improved, because it kind of gets back to my earlier comment that if you exclude OCI from our TCE ratio, we have an awesome TCE ratio. And that is mostly about illiquidity we think. And so most of that is going to come back.</p>
          <p>So I'm looking forward to just the day, whether it's next quarter or a future quarter, where we start to see some slow improvement in the financial markets. If we see it is as sustainable, then good. And that's when we will start to rethink our decision. The key is, we want to give ourselves flexibility in terms of stressed markets, but also in terms of ability to repay TARP when we are allowed, and also in terms of investing organically and inorganically. We're starting to think a little bit more aggressively than we did in the past.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So no bright lines touch, but move up in the rankings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's how I kind of think about it. And if you are watching the financial markets, particularly the debt markets and you're starting to see them improve obviously, that will be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I had a follow-up question. Bob, I heard you guys mention that you think the deleveraging is completed. Could you focus in and share with us, what you mean by deleveraging, obviously a number of the big banks over in Europe have deleveraged and the broker dealers in this country have deleveraged. The consumer and the U.S. borrower hasn't really deleveraged yet. But what do you guys -- when you mention deleveraging, what are you referring to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think -- Gerard, this is Todd. I think there is a couple of areas. Number one, in our sec lending business, part of the deleveraging is coming from the demand side. It's the borrowers of the securities. And as they've brought down their balance sheet to prime brokers, that's been one aspect of the deleveraging. We're also seeing it a little bit on the broker-dealer side. So we're really more discussing here the broker-dealer institutional market, not the consumer market, since that's a space that we really don't play in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the consumer needs to continue to delever.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Art, you might want to add to &#x2013; Art Certosimo, head of our broker-dealer services area, I think could add to what he is seeing -- on the stabilization you're seeing, Art.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I agree with Todd. I think that the way we see that is through the balances and the collateral programs in the global repo markets clearly have declined, not only due to market value but due to specifically this delevering. And we've been able to offset that by continuing to grab market share. But clearly we see the delevering.</p>

          <p>Great. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, thank you everyone for the level of questions. It has continued to be a challenging environment. There's some hopeful signs. On the other hand, it's a challenging time as well. We are working hard on expenses and on capital and continuing to gain market share. And we'll continue to work very hard on your behalf. So thank you for calling in and have a good day.</p>
