          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Ford Motor Company Fixed Income Earnings Conference Call. My name is Katrina, and I'll be your coordinator for today. <mark type="Operator instructions" /> I would now like to turn the presentation over to our host for today's call, Mr. David Dickenson, Fixed Income Investor Relations Manager. Please proceed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Katrina and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to all of you who are joining us either by phone or webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I would like to thank you for spending time with us this morning. With me this morning are Peter Daniel, Ford's Senior Vice President and Controller, K.R. Kent, Ford Credit Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, and Neil Schloss, Ford Vice President and Treasurer. Also with us this morning is David Brandi, Assistant Treasurer, and Mark Kosman, Director of Global Accounting.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I'd like to review a couple of quick items. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the slides we will be using today have been posted on Ford Motor Company's Investor and Media websites for your reference. The financial results discussed herein are presented on a preliminary basis; final data will be included in our form 10-Q for the third quarter 2008. Additionally, the financial results presented here are on a GAAP basis, and in some cases on a non-GAAP basis. Any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are reconciled to their GAAP equivalents as part of the Appendix to the slide deck.</p>
          <p>Finally, today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments here. Additional information about the factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation. These risk factors are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual, quarterly, and current reports to the SEC.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ford Senior Vice President and Controller, Peter Daniel. Peter?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave. I'll begin by reviewing the key financial results for the third quarter on Slide One. As shown at the top of the slide, vehicle wholesales last quarter were about 1.2 million units down 313,000 from the same period in 2007. Ford's third quarter revenue was 32.1 billion, down nine billion from a year ago. The decline reflects lower volume, the sale of Jaguar-Land Rover, unfavorable product mix and lower net pricing, partly offset by favorable changes in currency exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Ford's third quarter pre-tax operating loss from continuing operations, excluding special items, was 2.7 billion, over 2.9 billion worse than a year ago. This reduction included 2.5 billion in Automotive and about 400 million at Financial Services. Our third quarter net loss was 129 million, including over 2.2 billion of favorable pre-tax special items, more than explained by the retiree health care curtailment gain related to the VEBA agreement with the UAW. We entered the quarter with 18.9 billion of cash; this will also be discussed in some detail later.</p>
          <p>Now on to Slide Two, which covers special items in the third quarter. We recorded a charge of 197 million, largely related to hourly and salaried personnel reduction programs in the U.S. Largely offsetting these changes was a 320 gain due to a reduction in the number of personnel and job security benefits reserve, primarily due to the changes in the ACH plan. We also incurred 94 million of charges primarily related to personnel reduction programs in Europe, Australia, and Volvo. Finally, the 2.3 billion improvement near the bottom of the slide primarily represents the curtailment gain related to the VEBA agreement with the UAW.</p>
          <p>Slide Three shows Automotive cash and cash flow. We ended the third quarter with 18.9 billion in gross cash. and our operating related cash flow was 7.7 billion negative in the third quarter, reflecting an Automotive pre-tax loss of 2.9 billion, capital spending during the quarter about 500 million higher than depreciation and amortization, changes working capital and other timing differences of 3.6 billion negative &#x2013; this is primarily explained by lower trade payables as a result of lower production &#x2013; and payments of 700 million to Ford Credit, reflecting our change to upfront parameter subvention. Excluding the upfront subvention payments, our operating cash flow was seven billion negative. I would like to note, however, that this outflow was significantly impacted by a number of unique factors during the quarter, including the decision to reduce truck production to allow for an orderly selldown of dealer inventories to make way for new models.</p>
          <p>Overall, Ford's global third quarter production levels were over 100,000 units below retail sales, and nearly 500,000 units below second quarter levels. This had a substantial impact on profits and the decline in production resulted in about three billion reduction in payables during the quarter. Separation programs resulted in an outflow of 200 million for the quarter, and we contributed 100 million to our non-U.S. pension plans. Ford Credit did not pay Ford a dividend during the third quarter. Including all of these impacts, the total decline in gross cash during the third quarter was 7.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide Four summarizes our net liquidity. Total liquidity, including available credit lines, was 29.6 billion; automotive debt was 26.1 billion. Upon implementation of the independent VEBA, we will contribute debt securities with a face value of 6.3 billion to the trust. We have less than three billion of debt maturities in the next three years.</p>
          <p>Now on to slide five, which shows where we are on our planning assumptions and operational metrics for 2008. Total industry during the first nine months was equal to a SAAR of 14.4 million units in U.S. and 17.2 million units in Europe. Based on the continued deterioration in economic conditions in the U.S. market, we expect that the units will be lower than the outlook that we communicated previously. We are now projecting total industry, including medium and heavy trucks to be about 13.7 million units for the full year. We are also seeing increasing weakness across Europe. As a result, we are now projecting that European full-year industry volumes will be about 16.7 million units.</p>
          <p>On the operational metrics, the quality of our vehicles has risen consistently for four straight years. Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles collectively reduced things going wrong by 7.7%% compared to last year, and as noted earlier, our quality has received important third party endorsements.</p>
          <p>Automotive costs have improved by three billion through the first nine months. We now expect full-year cost reduction should be about four billion globally, including the impact of last quarter's impairment. U.S. market share for the first nine months was 14%,% down 0.7% from the same period a year ago. Absolute operating cash flow during the first nine months was 12.3 billion negative. This was higher than planned, and we continue to expect that full year net outflow to be worse than originally projected. Capital expenditures through the first nine months were 4.7 billion. We expect full year expenditures to be on track with our full-year plan. Overall, as communicated previously, 2008 operating and overall results will be worse than 2007 levels.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand it over to K.R. Kent.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Peter. Slide six shows Ford Credit's operating results and key metrics for the third quarter of 2008. As shown in the top left box, our third-quarter pre-tax profit was $161 million, which was down $385 million from a year ago. Shown below the box, excluding the impact of net gains and losses related to market valuation adjustments to derivatives, pre-tax profits were 185 million, down $156 million from third quarter 2007. The net losses related to market valuation adjustments were about 24 million in the third quarter of 2008 compared to net gains of 205 million in the same period last year.</p>
          <p>You can see in the right box our September 30 managed receivables were $130 billion, down about $18 billion lower than last year and about 10 billion lower than the second quarter. The $18 billion receivables decline is more than explained by lower North American receivables, the impact of divestitures in alternative business arrangements, changes in currency exchange rates, and the second quarter 2008 impairment charge for the North American operating leases. The 10 billion declines in the second quarter primarily reflects lower North American receivables and changes in currency exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Our receivables will continue to decline, primarily reflecting Jaguar, Land Rover, and Mazda transitions to other finance providers, as well as projected industry volume decrease. Charge-offs for managed receivables in the third quarter were $303 million and the worldwide managed loss receivables was 89 basis points, up 35 basis points from last year. I'll speak more about this in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>At September 30, the allowance for credit losses for on-balance sheet receivables was $1.5 billion or 119 basis points of receivables. The allowance was about the same as second quarter, and up about $500 million from a year ago. Also at September 30, our managed leverage was 9.6:1, compared to 10.1:1 at September 30, 2007 and below our 2008 year-end originally planned leverage of 11.5:1. At the end of the third quarter, our equity was about 11.7 billion. Further, we did not pay a dividend to Ford in the third quarter of 2008, and we do not plan to pay a dividend to Ford for the remainder of 2008. In addition, we did not request a third quarter payment from Ford under the terms of the profit maintenance agreement.</p>
          <p>On November 6, 2008, we and Ford entered into an amended and restated support agreement, formerly known as the profit maintenance agreement. Under the terms of the new agreement, if our managed leverage for an accounting quarter is higher than 11.5:1, as reported in our most recent 10-Q or 10-K, then under the agreement we would require Ford to make a capital contribution to us in an amount sufficient to have caused such managed leverage to be 11.5:1, and a copy of this agreement will be filed as an Exhibit to our third quarter 10-Q.</p>
          <p>Slide Seven explains the change in Ford Credit's pre-tax profits for the third quarter compared with the third quarter of 2007. As previously mentioned, pre-tax earnings at Ford Credit were $161 million in the third quarter, about $400 million lower than in 2007. The decrease in earnings primarily reflected the nonrecurrence of net gains related to market valuation adjustments to derivatives, a higher provision for credit losses, and lower volume. These factors were offset partially by higher financing margins. The increase in credit losses primarily reflected higher severities and higher repossessions in the U.S. retail and leased portfolio. Residual losses were about the same in the third quarter of 2008 compared with last year, and we continue to believe &#x2013; or continue to expect auction values to continue to be volatile.</p>
          <p>Both our North American segment and our international segment, which is primarily Europe, were profitable in the third quarter 2008, although at a lower level than in the same period last year. We do expect Ford Credit to incur a pre-tax loss to the second half of 2008, which is expected to be smaller than our first half pre-tax loss of $262 million, excluding the impairment charge.</p>
          <p>Slide Eight shows quarterly terms of charge-offs and loss to receivable ratios for our on-balance sheet and managed portfolios. Top left box shows loss to receivable ratios for the worldwide portfolio; the top right box shows loss to receivable ratios for the U.S. Ford, Lincoln and Mercury retail and leased business. Both the on-balance sheet and managed loss to receivables ratios are up in the third quarter 2008 from the year ago levels, reflecting, primarily, higher severity per unit and higher repossessions in the U.S. retail and leased portfolios. About half of the year-over-year increase is primarily attributable to the significant decline in auction prices for used vehicles.</p>
          <p>Both worldwide and Ford-Lincoln-Mercury third quarter 2008 loss to receivables ratios were up from the second quarter, primarily reflecting higher repossessions and higher severity per unit in the U.S. Consistent with this, managed charge-offs in third quarter 2008 were $303 million, which was up $103 million from a year ago, reflecting the same factors I just mentioned. Third quarter managed charge-offs are well below the historical peak that we last experienced in 2002.</p>
          <p>I move to Slide Nine. This slide shows the primary drivers of the credit losses in the U.S. Ford, Lincoln and Mercury retail and leased business. Repossessions in the third quarter 2008 were 21,000 units, up 2,000 units from the third quarter 2007, and up 3,000 units from the second quarter 2008. Severity of 10,200 in the third quarter was $2,700 higher than last year, primarily due to the overall auction value deterioration in the used vehicle market, along with an increase in the amount financed and higher mix of 72-month contracts. Severity was up $200 than in the second quarter of 2008, primarily reflecting an increase in the amount financed and a higher mix of 72-month month contracts.</p>
          <p>As I previously discussed in the second quarter fixed income call, severity in June was between 10,500 and 10, 600. In September, severity moderated to between 9,900 and $10,000. However, we have seen a lot more auction weakness in the month of October. Over-60-day delinquencies totaled 25 basis points in the third quarter, up 5 basis points from the second quarter 2008. Although still very low, and within our expectations, delinquencies are up 3 basis points from last year. Bankruptcy filings totaled 10,000 in the third quarter; that's up 3,000 compared with the third quarter of 2007, and up 1,000 from the second quarter of 2008. Bankruptcy filings continue at a very low level, but are increasing. The credit quality of our portfolio remains very good, and we continue to monitor closely our key loss metrics for any additional deterioration related to broader trends in the economy.</p>
          <p>I move to Slide 10. This slide shows the lease residual performance for Ford, Lincoln, Mercury U.S. brands. Lease return volumes totaled 39,000 unit in the third quarter; that was down 4,000 compared to the same time last year. Return rates were up five points to 88%,%consistent with auction values that were lower than expected at the time of the contract purchase and a general shift in consumer preferences away from trucks to sport-utility vehicles. In the third quarter, auction values for 24- and 36-month lease vehicles, at constant mix, were down on average about $2,300 per unit and $1,850 per unit respectively from year-ago levels primarily reflecting the overall auction value deterioration in the used vehicle market. Compared with the prior quarter, auction values were actually up in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>These placements continue to shift toward cars and crossovers, and away from full-size trucks and SUVs. In the third quarter, cars and crossovers represented 71% of new placements; that's up 52% in the third quarter and 62% for the second quarter. Our leased portfolio is presently 50% cars and crossovers; that's up from 38% one year ago.</p>
          <p>Our worldwide net investment in operating leases was $25.2 billion at the end of the third quarter; that's down about $4 billion compared with the third quarter of 2007, and that primarily reflects the impairment of certain North American operating leases, as well as lower per-unit acquisition costs reflecting a mix shift in the leased portfolio to cars and crossovers, as mentioned.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Neil.</p>

          <p>Thanks, KR. I'd like to begin today on Slide 11 by discussing the external financing environment. We, like every other finance company, are facing numerous challenges in funding our business. Despite these challenges, we have executed our funding plans, we have maintained our cash balance, and we have increased our liquidity available for use. We achieved this by planned and market-driven reductions in managed receivables, and the successful renewal in some utilization of our committed capacity. As we move forward, there are still many challenges remaining related to the volatile and unpredictable credit markets. Our key concerns include availability of public securitization, unsecured debt, asset-backed commercial paper and hedging instruments.</p>
          <p>Global government-sponsored programs have been announced to help mitigate the present credit crisis. We expect to benefit from these programs, both directly and indirectly in the U.S., Europe, and the rest of the world. In October the U.S. Federal Reserve's commercial paper funding facility was implemented to restore liquidity in the commercial paper markets. The commercial paper funding facility is another tool to help us manage our liquidity. We registered to sell up to 16 billion of asset-backed commercial paper to the commercial paper funding facility, and to date we have utilized about 25% of our capacity under this facility. We have not drawn on our standby FCAR bank liquidity line, and we are beginning to see signs of improvement in the commercial paper market in both demand and tenor.</p>
          <p>In addition to the commercial paper funding facility, FCE, our U.K.-based bank has accessed short-term ECB funding under its open market operations program, the obligations of which are backed by either notes or receivables. To facilitate continued access to the public markets and our ability to renew our committed capacity, we will continue to focus on maintaining the consistency of our funding programs.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 12, as discussed in the prior slide, we have benefited from our diverse funding strategy. Ford Credit's funding strategy remains unchanged, and is centered on maintaining liquidity to meet short-term funding obligations. We will continue to hold a substantial cash balance, utilizing the flexibility we have with our committed funding capacity and private funding sources, as well as accessing the public funds as market allows.</p>
          <p>Our plan includes the renewal of our global committed asset-backed funding capacity, while maintaining diversity of liquidity providers. We will continue to explore and execute alternative business and funding arrangements in those locations where lack of diverse funding capability, while also ensuring that Ford has continued support in these markets, if needed. And finally, as I mentioned previously, we have and continue to use the global government-sponsored liquidity programs as appropriate.</p>
          <p>Slide 13 shows the trends in our funding of our managed receivables. As KR mentioned on the previous slide, at the end of the third quarter managed receivables were 130 billion, down 17 billion from year end 2007, and down 10 billion from the end of the second quarter. We project a further reduction of managed receivables in the fourth quarter, ending the year around 125 billion. We expect our managed receivables will decline further in 2009, as we transition the origination of Jaguar Land Rover and certain Mazda businesses to other finance providers, and as projected industry volumes remain low.</p>
          <p>We ended the quarter with 19.1 billion in cash, including 13.7 billion to support on-balance sheet securitizations. Our year end forecast for cash is 16 to 18 billion, which will provide us flexibility as we enter 2009. Securitized funding was 54% of managed receivables at the end of the quarter, and we expect the funding level from securitized funding will be at the range of 54 to 56% at year end. Since the second quarter we have seen a steady reduction in the balance of the Ford Interest Advantage, our unsecured demand note program. At the end of the third quarter, the FIA balance was 3.7 billion and at October 131, the balance was 2.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide 14 shows our term funding plans for Ford Credit, which does not include our short-term funding programs or our asset sales to our on-balance sheet asset-backed commercial paper program. For 2008, our public term funding plans are in the range of 12 to 15 billion, consisting of 10 to 13 billion of public securitizations, and two billion of unsecured debt. Year to date, we have completed 12 billion of public funding transactions in the U.S. and Europe, including one billion of unsecured transactions in Europe during the third quarter.</p>
          <p>As shown as the bottom of the page, we continue to have substantial private funding sources, in addition to the public markets. These are largely asset-backed securitization programs for retail, wholesale and lease assets in various countries around the world. For 2008, we are forecasting 23 to 26 billion of private funding. Year to date, we have completed 23 billion, including eight billion in the third quarter. Through October 31, we have completed 35 billion, or about 90% of our 2008 term funding plan.</p>
          <p>Our securitization transactions continue to perform within expectations. No transactions have been downgraded and, year to date, rating agencies have affirmed certain ratings on our U.S. lease and wholesale transactions, and have upgraded some of our rated U.S. retail transactions.</p>
          <p>Slide 15 details our liquidity programs and our utilization. The top box shows Ford Credit's committed capacity in our liquidity programs, which include unsecured credit facilities, our FCAR line, our multi-asset facility and conduit capacity. The multi-asset facility is committed to fund multiple asset classes, including U.S. lease, dealer floor plans, and assets that are more difficult to securitize.</p>
          <p>As of September 30, we had 70.5 billion of capacity in cash. After excluding securitization cash and adjusting for available assets, liquidity was 60.3 billion, of which 35.5 billion have been utilized, leaving about 25 billion available for use, given our present level of eligible receivables. This is up about two billion from the second quarter, primarily attributable to the reduction in managed receivables. Our cash that is not related to securitization totaled 14.4 billion at quarter end. In addition, we have 5.5 billion of excess capacity, which provides incremental funding sources for future originations.</p>
          <p>As I discussed earlier, consistent with the overall market, we have seen lower demand and shorter tenor for our asset-backed commercial paper program. In September, we repurchased 2.5 billion of asset-backed securities from FCAR, and used the proceeds to reduce the outstanding commercial paper. Additionally, on September 30, we held 1.1 billion of FCAR commercial paper at Ford Credit, which is not included in the outstanding FCAR balance of 9.8 shown on the slide. About 3.7 billion of the outstanding balance at quarter-end was issued on an overnight basis. We utilized our other committed liquidity programs to fund these actions, therefore compared to the second quarter our available capacity has become more weighted in FCAR, rather than in conduits.</p>
          <p>Through September 30, we have renewed about 22 billion of our committed capacity that came due, including renewal of our 364-day FCAR commitments. We renewed about 6 billion or about 73% of our committed capacity that was up for renewal in the third quarter. This renewal rate is lower than the 90% renewal rate achieved for the first half of the year, and the third quarter renewals were completed at a higher cost. We have about six billion of committed capacity to be renewed in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>In summary on Slide 16, Ford Motor Company had a pre-tax loss, excluding special items, of 2.7 billion. Automotive cash at quarter-end was 18.9 billion. Cash, together with available Automotive credit lines, provided total Automotive liquidity of 29.6 billion. Based on the continued deterioration in economic conditions in the U.S. market, we are now projected total industry, including medium and heavy trucks, to be about 13.8 million units for the full year. In addition, we now expect full-year cost reductions to be about four billion globally, including the impact of last quarter's impairments.</p>
          <p>For Ford Credit, pre-tax profit was 161 million and net income was 95 million. Excluding the net losses related to market value adjustments to derivatives, pre-tax profits were 185 million. External funding environment remains challenging. Ford Credit completed 35 billion of the term funding year to date, about 90% of our plan. Ford Credit's liquidity available for use remains strong, at 25 billion, and committed excess asset funding is 5.5 billion.</p>
          <p>And with that I'll turn it over to David to start the question-and-answer period.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator instructions" />). Your first question comes from the line of Eric Selle, representing JPMorgan. Please proceed.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. A couple of questions. What is your confidence in attaining the ILC [Industrial Loan Company] status this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good question, Eric. We put the application in originally in 2006, then the moratorium came along, we put our application back in February of this year. We have been working with the FDIC going through the application, but it is a process that needs to be completed. The way we look at it, other automotive companies have an ILC, and I think it's a matter of parity, and so our view is we're setting up an ILC that basically meets all the requirements from a safety and soundness perspective, and to be a well-run bank. So I'm assuming it will get done. As far as exact timing, I can't give you that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And assuming you guys get that done, will you guys be able to access the TARP funding, as well as the FDIC-guaranteed of unsecured debt financing through June of next year, or do you think you'll be able to have access to both of those programs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eric, this is Neil. I don't believe that TARP access comes with the ILC. There are other FDIC programs, including the liquidity guarantee facility. That is a separate approval process with the FDIC that, at this point, we're looking at, but again the important thing is getting the ILC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I believe you guys mentioned 11.5 times leverage agreement. If not, you're going to see the profit maintenance agreement turn on. Is that discretionary, or is it going to be contractual?</p>

          <p>It's an actual contract that we'll file with the 10-Q. Effectively, what we tried to look at was that the prior agreement was basically a profit-only focus, and every time we've gotten in a situation where we had to evaluate whether we needed to make a demand on that agreement, we'd go back to it and we'd look at all the right things &#x2013; our liquidity, our leverage, our equity levels, our asset projections. And last couple of quarter, since we have a leverage that is substantially below what we think is a real good ongoing target leverage amount, coupled with the fact that we have very good liquidity at this point in time, we didn't make demand payments. So what we decided to do was to change it over into more of a net worth maintenance concept, which would be under the 11.5:1 managed leverage, and if we drop below that &#x2013; above that &#x2013; we could make demand. And the whole thing hinges around Ford Credit making the demand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that, obviously, will hinge on the 1.5 billion of dividends that you guys are planning over the next few years, and that will be flexed according to that leverage as well, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, our goal is to manage the business. As we drop receivables over time, as I talked about earlier, if you had a chance to listen to the earlier call, with Jag, Land Rover moving away, Mazda moving away, coupled with the U.S. industry and maybe European industry weakness, our receivables levels are going to drop over the next few years, and so that will free up capital. So our goal here is basically keep the credit company well funded, keep our liquidity high enough, and to pass back dividends to the parent company, at the same time obviously not violating the 11.5:1, staying below that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you guys aren't giving a managed AR goal for next year yet, are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The only thing &#x2013; I can give you a little perspective. We'll end the year about 125 billion. If you think about what's all in our portfolio and what's going away, between Mazda and Jag Land Rover, there's about 18, 19 billion of receivables. Now, it takes time for that to wind its way out, but that will start to move away. And the real, I'll call it the wild card, is a little bit about what happens to the industry volume sales and our penetration. We don't plan to reduce our penetration dramatically, or anything, but what happens to the industry volumes. And you could see some of that coming through, like in the third quarter. We've dropped 10 billion of receivables from the end of the second quarter. Six of it was North America really being driven by the industry, and the other four was exchange-related translation. We saw a substantial drop just in the quarter from the standpoint that the industries are down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that 18 to 19, kind of a 2.5 year roll-off is a decent assumption there?</p>

          <p>And then finally, I know I'm asking a lot of questions, it's been a busy day. Manheim just came out &#x2013; obviously an October number that obviously credit has loosened up since that number. But do you guys agree with me, in that that's a one-month impact due to this credit freeze, and that as credit &#x2013; or if and does thaw up, you should see that come back? Basically are you guys thinking that we're at peak loss per unit due to the Manheim and other series?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Eric, I wish I had a crystal ball on that one. I don't know what's credit-driven and what's just pure demand-driven. We saw the same thing in October. We saw residual values, auction values, drop for our leases and repossessed vehicles that came back during the month of October. I hope it's the bottom, but I'm not that good to actually declare I think it's a bottom at this point in time. I will tell you, you remember back from the second quarter when we did the impairment on North American leases, we actually expected that auction values would deteriorate during the third quarter. They actually improved a bit. And so we're &#x2013; in October we're right where we originally thought we would be. So going forward, it's your guess is as good as mine.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys, got a few quick questions. Just more along the lines on this profit maintenance agreement, what is the reasoning behind the change, I'm just curious? Is it giving Ford more flexibility? Tell us why exactly you decided to update it and change it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I was mentioning to Eric, it was really driven around that, when you get into it, when we had the impairment we could have made a demand under the profit maintenance agreement. But then when you look at where we stand from all the credit metrics, where we stand on the balance sheet, the equity levels we have, the leverage level we have, the liquidity levels we have, it wouldn't have really made sense to make a demand, because we obviously turned around and paid back a dividend, because we were in good shape and we still are in good shape. So the view was to re-look at the profit maintenance agreement. We hadn't made a demand, I think, since 1981, hadn't been looked at that closely, and we decided then that maybe what we should do is focus more around what you would see in a regulatory framework call it, a net worth maintenance level, and that's why we made the change, to focus on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And with respect to &#x2013; changing topic, with respect to what you talked about with the working capital on the earnings call, can you give us a framework for maybe the severity of fourth quarter just &#x2013; it sounds like you're not going to have as big a use, but I guess the question is, the payables falling so much, is any of that attributable to, perhaps, you having to support some of your &#x2013; some of the Tier Two or Tier Three suppliers that might be having troubles? Is any of that baked into what happened in third quarter, maybe what may happen again in fourth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, none of it is really related to any changes in payable terms. It's really a function of the production reductions. And we think there will be further payable reduction in the fourth quarter, primarily because of the timing of the production cuts: as we cut our production now it's coming out in the last month, so it's primarily, most of it's coming out in December, so that will have an impact on payables as well. So we would expect fourth quarter still to have some negative cash flow, but it won't be as bad as the third.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>Great. And last question, just with respect to slide 39 on your earnings call slide that you have, you lay out the plan to save 14 to $17 billion in cash. Any chance -obviously it doesn't sound like today, but maybe you could provide, when you put out the Q, just more clarity on the different buckets on how much you think you could save, like for example, other than the CapEx, on the operating side, maybe how much you think you can save through reductions in inventory and structural costs. Is there any color you can give us there, on those buckets?</p>

          <p>Hi. I just wanted to clarify something on the ILC. Did you say that you thought if you got the ILC you could have access to the FDIC guarantees for the debt program, or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I said was there are programs that the FDIC has that, if you are an ILC you can apply for. It's a separate approval process, the best we understand, and then it's at the discretion of the FDIC of whether or not they approve it or not.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But are there programs for ILC vis-&#xE0;-vis guaranteeing unsecured debt from September through June of next year? I thought maybe you had to be a bank holding company to do that.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the temporary liquidity guarantee facility does work for ILCs as well, but it is a separate approval process that requires the FDIC to approve it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Gotcha. And then I don't know &#x2013; I was jumping off to look at the GM numbers, too &#x2013; I don't know if you addressed this. On the 11.5, should we look at that number that's in the new agreement as not necessarily a number that you're going to get to, or how should we think about how the 11.5 was arrived at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me give a little perspective on that, Monica. We talked about this in the past what we think the appropriate leverage is, I call it under normal circumstances, when it's easy to fund the business and so on. If you look at our balance sheet, you look at the riskiness of our assets, we believe the appropriate leverage would be about 13:1. What we've done is backed it off a bit to 11.5:1 to provide a little bit of flexibility to maintain some funding for us. And then going forward, I think at the end of third quarter we were at 9.6:1, and in all likelihood with the reduction in receivables, coupled with whatever we do pay out in the dividend, it's going to be at that or lower than that level, the 9.6. I don't think we're going to be approaching the 11.5:1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When you say lower, meaning in the fourth quarter, or what do you mean in terms of timeframe? Are you saying lower than the 9.6?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will be about the same for the end of the year, but it will be lower going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. And in terms of the residual, the Manheim numbers, because obviously they look pretty bad sequentially. Can you just refresh us on the lease book again, because this time it looks like cars took a sequential hit. Can you give us a refresh on the, break down the lease book in terms of the cars versus SUVs, trucks? And then in terms of &#x2013; I know you had said at the last call that you'd really marked the residuals at July levels, and at the end of June you'd actually marked it just a little bit worse to the end of the year. Would that also apply to cars, or is that more of just an SUV truck notion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the last part there, it was both cars and trucks. Trucks were obviously a little bit worse than cars that we expected to decline through the summer months. Typically as the model year gets older the auction values decline. Again, back to our more normal circumstances but these aren't exactly normal times right now.</p>
          <p>As far as the portfolio split right now, I don't actually have what the split of the portfolio, I'm sorry. I've got placements we did 71% cars and crossovers in the third quarter, and 29% trucks. I'd be guessing if I had the real split, but I think it's somewhere about 50/50 right now, 50% cars and crossovers, 50% trucks and SUVs.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the last question is in terms of, I know you've been exploring through the year JVs and alternative business arrangements; I know you touched upon it. Are you very actively focusing on other means to even incrementally shrink balance sheet more, or is it going along the normal pace?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, guys. I had a question on FCAR and the Fed's CP program. What's the long term view? Are you looking to tap that CP program throughout '09, as long as it stays available, and take utilization of FCAR down a lot? And what's the net increase in liquidity there? Could we think you've got double that CP liquidity now, or is it kind of one for one? I just want to understand that better.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't think you can &#x2013; it's not a one for one change. Because I think our strategy with FCAR and use of the program is to continue to place as much as we can externally to investors and we've seen a good demand of that since the program was created both in both demand and tenor. So we're using the CPFF program to be more of a balance, and as a backstop to that program. We only have about 10 billion outstanding under CP today. We said we have about four billion with the government today. We have 16 available. So to the extent that we wanted to put more assets in there, so it really acts as a backstop that we can increase the program, put more to the government. But our objective continues to be to sell the program to investors.</p>

          <p>And then do you expect to see any capacity reductions when those roll? If so, how much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we have built in, with the asset plan, we have built a balanced expectation from the standpoint of our ability to renew. I think the credit markets are clearly tight. We have a very diverse group of banks providing us that capacity. Each of them have sort of different needs and different objectives, and we work with them to facilitate the renewal of all these facilities.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And lastly, on Slide 10, it talks to the auction values ticking up a little bit in Q3. My understanding, just from talking to some industry people, is they have fallen off a cliff in October, not only in terms of dollar prices but also the volumes that are actually auctioned. I was wondering if you could comment if you're seeing anything like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jeff. I mentioned earlier we did see a dropoff in the month of October. We saw improvements all summer long, through the end of the third quarter, and then in October it has dropped off rather dramatically from where we ended up during middle of summer. So I'm not quite sure what's driving it. We've seen, I don't know if you've ever heard of a term called No Sale, where you go to the auction and you either don't get a bid or it's not good enough, so you bring the vehicle around and send it back through the lane a day later or later that day. The No Sales have increased as well, which all gets back to just flat out auction weakness right now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as I mentioned earlier, when we did the impairment in the second quarter, we actually expected the summer months to be worse than what it turned out to be. October's turned out to be only slightly worse than what our expectation was, so we had good news through the summer months, a little bit bad in October. We do an adequacy study every quarter, where we go through and reestablish what we think the auction value will be over time: we completed one at the end of the third quarter as part of our closing of our books. We looked at it again in October. I think we're well covered at this point in time. But again, I want to point out that there's a lot of volatility out there. And it's hard to predict where it's really going to end up.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I have three quick questions for you. Can you discuss what kind of financial support Ford Motor Credit and FCE Bank can expect from the European government? And a related question, is FCE Bank able to take advantage of the U.K. or other European government guarantees on debt issues in the future? And finally, what did FCE Bank do with the eight million proceeds it obtained from two bond issuances in August and September 2008? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the first two questions are really centered around government support, and what they've done and FCE Bank has access to the ECB facility, the short-term facility backed by assets and/or notes, and they've used that. And they've been using &#x2013; at least one of the programs in Germany has been using that for several years, although a relatively small amount and we will continue to use those programs as we go forward.</p>
          <p>I'm not aware of any existing programs that exist today that would support FCE Bank from a standpoint of guarantee, although there's been a lot of discussion in the U.K. specifically, for banks and we're continuing to evaluate those as we go forward. And as far as the use of proceeds, it's like any other fund raising that we do: it's used for general business purposes, it helps refinance debt coming due, and help to fund new assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you can't tell us whether it was used to repay intercompany debt or external debt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's part of a funding plan that, just the unsecured debt that they raise is part of, also, a bunch of securitizations that they do, and so the inflows from sources of cash is fungible to then pay off maturing debt and originate new assets. We don't raise money specifically to either repay debt or fund new assets.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Richard Murawczyk of Knott Partners. It seems to me the new profit maintenance agreement is far less valuable to Ford Credit than the one which was in place for many years. Did Ford Credit obtain any payment in exchange for making the modification to the agreement, and if they didn't, why not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was no payment that went with the change. I'll be honest, I disagree with your supposition, because it before was literally just a profit agreement, whereas I firmly believe that a net worth, or a leverage agreement is much more valuable to the company. It does provide support for the company, as opposed to a profit agreement, which doesn't necessarily provide the same sort of support.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For Fairlawn Capital, Three very quick questions. With regards to the six billion in bank lines that are coming due for renewal in the fourth quarter, is it still the case that in the event that you are unable to get those lines to roll, you can draw them down and term out the financing of eligible receivables that you would pledge to those facilities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. With regards to the private transactions that you had executed in the third quarter, if I look at -- the figure on Slide 14 from this third quarter report shows a year to date total of 23 billion in private transactions that have been done. The same slide from the second quarter shows a total of 11 billion year to date having been done. That looks to me like there is 12 billion of private transaction activity in the third quarter, as opposed to the eight that you mentioned. Can you reconcile the difference?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One quarter, one year to date. Sorry let's get a little goofy here. I think when we typically show our term funding plan, we typically show it as a year to date number and I think it is through the second quarter it would have been late July, the year to date number, and through the third quarter it's really an October, end of October number and the eight billion, I think, is just third quarter itself.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see, so that would include some activity then that occurred in October, subsequent to the end of that third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The second quarter number would have included some of the data, some of the transactions that actually happened in the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand. Okay. Very well. And then again, can you explain what you have done with regards to FCAR utilization in this quarter? I'm a little bit confused as to the cash movements, and really perhaps the motivation for reducing utilization under FCAR, and then the holding of commercial paper on Ford Motor Credit's balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just set the dates. This was at the end of the third quarter, and it was prior to any of the government facilities. So the CPFF facilities didn't exist at the end of September, and as we were going through August and September, there was obviously, as you well know, significant pressure on the commercial paper markets globally from a standpoint of both demand and tenor. A lot more CP was being done overnight. So as a result of that, in the middle of September we made the decision to take the program down in size, and as a result we used some of our conduit capacity to fund the ability to buy back some of the FCAR securities, or the securities within FCAR to the extent of 2.5 billion, and we used proceeds from other transactions to do that, which then used to pay down CP that was coming due. So we intentionally took the program size down by 2.5 billion, and then at quarter-end, we had $3.7 billion that was overnight, and we also &#x2013; not included in the 9.8 was 1.1 billion that Ford Credit purchased with its own cash. So the 9.8 that you see on the slide, 3.7 of that was overnight, and then on top of that, Ford Credit had 1.1 billion on its own balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In other words, the 9.8 was issued to external investors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In October we have utilized four billion of the CPFF facilities.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Further reducing the utilization of the FCAR facility? .</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, just replacing some of the very short-term maturities, so the stuff that was rolling overnight with 90 day term CP.</p>

          <p>And, David, before we end, let me just fix one number that was on the last summary slide, Slide 16 had a total industry projection of 13.8 million units for the full year in '08; the correct number should be 13.7.</p>
