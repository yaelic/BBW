          <p>Good morning everyone. As you know we are now going to be presenting the Results for Second Quarter. Jose Ignacio Goirigolzarri, President and COO will be giving us a presentation, after which we will be taking questions first of all from the room here, and then we'll be taking questions that come over the conference call. And then finally, we'll take questions from the webcast as we always used to do.</p>
          <p>Anyone who is actually here can get to coffee with us afterwards, but it won't be in the room next door, because we have got the photography exhibition there. So we will have to go up to the floor above.</p>
          <p>Many thanks. I now give the floor to Jose Ignacio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone. First of all, many thanks being here today with us. And I would like to rectify something. Also this is in the way a precedent -- Manuel said that you are going to be invited to a coffee here, and you can have a little coffee with us on the first floor. But actually, you can have a big coffee with us on the first floor, so if you want -- sorry about that Manuel, you don't normally get things wrong. But I think we can now present our results.</p>
          <p>This is a presentation, which will be divided as we always do. To give you a global view and a standardized view, so that you can make a comparative analysis more easily. So we'll start with an overview of the Group, and then we will analyze each of the business units into which the Group is structured. So in global terms, the first half results of &#x2013; well, it's up to you to judge this, seem to me, at least. Today, yet again, a way of setting the BBVA apart from its competitors next years.</p>
          <p>In a half year in which the environment, as you well know, has been frankly rather complex. And yet we are being set apart. Now, why is that? There are three reasons. First of all, because we are growing very strong in earnings.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we have really sound balance sheet, very powerful balance sheet and thirdly we are delivering on the strategic initiatives that we have announced on our Investment Day.</p>
          <p>So let's start with income statement. You can see that we've got very strong growth rates in our revenues and we are continuing to significantly improve our cost income ratio Look at our strong balance sheet, we'll continue to give you data on the excellent liquidity position we have, our very sound capital position and the very sound asset management that we are carrying out.</p>
          <p>As I have said, we are delivering on our strategic initiatives that we announced to you at Investor's Day. There I wanted to refer to two aspects. First of all transformation and innovation plan, and then secondly what's going on with agreement with CITIC Group in China.</p>
          <p>So what's behind my statement? You can see it here if you look at what's being happening to attributable profit, without one-offs in all different quarters up to know. Yet again, this quarter we are hitting record attributable profit. The growth, as you can see, is 11.6%, and in constant euros, that's in local currencies, it's an even bigger growth, which will be 17.4%.</p>
          <p>I think it's especially significant to say that this growth in the attributable profit stems from the very first line in the income statement, because we are generating revenues. Yet again -- this quarter we are generating revenues so that our net interest income is growing 23.2% and our ordinary revenues are growing at 21.2%. Therefore, yet again, we can say that revenues are the foundations of the growth in our operating profit and our attributable profit. This growth in revenues is being made compatible with very outstanding control on costs. Here you can see the quarter-on-quarter figures. They are on the left of the slide. And you can see the quarter-on-quarter our expenses again down. As a consequence of this very strong generation of revenues, alongside this cost control, our cost-income ratio has improved yet again, and now stands at 40.1%. And we are continuing to improve on an ongoing track which will take us to the target that we gave you, which is to bring us to below 35% by 2010. So, with that happening in revenues and that happening in expenses, the growth of our operating profit without one-offs is 12.8%.</p>
          <p>I think we should use this to point out that this growth can be seen in each and every one of the different areas. I am not going to talk very much about this slide. Because later on we will be talking about each of the areas in much more detail. But nonetheless, the generation of earnings and of recurrent revenues above all can be seen in all the different areas of our Group.</p>
          <p>Alongside that, we are also actively managing our asset quality. On the left, you can see something and you probably want to see this over time, what's been happening to our NPL ratio. In June NPL ratio is 1.15% for the Group as a whole, with the coverage ratio of 166%. You can compare that and see how well it compares against the ratios reported for NPL and coverage by our European peers. More important still, behind this NPL ratio, we have got a very sound balance sheet, because we have a high loan loss provisions of &#x20AC;7.8 billion of which 74% are generic. In fact in this quarter, once again, we've increased our generic funds, our generic provisions.</p>
          <p>So alongside that performance in earnings, we've also got a very strong balance sheet, is also saying, which is not only based on our loan loss provisioning which I've already talked about, but also the fact that we are very strong capital position, our core capital is 6.3%, yet again and our Tier-I is 7.7%. And I should remind you as it says here that are unrealized capital gains and our surplus generic provisions over expected losses are also very healthy figures, as you can see here.</p>
          <p>On the right, you can see a comparison against our European peers, or big European banks. We wanted to give you this comparison on the basis of very simple ratio, the ratio that at the end of the day, says what our tangible equity is, and how that compares against the assets, we have. And as you can see, our situation is a very powerful one, and same could be said about our liquidity position. We've already informed you on other occasions about the fact that we have a very strong liquidity position, because we managed to anticipate what was gonna happen last year.</p>
          <p>You also know that we are not involved in anything using conduits or sieves or anything like that. So, here we've given the comparison against our European peers to give you a more clear idea about where we stand. And our wholesale funding requirements are very different from those of our European peers. For two reasons; first of all, because of the size of our balance sheet, the pure size of the assets that we have. And secondly, because we're much smaller in relative terms. So the ratio between the deposits and the total assets, actually means, that we're at the very top of the ranking table compared against our European peers, so very sound liquidity position. At the end of the day, what we are presenting is results without one-offs, which you could see here.</p>
          <p>Operating profit 12.8% growth, and in constant euros, or local currencies, which is what really explains the clout we have when we generating these kinds of profits, then that figure will be 18.8% in attributable profit of 11.6%. And if we give that in local currencies, the figure would be 17.4% growth in attributable profit.</p>
          <p>So, we can say that we are a profitable group. And yet again, we are creating value as we do on a recurrent basis. Here you can see what's happening to economic profit to ROC and our basic returns. And that's why last month our Board decided to make a 10% increase to do the interim dividend to be paid out against the first quarter.</p>
          <p>So, if you can see here and as I said at the beginning, we're presenting results for the Group as a whole, which are tremendously strong, based on the generation of revenues, whilst improving efficiency on the basis of a very sound and very powerful balance sheet.</p>
          <p>But apart from that, as I said at the beginning, we are also delivering the results of the strategic initiatives that we've informed you about a year ago. A year ago, we were talking about our transformation and innovation plan. And the year ago, we were saying that, really -- what we were saying was, I think extraordinary change in our environment.</p>
          <p>In terms of what our customers were demanding of us on the one hand and then what IT makes possible on the other, and we said that was going to have an impact, or already was having impact on all the elements in the value change -- chain, sorry. And we've said that that was why we were going to be launching these plans of transformation and innovation. And we've had very many initiatives, the latest one was t&#xFA; cuentas, which was providing a personal account manager which would come up with very strong personalized suggestions for our customers.</p>
          <p>But apart from the innovation plan, I also wanted to talk about our transformation plan. Our transformation plan has an impact on all the different units in the Group and next quarter, when we present the third quarter results, I'd like to give you a more detailed analysis of what's been happening in the transformation plan. How it's being rolled out in all the different business areas in the Group.</p>
          <p>But today, I'm just going to focus on Spain and Portugal. For some time we've been reporting the measures that we've been taking up over the last few quarters to you. We were talking about the internal reorganization, about how we were going to reduce the intermediate structures, how we were going to really change our distribution network, in order, first of all to be able to improve the quality of our service in our customer care, and secondly, bring down the cost base that we have in Spain and Portugal.</p>
          <p>What I can tell you today under COC as we continue, we've got an additional charge because of early retirements of &#x20AC;417 million after tax that would be considerably less, just 329 million, which gives us very high returns. So net annualized savings is &#x20AC;43 million and net present value for the first six months would be very positive, 372 million.</p>
          <p>The other aspect that I wanted to talk about with respect to our strategic plan, with the -- well, two months ago we announced an initial understanding with CITIC, which would increase our holding both in the Mainland bank and in the Hong Kong bank. And I can remind you of these figures, which Manuel gave you at our conference call. This is an operation, which is going to be accretive right from the very first year. We think that this is of extraordinary importance for all of us.</p>
          <p>Whatever the case, these are the charges and the credits, which have to be made for one-offs. What we had last year in the first half of 2007 and the ones that we've booked through the first half of 2008, as you can see along with the contribution of the Bradesco divestment, which processing capital gains of 727 million.</p>
          <p>We've also got a charge for early retirements of 470 million before tax. That's very important, to say before tax, which means that there is a significant change in our attributable profit figure between what we had in the first half and the second half of the year. So that the published accounts that we've with one-offs look like this. However, we would like to with you with respect to our more recurrent business and what's happening to our performance without one-offs. So that's what's happening in the Group. And I think it really shows how strongly we are growing and how very sound our balance sheet is. And I hope that now you'll allow me to give you an analysis of each of the business units.</p>
          <p>We are going to start with Spain and Portugal. In Spain and Portugal, the Spanish market above all is showing quite a fast slowdown rather faster than we had expected, but given this slowdown I think for BBVA Group is really managing things in way that sets it apart. We've been set apart because of the very tidy we are managing the slowdown, focusing very clearly on our pricing policies. We are being set apart because we're focusing on improving efficiency and we are focusing on managing risks.</p>
          <p>Here once again, I want to give you the reasons why I feel able to make these statements. What's happening to our business volumes? Here you can see the year-on-year growth figures for the most important items, lending is growing 7.1% and customer funds on our balance sheet 9.3% and our market shares look very positive.</p>
          <p>Although that's not a priority for us, in absolute terms, because our first priority is to manage pricing. And in price management, I'd say that our Group here in Spain and Portugal is showing excellent performance both in terms of customer spreads and in terms of net interest income over average total assets.</p>
          <p>And that pricing policy, it's really what explains why our net interest income is growing as you can see here at 12.7%. This performance in our net interest income which is doing comparatively very well along with our fee income, gives us ordinary revenues growing 8.9% in Spain and Portugal.</p>
          <p>But here we have to compare what's happening to our revenues and compare what's happening to our expenses. As I've said before, our expenses are growing negatively at the moment, 1.4% in Spain and Portugal from 0.4%, that would be 0.4% for our retail networks in Spain. And that figure will continue to go down over the next two quarters.</p>
          <p>And that really supports what we've being saying that our efficiency is improving. Our cost-income ratio was already said 30.6% and this makes it possible for us to have an operating profit growing at 13%. I am sorry, that figure was 35.6% for the cost-income ratio.</p>
          <p>And now you can see what's happening to our NPL's. In order to be able to see how we compare against other Spanish businesses, we're talking about domestic businesses here with a rate of 1.1%. Although here you've also got the coverage ratio for Spain and Portugal as a whole. In terms of impairment losses there we've got an increase of 22.8%. Here I'd like to explain first of all that volume of our generic funds, our generic provision such as, and say that here in Spain our generic provisions, the domestic businesses have -- had positive endowments.  And the second quarter we've been allocating &#x20AC;90 million of generic funds, which will now be included in the impairment losses item.</p>
          <p>So, understanding all these factors, here in Spain and Portugal, we are seeing our attributable profit go up 15.5%, whilst we improve our return-on-equity which was -- is  37.3%. So this is the income statement with the whole cascade of the different items in Spain and Portugal as I was saying before.</p>
          <p>It seems to me that Spain and Portugal are doing an excellent job in terms of the way they are managing the slowdown in business volumes whilst having an excellent management of pricing, and improving cost-income ratio on the ongoing basis whilst managing asset quality very well against the current rather gloomy backdrop that we have here.</p>
          <p>Now, I move on to Wholesale Banking and Asset Management and there, yet again this quarter, we're presenting excellent results. Recurrent revenues even in an environment which as you know is especially negative, for this kind of business in this environment, however, we've got good news both in terms of our large customers and what's going on in markets for treasury. Our treasury department doing global customers and investment banking.</p>
          <p>We are showing a very strong growth because we are taking advantage of these situations in the market, and a very sound balance sheet, to grow very selectively with customers that are going to generate cross-selling because of their geographical positioning. This growth in lending means that we have also got a growth in net interest income, which is what you can say here.</p>
          <p>Looking at Global Markets, yet again this quarter I've got good news, and for me it is a point of great satisfaction because it justifies what we've been saying to you for some time now that our Global Markets and Distribution business is very close to customers. 70% of our revenues come from customer relationships, which means that we got recurrent revenues, which in terms means that the risks that we are taking on board are much lower than those of our competitors. Anyway, as you can see here the ordinary revenues are growing quarter-on-quarter -- no, half year-on-half year -- sorry -- 28.9% after having grown 28.4% half year-on-half year last year.</p>
          <p>So great six months for this area. Operating profit going up 17.3% including the global businesses portfolio, we have in the Americas, which is booked to this area internally. Our net attributable profit is growing 25.5%. This means we've improved our efficiency. The cost-income ratio getting better, our return-on-equity going down 2.5 percentage points. So here is the overall income statement. As I've said, revenues are going up with the operating profit growing 17.3%, and attributable profit growing at 25.5%.</p>
          <p>Consequently, as I was saying before, I think it's been a great half year for our wholesale banking and asset management area, excellent news, above all, because of the capacity to generate recurrent earnings in this area, which is based on our strategic vision of the market.</p>
          <p>Now Mexico, I think there are two things we have to bear in mind, when we talk about Mexico. First of all, what's happening to the Mexican economy? The Mexican economy in the first two quarters has performed very well. And has shown that it really is decoupling from what's going on in the US economy. Then secondly, the positioning of Bancomer. Bancomer is the leader in the market in Mexico for its balance sheet and for its earnings. So yet again this quarter as you will be seeing when you look at the results and then the results of our peers, Bancomer is outperforming the rest of the market. It's really taking advantage of the good economic situation to boost its volumes whilst controlling its costs and setting itself apart from its peers with respect to its asset quality.</p>
          <p>Let me explain what's behind this statement then. First of all when we look at business volumes, you can see that lending is growing 20 -- over 27%, whilst customer funds are growing at 15.7%. So really this is very strong growth. And in the case of lending, we are continuing to change our loan book mix, which is something we announced to you some quarters back. And as we've said when we talked about this mix change, it would mean -- has meant that we've improved our customer spreads and our net interest income over ATAs, which means that the net interest income for Bancomer has grown 15.9% with core revenues growing 13.5%.</p>
          <p>However, I was saying to you that apart from the fact that revenues are really growing buoyantly in Bancomer, because we have good volumes and good pricing. At the same time, if you look at expenses, Bancomer, despite the fact that its bringing in a tremendous amount of new customers and new business is still managing to control its costs and will continue to do so over forthcoming quarters.</p>
          <p>And on the right, you can see what's happening in year-on-year terms with respect to its expenses and with that combination of revenues and expenses once again we're improving our efficiency. This cost-income ratio is now at 31.7% and that means that we can grow our operating profit at 24.3% as you can see here on the left.</p>
          <p>In terms of risks, here you can see what's happening to the NPL ratio. It's been very stable over the last four quarters. Our coverage ratio is 227% and our impairment losses which is really provisions which as we said in the past, are very much in line with the kind of growth we're seeing on net interest income.</p>
          <p>And another thing that I want to make very clear, is that really if you compare the performance of the asset quality that Bancomer has against its peers there, if you look at its asset quality Bancomer's is definitely very much better, which gives us an attributable profit growing over 20%, 20% in the bank itself, but also in pensions and insurance which means that our income statement looks like the one you can see on the screen. It is a magnificent income statement with operating profit growing 24.3%, and net attributable profit growing slightly above 20%.</p>
          <p>Consequently, in Mexico we can see, say the economic situation is a lot better than some people expected. The economic situation is being taken advantage of by Bancomer to generate revenues and at the same time rollout the measures to improve efficiency and improve asset quality, something that we announced to you some time back that we're going to do.</p>
          <p>Now, we can talk about United States. In the United States, I'd like to remind you of two elements, that make us rather different from other banks. First of all, the excellent position of the BBVA Group in the United States. The way that performance of the markets that we are operating in, is so different from that of others, in macroeconomic terms as well. If you look at the levels of growth of the markets that we are operating in from Compass, you can see that they are outperforming the average for the US, significantly. And we're a different case from other banks because we're talking about integration here, where we are managing to get a lot of synergies that we expected to get when we announced to the market and you see that we have managed to do them. And we are growing in activity with higher business volumes that make us very satisfied.</p>
          <p>But let's start with our strategic positioning. As you know, as we have often said when talking to you, we've got 50% approximately of our portfolio in Texas, slightly over 50%, that's right. And if we add Texas and Alabama, we'd be talking 75% of our portfolio. While in Texas, especially in Texas, but in the markets that we are operating in general, if we look at the macroeconomic performance indicators, and as you can see on the slide, the performance is much better than that of the rest of the US, or the US average.</p>
          <p>Look at housing prices in Texas, they are not dropping, or at all. In fact in year-on-year change terms, they are increasing and the same will be true in Alabama. And that's something that markets now recognized. If you compare what's happening to the listed price of Texan banks or the Texan industrial companies against the average industries in the US, as you can imagine, the market distinguishes between the macroeconomic performance, which is so much better in Texas.</p>
          <p>But anyway, let's start with the beginning. As you all know, we've got our integrated plan, and we are now rolling it out and we are on time. We are sticking to the deadlines with very strong discipline. We've finish the migration of the first bank's platform, we'll be migrating the second bank which would be TSP on the 20 -- on the 31st of August. And in November as we've already said we will completely finish the integrating process. We will have all four banks on one single platform, which would generate synergies as it already has done. I'll remind you that when we presented the deal, when we talked about our potential to generate synergies, we are talking about $300 million, we are talking about $100 million in the first year. And as you can see, we've managed to do better than what we'd expected in the first five months. And we've also decided that in the second half of the year and the beginning of the following year we will be getting Umbrella brand which will be BBVA Compass. Apart from integration, I was also saying, that we've seeing that we are able to generate business volumes on an upward scale. Here you can see what's happened to our growth figures for lending and for customer funds lending. As you can see on the screen, this coming in with very high quality assets not better than the back book that we had in Compass which is generating a margin, here you can see what's happening to ordinary revenues and what's happening to our total cost, excluded the depreciation of intangibles, taking into account, we've had some extraordinary charges which we were expecting to have, because of the merger and integrating costs.</p>
          <p>Our operating profit in Compass is continuing to grow. And our efficiency is mirrored in the cost income ratio, which is coming to levels which are much more in keeping with the averages in the Group as a whole.</p>
          <p>In risks, you can see what's happening here, what's happening to our NPL ratio. And here, I want to distinguish between what's happening to the NPL ratio, with and without Jacksonville. Jacksonville, if you know is an issue that we've talked about with you. We always informed you what was going on from the very moment, we brought Compass into our books, and we're focusing on that very clearly as that issue is separate from everything else. Without that, the gross in the coverage ratio, would give us 116 excluding Jacksonville. And with, though we know exactly what's going on there, and the ROE that we're getting would be close to 25%.</p>
          <p>So to explain why Jose would say everything I've said so far, I think we have to analyze each one of the different quarters. And here you can see that in the second quarter, we're generating ordinary revenues which are much better than previous quarters. And general costs are under control especially if you take into account what's happening to the merger and integration costs, which were already planned for. I have to repeat that and in terms of synergies as well, we are definitely coming up with the goods we were expecting to get, which why our operating profit is growing as it is and with loan loss provision, and it's growing as I explained before, we get a net attributable profit, which really indicates the cruising speed which we announced you some months back that we would get.</p>
          <p>As the point of reference for the third and fourth quarter, we think that the loan loss provision again to be at very similar levels that what we've been reporting in the second quarter. We don't think there will be any big increases in our loan loss provisions. And our policy is to have very proactive management to keep on analyzing all the different Compass loan books to see exactly what's going on and we do know what's going on.</p>
          <p>So, we are rolling out the plans as we said we would. And we are managing the benefits from the fact that the markets where we are operating are outperforming other American markets.</p>
          <p>So now I come to the fifth big unit in the Group. South America as you know, South America has a very favorable economic environment and more and more people are using banking services now. And the bank has realized this, let's take the advantage of the phenomenon, which means that our business volumes are growing very strongly with significant improvements in our efficiency here in South America and at the same time we are controlling the quality of our assets.</p>
          <p>You can see how dynamic our activity is. We're continuing to increase our lending and our customer funds. This is quite significant, if you look at the year-on-year growth figures, which means that we're generating revenues and as you can see here our net interest income is now growing at over 36%.</p>
          <p>Generating recurrent revenues and if we analyze the different businesses that we have there and above all the different countries where we're operating, you can see that this recurrent generation of earnings is very consistent, very coherent across the board in all the different countries. As I was saying the growth in revenues means that yet again this quarter we're reporting an improvement in the cost income ratio and that seeds-in to an operating profit which is growing at 31.8%.</p>
          <p>If we look at NPL ratios now, there you can say that it's pretty stable, although we have told you in the past that it wouldn't be strange to see a certain rise in the next few quarters given the kind of growth that we've got. But this is a situation right now so that our net attributable profit as you can see is growing at 17.6%, very much influence there by tax considerations.</p>
          <p>So, this is the income statement for South America, operating profit growing 31.8%, influenced by tax issues. So it go from 31.8% down to 17.6% in net attributable profit. But we've talked about that because there were some tax shields that we had in several countries, which over the last couple of quarters have come to an end, which, we've used them up, which is why our pre-tax profit is 27.1% and our net profit that's after tax is 21.4%. So, we got good news from South America and we're very optimistic about what's going to be happening over the next few quarters.</p>
          <p>We now come to our conclusions, and here I want to continue to put across the same message I was at the beginning of the presentation. I think our results show that our situation is quite different from other banks in Spain and Portugal. Our management is marvelous, as there is a slowdown throughout the Spanish economy, both in terms of our business volumes and in terms of the way that we're managing pricing, and in terms of our efficiency in cost-income ratio and in terms of the way that we are outperforming our peers in terms of asset quality.</p>
          <p>In wholesale banking and asset management, yet again this quarter we've shown that what we were talking about in terms of the recurrence of our business is not mere theory, its practice. And each quarter we're seeing how we can continue to grow against a very complex backdrop.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, we've got good results, first of all, because the Mexican economy as I said before is showing itself to be very resistant indeed. With the Mexican economy performing so well, in Bancomer we are able to generate business volumes, revenues, improve our cost income ratio and be in a situation which really sets us apart from any other banks in terms of asset quality.</p>
          <p>In the United States, we're presenting results, which are much better than those, such as the industry as a whole, and that will continue to be the case because of the structure of the markets in which our franchises are operating, and because of the integration process that we're rolling out.</p>
          <p>Then in South America, we still have very buoyant revenues. We are maintaining our capacity to take advantage of very positive macroeconomic situation. And at the same time, we are improving efficiency. And here too we are showing that the quality of our assets can continue to get better and better and far better than that of our peers. So, results that we're presenting are really recurrent, because of our corporate positioning and because of our business volume, model -- sorry. Our business model is focused on customers and relationship banking. That's the case in our retail banking, which is the biggest part of our portfolio, but also in our global businesses as well. So along with the recurrence of our revenues, we still have our transformation plan to improve our efficiency. We are the group with the best efficiency ratio in Europe.</p>
          <p>And we are obsessed, we want to reach this 35% that we said we will reach for 2010. This combination then of efficiency and profitability is accompanied by our risk management which really sets us apart. Our risks are very well known. We know exactly what they are, where they are. We've informed the market of them. And unlike our peers, we are being very clear about everything and our level of provisioning means that our financial soundness is outstanding. So the BBVA Group has and will continue to have differential capacity to generate value and also to present recurrent earnings. And that's why we decided last month to increase our interim dividend. So that's about it. Many thanks for your attention, and if you wish as Manuel said before, we can now go on and take questions.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. So we'll start with questions from here in the room first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Carlos Garcia from ING. I have a couple of questions. About domestic business volume, there is a slowdown in lending. I suppose that's quite normal because of demand. But also in deposits which have fallen 1% in resident section. I thought you would have done better, because I thought you are safe even for customers who think where to put their money. Could you say something about business volume and what you expect for the future? Then I'd like to ask about defaults, the 1.4 billion that you have for this quarter. Is there a split there for these entries in arrears?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, business volumes in Spain and Portugal which is of course our domestic business, as you've seen, it's true, there is a slowdown. But there is a growth in lending of 7%. And in terms of balance sheet resources, we've seen a 9% increase for Spain and Portugal. And that has been accompanied by differential performance in our mutual funds. It's true that the net worth is coming down. But in terms of market share we're actually getting a big increase. There's something that I would like to say to you and that is that as far as our priorities are concerned, increasing market share is not our top priority. We want to make the most of net interest income, and therefore, we'll be very strict at managing our pricing policy. Having said that, in terms of business volume of the last couple of months, as you'd have seen we're keeping up our lending market share and we give an increase, as I said, in liquid assets and mutual funds.</p>
          <p>For deposits and the trend there, I think we said several times in recent quarters, there is a market for which the pricing factor is important, and we think that we are behaving very rationally. That is why there is an improvement there in our spreads and in our net interest income over average total assets, and we're making that compatible with the maintenance of basic market share. So, I think this is a winning combination, especially, in the current situation. As to expectations for the next few quarters, in lending, I think, there'll be this gradual slowdown. But certainly, we won't slip much more, we've grown 7%, I think we maybe 6%, but never below that. And customer funds, I think that when we pull amount together, balance sheet funds, mutual funds, I think, we'll keep up the same percentage growth that we have right now. And I hand over to Manuel further question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On page 23 of the prospectus, we have the table by entries in arrears. And the June figures are now audited. So as we see at the end of the year, you've often seen appearance of other headings which really sets us apart from our peers. And we were saying that there are some charge-downs which you can compare against last quarter and the fourth quarter the previous year, there's nothing very special to report there, not a big change in terms of charge-downs. And there haven't been any bigger adjudications either, as you can see when we look at the asset sort of been adjudicated, that's a small change there. And again the same is true with the available for sale properties that we've in our books. So we can say that we are pretty clean. If you look at the doubtfuls, this quarter it's 842 million, approximately 600 and something would be associated to Spain and Portugal there, with the interest into arrears in Spain and Portugal. And the rest would be from Mexico and the US, but the figures for them are much lower.</p>
          <p>Okay the next question from the room. No more questions from here in the room so we will go on to the conference call questions in Spanish, please. Doesn't look like we have any conference call.</p>
          <p>Well in that case...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Antonio Ramirez has asked us about early retirements, kind of charges we have made there. Is -- does that complete those provisions, and how many employees does that cover? And Mario Lodos from Ibersecurities has asked the same question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, when we talked about this Investors Day, we said then that for 2007, 8, 9 and 10, there would be charges of about &#x20AC;2 billion, last year was &#x20AC;100 million. We're going to speed up the plan now because the programs that we had drawn up are moving faster themselves. So perhaps, in the next few quarters we will see more charges for early retirements, but always as part of the framework of our transformation plan. I would like to get specific figures, but we'll be sticking to the framework, we gave you on Investors Day. And that will be &#x20AC;1 billion over the next few years until 2010.</p>
          <p>And everything is going faster than expected, so that's good news. Well, the number of early retirements -- I think rather than the number of early retirements, is more interesting to have a look at head count. And if you look at the first semester of Spain and Portugal, we have 1,100 people left, less, less than we have before, so that obliviously means lower cost. We'll now go back to the conference call, because apparently there has been a problem with the sound. So we'll go to the questions in Spanish.</p>
          <p>There is a question in Spanish from Giovanni from Execution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a couple of questions about cost lending in Spain, it's gone up to 49 basis points. What can we expect for the next few quarters, and is there a level beyond which people will look elsewhere? And then, are you expecting any special provisions for the -- for specific risks in Spain, either in Spain or Portugal in wholesale banking. And finally, this is a question about the cost of customer deposits in Spain. That's increased slightly more than what you are making on lending, is there any sort of price war going on, in order to get more funding?</p>
          <p>[Operator remarks] Well, it's true, you know Mr. Goirigolzarri is just saying that there is sound problem, that they can't really hear the questions very well. So the questions is just being explained to him. Okay, the question is clear now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, for risk premium in Spain, as you have seen for Spain and Portugal in the first quarter, we have the risk premium, well on the first semester even, of zero, 35 to 35 basis point. In the second semester, we could get to 40 basis point, and don't think we will, but somewhere between 35 and 40, and for 2009, we -- there is no way that we see the risk premium for Spain and Portugal in excess of 45 basis points. So, no huge change is there.  And do we have any special provisions? The special provisions we have for our generic provisions, we have a huge volume of generic provisions, as I said before in Spain. The volume of our generic funds has increased by &#x20AC;90 million.</p>
          <p>So as part of the provisions that we have made, this quarter 90 million went straight to generic provisions. And we've increased the volume of our generic provisions in Spain. Now customer spread, I think it's better for you to have a look at customer spread in Spain and Portugal. Because you're probably talking about the prospectors and I think that we give the overall figure for global business. And as I did say before global business is growing a lot more than our operations in Spain and Portugal. This has been a deliberate choice, we think now is the right time to position ourselves with clients that can guarantee returns because of their geographic position because of cross-selling and that does tend to distort customer spread somewhat.</p>
          <p>If we look at customer spread in Spain and Portugal, I think, you'll see that it's been increasing for last few quarters and net interest income over 88  has also been increasing and when you compare it to our peers, I think our performance is really good. Then this funding war, what I would say is that this is nothing new, for the last four, five quarters, there has been significant pressure on pricing policy of funding by some banks. We've made no secret of this with you. And as I've often said in the past, we try and make the most of the price volume split, and our priority is to manage prices and not so much market share. Although of course, in the last few months we've seen an increase in market share, but that is not our priority. Our priority is net interest income. And the next question from the conference call, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Arturo de Frias from Dresdner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I have several questions. The first one is, I haven't talked to you about the dollar for several quarters now so here I am. First of all, I'd like to know what policy you have right now as far as hedging is concerned. And what profits have you had from hedging in the first and second quarter? And what is your outlook, it seems that the dollar is quite happy with 1.51, 55, 1.60, are you going to be less cautious with your hedging now, in case the dollar grows back up, or do you think, it will continue to depreciate? Second question, still on United States, I'd like to ask you  about you NPL ratio, this 90 basis points, that you gave for US, you've explained very clearly, that the areas, where you are less at risk than other areas in the US. But my question is whether these 90 basis points is what you're expecting for the next few quarters, so they got worst, how do you feel the property market there? Then the third question, about developers in Spain. After seeing some rather weak results last week, from different operator, do you have any specific exposure? It doesn't look like you have had so far, at least with the suspended payments process as we've seen in Spain, but do you have any portfolio risks that you're specifically concerned about as far as developers are concerned. Then two more questions, although I don't want to take too much of your time.</p>
          <p>What about -- what about, simplicity in Basel II? What about the impact of higher risk percentages if the portfolio is impaired because of the risk-weighted asset? Is that being increased by 5 or 10%, should there will be big increase in NPL? And then I know you have just given the figures what -- you don't think. But you have a risk of more than 40 basis points in Spain and Portugal until 2010. Is the level above which you can use the generic provisions 50 -- 55 basis points, which I think is something you commented on in the past? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I said 45, I said -- I don't think it will go beyond 45 basis points for 2009. It would be 40 basis points for 2008. Perhaps I'll hand over to Manuel for the first question, and then I'll deal with the others. So I let Manuel to talk about dollar, in Basel II.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, as far as using generic funding is concerned, in 2009 under the new regulation that could happen that is why that the stability of risk premiums is important for us in the future. Now with the dollar, currently our average hedging is 50% for results. And another 50% for exchange rate risk impact on our net worth. The 50% of that was in the first semester, it was &#x20AC;126 million and the dollar hedging we have for results is very high. It's almost 100%, certainly in excess of 90%. The cyclicity of Basel II, and risk-weighted assets capital ratios, this quarter as you know, the Bank of Spain has approved our internal models, and using the advanced method by about 82% of the Group's lending exposure. And those advanced models imply a severity hypothesis and also cyclical adjustment. So our consumption of risk-weighted asset in terms of the advanced models already take into account, pretty serious negative situations. So I think the pro-cyclicity for our risk-weighted assets will be low, because we have already calculated very conservative severity impact. We are calculating risk-weighted asset in the mortgages business of some 25%, when in the UK, we have 13, 14, 15% obviously the difference is the series of very conservative hypothesis in terms of severity cyclical adjustments. So, that there would be a low level of pro-cyclicity.</p>
          <p>Then the two questions you asked about the US developers and Spain. In the US, well, it's basically I think I've said everything. Right now, it's true that our markets are performing better than the US as a whole. We are making a constant and proactive analysis of the quality of our portfolio and I've given you the figures for that. The risk premium has increased from the first or the second quarter. The volume of provisions has also grown up from the first or the second quarter as I said. And the risk premium for the second quarter is slightly in access of the 90 basis points that mentioned Arturo. Of course it depends whether you use averages or not, but I get 100 basis points. And I think those 100 basis points, I'd thought, sort of benchmark for the third and fourth quarters. That is our main scenario. As I said during the presentation, with business volumes that's growing in single-digits, then by growing as we have the second quarter in the US which is our main scenario and we feel comfortable with that. And we have very detailed analysis.</p>
          <p>Developers in Spain. If you would allow me, I'd like to talk about what recent events and suspended payments. Instead of talking about exposures, I think, we should talk about the different debt funds have been in these, sort of, companies. And I think there are two sorts of debt. Those -- the money that we lend for corporate movements and those to fund development. That -- the kind of debt people have taken out to fund normal business, tend to have much higher guarantee so they are much more secured, much better secured in other kinds of debts, sometimes 100% secured against the cases. We have seen -- many of the cases that have been mentioned in the press so we don't really have any exposure to the kind of borrowing, which has been used just to back-up corporate activities. M&amp;A and such, like so our position is quite different from that of other banks and I can say that we are in a quite comfortable position really.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>So we go on then with more questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Antonio Ramirez asks If you could give a breakdown of NPL's by segments and what will the situation look like at the end of 2008 and 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I presume the question is about Spain, right. Let's see then our NPL's in mortgage business for home buyers is 0.96 consumption, as consumer business it will be 3.5, in SMEs two, and in corporate and institutional it will 0.59, and in developers' 0.35. So those are kind of NPL ratios that we have in the different businesses that we have here in Spain and Portugal. We have got questions with respect to the real estate market, are we buying real estate assets?</p>
          <p>And are we accepting the security for refinancing loans? We are talking about real estate, I think that Manuel already talked about that before. In this quarter, I can't quite remember exactly what the name of the item is, but anyway this quarter, we haven't got anything to report there. There is nothing really significant at all, no litigations, or anything like that. With -- we announced our figures, with respect to our exposure to developers in absolute terms and in book terms here in Spain. I think about 17 billion, how do you know better than me. Yes, our exposure to that would be 17 billion. I think all the Directors know -- especially our COO that we are always asked about it -- everywhere.</p>
          <p>The total percentage of that over our total loan book here in Spain will be 8.3%. And that exposure then to the -- total exposure we have to the whole mortgage business here in Spain. As you know, most of what we have is to homebuyers directly, that will be 17.5%. A lot of the exposure we have to developers is for first homes. So the developers who are developing first homes for the cities, 6.3% is for second homes as we called them, which is really tourist homes.</p>
          <p>And as you know, our market share in this risk is 5.63%. And then in this market, our policy has been very aware of the fact that we have to bring down that market share. You remember in 2004, it was 7.5%. So since 2004, we've managed to bring down our market share systematically. So we are not so exposed to that sector. If you look to those item mix we've got in the different kinds of development, 39% is linked to land development, 91% is current -- currently built or the development sort of being built and will shortly been finished. We haven't got any exposure to the syndicated loans in this industry for acquisitions or any M&amp;A debt. And our exposure is very, very limited with respect to working capital or projects of that kind -- different funding, those kinds of projects. We've <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>And then under other provisions with something about release. What does that refer to? That was for country risk was quite small, it's really not relevant. We had a generic release in the previous quarter. So this is just country risk. And the one we had risk for contingence. Somebody is asking about the adjustments we've presented, what is the main driver behind that trend? Well, that's very simple. The evaluation, adjustments corresponded two things, unrealized capital gains because of interest rate hike and our interest rate risk portfolio that was in our euro balance sheet in Mexico and the US, and then unrealized capital gains in equity given market adjustments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Eva Hernandez from Morgan Stanley has asked about wholesale banking. Do we have any one-offs or extraordinaries there? Is the trend there recurrent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that the answer is definitely yes. As you know, we usually have a portfolio of property and industrial holdings which usually gives us quite constant capital gains and this quarter there hasn't really been anything special there. So the growth speed that we're witnessing now is purely because it's recurrent business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you -- does the trading income include any assets sales and then another question from Eva, whether the Bank of Spain has said anything about our internal models?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well second question is yes, and the first one nothing that I remember.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then on global business, in which geography and in what sectors are you seeing the increase in lending with global customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we're seeing in US companies, which links in Latin America and European companies with links in Latin America, all the growth we're achieving in global business is very selective growth. We are aiming to make the most of the market opportunities and boost our position with customers, with two main characteristics; to generate cross-selling in the future, and secondly we want them to be customers that give us a competitive advantage in terms of geographic coverage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We have couple of questions on Mexico, one from David Serra . Why is Mexico so strong right now and from Eva Garcia, about 120 million provision in Mexico this semester? The 120 million provision allocation what's it all about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Manuel you can answer that one and I can answer the first one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said before about Mexico there are two important issues, the Mexican economy and Bancomer itself. The Mexican economy as I think we told you all at the beginning the year, we were very optimistic about the Mexican economy. Of course, it would be affected by the US economy, but we believe that the Mexican economy was going to be very resistant and we said that for several reasons and I think we've been proved right. And that is why the things are going so well in Mexico. And also people always correlate Mexican GDP to US GDP, when you have to correlate Mexican GDP to the US's industrial GDP.</p>
          <p>Mexico has changed a lot in the last few years. And unlike other crisis suffered in the past, Mexico now has people in charge that can explain things, put money where their mouth is, and really Mexican domestic demand is very, very high. It's hard therefore to extrapolate what happened in previous US recessions, because the new Mexican economy will respond very differently that's what we've said. And I think we've been proved to be right. Our research department was right, that's one thing.</p>
          <p>And then we have Bancomer in this environment, Bancomer has once again shown that its franchise really is different. Its customer positioning, the way it has decided to get into different markets and the way it manages risk. If you analyze the risk quality of Bancomer compared to its rivals, the difference is remarkable. The NPL ratio, the provisions and I think that is more than justified by decisions we made in the past.</p>
          <p>The first decisions we made in Bancomer were to attack different markets. We were the first to embark on consumer finance, then everybody else followed us. We were the first with mortgages, we bought Hipotecaria Nacional and everybody else copied us, and the same is true with SMEs. So market positioning and big misses from there does give you a competitive advantage.</p>
          <p>And also in 2006 I think we've talked to you all about this. We decided to provision for our mortgage and lending portfolios in Mexico based on expected losses. And I remember the market didn't understand that well, but it was definitely the right decision to make, for two reasons. First of all, because it helped us to manage market proximity in a very different way, when you work with expected losses and not the incurred losses, your strategy is a lot more consistent and means it's a lot more valuable in the long-term.</p>
          <p>We have continued with expected losses and a lot of our competitors are allocating provisions based on incurred losses. So, that's one explanation. The Mexican economy is growing. Obviously, it has suffered some impact from the recession in the US. But it's a lot more resistant and many people thought it would be. Bancomer's management is very different as its position, and that's because we were the first in many different marketplaces and because we decided to allocate provisions on the basis of expected losses.</p>
          <p>Then the -- this question about the 120 million provision in Mexico. It's from the first quarter. It's not the second quarter. There will be 20 million from this quarter for several different concepts. The first quarter figure was a 100, where there was a bigger provision, basically because of social benefits and because of the sale of Bancomer's historic buildings. But there is a nothing special there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We have another two questions on Mexico about interest rates. Javier Bernat and Gabriel Baron would like to know whether interest rates will continue to increase in Mexico and what impact this will have on your business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Mexico, as in many other emerging countries, the monetary authorities have a bit of a dilemma. There is a recession affecting some of the industrialized countries, and then of course there is inflation and very strong domestic demand. The Bank of Mexico has increased short-term interest rates by about 50 basis points to try and cool down inflation expectations. I think there might be an additional interest rate hike in Mexico. And that's the scenario we are considering. Then interest rate risk exposure in Mexico, well our profits go up when interest rates go up, so it's very limited exposure. And interest rate hikes have a slightly positive impact on our financial margin in Mexico.</p>

          <p>There is a question about the CITIC operation from BPI. According to press information, there could be some problems with 50 listings of the Hong Kong Bank. Will that mean an increase in your bidding price, or will that mean you'll have to put more money up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on the CITIC operation there are two things. We haven't presented the bid -- so CITIC would be the one to answer that, and not us. And we are in a situation now in which we cannot say anything. There's an information black out.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a question about commercial real estate and developers in US. Are we concerned about that? Has our portfolio there worsened or suffered any impairment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, commercial real estate in US -- of course, it's something that concerns us, that's why I explained why we closely monitor our books there. And I also said previously that in the second quarter we increased provisions and I explained that will continue in terms of volume and risk premium in quarters three and four. There will be similar volumes and similar risk premiums in quarters three and four as to what we've had in the second quarter. I also think it's important to say that in Compass we are seeing an increase in business volumes because of the change in mix given current market situations. And as I said when I showed the slide, this change in mix which is more based on individual customers with much higher cycles than we had before, because we've always had excellent cycles. And in the business world we are also improving our rating as I showed you in the slide.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And from Insight Investment and Oddo, what about interest in the UK and in Halifax Bank in Scotland.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as we said on more than one occasion several quarters ago in fact now, we are very clear about our priorities and we haven't changed since then. I'll just remind you that in a minutes time, we are absolutely focused on generating organic results within the Group and they are very consistent, and our priority is our integration in the US, which I also talked about this morning. And in August we'll be integrating a second bank and we have commitment to the markets for synergies and those are our targets. We want to come up with the goods in the United States. That's where we're focusing 100%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And we have a couple questions from Ignacio Cerezo from JP Morgan, and Mario Lodos from Ibersecurities, About the impact of the whole makings of recent Colonial on NPL or loan loss provisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I don't have the figure. I actually don't like talking about our exposure and our customer relations, but one of them is so big. I have the material -- there is figures here. I'd like to go back to something I said previously, and that is customer exposure whether it's property or not, are never homogeneous. And you have to distinguish the kind of exposure that different banks have with different customers.</p>
          <p>Before I made a clear distinction between lending, or funding for corporate operations, or lending and funding to actually do business. I explained that we were not involved in funding corporate operations and sometimes we are involved in funding, the normal day-to-day business of the company. The funding we have for <mark type="inaudible" /> and it's not for corporate operations, &#x20AC;230 million with mortgage guarantee and those are almost mature. So I think in terms of the severity, the difference between one kind of funding and the other, the difference is huge. So if 230 million are with mortgage guarantees, Ignacio Cerezo wants to know why our core Tier-I ratio hasn't increased compared to the first quarter. Basically, the organic generation of core capital, which is still pretty significant, is being used to fund to the early retirement charges. So it consumes the generation of organic capital. And that's why there is no increase in core Tier-I.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sergio Gamez from Merrill Lynch wants -- also asks about our capital ratios and what about the impact of the Chinese bank and what about funding in the long-term and how we use the ECB? What is user limit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, China in the second phase would include the first phase. First phase, not the second phase because it hasn't been completed yet, that should be somewhere at the end of the third quarter beginning of the fourth quarter as we did explain. So the first phase of first 15% of some bank in Hong Kong and 5% of the bank on Mainland China. BBVA's funding situations is quite comfortable, it's quite different. Our balance sheet is very manageable in size terms. And we have many more customer funds than our European peer group and certainly our domestic peer group because in summer 2007 we're in a very comfortable position, because we did our homework on time. Jose Ignacio ended the whole presentation by saying that we'd done our homework properly with 33 million in mid-term funding. And well, we are in a much better position than anybody else. So our position this year is quite comfortable, despite the fact we haven't -- to go -- we haven't gone to the capital markets. And we have lines of credit available for up to 50 billion which goes far beyond our current needs. We have &#x20AC;17 billion capacity to assume mortgage bonds, and we can use commercial paper programs, which we haven't used but both in Spain and the US. Obviously for quite modest figures, 20 odd million in assets, but we're not using, but we could use. And we go to the ECB's weekly options for about 3.5 billion, but only -- but weekly options, we're not going to the monthly ones, or the extraordinary ones, or the quarterly ones. So we are in a very comfortable position, I think and we are definitely ahead, and head and shoulders above the rest And all -- issue -- markets are available to us; senior debt, tier-I, tier-II, everything.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>BPI is also asking us about the average alpha and beta values in Spain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I got it written down because they have asked this question at all the other banks too. Our average alpha is 1%, which is kind of maximum. And our average beta is 0.28, that's really based on the Bank of Spain's regulation for the whole company. So this is the BBVA Madrid plus Banco de Cr&#xE9;dito Local, Uno-E and another one. So that's 1% and 0.28% for the alpha and beta and that's using expected losses. Our expected losses in this format, with this expression these companies would be a slightly below the average beta, and the alpha is really at the maximum of generic provisions. There are some questions here that have been answered. Diego Barron is asking about the early retirement charges and the others overall request for breakdowns that we can provide through Investor Relations at a later date. So I think, that's it.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you to those of you who are actually here in person. And what I would like to say here, just as we did last year, that we've also done our homework this time and passed all our exams, and some of us may even be looking up to go on holiday.</p>
