          <p>Dear ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Conference Call of E. E.ON AG.  As a reminder, all participants will be in a listen-only mode.  After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I now hand over to Mr. Bibert.  Please go ahead, sir.</p>

          <p>Yes, good afternoon, everyone.  Welcome to the nine-month 2009 results of the E.ON Group.  Wulf Bernotat, our CEO, will summarize the main financials as usual before giving you an update on our disposals as well as the status quo regarding nuclear lifetime extensions.  He will then summarize our main messages with respect to our gas business before Bernhard Reutersberg, CEO of E.ON Ruhrgas will go into more detail.  And as usual, Marcus Schenck, our CFO, will then review the nine-month figure in more detail. And afterwards we have our Q&amp;A session.  But I will make a few comments once again before that.</p>
          <p>Now with that, I hand over to our CEO, Wulf Bernotat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the presentation of E.ON's results.  At the beginning of 2009, we started to discuss potential consequences that might arise from the financial crisis, which itself had started to develop into a major economic downturn.  At that point in time, some had raised their eyebrows; some had even asked whether E.ON is exposed to different drivers than similar peers.</p>
          <p>We did not have a crystal ball back then, nor do we have one today.  However, we were and are convinced that an honest and proactive dialogue is necessary in good and bad times.</p>
          <p>The crisis does impact the utility industry and it has not yet gone away.  In that context, I am glad to report a robust set of figures to you today.  For the first nine months of 2009, adjusted EBIT was down 1%, while adjusted net income was up 1%.  In general, these figures reflect the trends already seen in the first half results.</p>
          <p>To summarize, our new markets contribute to the earnings base and compensate for the income reduction at Pan-European Gas.  The other market units are delivering broadly stable results once transfers with Energy Trading and extraordinary effects are taken into account.  In particular, a well-timed forward hedging strategy and cost management activities have helped E.ON to withstand the economic crisis in 2009 and will continue to support our earnings growth in 2010.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2009, we continue to expect adjusted EBIT to stay around the same level as last year.  In addition, we can once again upgrade the outlook for adjusted net income.  We now expect it to fall by only 3 to 5% instead of 5 to 10% previously.</p>
          <p>Today I want to give you a brief presentation concentrated on the following two issues: first, to update you on the progress of our portfolio streamlining program; and second to summarize the developments regarding nuclear life extension in Germany.  I will then make a few introductory comments on our gas business, but hand over to Bernhard Reutersberg who, as CEO of E.ON Ruhrgas, will discuss recent developments at Pan-European Gas in more detail.</p>
          <p>Let me start with the progress achieved with regard to portfolio streamlining.  Yesterday we announced that we have reached an agreement to sell our German TSO transpower to TenneT.  Transpower is a spin-off of the German TSO activities of E.ON Netz and consists mainly of the 220 and 380 kilovolt transmission network.  As operator of the Dutch transmission system, TenneT is well placed to run our power transmission network in Germany.  It has the necessary technical expertise as well as the financial strength.  In addition and as required by the EU Commission, it does not have any power generation or supply activities.</p>
          <p>The purchase price will amount to about &#x20AC;1.1 billion.  Of that, transpower's enterprise value makes up &#x20AC;858 million, while its net cash position as per year-end is currently estimated at around &#x20AC;200 million.</p>
          <p>In the coming years, network operators are expected to carry out large investments to connect on and offshore wind farms and to improve cross-border interconnections.  Those necessary investments and uncertainties regarding the adequacy of the regulation in Germany played an important role on the agreed valuation.</p>
          <p>This transaction will create the first truly cross-border transmission system operator in Europe and will contribute to the integration of power markets between Germany and the Netherlands, two countries where E.ON already has a significant presence.</p>
          <p>The divestment of transpower supports our firm belief in a more open European energy market and means that we have almost fulfilled the commitment we agreed with the EU Commission.  Following the conclusion of the sale of our stake in the Mehrum power plant to Stadtwerke Hannover in October, we only have to sell 265 megawatts of coal-fired generation capacity.</p>
          <p>Over the last few weeks we have also signed the purchase and sale agreement regarding Th&#xFC;ga and closed the following three transactions. First, the asset swap with Verbund at the end of August; then the asset swap with GDF Suez last Thursday; and finally, the Yuzhno Russkoye asset swap at the end of October.</p>
          <p>With reserves of more than 600 million cubic meters, Yuzhno Russkoye is one of the last so called supergiant gas fields.  Thanks to this strategic extension of our longstanding cooperation and partnership with Gazprom, E.ON Ruhrgas is now able to participate in this field.  This transaction is a decisive step towards our goal of producing 10 million cubic meters of gas from our own sources.  Including a full year contribution from Yuzhno Russkoye, we will be close to eight bcm at the end of 2010.</p>
          <p>In all, the transactions agreed so far we'll generate cash proceeds of around &#x20AC;6 billion.  As a result, we are well advanced with respect to delivering on our target of generating more than &#x20AC;10 billion of cash proceeds.</p>
          <p>Let me now discuss the changes taking place regarding the energy policy in Germany.  We welcome the fact that the new coalition of Christian Democrats and Liberals wants to define a consistent and sustainable energy concept for Germany, something that we need and that hasn't been missing &#x2013; that has been missing for a long time.  We support the new government's aim to develop an energy strategy free of ideological preconceptions, one that is market oriented and based on a diversified technology mix.  The lifting of the premature phase-out of nuclear power goes into that direction.  The new coalition is willing to extend the lifetime of nuclear power plants as far as national and international safety standards are fulfilled.</p>
          <p>It also plans to share the benefits of the lifting of the phase-out between the public and the nuclear operators.  These broad policy directions now have to be developed into detailed agreements between the government and the industry.  We expect that the corresponding discussions with the government will take several months.  Nevertheless, we are confident that a positive outcome will be reached.</p>
          <p>Nuclear power is responsible for around 50% of E.ON's power generation output in Germany in 2008.  Accordingly, nuclear lifetime extensions will contribute significantly to reduce E.ON's and Germany's carbon emissions.  Its continued use will not hinder the development of renewable energy in which we are investing &#x20AC;8 billion between 2007 and 2011, but will help to smooth the transition towards a low carbon economy.</p>
          <p>With the acquisition of Ruhrgas in 2003 E.ON has developed into an integrated power and gas company. We have discussed developments and trends for our power generation business during our recent capital market day.  Following a number of questions from the capital markets, we would like to take a deeper look at our Pan-European Gas business during this conference call.</p>
          <p>Before going into more details let me summarize our key conviction.  Pan-European Gas business is based on a diversified business model with each component characterized by different risk return characteristics.  In this context, certain segments especially the supply and sales business are facing temporary challenges.  While there is no quick fix, those can be and already addressed.  Longer term we are convinced that gas will become a scarce and valuable commodity again.  It is a destination fuel even in the lower top of the world.</p>
          <p>The market unit Pan-European Gas with E.ON Ruhrgas at its core has been a great success story in the E.ON Group since the acquisition of Ruhrgas in 2003.  Last year Pan-European Gas achieved an adjusted EBITDA and an adjusted EBIT of 3.1 billion and &#x20AC;3.2 billion respectively around a quarter of the group's total.</p>
          <p>Whereas the downstream shareholdings have delivered relatively stable earnings growth between 2004 and 2008, the up and midstream business has produced a stellar performance especially between 2006 and 2008.  This was a result of the development of the upstream business and of particularly favorable conditions for our midstream activities.</p>
          <p>Since its acquisition Pan-European Gas has widely exceeded our expectations.  This can also be observed in the consensus enterprise value that the capital markets ascribe to this market unit to actually less than &#x20AC;20 billion compared to an acquisition value of around &#x20AC;11 billion for Ruhrgas.  Without any doubt, Ruhrgas was E.ON's most successful acquisition.</p>
          <p>Let me now pass over to Bernhard Reutersberg for further comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, good afternoon everyone also from my side, following the introductory remarks from Wulf Bernotat, let me go one step deeper into our gas business.  The strength of Pan-European Gas lies in its diversified business mix.  Each part of the value chain has specific earnings drivers.</p>
          <p>Last year, the majority of our adjusted EBIT came from three relatively stable segments:  First, the regulated businesses which mainly consist of our German gas transport network and of our international participations.  Second, storage which is part of the unregulated business. And third Th&#xFC;ga which forms most of the other businesses and is about to be divested.</p>
          <p>By contrast, upstream and supply and sales are more volatile.  The short-term performance of upstream is largely driven by international oil and gas prices which reached record levels in 2008.</p>
          <p>The earnings drivers of supply and sales are more complex.  After the extraordinary earnings of the period 2006 to 2008, we are currently coming back to the level before those extraordinary years.</p>
          <p>In essence, supply and sales is a sophisticated gas wholesale business.  As one of Europe's largest gas importers, we buy gas from producers, structure the product, thereby handing amongst other parts demand volatility and seasonal variations and we sell the gas to large industrial customers and regional or local utilities.</p>
          <p>There are three key developments in the European gas market that are putting the competitiveness of supply and sales business under pressure and which require our attention and action.</p>
          <p>First, the economic crisis has led to a significant decrease of demand, especially for power generation and for industrial consumption.  Second, the North American unconventional gas market, such as coalbed-methane or shallow gas is seeing a major expansion as the development and production costs have dropped significantly.</p>
          <p>In only a few years, the supply/demand balance in North America has changed considerably.  While it was previously expected that LNG imports would be necessary to make up the balance, North America can now be considered as largely self-supporting.</p>
          <p>Third, LNG liquefaction and regasification capacities are increasingly substantially and are or will be going on stream in due course.  As a consequence, an increasing number of LNG cargoes are being diverted towards Europe, instead of going to the U.S.</p>
          <p>This contraction of demand and the widening of supply have led to a temporary oversupply on the European gas markets.  This has two consequences.  First, spot gas prices have decoupled from oil prices and thus from the price of the long-term contracts, which are largely linked to oil prices.  Second, liquidity of the spot gas markets has increased strongly making spot gas as much credible sourcing of options than before.</p>
          <p>This has created more liquidity on the spot markets leading to both volume and margin pressure.  However, we believe that these imbalances will last only for a limited number of years.  The market seems to support this view as well.  As gas forward prices are currently pointing to a re-coupling of spot gases and long-term contract prices around 2011 or 2012.</p>
          <p>The backbone of our supply and sales business consists of some 35 long-term contracts with producers which provide more than 90% of our gas sourcing.  Their duration is typically 25 to 30 years, while long-term in nature various risk sharing elements ensure that those contracts allow both parties to react to changing circumstances, following one basic principal.  The producer bears the price risk and the buyer the volume risk.  A corridor of maximum and minimum volumes provides the buyers with a degree of flexibility.  The price of gas is typically indexed based on competing fuels, mostly gas oil and fuel oil but also the coal and spot gas.</p>
          <p>Periodic renegotiation clauses allow both parties to check that pricing conditions and the overall contract situation are inline with market developments.</p>
          <p>On the basis of the abovementioned risk sharing principle, our LTCs cover a range of elements to restore the profitability of our sales and supply business.  The main issue addressed in the ongoing negotiations with the producers are pricing and flexibility.</p>
          <p>Regarding pricing beside the review of other elements we see some merit for giving spot gas more weight and the indexation formulas closer to its now extended role in the European gas markets.  However, we have to think it's about the right balance between short-term needs and/or belief that oil indexation provides better value in the longer term for all market participants.</p>
          <p>Concerning volumes, the situation is as follows.  If we take less gas than specified in the minimum take obligation then our contracts require us to pay for a certain percentage of the shortfall.  This has an impact on our cash flow as we pay now for gas that will be delivered later, but it does not impact our adjusted EBIT.  We have the so-called make-up right in the upcoming years for volumes that we paid for but did not take.  Nevertheless, before being able to do that we take minimum pay obligation in the respective years as well.</p>
          <p>Overall the minimum take obligation of our contract portfolio will decline in the coming years as some contracts will expire.  With the recovery of gas sales, we should then be able to manage the minimum take issue.  Supply and sales is undoubtedly facing some challenging years ahead.  Nevertheless, we remain optimistic regarding the long-term prospects for the gas business.</p>
          <p>Between 2008 and 2030, gas demand is expected to grow by up to 40% worldwide and by 20% in Europe.  Indeed, gas will play a significant role in the transition to a lower carbon world.  Gas is globally available.  Potential reserves are abundant and gas is the cleanest fossil fuel.</p>
          <p>In power generation, its efficiency and flexibility makes gas an ideal complement to renewable energy.  This means that with gas production in Europe set to decline markedly, we expect the European gas market to become tighter over time.  We therefore continue to see long-term gas contracts as a backbone of our gas sourcing.  All indexation will remain dominant, but indexation to spot gas will increase to reflect the higher liquidity of the gas markets.  In addition, LTCs have supported the development of the gas industry as they had the necessarily financial certainty underpinning the financing of large-scale long-term projects across their whole supply chain.</p>
          <p>In setting our strategic priorities, Pan-European Gas has to some extent already anticipated the recent developments.  Looking beyond the current cycle, margins in supply and sales are expected to recover later on, but we do not foresee a return to the levels recorded in the results of the last years, as competition will continue to intensify.</p>
          <p>To compensate, Pan-European Gas is therefore developing its presence in upstream at L&amp;G two attractive growth areas that were not available to Ruhrgas before its acquisition by E.ON.  With the Yuzhno-Russkoye and Gazprom asset swap and with the development of Scarv Idun, our target of producing 10 bcm per annum of equity gas is coming in sight.  The decline of domestic production in Europe will remove substantial flexibility from the system.  Additional gas storage capacity is required to fulfill structuring needs.  Hence with competitive storage sites, Pan-European Gas is well placed to grow in this segment.</p>
          <p>Finally, Pan-European Gas operates the largest gas transport network in Germany and it takes the role of innovation leader in Germany.  Furthermore, to support the surge of supply, Pan-European Gas also participates in selected transport projects in and outside of Germany, such as the UK Interconnector or Nord Stream.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes my remarks.  I will stay on the call to answer your questions later on. And now I would like to hand over to Marcus Schenck who will discuss the third quarter results in more detail.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bernhard.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  As always, I will provide some details on the numbers, or refer you to the written commentary on the respective pages.</p>
          <p>Before I go through the details, just one topic in advance, economic crisis, which is a topic that has been accompanying us throughout the entire year.  As of end of September, we estimate the impact from the crisis at around &#x20AC;350 million, which breaks down into roughly 130 for reselling volumes which we had anticipated to have sold and where then the customer disappeared.  Secondly, with another 130 bad debt, and then thirdly 100 million of lost margin because our volumes turned out lower than we thought.</p>
          <p>For the full year, we now expect an impact overall in 450 million, which is 50 million more than what we had expected as per half of the year.  But we do see, and I will come back to that when I talk about Pan-European Gas, some recovery in volumes in Q3 basically inline with the expectations that we had voiced on our last conference call.</p>
          <p>Let me move to page two.  EBIT, adjusted EBIT is down 1%.  When corrected for currency translation effect, we are actually slightly up.  Let me go straight into the market's units, starting with Central Europe on page 3, just the main effects here, basically Central Europe is flat year-on-year, positive were the consolidation effects from the French business SNET, the first time inclusion of Gaz Romania. The regulated business in Germany is performing better based on more favorable regulation and also our cost cutting efforts.  We spoke about that on our last call, in particular, as it relates to the TSO. And the wholesale power and retail gas margins are up. And offsetting our negative effects from a lower retail power margin, the first effects from the disposal of plants in the context of our deal with the European Commission was around 70 million, and then a particularly weak result in Hungary. Those were the main effects on Central Europe.</p>
          <p>Over to Pan-European Gas, where I will not comment on any strategic issues, but really just go through the numbers. It's down 33% to now 1.4 billion. Mainly the non-regulated business is being hit here. While the storage business remains to be stable, our upstream now is the result of 125 million, down from more than 200 million last year.  The wholesale business is down 340 million. Here, the three drivers are lower volumes which translate into roughly 175 million, less earnings, price effect of around &#x20AC;240 million, and then a positive effect from the storage valuation of &#x20AC;67 million.</p>
          <p>Before I come to the volumes, just one word on E.ON Gas Transport, our gas transport business. We will see a tariff reduction starting in the fourth quarter of 2009. For the full year, the effect would be around &#x20AC;250 million. But please bear in mind, it will hit this year only with one quarter, namely Q4. We will see the full impact in 2010, in line with what we have anticipated so far.</p>
          <p>On the volumes, over to the next page, we have seen a particularly poor development in the first quarter as well as in the second quarter, which you can see on the chart. And as we indicated to you in our Q2 call, we are seeing first signs of recovery in the third quarter of this year. The effects from the crisis stay at the same level as we had communicated three months ago.</p>
          <p>Let me move over to the U.K. Again as explained during Q2, the decline in this business is mainly caused by internal transfer as well as currency translation effect. You can see in the appendix that the U.K. business actually, when corrected for those effects, only slightly falls short of last year's results. The real decline is around 65 million in generation due to the timing of the nomination of volumes to E.ON Energy Trading. Actually, to the outside world with E.ON Energy Trading, we did realize higher spreads, i.e. there's a positive result on the U.K. portfolio sitting inside Energy Trading.</p>
          <p>On our retail business, the isolated Q3 quarter for a long time now is positive, and we actually do expect for the full year a slightly positive result from our U.K. retail business.</p>
          <p>Similar story for Nordics on page 7. As discussed also during our Q2 call, Nordic, when corrected for currency and the planned lower volumes, is basically even above the 2008 level. We did lose volumes in a planned way due to our transaction with Statkraft, as well as the investment program as discussed on page three. The real effect in this business is that the regulated business is actually up by around 40 million and then Nordic realized in particular higher prices towards energy trading, there are some lower volumes due to the outage in particular of the greenhouse plants.</p>
          <p>The U.S. Midwest business, on page 8, is up 16%, this time for a change mainly due to positive currency effect. Q3, when looked at it in an isolated way actually was a pretty difficult quarter given mild weather conditions in the U.S. and continuing lower off system sales basically driven by the economic crisis. The positive effect from fuel and gas recoveries will partially reverse in Q4 of this year.</p>
          <p>Over to E.ON Energy Trading, prop trading is behind last year. We highlighted on our last call that in particular the second half of 2008 was very strong in proprietary trading and obviously something which we did not expect to repeat during the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>On the asset optimization results, it is up &#x20AC;430 million, offset increased the line share namely around 360 million is mainly caused by internal reallocation, in particular it relates to the gas contract from the U.K. which we spoke about and you can see the details in the appendix and it's related to the re-pricing of CO2 certificates that stem from our Central European and the U.K. portfolio. The remaining increase is mainly caused by positive results on the U.K. portfolio as I said earlier and the optimization of our short term gas position.</p>
          <p>On chart 10 which you are familiar with, you can see the details on our hedge provision, I would say 9, 10 and 11 unknown, we're for the first time including the year 2012, where on average our outright power position is hedged by roughly 20%, the prices are lower than -- is the case for 2011 but again 80% of the position there is still open. Just one general comment hedge ratios as you will see have only slightly changed during the last quarter, we have not accelerated anything at this stage and we also do not take a particular view on 2012 at this stage.</p>
          <p>Let me move over to the new markets which for the first time have surpassed the one billion EBITDA thresholds.  Climate and renewals in Russia continue to suffer from the weak wholesale prices in the U.S. and Russia respectively.  Italy and Spain we've some special effect in both year both 2008 and 2009.  Just to remind you Italy and Spain both had negative non-cash CO2 effect in the third quarter of 2008 which was not repeated this year and in Italy in the first half of this year we saw a positive non-cash valuation effect from the renegotiation of unfavorable power contracts.  That's a little bit distorts, the increase that you see in those market unit.</p>
          <p>Let me now explain the further items down through net income.  Adjusted net interest expense is down mainly due to an increase in the net financial indebtedness and the reduced share of commercial paper.  We expect this effect to be even stronger in Q4 given that our Th&#xFC;ga transaction will close only at year-end and Q4 is a particularly strong investment quarter from a CapEx point of view.</p>
          <p>Net book gains is mainly related to sale of Lippendorf, Bexbach, EnBW and the hydro assets which we closed in Q3 of this year.  Noteworthy of the 2.7 billion swing in the mark-to-market valuation of the derivatives and also noteworthy is the provision debt we'd booked in the third quarter for &#x2013; that we had booked in the first nine months for the EU fine in the context of the MEGAL pipeline which will &#x2013; only leads to a cash outflow in October of i.e. in Q4.</p>
          <p>Over to page 13, income taxes as reported increase in particular because of the deferred taxes related to the mark-to-market valuation of derivative accounts at this stage.  This continued operation includes WKE and also one point I would like to indicate for Q4, you will then for the first time see the remaining quarter i.e. Q4 of the Th&#xFC;ga business that we sold reported as the discontinued operations.</p>
          <p>Net income attributable to the E.ON shareholders is up almost 100%, but as I mentioned this was mainly driven off the positive derivative valuation and the highest bookings.  Corrected for those as you can see on the next chart, you get to an adjusted net income which is up 1%.</p>
          <p>Let me now move to Group operating cash flow and I would actually like to jump the next page given as you know it is pretty much distorted by intragroup effect and really I would like to highlight what the main driver at the Group level were.  EBITDA is improving the cash flow by &#x20AC;156 million.  As I indicated in the context of the description of the effect within new markets, it's there in particular Italy and Spain, they are valuation effects which are non-cash relevant, which we have to correct for, which is the CO2 effect in 2008 and the renegotiation of power contract in Italy in 2009, that is negative minus 330 million altogether.</p>
          <p>We have higher cash interest payment also &#x20AC;330 million and these effects are more than offset by a different usage of the gas storage i.e., we have lower inventories there and improved working capital in particular in our U.K. retail business where basically days outstanding came down, and then you can see here the reversal of a negative effect which we have commented on in Q4 of last year with in E.ON Energy Trading who had acquired CO2 certificate at the end of last year which are now being sold into the market.  So you can see here the reversal of that effect as we have commented on at the end of last year.  This results a roughly 7.1 billion operating cash flow for the first nine months of this year.</p>
          <p>Over to the investments, economic investments are still at a very high level during the first nine months of this year.  As you know, 2008 was higher due to the acquisition of assets from Endesa in P&amp;L.  Almost exclusively we are investing into organic projects here and basically all our different market unit.  Let me repeat at this phase that we are basically not adding new projects to the pipeline but really just executing on what we have started.</p>
          <p>The next chart shows you our, this is a details on the economic net debt, I'll jump that and just walk you through the development of economic net debts, it is slightly improved over Q2 this year due to the strong operating cash flow, but since the beginning of the year we see an increase of our economic net debt of around &#x20AC;1.3 billion to now &#x20AC;46.2 billion.  I have described most of the changes, let me just highlight one which is relevant here, which is the obligation.  We have on average needed to change to a slight discount rate by roughly 50 basis points which drives up our PBO. This effect was only partially offset by improved value of the planned asset for that net negative movement of &#x20AC;700 million.</p>
          <p>For the remainder of the year we do expect economic net debt to be slightly better than what is reported at the end of September where we assume that we would see a closing of the Th&#xFC;ga transaction at the end of the year, which is a positive effect, negative we have a higher CapEx contribution in the fourth quarter and please don't forget the MEGAL fine which was paid in October.</p>
          <p>That gets me to my last page. The outlook for 2009, we continued to see adjusted EBIT for the full-year on the 2008 level.  On adjusted net income we now have higher visibility on the development of interest expenses as well as our tax rate at year-end and based on that we changed our outlook from previously down five to 10% to now down three to 5%.</p>
          <p>Regarding 2010, we will provide an outlook together with our full year reporting in March next year.  Right now we've just started discussing the next three-year plan with our market units.  I'd just like to highlight one chart in the appendix, where you can see the effects from disposals on earnings from those disposals that we have so far assigned or closed.</p>
          <p>That concludes my remarks, and with that I think we can move to the Q&amp;A.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon.  I have two questions regarding the gas business.  First one is for Mr. Reutersberg.  On page 15 of the presentation, it has been mentioned the discrepancy between effective take and minimum take. Should I read that slide in a way that you expect rising volumes for next year and consequently higher earnings for the non-regulated business for 2010?  That's the first question.  The second question is regarding the inclusion of the Yuzhno Russkoye gas, what is the impact on EBIT in that unit account for 2009 and maybe 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I'll take the second question first.  Do we expect for 2009 an impact of around &#x20AC;100 million in EBIT? The overall effect for us was around 250 million, but the lines through EBIT but will come as a cash contribution.  As far as next year is concerned, that will obviously depend on where gas and oil prices will be. But we think it could be somewhere at around 200 to &#x20AC;250 million in EBIT.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Coming back to your first question concerning make up and how it will work for next year.  First of all to page 15, the thematic presentation how it will work.  If there will be a minimum take obligations and we have to pay for it, it's still not an issue up-to-date. And then of course next year, first of all we have to meet the minimum take level and then afterwards, we can use it to make up volume.  So it's quite obvious that we first of all have to meet these obligations and afterwards can probably work on our minimum takes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So it's not quite clear whether you're really heading for clearly higher volumes at this point in time, at least?</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Deborah Wilkens from Goldman Sachs. I have also a question for Dr. Reutersberg.   On the gas margin, could you help us in terms of the nine months EBIT, just giving us a feel what is the split between the storage EBIT and sales and supply, and how you see the outlook for the sales and supply earnings for 2010. Should we expect further deterioration of these margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Deborah, if it's okay, I will take the numbers.  As far as our storage business is concerned, it's a data that we have not really disclosed.  To give you an indication, at the nine months result for this year we are somewhere around 300, &#x20AC;350 million in that range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For the storage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For storage, in terms of the EBIT contribution which is I would say a fairly normal result and a fairly stable result.  As far as 2010 is concerned at this stage, we would prefer to not really comment on our outlook.  I think what Bernhard indicated is that clearly the Ruhrgas business will continue to be under quite significant financial pressure as far as margin is concerned.  And I would like to remind people that basically today we are signing contracts with customers where we are locking in margin which will actually prevail only in 2010 and 2011, i.e. we are locking in in our wholesale business lower than what used to be a very decent margin in the past. That means the wholesale piece will continue to be under financial pressure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think from the fundamental point of view, we only report supply and sales in one figure because the margin is closely related to flexibility and what price we'll get from the flexibility.  So it makes no really sense to split out a real safe margin for the commodity and for storage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can I just follow up.  Is there a risk that the wholesale margin is actually a negative number next year?</p>

          <p>Thank you very much.  The next question comes from Simon Flowers from Merrill Lynch.  Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon.  It's really on the same lines, looking at your spot price, the long-term contract price indicator and I presume what you mean is that is proxy for where your problem is on supply margins.  And so looking at the chart you are expecting calendar '09 to be bad, calendar 2010 and maybe things to pick up again by 2011, 12.  That's the direction I think you indicated.</p>
          <p>But you are also seeing in the way that you contract that there might a lag in that.  You just said markets I think you are locking in contracts to 2010 and 2011 which mean that the recovery might be for the two to three years down the line rather than one to two years.  Just a confirmation on that will be helpful?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just to follow up on what you were saying at the capital markets day on the mark-to-market regulation for over the kinds of contracts, any further thoughts on this and any color would be helpful, please if your thinking has progressed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  On the second question first, before the end of October, I host our capital markets day, the Commission published a second document following the July, I think it was end of July document, where they were basically indicating that there is going to be legislation in the or dropped legislation in the first half of 2010.  And certain principles and objectives were being highlighted.</p>
          <p>Noteworthy from our points were statements in particular in two areas; one area was that we are clearly &#x2013; was clearly a distinction between financial and non-financial in terms of how people needed to be treated.  And then secondly, there was also a clear reference for the objective of the Commission to not dry out liquidity and market activity in certain markets, and in particular it was referred to the energy markets.</p>
          <p>And the sort of the hedging of underlying real positions was viewed as something that slightly would need to be treated differently.  Now, again there is no draft legislation yet, but we took that as first indications that certainly the Commission is aware of the fact that they can't &#x2013; that they have to be careful in terms of what exact regime will be implemented.</p>
          <p>We also see that, not just us, but actually almost all industry are talking this with their local governments as well as the EU Commission that these things need to be done in a responsible way.  I hope that answers the second question.</p>
          <p>On the first question, I don't know, Bernhard, whether you want to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can start.  First of all, you probably referred to the page number seven where you see the expiration, you see the BAFA prices, spot prices. And this is of course the snapshot of the situation as of today.  So what will really happen to the BAFA prices and to the spot will heavily depend on how fast the demand will recover again.</p>
          <p>Important to note is tender size. Most of our sales contracts are also oil linked, but they will refer basically to the price level we see in the markets, and so spot will have an increasing effect on that price level.</p>
          <p>Secondly, of course, on the supply side, we are now in price review negotiation with almost all of our producers and this will hopefully bring down also the BAFA price, so that from both sides probably there will be a movement hopefully in the right direction. And the market is already anticipated for a 2012 that they will come back to a re-coupling of oil and spot prices.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. The next question comes from Martin Young from the company Nomura.  Please go ahead, Mr. Young.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Good afternoon to everybody, just the usual couple of questions. Firstly, to continue on this gas theme, I think the slide that you put up is quite clear in demonstrating that there could be a possibility of having to pay for some gas that you will not be utilizing in 2009. Appreciate that doesn't have any impact on the adjusted EBIT number, but presumably the cash that you have to pay will carry with it a financial cost. Could you give us an indication of the ballpark cash figure that you must have to pay at the end of this year?</p>
          <p>And then the second question relates to the hedging that you've done for 2012. I appreciate that you don't really want to go into too much depth about your hedging strategy, but it does appear that RWE has gotten slightly ahead of you for 2012 and so much that it's claiming a price in excess of &#x20AC;60 per megawatt hour when yours is 56. Why the difference in timing between when RWE hedges and you hedge? And are you holding back in any particular way for the possible outcomes of the Copenhagen summit, which may or may not put upward pressure on the carbon price post the end of this year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, why RWE hedges when they exit? You can ask them tomorrow I believe. We basically follow a strategy, which is similar to the strategy we have pursued in the past. We normally have been actually ahead of most competitors in terms of our hedge ratios, i.e. took a, in the past took a more conservative approach. We are taking a fairly conservative approach for the years '09 and '10 and also '11 in particular in light of the fact that those are the high CapEx years for us. And we think that from a risk management point of view when you know that there is a high certainty for high cash outs, you're also better advised to not take too big a risk in terms of running at a position open for too long in your trading business.</p>
          <p>2012, we expect CapEx to come down. That's one of the reasons why we think we should not close positions there in an accelerated way at this stage. And when you actually look at the specific data and just look at the period '09, '10 and '11, at least in our analysis, actually the locked-in price and then take the remaining open position at market, you will likely find out that probably of most if not all competitors in our analysis at least we've secured the highest price. Okay, 2012, yes, we have hedged 20%, which seems to fall slightly below where someone else is. Let's see what the situation will look like come 2012.</p>
          <p>On your first question as it relates to the real min take payments that we could run into, we actually do expect them to not be so significant at this stage. The way it technically works as you determine your min take payment obligation at year-end, but then actually the payment is being made in January. That payment as we currently see it will most likely be quite below &#x20AC;200 million. So I mean if I take any interest charge on that, I would say it's de minimis from an earnings perspective.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I have a question on the interest charge on page 31 of the financial presentation, you highlighted a significant increase in the effectively the capitalized interest benefit and also quite a big move in market valuation of interest derivatives, I wondered if you could explain a bit more about those, particularly since your CapEx last year was quite a lot higher than this year, so the changing capitalized interest seems a little strange?</p>

          <p>Yeah, I can explain that item. When we build the power plants, the hypothetical &#x2013; or the imputed interest charge you have on the financing of such a project you record as an asset and that's basically in the P&amp;L you can see here in our interest results. It is &#x2013; it has grown because we simply have a higher organic CapEx activity this year than was the case last year. That's the explanation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I have to come back to this chart on page seven on the spot price versus the long-term contract price. I mean you made it clear that the majority of the gas procurement is via this long-term contract price. Now how much of these volumes can you actually sell at the contract price? I mean you did say that spot gas was getting evermore prominent; it is quite a liquid market. So the oil-gas spread of about minus eight, &#x20AC;9 there, to what extent does this actually impact earnings or can you give us any kind of idea of how much of these volumes you pay the oil based price or can you actually sell at a similar level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Bernhard that is probably one for you. As far as the &#x2013; Lueder, let me just make sure that we understand how much volume do we sell to customers below our long-term...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean basically you talked about the spot gas getting evermore prominent; the gas market is evermore liquid. So the volumes you are contracting and for which you are paying a price significantly 8 or &#x20AC;9 above spot gas, how much of these volumes can you actually sell at a level that is significant &#x2013; well, that can be compared with your purchase price? If people can buy spot gas in the market, I can see why they're not necessarily might want to pay the gas you pay &#x2013; the price you pay for gas under the long-term contract obligations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you have to look to it more from a segment-specific point of view when you look to the major part of the business which goes to regional distribution companies and to utilities. Therefore they have also a mixture of customers and we are very close to the LTC prices. If you go to a more let's say competitive-oriented segment like industry and gas and power sector, they of course have also access to the spot markets. So we have to be very close to the spot market and there we are let's say below LTC prices. But overall, we are slightly below LTC prices at the moment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody. Without harping constantly on on the gas business, my two questions are in that area, firstly, you mentioned the profitability of the business line will be more at the kind of '04 &#x2013; 2004-2005 levels than 2006-'08. Going forward, can we assume that 2010 might be even lower because we're still kind of digging our way out of this de-coupled position? And then related to that you mentioned that you will probably or if demand doesn't improve, allow some of these contracts to roll off. So presumably that business is going to shrink over time. So would it be fair to say that the ongoing profits are actually below the 2004-2005 levels going forward?</p>
          <p>Secondly, I don't know if you can comment on this, but the IEA's World Energy Outlook yesterday seemed to strike a more bearish outlook than you in terms of European demand going forward and also suggested that there will be quite a big chunk of gas available or in fact gas prices could clear five to $6 a million Btu, which I think is below where even the contangoed forward curve is at the moment. Do you see that being excessively bearish, I don't know if you can comment on that at all?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Chris</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the profitability of Pan-European Gas as an overall market unit, clearly when we sort of look further out, we see a significant positive driver there being the E&amp;P business where Yuzhno Russkoye will be added next year, in 2011 Scarv Idun will be added. That is going to be quite a material driver of profitability in that segment, pretty much dissimilar to what we saw in the years 2004 and '05, so that's one item to highlight. That will be partially offset by the fact that the Th&#xFC;ga business no longer belongs to the business.</p>
          <p>Now the key question really is how will the more narrowly defined supply and sales business develop. That is the piece that I think almost all questions circle around, which had seen I would say spectacular years in '07 and '08, and as we indicated when presenting the 2008 numbers we definitely have to expect the margin and hence profitability in that business to come down. Now admittedly it came down a bit more quickly in 2009 than we had anticipated. 2010, actually our view on that year today is not so dissimilar from what we saw coming at the beginning of this year for 2010. So we do think that the supply and sales business in 2010 and likely also 2011 will be burdened by low margins that given the contractual situation that Bernhard described, we kind of have to accept at this stage. Obviously when the results of the negotiations with our upstream partners will come through, and they do not come through in one go, but first of all it's multiple players you need to negotiate with and then it takes time until it kind of feeds through into the positive results and that will then sort of start '11 and definitely we expect the improvement in 2012.</p>
          <p>Where the overall level will be? Again, is &#x2013; yeah, I would say we will see upstream clearly gaining importance quite substantially. The supply and sales margin will definitely not see the margins of '08 and '09 again I would bet in the next five years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Coming back to your other question concerning the IEA, they recently published their new analysis of the gas market and quite frankly they more or less confirmed our view of the market. On the long term, we share the view that there will be very interesting growth options for the overall natural market worldwide &#x2013; natural gas market worldwide. Of course, it's interesting to look to the more short-term periods, let's say what &#x2013; how long will this situation of oversupply will last? There are little bit from my point of view on the pessimistic side. They expect that it will last until 2015. We see other levels for instance from Sera, they are much more short-term oriented; they say probably the amount will pickup again at 2011. So we are somewhere in between there, our present view is that there will be further reactions from the producer side. They will react on the situation. Our negotiations with the producers will also have a major impact on that, so that our perspective is that's probably &#x2013; '10 will be a tough year as Marcus already mentioned, but I think there will be sign of recovery for 2011.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Just want a bit more color on the &#x2013; you said there's going to be a greater weight of spot gas in the indexation from this stage, I was wondering if you could help me to understand how this greater weight of spot gas indexation is going to fill the gap between spot and gas input prices which is a huge gap. So presumably when you are discussing on the various renegotiation tables, you were also discussing the peanut, so the initial condition of gas prices, could you give a comment on that? And the second thing is to pick up on a &#x2013; on the notes, you mentioned that some of the gas contracts will expire in the coming years, and I just want to get a sense of how much of the volumes of the existing gas contracts will expire every year starting from when? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, concerning spot indexation in our long-term contracts, so the actual situation is today that more than 90% is oil-indexed, and we are in negotiations with the producers to increase that number. And there are different views on that how we will increase it.  At least for us, of course, we need bigger share, but we still believe very much in oil indexation for the medium and long term. That means that we need some more flexibility also from the volume side, so that we can use directly the spot markets and in addition have the share of spot indexation in our long-term contracts so we get more flexibility on the volume side, but also on the indexation side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And there was a question on development of intake volume due to expiring contract. Did I get that right, Alberto?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yes, basically the question is, there are some contracts that are expiring. So from say 2010 you will have to import 20 terawatts you can either renew by new contract or by spot.  So, what is the sequence over the years on this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I can't give you the exact numbers on that, but there will be only a few contracts that will expire during the next one or two years and then afterwards, in 2013 and '14, there will be larger volumes which are expiring.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I will try to divert the attention a little bit away from gas. I just wonder, if you could give any indication how your outlook for the achievement from PerformtoWin looks for the current year, you were indicating 2 to 400 million upfront, only one number of 32 million in the detail so far.  So, just where you stand there? Secondly, with respect to the economic net debt, you were already indicating that you are below the nine-month level due to &#x2013; also due to disposals at the year-end. If I think about the CapEx left for the year, you &#x2013; I'm slightly puzzled, you're giving total number of 13 billion and including the assets swap with Yuzhno Russkoye I guess. So even if I strip that out that would be 3.5 billion for the remainder of the year, is that little too high or is that in the right direction and then would it be correct to think that economic net debt is something like 1.5 to 2 billion over than the nine-month level at the year-end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Your CapEx estimate is not entirely incorrect, almost spot on for Q4; and as I indicated Q4 is a strong CapEx quarter. As far as economic net debt at year-end is concerned I think at this stage all we can expect is the closing of Th&#xFC;ga, this year Transpower we think will be more like January. So not hit the '09 balance sheet where exactly then, you know the reduction in net debt is going to be &#x2013; we'll have to see. But we do see some reduction. It's not going to be so material. I mean, whether it will really be more than one billion I &#x2013; we'll have to see, there's always final cash flows swings at year-end which have an impact here, due to working capital changes in particular.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think your first question was on PerformtoWin and what's &#x2013; just to repeat what of the effect of 2 to 400 million, we are already seeing feet through in the 2009 results, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can start and then sort of maybe others want to add, we are &#x2013; we do see the results roughly in that range at this stage, particularly on the Ruhrgas side. We are seeing the first effects from different marketing of extra storage capacity, which is part of the storage results.</p>
          <p>And for the cost savings, as we always said, we will see the revenue measures feed through more quickly. That alone is roughly &#x2013; the Ruhrgas impact is roughly at around 60, &#x20AC;70 million year-to-date. Already in the numbers, we are also seeing the first impact from cost metrics. So I mean I don't yet see the details for each and every market unit but we do stand in the range of two to 400 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I was probably just after an idea if you would trend more to the upper and/or to the lower end of the range, and sounds more like rather in the upper half than in the lower half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it will depend I would say also really on Q4 because, please don't forget, we had our agreements in place early August. And hence we'll have to see what we get done during the course of Q4. But we will hold to that range.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Two questions please. The first one again on PerformtoWin, I think you said in the quarterly report that it's been extended to the new market units. Could you give us an idea please of the upside to the 1.5 billion target this could represent? That's first question. And secondly, could you tell us what was the contribution of Transpower to your CapEx program for 2009-'11? And more specifically how much you have for business in 2010 and 11? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Transpower CapEx, we have not planned in our numbers because we have a commitment to sellers. So if your expectation is that our numbers will now come down because we've sold Transpower I have to disappoint you.</p>
          <p>As far as upside from PerformtoWin resulting from the new market units is concerned, we just basically started analysis there. So I would say basically two comments, too early to tell, and then secondly what we see in terms of first ideas, at this stage I would say is giving us more comfort that really the 1.5 overall being on the safe side. I would shy away from adding something now from those units at this stage.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Chris, can you maybe restart. We just heard the last five words.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I am so sorry. And I wanted to be quick, sorry. I heard you say earlier, you were saying you were currently working on your three-year plan at the moment. Does that mean you have a further update to give us post the capital markets beyond CapEx? And the second question would be are you going to give us graciously another three-year EBIT target like you did back in 2007? That would be the first question.</p>
          <p>The second was going to be directed towards Mr. Reutersberg. I was going to ask regarding the negotiations that are ongoing with Gazprom. Have they been impacted in any way by the fact that E.ON is now only a 3.5% shareholder in Gazprom? Does that stake still leave you with any additional strategic influence or do you think other competitors of yours have not got in Russia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the first question, Chris, we are working through our mid-term plan as is the case every year. We will provide an update on CapEx together with an outlook for 2010, at least 2010 in March next year as we did this year. Obviously, this will then include CapEx also for the year 2012.</p>
          <p>As far as further guidance on EBIT, net income or what not is concerned, at this stage, I cannot answer the question. This is something which we will work through in the coming weeks and months. So I mean unfortunately, I can't give you more clarity there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll just eagerly anticipate an answer then. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Concerning your question does the stake of Gazprom has any influence on the price negotiation? Quite frankly, they are completely separated businesses. So that means unfortunately, we didn't get any rebate in the past for having 6.5%. And with the reduction of course still there is no reduction there, so unfortunately not.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My two questions are first of all, Dr. Schenck, on your final remarks of the presentation about the 2011 EBIT target, I understand that you are not &#x2013; sorry 2010 EBIT target &#x2013; I understand you are not going to update that specifically right now. But is it fair to calculate the like-for-like adjustment from the initial 11 billion target of that $0.9 billion you are mentioning in the appendix? So do we in fact now stand at 10.1 excluding the 200 million EBIT, which I expected for the transpower business?  That is the first question.</p>
          <p>Second one is for doctor Reutersberg, again on slide number 15, you are indicating a declining volume of take-or-pay obligations in the next couple of years due to the maturity of contract. Could you please elaborate how that looks on your end customer business? I assume there are some contracts here running out as well. So could you give us some indications in general terms and especially on the delta between take-or-pay obligations and take-or-pay rights?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matthias, your first question with regard to 2010, indeed that's if I were you what I would do.  Take what we provide on the first page in the appendix and take that as an adjustment to the 11 billion.  At this stage this is also where we see it.  As I mentioned, we are just starting to work through the 2010 budget.  We really see there are certain things that have developed more positively, certain things that have developed more negatively.  On balance, we have to see where the outcome is at this stage. I would say really the best thing you can do is take the 11 billion and knock off the numbers indicated in the appendix.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay coming back to chart number 15 at your question.  First of all, it is a schematic representation, so it did not really reflect exactly how the expiration of the long-term contracts will be.  But the basis of your question is, is there, let's say, a clear relation between the timeframe of the long-term contracts and the sales contracts?  There is no clear relation.  Due to the regulation in Germany, we can only fix contracts with our sales customers of one year or two years contracts.  And only for let's say a maximum of 50% of the sales to specific customers we can also sign long-term contracts. So a clear no link between the timeframe of long-term contracts and short or mid-term sales contracts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So is it fair to assume that we can expect a significant impact of the maturity of your sales contracts while your take-or-pay contracts are only declining marginally over the next couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there is no change in the overall picture.  We are still used for several years now with one or two years contract on the sales side. So there is no change.  This picture just shows that we get additional flexibility due to the fact that the long-term contracts will expire.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everybody.  I have two questions. First of all on page 22 of Mr. Schenck's presentation, you gave an explanation of 500 EBIT reduction due to disposals and swap of generation assets. And in the explanation I find something like 350 million.  Can you please explain where the other 150 million comes from when you knock it off?</p>
          <p>And the second question is, yesterday you announced the grid disposal and the multiple doesn't look particularly high at first. And I talked to your IR people and they said, the explanation they gave was basically there was a CapEx involved in the business, which you perceived as a valuable structured investment. Can you give some other indication or benchmark how you arrived at this valuation? Whether this is a rough or what's the work you put on the business, things like this? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  This will be two longer answers. On the roughly 500, it is actually slightly lower than that but let's say it's 500. 250 of that is related to power plants that we have sold for cash.  The remaining 250 you can essentially break down into three effects. One effect being somewhere in the order of magnitude of 60 million which is the pure purchase price allocation effect which you then actually see on both sides of the swapping partners, i.e., we get assets that we need when we first time consolidate them in our accounts step-up to fair value, and hence you will have a higher depreciation base, which essentially is hurting EBIT, with some positive effect that comes with it, mainly on the depreciation we might see some tax benefits going forward. But, that's roughly 60 of the roughly 250 I need to explain.</p>
          <p>Then we are going to consolidate or we will receive ownership of certain EBITs which is also somewhere at around 60 million from SNET, which we had already consolidated.  So here unfortunately it has kind of a negative EBIT impact because we are giving up assets that were contributing EBIT and we are getting full ownership of EBIT that we had already consolidated.  It will have a reversing impact then in the minority.</p>
          <p>That leaves me with around 130 million that you could now really ask, okay, what on earth is going on there? And that is basically related to the specific payment pattern of the nuclear drawing rights, which are value equivalent.  But in the first year it leads to a lower accounting EBIT, and in longer years, or in outer years, that effect reverses.  It is driven by the fact that the number of years when we will receive, or when we can draw from nuclear plants abroad is different from the number of years that our swap partner can draw from our power plant.  It is a fairly technical effect.  I can walk you through that probably offline if you want. But that's the main driver behind that delta.</p>

          <p>On the second question, the valuation of transpower.  First of all, the single-biggest impact I think that people need to be aware of is the fact that there is probably some three to four billion of CapEx obligation, in particular for the offshore grid connection that comes with that business.  As the allowed returns currently stand, basically you are faced with a roughly at least 100% negative spreads on such investments, i.e., you get an allowed return which falls short of what probably cost of capital in reality is by at least 100 basis points. If you apply that to a four billion investment, that alone gives you quite a significant mark-down, probably somewhere at around &#x20AC;500 million.</p>
          <p>So mentally in a way you need to add that to the enterprise value because that is CapEx yet coming and then compare that &#x2013; that's essentially the value that is being paid for the existing business &#x2013; and then compare that with metrics.  That doesn't make sense in the context of a German valuation.  You can look at kilometers where in certain countries like Italy transaction multiples stand somewhere at around &#x20AC;50,000 per kilometer.  In the U.K., it's probably at around 140 &#x2013; 150,000.  Our grid here is almost, what is it, 10,600 kilometers, if I am not mistaken.</p>
          <p>So corrected for that, as reported it translates into roughly &#x20AC;85,000 per kilometer, corrected for the negative value or negative expected value on the offshore rig connection, you actually get pretty close to the U.K. multiples, which in today's environment, with acquisition financing being where it is, we actually think it's quite a decent and acceptable result.</p>

          <p>Can I ask you, because you've provided a capital on market base sort of watts in the range of seven to 12% you would assign to generation assets, does this mean that you would basically see the watts for the regulated range in Germany at the lower end of this benchmark?</p>

          <p>Group, cost of capital post tax we see at around 6.5%.  Obviously, the higher businesses like generation will be north of that number, and purely regulated businesses will be slightly south of that number.  So it's probably more at around 6 plus epsilon percent, which tells you then how attractive the allowed return on the offshore grid connection is.</p>
