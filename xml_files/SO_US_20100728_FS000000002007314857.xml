          <p>Good afternoon. My name is Michael and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Southern Company Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator instructions" /> I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Glen Kundert, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

          <p>Thank you Michael, and welcome to Southern Company's second quarter 2010 earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are David Ratcliffe, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Paul Bowers, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today, in addition to historical information. There are various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings.</p>
          <p>We'll also be including slides as part of today's conference call. These slides provide details on the information that will be discussed on this call. You can access these slides on our Investor Relations website at www.southerncompany.com if you want to follow along during the presentation. Now at this time I will turn the call over to David Ratcliffe, Southern Company's chairman, president and chief executive officer.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. I am sure most of you are aware by now of the changes in our senior management team that we announced yesterday. With my retirement from Southern Company on December the 1st, we have begun a transition in the office of chief executive. Tom Fanning, who many of you know very well from his four years as chief financial officer, will become president of Southern Company on August 1. He is also with us on the called this afternoon. Paul Bowers will be moving to Georgia Power on August the 13th as chief operating officer, while Art Beattie, who is also with us today, will become chief financial officer. Tom, Paul and Art are key members of our management team and are well prepared for their new assignments, and I know will do an outstanding job for us.</p>
          <p>As you can see, from the materials we released this morning, we had a good second quarter which was influenced by favorable weather and the continuing economic recovery in the Southeast. Since our last earnings call in April we have had three significant regulatory developments in our retail business, including a rate case filing by Georgia Power. Paul will cover the rate case filing in more detail in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>First on May 26, the Mississippi Public Service Commission approved the construction of our 582-megawatt coal gasification project in Kemper County, Mississippi. Yesterday the South Mississippi Electric Power Association signed an agreement to purchase 17.5% of the plant to fill the projected capacity requirements of its members. The plant, which will use Mississippi lignite coal, is scheduled to be placed in service in May 2014. The facility has a construction cost estimate of $2.4 billion. The project, which will feature 65% carbon capture capability, has qualified for nearly $700 million in federal incentives, including $412 million in investment tax credits and $270 million in clean coal power initiative funding. In addition, we are in advanced due-diligence discussions for federal loan guarantees.</p>
          <p>The Mississippi Public Service Commission has also approved the construction-work-in-progress mechanism, which will begin in 2012 and continue through the end of May 2014. We are pleased to now be under construction with the Kemper County project. We believe this plan is clearly the best choice for our customers, and to repeat what Secretary of Energy Stephen Chu wrote recently, and I quote, "the project is of national importance because it provides a viable option for using our abundant coal resources in a cost-effective manner and reducing power plant emissions."</p>
          <p>My second update concerns our Vogtle nuclear project. Last month we announced that Southern Company and the Department of Energy agreed to conditional terms on the nuclear loan guarantees for units three and four at Plant Vogtle. Under the conditional agreement, the loan would not exceed 70% of the company's eligible projected costs, or approximately $3.4 billion, and is expected to be funded by the Federal Financing Bank. The loan will be full-recourse to Georgia Power and secured by a lien on the company's 45.7% interest in the two new units. The loan is expected to save Georgia Power's customers between 15 and $20,000,000 annually in interest costs.</p>
          <p>The actual amount of the interest savings will depend upon the final terms and the timing of the specific borrowings. Final approval and issuance of the loan is subject to the receipt of the combined construction and operating license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and satisfaction of other conditions. The NRC's current schedule calls for finalization of its design and control document review by October of 2011, and we would expect to receive the COL by the end of 2011. As you know, the company received an early site permit and limited work authorization from the NRC in 2009, and site work has been underway since that time.</p>
          <p>At this point I will turn things over to Paul for a discussion of our financial highlights for the second quarter, and our earnings guidance for the remainder of 2010.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David. First of all, let me say how much I have enjoyed working with all of you as CFO during the past 2 1/2 years. Now as David said, our second quarter performance was good. The results continue to highlight the consistency of our business plan to provide regular, predictable and sustainable performance over the long term. In the second quarter of 2010 we reported $0.62 a share compared with $0.61 a share in the second quarter of 2009, or an increase of $0.01 a share. Let's turn now to the major factors that drove our second-quarter numbers compared to the second quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>First, the negative factors. Non-fuel O&amp;M reduced our earnings by $0.07 per share in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2009. This change is primarily due to a return to normal maintenance spending in 2010 for both our fossil and hydro generation fleet, and our transmission and distribution network. On the generation side, approximately 3,000 more megawatts were involved in planned outages in the second quarter compared to the second quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter of 2009 we had the early termination of two of our international leveraged lease investments, which resulted in a gain. For the second quarter of 2010 we now show a reduction of $0.03 per share compared to the second quarter of 2009. Finally, an increase in the number of shares outstanding reduced our earnings by $0.03 a share in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the second quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to the positive factors that drove our earnings for the second quarter of 2010. Warmer than normal weather in the second quarter added $0.04 per share to our earnings for this period compared to the second quarter of 2009. While the first quarter of this year was the coldest winter in 20 years, the second quarter was the warmest spring in 20 years, and the fourth warmest in more than a century. Clearly weather has been a major factor this year and has added $0.14 per share to our earnings, compared to the first six months of 2009.</p>
          <p>Increased usage and better than expected economic activity, primarily in the industrial sector, added $0.04 a share to our earnings in the second quarter compared with the same period in 2009. Other revenue effects in our traditional business added a total of $0.02 a share to our earnings in the second quarter compared with the second quarter of 2009. This impact was driven primarily by revenue changes related to the recovery of environmental expenses and other investments at our operating company.</p>
          <p>Reduced depreciation and amortization added $0.01 per share to our earnings in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the same period last year. This increase was driven primarily by the continued amortization of excess costs of removal obligations at Georgia Power, approved by the Georgia Power &#x2013; Georgia Public Service Commission beginning in the third quarter of last year. The increase was partially offset by additional depreciation from increased environmental, transmission, and distribution investments.</p>
          <p>Lower interest expense also added $0.01 per share to our earnings in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Increased transmission revenues in our traditional business added $0.01 per share to our earnings in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. Investment tax credits at Georgia Power added $0.01 per share to our earnings in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. In conclusion, we had $0.13 of negative items compared with $0.14 of positive items, for a positive change of $0.01  per share over the second quarter of 2009. So overall, our quarter came in at $0.62 per share.</p>
          <p>Before I discuss our earnings estimates for the third quarter I would like to update you on the Georgia Power rate case filing, the economy, and the impact of the oil spill.</p>
          <p>On July 1, as required by its current accounting order, Georgia Power filed a retail rate case with the Georgia Public Service Commission. The requested increase is necessary to cover additional costs of required environmental controls and continue investment in new generation, transmission, and distribution facilities to support growth and ensure reliability. During the past 15 years, Georgia Power has operated under three-year negotiated rate settlements. The 2010 rate case filing contains proposed enhancements to the current structure. The requested increase of 615 million, or 8.2%, would be effective January 1, 2011, and is based on a retail return on common equity of 11.95%.</p>
          <p>The increase would be recovered through Georgia Power's existing base-rate tariffs, including its environmental compliance cost recovery tariff, the demand-side management tariff, and the municipal franchise fee tariff. The filing also proposes an alternative rate plan which enhances the existing tariffs and proposes two additional base-rate tariffs.</p>
          <p>The first proposed new tariff is an adjustable cost recovery tariff, or ACR. If approved, beginning January 1, 2012 the ACR will work to maintain Georgia Power's projected earnings within the ROE band established by the Public Service Commission and this proceeding. The ACR tariff proposal has a symmetrical sharing mechanism, should the Company's actual earnings exceed or fall below the approved ROE band. The second proposed new tariff is a certified capacity cost recovery tariff. This tariff is designed to recover certified generation and associated transmission costs as well as capacity cost of certified power purchase agreements.</p>
          <p>If approved, these new tariffs, along with the annual reset of the existing cost recovery mechanisms, would allow the company's rates to adjust more gradually than under another three-year accounting order. Testimony and hearings on the requests will begin this fall, and the Company expects the Georgia Public Service Commission to issue a final order on the matter during December. We will keep you updated as the case moves forward.</p>
          <p>Last week we convened another economic summit with executives from several of our industrial segments, including a rail transportation company, as well as economists from a major private bank and the Atlanta Federal Reserve to discuss the outlook of the economy. Even with a diverse spectrum of industries represented, there was a consensus of opinion in three main areas. First, a double dip recession is unlikely, however, the momentum of the economic recovery is slowing. The general view is that the Southeast is still well positioned for economic growth outpacing the U.S.</p>
          <p>Second, residential and commercial construction remains depressed, but the trend shows stabilization in the residential market. Apartment rentals and unoccupied homes are moving in a positive direction. Third, inventory restocking is slowing from the first quarter. It is not expected to be a major economic driver going forward. Most economists, including those in our group, see modest growth in the second half of 2010. So the conclusion of our panel was that the recovery continues, but it is far from robust. Several of our participants mentioned that their industries will basically muddle through for the next six months.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our own customer data, industrial sales increased by 13% in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the second quarter of 2009. Quarter over quarter, the most significant increases were in primary metals, up 60.7%; chemicals, up 25.9%; transportation, up 14.5%; and paper, up 16% compared with the second quarter of 2009. Year-to-date, we have seen positive growth in every segment except pipelines, rubber, and apparel.</p>
          <p>The ThyssenKrupp steel manufacturing facility in Alabama hired approximately 1,000 people at its new facility and has continued commission &#x2013; production equipment which will require approximately 200 megawatts. In addition, Hyundai Heavy Industries announced a facility in Montgomery Alabama to build high-voltage transformers, which is expected to add another 500 jobs. All of the major automobile manufacturers in our service area continue to report steady demand for their products, with an increase in production in Alabama alone of 71%.</p>
          <p>Adjusting for weather, residential sales increased by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. New connects have climbed to approximately 36,000 units per year in the second quarter, which represents a 47% increase over the first quarter of 2010. In addition, we are seeing positive customer growth of more than 7,000 new residential customers.</p>
          <p>As expected, commercial sales remain our weakest sector, declining at 1% on a weather-normal basis in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the second quarter of 2009. Year-to-date, 2010 commercial sales are down .7% on a weather-normal basis, which is in line with our forecasts. Commercial activity continues to lag, with vacancy rates for offices of more than 22%. On the positive side, electricity demand by data centers increased by 7% in the second quarter, reflecting our most active account in the commercial sector.</p>
          <p>In summary, the commercial and residential sectors are performing a according to our forecasts, while sales to the industrial sector in the second quarter are ahead of our plan.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the impact of the oil spill in the Gulf. We know many of our customers along the Gulf Coast have been financially impacted by this accident. However, at this point, from both an energy demand and operational standpoint, we have not seen a measurable impact on our Company. From an energy sales standpoint, the major impact will be seen in the commercial sector, primarily in tourist-related businesses such as hotels and restaurants.</p>
          <p>Gulf Power in Northwest Florida has the largest exposure, with some 125 miles of coastline along the Gulf. While few beaches from Pensacola to Panama City have been affected by the oil thus far, we have not been able to identify any impacts to our energy related sales, since only about 5% of Gulf Power sales are to customers in tourist-related segments. Another factor is that oil spill workers are occupying hotel rooms which otherwise would have been filled by tourists.</p>
          <p>On the generation side, our plants along the Gulf Coast are operating normally, and coal shipments by barge has not been interrupted by the oil spill.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our earnings guidance for 2010. Our second quarter results exceeded our estimates by $0.06 a share. As we discussed the quarter was largely influenced by weather and the gradual economic recovery we are seeing here in the Southeast, particularly from certain segments in the industrial sector. While we ended the first six months at $1.22 per share, it's important to remember that $0.14 per share of those earnings were due to weather.</p>
          <p>In addition, for the remainder of the year it's important to remember that three major factors will continue to have a limiting effect on our earnings: number one, the third year of a modified accounting order at Georgia Power; number two, a more normal level of O&amp;M spending; and three, an increase in the number of shares outstanding. Given these factors, and since a significant portion of our earnings are derived in the third quarter, our guidance will remain at $2.30 to $2.36 per share, with an emphasis on the top end of that range. Finally, our estimate for the third quarter is $0.94 per share. At this point I will turn the call back over to David for his closing remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paul. As Paul explained, we had a good quarter and a solid first six months, but we are mindful that weather has been a major contributor to our earnings, and that the economic recovery, while encouraging, remains somewhat fragile. It is important to reemphasize that the foundation of our business plan is a commitment to provide our investors with regular, predictable, and sustainable financial performance over the long term. At this point Paul and I are ready to take your questions, so Michael, we'll now take the first question.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Your first question is coming from Greg Gordon of Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> Sorry about that. I was distracted for a second. So I guess my question &#x2013; I have two questions. The first question is, the $0.01 benefit from the lower amortization, was that lower than it otherwise would have been because you had the flexibility to reduce its vis-&#xE0;-vis having a strong weather quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Greg. This is Paul. When you look at that $0.01 benefit, remember you had the COR, the cost of removal benefit from Georgia Power, at the same time we're recognizing increased depreciation and amortization from environmental equipment and T&amp;D equipment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. And then, you had &#x2013; I know you commented in your scripted remarks that you're still very cautious about prospective acceleration of demand, but for the first six months of the year we have seen quite a dramatic recovery. And shouldn't that benefit you in your dialogue with the regulators, because obviously the better the sales levels are, the easier it is to amortize the needed rate increases across the customer base, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct, Greg. That's absolutely correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Eggars with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon. Just drawing up on, or touching on Kemper a little bit more, can you talk a little bit about the contract on the EMC side, to give you confidence you can stay within the top end of the allowed cost -- or the investment level the commission provided, given the overruns that you've seen so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dan, this is Paul. Both David and I will comment on this. When you look at the contract that we just signed actually yesterday with the SMEPA organization, it is an opportunity for them to get capacity, low energy cost capacity for their customers that they serve, the EMCs in the southern part of the state. From the standpoint of where we stand from a Kemper County construction and execution, we've already secured about 20% of the cost already under contract. By the end of the year we expect to have 50% of that cost contracted for. So we're real confident that we can make the contracted or the targeted price of 2.4, but we have the 2.88 billion cap that's available to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I guess if you give a little more color on the customer growth you saw in the quarter, the 36,000 run-rate level. Where are those bodies coming from, and are you seeing an acceleration over the year that might give you confidence that number's going to continue to rise from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dan, remember, I mentioned that customer growth was only 7,000 customers in the residential class. When you look at the 36,000, that's new connects. So it's people leaving, connects now being reestablished in existing facilities and/or new facilities. That new connect is a determinant, if you will, of the growth that we might be experiencing in the marketplace. So having positive quarter-over-quarter numbers is an indicator that we are having inward migration, and that jobs are being established in the Southeast. The other point I will make is that when you look at our normal new connects from 2000 to 2007, that number usually runs around 80 to 88,000, so we are significantly below normal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But are you seeing an acceleration in that 36,000 number? Where was it the last couple of quarters, on a run rate basis? And when do you think you get back to something closer to the historic level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Last quarter it was around 30,000, so that 47% (sic) [20%] increase is 36,000 over the 30,000. The aspect of when we get back, we're looking at 2012 when you have a residential market returning to something more than normal. Or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>More than current normal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...more than current normal, thank you. The new normal out here somewhere, Dan, we are trying to find it. I just think what we are trying to do is to celebrate the fact that we see a little positive here. I still think the long-term reality is a function of job creation, and we're still struggling with unemployment rates that are too high, and until we get those numbers headed in the right direction I think we are going to be pleased with what we get, but I don't think we can talk much about an accelerated pace, here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I guess just one last question, as it goes to Georgia &#x2013; the Georgia filing. Remind me on the ability of the commission to approve an ACR or some sort of alternative rate-making mechanism. Is that something they have the power to do, or is that something that would also need legislative attention prospectively, to get approval?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, they can clearly do that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you already answered this but I didn't quite catch it. Did you take full advantage of the accounting order to depreciate &#x2013; on the depreciation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Paul. When you look at it, $54 million per quarter, so yes, we did recognize that this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as we look at the third and fourth quarter of 2010, should we expect similar O&amp;M step-ups of 5 to $0.07?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Going back, Paul, to the guidance for the year, I understand the point you folks made of the $0.14 help from the weather, and the negatives that you outlined in the second half about the share count, et cetera. Those are also well known. And so I was just wondering if you're assuming normal weather for the rest of the year, and you picked up $0.14 through the first half, why would you not be raising your guidance for the year? What's the other negative that you may not have accounted for, that's causing you to remain at these levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well remember, Ali, when you have &#x2013; like I said, there's three things. Normal O&amp;M expenditures that we have is getting back on a reliability schedule associated with our generation fleet; the vegetation management activities that we have around our T&amp;D facilities, so there will be a higher spend on O&amp;M levels. The other piece is, recall that we had the accounting, modified accounting order at Georgia that limits, if you will, the capability of that company to earn over a certain amount.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The Georgia part, I understand that limits it. But the O&amp;M step-up and the share count increase, I mean those are already budgeted into your original numbers to begin with, right? I mean, so that's not incremental. I understand the limit on Georgia. But is there anything else out there that is beyond these factors, that is causing you to keep your numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we disclosed the planning that we're doing on increased O&amp;M spending and the increased number of shares and the Georgia orders. Those are the things that are &#x2013; the major factors. And always the uncertainty around weather. I mean, we've seen weather go the other way, too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right, I understood. Secondly, could you remind us of what was &#x2013; how much equity did you folks raise in the second quarter, and where are you now versus your plan for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have raised $344 million so far this year. <mark type="inaudible" /> Probably one other thing, too. As you look at our drivers, and like we said on the opening of this call, the third quarter is our largest quarter in terms of our revenue and earnings. After the third quarter, we'll make adjustments as necessary to our guidance, but not until then.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Hey guys, two questions. One, on Kemper County, what if any do you expect in the way of litigation going forward? I mean, usually the environmental groups continue to battle it, and what precedent, if any, in Mississippi exists, in terms of whether injunctions ever get granted?</p>

          <p>Okay.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael when you look at Southern Power, like we said before, it is a surrogate of a regulated model. It has long-term contracted capacity for its generation units, and it &#x2013; what we also said is, it was going to remain flat over the next three years, because of the contracts that are evolving during this time. One of the issues that Southern Power is also facing is the downturn from the economy, and having capacity that was allocated towards a requirement contract that is really not needed for another year or so.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with UBS.</p>
          <p>&lt;Q &#x2013; : Jim von Riesemann&gt;: Good afternoon, everyone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Afternoon, Jim.</p>
          <p>&lt;Q &#x2013; : Jim von Riesemann&gt;: Hi. Two questions. One, did I hear you correctly, that on the industrial sales, all the restocking efforts that the industrials were doing in the first half is basically now over? Did I interpret that correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, what we said is from the economic summit, the participants basically said that the pop that we had in the first half of the year resulted from much of the activity around restocking, and they do not anticipate restocking to drive the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>&lt;Q &#x2013; : Jim von Riesemann&gt;: Okay. And then the second question is on &#x2013; I'm confused about the fourth quarter. I know we're jumping ahead here, but if your guidance remains the same with the emphasis on the upper end, that means you would report somewhere in the $0.20, 19 or $0.20 range in the fourth quarter. Can you tell us what would be the big drivers in 4Q? Would they be considered, call it one-time in nature? Step-up in maintenance or anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, when you look at &#x2013; like we had said earlier, ongoing O&amp;M is going to be in normal areas. We're going to be looking at maintaining the reliability of our network and ensuring that we provide the necessary maintenance on our systems to meet our customers' expectations on reliability and price for the future.</p>
          <p>&lt;Q &#x2013; : Jim von Riesemann&gt;: Okay. Now that the economy is, we're in a new normal phase, and some of the temporary O&amp;M cuts have lapsed, what should we be expecting in terms of, call it a normalized O&amp;M growth, year-over-year? So looking into 2011 and beyond?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Jim, each year you have to assess the O&amp;M spend based on the environmental equipment that comes in. So I can't give you a smooth 3% growth rate on O&amp;M or 4% growth rate, because some of those numbers are driven by the scrubbers that come online during any individual year. They drive O&amp;M significantly for us.</p>
          <p>&lt;Q &#x2013; : Jim von Riesemann&gt;: Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Two questions. On the Georgia rate case, could you tell us a little bit more about the timeline for the rate case, especially in association with the management changes? Could we imply, for instance, that come early December or late November, we could have a potential settlement or some resolution to the rate case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>By definition, the rate case has to be finalized by the end of the year, by December. And as you know, the schedule calls for the hearings to begin in October. Usually they are completed in October and then the commission takes it under advisement in November, and we try to finalize it in December.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the second question is about your coal plants and dispatching of different coal plants, given where forward prices for central Appalachian coal are. Are we already seeing, are you already switching to natural gas, and what's your view about the future given where natural gas and coal prices are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've explained before the economic dispatch regime that we use, so we're dispatching our units on the basis of the lowest cost, and that's a function of, as you suggest, price of coal and price of natural gas. So as it changes, then the dispatch changes. We're still continuing to burn some of our coal piles in a managed fashion so that we are managing the inventory. We have the opportunity as gas prices go down to take advantage of that, and we will do so.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys. Just a question, do you have a sense on when this Moody's review of the credit ratings is going to end, and just is there any new data or other stuff you have been able to give them to make the case on how they are looking at new nuclear?</p>

          <p>The bonus depreciation associated with the financing bill. It was attached to the agricultural bill, but we have not had any update of late. It's now in the small business bill, is what I understand, and we'll see if it gets any traction.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Judge with Atlantic Equity [sic] (Atlantic Equities).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to start with a question with regard to environmental legislation. Clearly there has been some push &#x2013; well, delay in passing potential carbon bills and renewable energy bills. Do you have a point of view of when that could come back to Congress, and what's the likelihood of something being passed in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nathan, I don't know that we have any particular view beyond what's been reported in the press. As you know, it's a very complex piece of legislation, and the time associated with trying to deal with a very complex bill like that is problematic in a Congress when they really don't have enough time. If you look at their calendar, they've got a lot of things they have to do in the fall, and trying to get it back on the agenda in the fall will be a difficult challenge. Not impossible, but I think the biggest challenge remains trying to get the 60 votes that they need to pass anything of that magnitude in a clearly growing political season.</p>
          <p>So I wouldn't give it very high chances of coming back this Congress. I think it's jump-ball until we get through the midterm elections and see what the new Congress will look like and whether or not there is an ability to move something in the new Congress.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to the EPA and the recent transport rules, do you have any sense as far as magnitude of what that could mean in additional CapEx for Southern Company, and if &#x2013; what are the more difficult things that proposed rule that would make it difficult for you to comply?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we really don't. Like everybody else we are trying to do the analysis on the concepts that have been proposed, and I emphasize the fact that it is a proposed rulemaking. And it is a difficult one to understand, because it has some complex provisions with regard to interstate and intrastate trading, and whether you can use allowances and whether you can't.</p>
          <p>The bottom-line of all of that is, as we lower these numbers, the ability for us to continue to back-fit additional equipment is fairly limited. We have already made, as you know, significant investments. We have invested, by the time we finish in '12, I think about $10 billion, and you get to the point where there's not enough space and you can't continue to achieve reductions with the existing technology. So until we see and understand exactly what the requirement is, and how it's going to be implemented, it's awfully hard to figure out exactly what we might be able to do to continue to reduce emissions, of SOx and NOx primarily.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nathan, from a capital standpoint it's a trade-off relative to environmental equipment, like David was talking about, or replacement with new generation. So from a capital budget standpoint, it's relatively level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have an idea when you will know? I guess final passage and finalization of the rules, but...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The rule is going to be challenged, I am sure, so it will be &#x2013; I think it will be well into next year by the time we get some definition on exactly what's required, and then as part of that you are running into what I think is just an impossible date from a compliance standpoint. As I understood it they were talking about a 2012 kind of compliance, so that if there is any additional equipment, control equipment required, the timing and the ability to put that in place is extraordinarily limited.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think we have done the work, again, on installing major scrubbers, and we got additional scrubbers that will go into service this year, we pretty much have committed. I think the longer-term questions are, what are the entire portfolio of additional regulations, whether it's the transport rule or whether it's fine particulates, ash, mercury, additional hazards &#x2013; all of that, as we said many times, needs to be coordinated in a fashion that allows us to preserve reliability going forward.</p>

          <p>Okay. So secondarily, in terms of the proposed rate mechanisms, if they're approved, or can be implemented in some fashion similar to what you proposed, will this then kind of carry you through the Vogtle construction period without having to do it -- be discreet in specific updated cases, is that basically the objective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the objective would be to create a mechanism that would allow us to make routine filings throughout the entire period, and rather than these massive rate cases, to deal with increased cost, or decreased cost, in a small &#x2013; much smaller increments over the period of time. Really not during the construction, but really during the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Last question, I am wondering in terms of load growth and &#x2013; what are you seeing in terms of normalized usage per customer? Are residential customers and some customers started returning more normal usage behavior, or have you noticed that conservation and other types of activities are persisting, such that even with the existing customer base, getting back to prior usage or usage growth levels might be challenging?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Looking at the residential market, it is &#x2013; we are seeing an uptick in terms of use per customer, roughly about 1.2 for the quarter, 1.2% for the quarter. We have seen that trend for the year. The year-to-date number is 1.3. From a commercial standpoint, the small commercial group, it's really an economic question, not a use per customer question. Because the issue is economic viability, will they remain in business? And we are seeing some of the small convenience store-type entities really close up shop.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That 1.2 and 1.3, those are weather-normalized, you take out the weather effect?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think most of the questions have been asked.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we said, Carrie, is the first of the year we would look at between 5, 5 and 600 million, and that we would see if our internal <mark type="inaudible" /> programs could provide that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. So if I remember correctly, I think it was roughly double that amount last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was 1.3 billion last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And you know, kind of tied into the Moody's review, I guess it just seems to me that if you're trying to lower on equity issuance, that that's not real supportive of maintaining your current ratings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Remember, Carrie, we said last year that we sped up some of the equity issuance so we could take advantage of the market. That's why we went that way. So we pre- funded some of the equity requirements for this year, last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well, where are &#x2013; you guys don't give out any balance sheet information in the release. Where are we now, in kind of the equity ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're at 41.8%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I remember correct, you guys were hoping to be closer to the 42 to 43% level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the longer term, that's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And based on the comments I heard, I guess the view is that you guys are struggling to kind of figure out, is there a bubble of equity at Moody's that would allow you to maintain your current rating? Is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Carrie, the issue really is more of a business environment, relative to the issues that we are addressing. One being the nuclear risk, nuclear construction risk; the economy is at risk; and the regulatory environment was pointed out in Florida as a risk. The business environment issue is what we will be addressing, and how we are mitigating some of those risks, either through contracts or through things that are naturally occurring and improving like the economy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but do you feel you have been provided with, at Moody's, a level of equity that you guys could obtain, that would allow you to stabilize your ratings? Or do you feel that that number has not been provided to you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From an equity standpoint, it's not an equity issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Or a cash <mark type="inaudible" />. I guess what I'm saying is, of course you guys can choose to keep your ratings. If you make a decision to add equity, delever, there are choices that you have to keep your rating. And you may choose not to do that. So, that's what it sounds like to me today, and I'm trying to understand it, because you guys feel that it's unclear at Moody's what level ratios you need to have? Or is it that you have just chosen not &#x2013; like they are giving you numbers, but you are choosing not to get there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me make one point, Carrie. It's, we are not choosing to reduce our ratings. <mark type="inaudible" /> stand fast in trying to provide Moody's as much information about the future cash flow metrics that we see, the opportunities that we see from the marketplace from the improved economy, plus the risk mitigation measures that we have put in place around collection of costs around nuclear plants in Kemper County.</p>
          <p>So we are pushing those issues, in terms of providing Moody's with additional information. Financial integrity is critical to us, and we are going to focus on maintaining that credit quality. Now, we have done some assessments on what it would take to &#x2013; the impact of a downgrade at Moody's, and it looks like a 10-basis-point impact on a 30-year bond. Our objective, though, is to maintain credit quality.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I guess, and it's been some time since we've spoken, and I know maybe there's not a dramatic change in view, but obviously with you taking into the role, do you have any thoughts about balance sheet and credit quality that you could expand on?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Listen, I think it's just very consistent with what you've heard Paul describe. The only thing I would just add is that I think we are in solid shape with S&amp;P and Fitch. That this really is a discussion with Moody's about the business environment, just as Paul described. So David, Paul and I and others will go up there, and we'll have a good chat with them, and try and make them see the world our way.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Good afternoon. Two quick questions if I may. Number one, I don't think I recall that you &#x2013; I don't think you've given cash flow guidance for 2010. If you haven't, do you see a step-up in cash flow from operations in 2010 versus 2009?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would like to do is just have our team call you back, if it's all right, to get into the details of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. And as a second question, I don't know if you can answer this, but it may be the case that industrial sales were just starting to slow down, year-on-year, in July. Is there any indication of that, as a result of better comps last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's exactly the point. Remember, the third quarter of last year had the benefit of the Cash-for-Clunkers run-up. What we saw was the segment of our industrial customers associated with automobile manufacturing really tick up. And we moved to, our average monthly consumption in the industrial sector, to above 4,000 gigawatt-hours per month. We are running currently around 4300 gigawatt-hours per month. So from a standpoint of differences between July, August, September of '09 versus this quarter, you won't see that much of a difference, I don't think, in terms of percentage change.</p>

          <p>I have just a couple here, on your &#x2013; I think your said your requested ROE in the Georgia case is 11.95. How does that compare to the current allowed? What's the current allowed ROE, and what would like a delta of 1% do to your revenue request in Georgia?</p>

          <p>The current range right now &#x2013; Dan, this is Paul &#x2013; it's 10.25 to 12.25, it's a range with the midpoint set at 11.25. And a 1% change &#x2013; about $100 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the O&amp;M, the higher, the more normalized level of spending, when will that cycle? You know, so that you said that Q2 was a normalized level; will that cycle in Q4, or first quarter of next year, or when does that &#x2013; the comparisons become more comparable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will be the first part of next year, Dan. When you get into January, Q1 of 2011, you will have more of a comparable O&amp;M level. Remember also, the amount of O&amp;M reductions that we had last year were in the range of $230 million for '09, so you are seeing that come back, plus the normal activity that we have around our plants in maintenance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, I was wondering if you could give a little more color on the weakness you are seeing in commercial. You mentioned that that was according to your expectations, but at some point do you see higher activity out of the commercial sector, or is that business just going to be weak well into 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you recall, when we set out our forecast for this year we expected a positive .5% growth rate in commercial, which was relatively flat year-over-year. With the results that we've seen so far, we still see it being relatively flat year-over-year. There are some negative signs that are really showing up in our numbers relative to the grocery store segment, which is a big segment for us; that is a negative year-over-year result. And some of that is in the small category, when I say small grocery stores it's convenience stores or the smallest of the box stores which are materially being reduced in numbers.</p>
          <p>The other piece in the commercial sector, our year-over-year assessment of customer growth is down .5%. So that segment we expect to start picking back up in the fourth quarter, but again we will be watching it from a cautious standpoint.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And that's for the Southeast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that is the national number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the national number.  But you guys see the Southeast doing better. My understanding was that the economy there is better situated, I thought that you guys were indicating, as opposed to the U.S. economy as a whole?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How much should we add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you look at the economic data that's also &#x2013; when the economists said 2, 2.5, they had a assessment of the Southeast around 2.9% as well. So you get some numbers that are skewing on the upside if you will, the GDP numbers for the Southeast. But again, like we said in the first quarter, we're going to be cautious about making any predictions. The numbers are positive, but we also see indicators where inventories did drive some of that. We have some robust growth out of the steel manufacturing sector, and I'm sure you saw the Wall Street article that said prices are starting to come down, so those type of signals says here's a demand for these products.</p>
          <p>Our automobile segment, like I said in the opening statement, the production level of the unit is up 71%. Well remember, at the peak of automobile production we were producing almost 14 million units. At a 71% increase, we will be at 11 or 11.5 million units for the country, so we are still not back all the way to normal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so you're thinking about 2.9% for the second half. Did the economic summit suggest what you guys might be looking at in terms of 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We don't &#x2013; I don't have that in front of me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I was just curious. Okay. And then just finally, the RTP, any change in that or is it what you guys saw last quarter as well, and what you guys projected for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pretty much on track, as far as what we projected.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks a lot.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey guys, my apologies. Asked and answered.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thank you, Michael.</p>

          <p>And your final question will come from the line of Andrew Levi with Tudor Pickering.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Guys, just back on the equity question. Why not do a chunk of equity, and short the balance sheet, and move on? What's the thinking on kind of trying to do the DRiP and the ESOP and not just doing one big chunk, and kind of making the debt-holders happy and fixing your balance sheet, and making Moody's happy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, we've had those &#x2013; we've had that discussion last year when we opened up the dribble program, our continuous equity offering. And what we said at that time, which is true as well today, it is one that provides us a lot of flexibility to time the market appropriately for the value that we can get for our shares in the marketplace. Like last year, the dribble program provided 1.3 &#x2013; total program provided 1.3 billion, of about which 700 million was associated with the dribble program. I think that is the right mechanism to match our needs and the capital additions that we see to put equity into the marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the dribble program, do you have to authorize more, or is it basically you can continually do it, without board &#x2013; without any type of board increase or anything like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Each year we issue a shelf associated with a numbers we can put out in the marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And where are we right now on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe we have 10 million shares on the shelf right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And at this time there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, Michael. I appreciate your help. Paul Bowers just breathed a huge sigh of relief that this is his last earnings call. I want to take this opportunity to say 'thank you' to him; he has done an outstanding job in the role as chief financial officer for Southern. I know he has had an opportunity to get to know a lot of you folks, and hopefully you will express your appreciation to him. He is not getting out of the lineup, he's just moving into another spot. Art Beattie is appropriately concerned about picking up that responsibility, but he's going to do a good job. Tom Fanning is waiting in the wings to take over the reins, and all of that is as it should be. We look forward to the October call, and thank you for joining us today.</p>

          <p>Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Southern Company Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.</p>
