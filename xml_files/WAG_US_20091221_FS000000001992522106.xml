      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brendan, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. Today Greg Wasson, our President and CEO, will discuss the quarter's highlights, sales trends, and the macro environment. Wade Miquelon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will detail the first quarter financial results before we begin taking your calls.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rick, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on our call. We appreciate your continued interest in Walgreens. Today I'm going to review the highlights of this past quarter to update you on our sales trends and provide the latest on the progress we're making on our three strategic initiatives.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, we reported record earnings and sales with solid double-digit earnings growth even in this difficult economic environment. We also continued to generate strong cash flow, a direct result of improved working capital, especially inventory and drugstore performance.</p>
          <p>Net sales for the quarter were $16.4 billion, up 9.5% over a year ago. Net earnings were up 19.6% to $489 million from $408 million a year ago. Earnings per diluted share were $0.49, a 19.5% increase from $0.41 per diluted share last year, and this quarter includes the impact of $0.03 in restructuring and related costs.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations in the quarter more than tripled to nearly $1.2 billion from $312 million a year ago. Meanwhile, free cash flow stood at $864 million compared with a negative $326 million a year ago. This strong cash flow gives us the financial strength and flexibility to continue investments in our three core strategies. In the quarter, we also increased our dividend by 22% and bought back $150 million of company stock under the stock repurchase program we announced in October.</p>
          <p>Looking at our sales in more detail, comparable store trends improved in the first quarter. An early flu season and a well-executed flu shot campaign, which started a month earlier than last year, contributed substantially to the performance, especially in September and October. We saw some softening in November as this year's flu season declined, and we faced tougher comparisons with last year's flu season.</p>
          <p>The quarter saw some challenges, including a slow start to the holiday shopping season over Thanksgiving weekend, which dampened November sales. It's clear that consumer concerns about unemployment levels and the economic climate are weighing on spending. Consumers are focused on value, and discretionary items are not high on their shopping lists. That led to the weak sales trends we saw in late November, and that continued through mid-December. We entered the holiday season with lower inventory levels and with a focus on basics as we anticipated a cautious consumer. And while we don't report December sales results until next month, we believe we will see good sell-through on seasonal items.</p>
          <p>Like every Christmas season, our performance is driven by the final days, which makes this a big week. It could be more important this year as more consumers delayed their holiday shopping to last minute. The calendar works in our favor this year, with Christmas falling on a Friday. That means the convenience of our more than 7,100 drugstores with over half the U.S. population living within two miles of them will make them ideal destinations for last-minute shopping needs. And as always our stores will be open on Christmas Day.</p>
          <p>In addition to the final Christmas rush, we anticipate growing demand this week for H1N1 flu vaccine as additional supply is delivered. We're working with government agencies to obtain more H1N1 vaccine, and we intend to have it available at virtually all of our pharmacies as soon as possible. Mobilizing our pharmacy staffs for flu shots is a great example of how we're advancing the profession of pharmacy as a valuable resource on the front line of healthcare. Our pharmacists are going beyond the dispensing of medications to providing preventative healthcare services.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to update you on our three key strategies, which are leveraging the best store network in America, enhancing the customer experience, and achieving major cost reductions and productivity gains.</p>
          <p>We continue leveraging our existing store base and growing market share even as we slow our new store openings. Over the past seven years, as the prescription market has grown 16%, we've steadily grown our retail pharmacy market share from 13% in 2003 to 18.5% of all retail prescriptions today, according to IMS Health data. We see opportunities to continue that growth, not only through organic store openings, but also through comp store sales increases, prescription file purchases, and acquisitions that reinforce our core. An example of that is our recent transaction with Eaton Apothecary pharmacies in Boston, which is expected to close in January.</p>
          <p>As most of you know, one of our major initiatives as part of reinventing the customer experience is our customer-centric retailing format, which is now in more than 400 stores in Texas. The stores have better sight lines, a new layout organized around customer solutions, and an overall improved customer experience. We're pushing the CCR rollout a few weeks to the beginning of March so that we can also include our new store decor package with the conversion work. The decor package is an important piece of the overall CCR customer experience, which we want to include in this next wave of conversions. Expect to meet our goal of nearly 3,000 stores converted to CCR by the end of fall of 2010. Related to CCR, our beer and wine rollout is now in nearly 1,600 stores. This category provides another reason for customers to shop in our stores.</p>
          <p>So to sum up, CCR gives us a four-way win. It helps us improve sales. It takes work out of stores. It reduces working capital deployed. And it provides a better customer experience with greater relevancy and efficiencies.</p>
          <p>As we reinvent the customer experience, we are also transforming community pharmacy. We intend to create a new service model in which our pharmacists focus more on the patient than administrative tasks. Transforming community pharmacy will improve service, quality, and efficiency so that we can offer patients valuable new healthcare services that generate incremental revenue.</p>
          <p>As a first step, we implemented centralized pharmacy operations in Florida and Arizona and worked to fully leverage our workload balancing system. These centralized operations made a significant impact during the fall flu season in Florida, where our pharmacists provided more than 600,000 seasonal flu shots with virtually no additional payroll. Chain-wide, we provided more than 5 million seasonal flu shots this fall, up from 1.2 million fall for all of last year's flu season.</p>
          <p>As we expand from immunizations into other areas, we're taking our suite of health and wellness services to the marketplace by going directly to employers, government entities, managed care companies, and pharmacy benefit managers. Let me be clear. Our center of gravity is our community drugstores. And this slide shows the depth of our national footprint of pharmacy, health and wellness services, which include more than 7,100 retail pharmacies and a pipeline of more than 500 already approved new drugstore locations, over 350 Take Care clinics, more than 380 worksite health centers on the campuses of major employers, more than 110 pharmacies located in hospitals, clinics and medical centers, a specialty pharmacy distribution network with nine locations, five institutional pharmacies, and more than 100 home infusion and respiratory service centers, and finally two state-of-the-art prescription mail service facilities.</p>
          <p>This unique set of services allows us to tailor our offering to the needs of our clients. For example, we recently expanded our relationship with Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield, for which we currently are a provider of specialty and home infusion services for their members. We now also offer Highmark employees access to worksite health centers and pharmacies at their Pittsburgh and Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, offices, creating a unique employer healthcare solution. What makes this important is that we are bringing more services directly to not only employers but also to managed care companies and PBMs. Our bundled programs are an example of how the private sector is innovating to make healthcare more accessible and affordable.</p>
          <p>And finally, we continue to make significant progress on our strategy to reduce costs and improve productivity. As you see from this chart, we achieved our goal this quarter of gross profit dollar growth exceeding our SG&amp;A dollar growth. And we remain on track to deliver $1 billion in annual savings in fiscal 2011.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we plan to build on the progress we made this quarter. We have the right strategy in place and remain very confident in our ability to execute it. At the same time, we are cautious in our view of the economy and will focus on consumers' basic needs. In this environment, we have an opportunity to drive our winning strategies, while others may not have the resources to do the same. Our strong cash flow and balance sheet provides us with flexibility to invest in programs and opportunities for future growth.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile in D.C. &#x2013; Washington, D.C. &#x2013; talks continue on a healthcare reform bill. Certainly remains difficult to say what a final bill may look like, but in general we support the Obama administration's guiding principles of improved access, greater affordability, and higher quality as part of any reform platform. The shift in focus to preventing and managing chronic disease by emphasizing health and wellness is something we intend to capitalize on. Our extensive network of community pharmacies and more than 70,000 health professionals position us on the front line of healthcare. Our pharmacists and nurse practitioners can have a positive impact on people's behavior through direct, face-to-face interaction.</p>
          <p>And finally, I'd like to thank three Board members who announced last month that they will retire from our Board of Directors at January's Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Cordell Reed and Marilou von Ferstel provided invaluable insight and contributed greatly to the Board over many years. And Charles R. Walgreen III, grandson of our founder, is retiring after 46 years of Board service.</p>
          <p>As we said in our Annual Report that many of you recently received, his legacy surrounds us. When he started with the company in 1952, we had 403 stores. By the time he retired as CEO in 1998, Cork expanded the company to nearly 3,000 stores. Along the way, he built a record of sustained success, provided huge career opportunities for thousands of people throughout the company, and established a culture of quiet determination. In October, I really enjoyed the chance to be with Cork at the grand opening of our 7,000th store. He's provided amazing leadership, and we're really going to miss him. Cork, we wish you, Cordell, and Marilou the best in retirement.</p>
          <p>I want to thank all of our Walgreen team members for their contributions to these strong results as well. I also want to wish them and all of you a happy holiday season. And now Wade will give you an update on financial results for the quarter. Wade?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>Let me get into the details behind our financial results. In the quarter, net sales increased 9.5% while total comp sales rose 4.9%. Prescription sales rose 10% and represented 56% of sales for the quarter. Prescription sales in comp stores rose a solid 6.1%, and that was helped by 1.1 percentage point from our flu shot program, a program which we led the drugstore industry.</p>
          <p>We filled 194 million prescriptions during the quarter, an increase of 12% from a year ago, and that includes the benefit of 0.7 percentage points from patients filling 90-day rather than 30-day scripts. On a comp store basis, the number of prescriptions filled increased 9.2%, and that includes the benefit of 1.2 percentage points from 90-day scripts. We exceeded by 5.5 percentage points the industry-wide pharmacy growth rate, excluding Walgreens, as reported by IMS, and that is in line with the trend over the past six months.</p>
          <p>As Greg mentioned and I'm pleased to report, earnings per diluted share were $0.49 in the quarter or $489 million, including the impact of $0.03 in restructuring and related costs and $0.08 in savings associated with the company's Rewiring for Growth initiative. This reflects a 19.5% increase from $0.41 per diluted share or $408 million in the same period a year ago. Excluding restructuring charges, earnings per share would have been $0.52.</p>
          <p>Gross profit in the first quarter was $4.5 billion, a 9.3% increase versus the year-ago quarter. Gross margin decreased 10 basis points compared with the year-ago quarter to 27.7%. Negatively impacting margins were front-end product mix, non-retail businesses, and CCR markdowns. Helping overall margins was an increase in retail pharmacy margins due to the impact of generics and flu shots, although those gains were partially offset by third-party reimbursement pressure including the impact of AWP changes on Medicaid prescriptions. Also helping margins was a lower LIFO provision compared with the year-ago quarter.</p>
          <p>The two-year stacked SG&amp;A dollar growth shows improvement compared with the year-ago quarter, dropping from 18.6% to 16% and up from the fourth quarter two-year growth rate of 14.1%. Clearly as we cycle these comparisons, it becomes more difficult to continue that pace of SG&amp;A reduction. Given the inherent complexity of our business, we want to provide you with a better understanding of the key drivers and building blocks of SG&amp;A growth. So, let's review those drivers in detail.</p>
          <p>First, store openings, which we anticipate at 4.5 to 5% this year. But on a four-quarter moving average basis, the store count will effectively grow 6 to 7%. This tempers the immediate benefit to SG&amp;A of our slower store openings. Our four-quarter moving average remains high, and as you won't see a significant dip in that average until the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, at that point we expect to see some SG&amp;A leverage from our slowdown in store openings.</p>
          <p>Second driver to keep in mind is inflation, which we expect to run about 2 to 3%. Third, acquisition and business mix SG&amp;A is anticipated to increase about 1 to 2%. Fourth, CCR resets, as Greg mentioned; we plan to have nearly 3,000 stores converted by the end of fall 2010. And these were at a cost of 30,000 to $50,000 per store. And then there's always a few other puts and calls in any quarter that take place.</p>
          <p>Finally, while Rewiring for Growth is expected to provide a net benefit of $500 million, the net benefit to SG&amp;A is expected to be about $425 million in fiscal 2010. This chart summarizes the savings and costs for Rewiring for Growth restructuring charges since the initiative has started in last year's first quarter. Total Rewiring expenses this quarter were $42 million. We anticipate approximately $140 million in Rewire expenses in fiscal 2010. And we remain on target for net pre-tax savings of about $500 million this fiscal year and a net pre-tax savings of $1 billion in fiscal 2011, both versus our base of 2008.</p>
          <p>Now, let's review some additional income statement details. The LIFO provision was $34 million versus $43 million in the first quarter of 2009, and that represents an anticipated LIFO provision of 1.75% for the year. It's also lower than the 2% we anticipated heading into the quarter and the 2% that we recorded in fiscal 2009.</p>
          <p>Next are the $42 million in restructuring cost in the quarter, including $28 million in SKU discontinuation, $7 million in consulting and other costs, and $7 million associated with work force reductions.</p>
          <p>Net interest expense was $21 million compared with $15 million last year, due to the issuance of $1 billion in long-term debt in January 2009. Net interest expense benefited from a fixed-rate to floating-rate swap executed in July 2009 on the $1.3 billion note issued a year prior. The effective tax rate was 37% compared with a rate of 37.6% in the year-ago period, and we expect a tax rate of approximately 37% for the fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable are all components of working capital that we can most directly impact, and the net sum of these as a percent of sales has improved by 24% in the quarter, primarily due to inventory improvement. And I should mention that accounts receivable benefited from timing issues this quarter, but even without that, receivables would have been virtually flat.</p>
          <p>Total inventories were down $800 million or 9.9% against total sales growth of 9.5% and total drugstore growth of 7.8%. Among other interventions, we were helped by our SKU rationalization program, which is now roughly 80% complete. FIFO total inventories on a per-store basis fell 13.7% in the first quarter. Controlling inventory continues to be a top priority, and as you can see we have made great strides over the past four quarters.</p>
          <p>Controlling inventory of course helps cash. Our net cash position at the end of the quarter was $773 million, which compares favorably with net cash of $236 million at the end of the fourth quarter and a net debt of over $1.5 billion at the end of last year. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $3.2 billion, and long-term debt totaled $2.4 billion. And we were also able to pay out $136 million in dividends during the quarter and buy back $150 million in company stock. Our financial flexibility and liquidity are in very good shape.</p>
          <p>Greg gave you the details on cash flow performance, but this slide shows the comparisons and improvements in cash that we have generated from store operations and improved working capital. We plan to continue returning cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and buybacks. And you will recall that our September dividend was a 22.2% increase over the year-ago quarter. And in addition, we set a long-term dividend payout target of between 30 and 35% of net earnings.</p>
          <p>And as I mentioned, we also announced a $2 billion stock repurchase program at the same time. And by the end of the first quarter, we had repurchased $150 million in company stock under the program. Now, you'll recall the plan was approved in mid-October, which left us with a limited number of open trading days to make purchases.</p>
          <p>Well, in closing, I remain very optimistic about Walgreens' future, with many opportunities as we focus on executing our core strategies. And we will continue to drive smart growth, both organically and through smart acquisitions, including prescription file purchases. I emphasize smart growth because it's all built around prudent risk-taking and ROIC focus, designed to deliver long-term shareholder value.</p>
          <p>To reiterate Greg's point, we are confident in our strategy and cautious about the economy. As we move through this uncertain economy, we continue to be agile and do what's right and drive smart decisions for both the short and the long term. And building on Greg's earlier comments, I also want to thank everyone at Walgreens for all of the accomplishments this quarter. It would not have been possible without all of our team members' efforts. We thank them for that, and we wish them and you a happy holiday season.</p>
          <p>And now I'll turn the call back over to Rick.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Wade. Folks, that concludes our prepared remarks. Brendan, we're now ready to take questions.</p>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And we'll take our first question from Ed Kelly with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Good morning, guys. Hey, Wade, you gave the number of about $425 million in net benefits -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; for Rewire, and that's &#x2013; I mean, previously you'd been saying $500 million; isn't that correct? And is there something that's changed there to bring that number down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we've &#x2013; obviously, it's 500 net benefit year-to-year. But we want to do is point out that if you do the reconciliation of where one-time costs have gone &#x2013; because some of those one-time costs go in items like COGS &#x2013; that the SG&amp;A impact is 425, but the total impact in terms of P&amp;L is 500. And we can give you the detailed breakdown of again, where the benefits are coming through and where the costs, and then you can do the reconciliation from SG&amp;A to COGS and other.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So in your mind, there's zero change in the way that you're looking at this or in your expectations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there's zero change. I mean, as we give the detail on the P&amp;L line items, though, I don't think we've ever done a clear reconciliation of exactly how the difference hits the various lines, and that's what we want to do here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. And then just the cost savings in general, obviously you continue to progress towards realizing more cost savings on a quarterly basis. How should this flow for the year? Is this something that takes place sort of fairly even where it'll continue to build each quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A little bit, but I'd say it's always going to be a little bit lumpy, because different initiatives are timed when they're timed, right? Things like inventory clean out when they clean out, and the other ones, depending on when they're announced or when they're planned, they can have different impacts. So yes, it's going to build, but I wouldn't say it would be perfectly linear. And we can't always even predict it exactly because again of the timing of certain events.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And as we think about the gross margin, how should we be looking at this line item for the rest of the year? I mean, you got some benefit this quarter from the flu shot; comparisons ease quite a bit over the next couple quarters. Is it unreasonable to think that your gross margin should be up for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, maybe I'll jump in there, Ed, on this one. Yeah, I think that obviously we're going to continue to see a cautious consumer, that's going to be looking for non-discretionary products and more value. We're also going to be counting on that reimbursement pressure on pharmacy. But I do think obviously where we're going to try to counter the margin pressure obviously will be to drive more private brand. I think there's more opportunity in pharmacy to drive more services such as seasonal flu. But we're definitely going to continue to see a cautious consumer, so I think that it's tough to predict right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just on the share repurchase side. I know, Wade, you touched on it. I was a little disappointed; I thought the number would be higher. What should we expect going forward, do you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess as I alluded to, we actually didn't have a lot of days from the time we announced the program to where we weren't in blackout. So I think given that, actually 150 million was pretty good. So I don't know exactly, Ed, I did throw a number out there but, I can say, we certainly &#x2013; 150 doesn't reflect that we weren't confident in buying our stock back. It was really just a matter of number of trading days we had available.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are, by the way, setting up a 10b-5 so that we'll be able to purchase even when we are in blackout, systemically through the rules of that program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, perfect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, if you could just talk a little bit about the discounting environment on the front-end right now &#x2013; I mean, it sounds like the sales are a little softer, and I'm curious if that has kind of spurred more discounting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Mark, Greg here. I think that certainly there are a lot of folks out there driving promotions, and I think we've seen softer seasonal sales than we had last year. I think as far as the promotions, we've been and will remain pretty surgical on where we're going with markdowns and promotions. I think the good thing is that we anticipated a softer season, bought down in seasonal goods last year, and I think we're in better shape, so we're &#x2013; won't need to be as aggressive in markdowns post holiday. Last year, quite the opposite happened. We had to be aggressive; we had a lot left over. So I think we're going to be extremely surgical about where we go with markdowns, additional promotions, and try to balance that with swinging doors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just all the commentary on the SG&amp;A components; are you trying to tell us that investors have gotten a little ahead of you on expectations on the SG&amp;A reduction? Or just a little signal that 2010 is a little too high right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess what I'd say is, we're completely confident in the savings we're going to deliver. But again, because, I think, of some of these components, I'm not sure that everyone has the same understanding and clarity of the different building blocks of how we get there. So for example, right, when you think about the impact of SG&amp;A on new stores, it's not the number you do for the year, it's the 12-year impact that you cycle, and that's considerably higher.</p>
          <p>So I think &#x2013; I guess what I would say is, I think you've got all the building blocks now to do the math. But again, making sure that people have kind of the understanding and the clarity of what goes in there, I think, is important so that over time, people can see the direct impact of the Rewire initiative, and how it flows through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Mark, I'd add, we feel pretty good about the job we've done in the past four quarters with store SG&amp;A, and our store folks have done a tremendous job. So certainly we're going to be comping those tougher months or quarters going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, Wade, is there any way you could quantify how big the AWP hit was on gross margin this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know it was about $25 million, so that range, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it was pretty much &#x2013; this is Greg, Mark. It's pretty much in line with our forecast that we had given for the year. And we're watching it monthly, but so far it's pretty much what we predicted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Eric.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you talk a little bit about how the reset store strategy is evolving? You talked today about the decor and push it into March. Can you just talk about how that whole thinking is progressing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Greg here, Eric. Certainly we started off with the 35 pilot stores. We're able to compare performance of those versus the control stores that we had set up. We're still feeling good about how they're performing versus control. The next phase was to go to Houston and Dallas, roll out mass markets, which we completed about mid-October. The learnings there was, one, how do we roll this out in a mass market versus individual stores around the country? And I think a lot of good learnings came out of that to help us improve that process and reduce the cost of the rollout itself.</p>
          <p>We're still analyzing, obviously, numbers coming out of Dallas and Houston to look at maybe if there's opportunities to improve before we roll out in March. The real reason for delaying it the two weeks into March is we do want to add the decor package, and it didn't make sense for us to start a rollout before that new decor package was finalized. I actually we saw it Saturday. We got good results on it; I liked what I saw. So by March 1 we're rolling out both the conversion as well as the new decor package in parallel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does the addition of the decor package change the cost or the time to implement meaningfully?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, but it was always factored into the cost, and it pretty much can be done in parallel. But again, I think making sure that we have it right is important to the overall proposition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it was included in the 30 to 50,000 total cost that we've been talking about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And as you &#x2013; the data has moved on with Houston and Dallas, what have you learned? I think you talked about maybe a comped improvement you needed of a point or two to make the math work. Can you talk about how that's going?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're still analyzing data. The only thing that kind of threw a kink in it is we probably wouldn't have picked Houston, because we're comping a hurricane there, so it's been kind of difficult to get apples-to-apples numbers. I think the key learnings that we're really addressing and looking at is, again, we're looking at SKU by SKU, did we take out some SKUs that maybe we needed to add back? But we feel good with the 3,500 items that we have reduced.</p>
          <p>I also think what we want to do is look at kind of local unique stores. For example, we're &#x2013; this has worked well in the majority of our stores that are pretty much according to prototype, but when we begin to look at maybe Hispanic stores, African-American stores, maybe beach stores and so forth, the uniqueness there is what we want to now address. But we'll have more data, and I think hopefully by our next quarter call, we'll be able to share more. I think we'll have a good two months to drive through the data and analyze it and give you more color on the next call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then lastly, on the beer and wine rollout, can you give us any sense on is the comp benefit from that material, and how's the profitability of that influence the overall store?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We're in about 1,600 stores now. The comp benefit will be material. We think that it &#x2013; not only will it drive sales, but also it's an nice basket item. It drives basket size as well. As far as the margin, we're really working through the mix now as far as what we hope to attain. We've got a private label wine that we just launched that has a little higher margin we feel good about. So &#x2013; but we'll know more about that as well as we come through the season.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Can you give us -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; some more details around H1N1? I guess, what is your internal expectations, how many flu shots do you think you'll receive, and I guess the economics? I'm assuming that you get the flu shots for free and then you're just charging an incremental charge to administer it. So how should we look at that I guess in the coming months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ann, it's Greg. It's kind of hard to predict, because we're really working with obviously the government and the individual states. Most of the states at this time have worked through what they call the priority high-risk population, and now they're opening distribution up to pharmacies across the country. We have provider agreements in 49 states, excluding North Dakota. We have product in about 3,000 stores in 36 states today, and we've given about 350,000 H1N1 vaccinations to-date. It would really depend, Ann, on how the states begin to open up and utilize pharmacists across the country. We think they will.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we're working with the states and the government to make sure that they understand how we can help.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from David Magee with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just &#x2013; not be simplistic, but on the SG&amp;A side, if I'm hearing you correctly, we should be looking for the kind of the same type of differential over the next couple of quarters. I know that year-to-year comparisons get maybe a little bit tougher, but on two-year basis, it looks actually fairly flat. And I'm just &#x2013; so the improvement we saw this quarter, is it fair we should just kind of assume that's a good proxy for the next couple of quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, kind of again, you got to kind of run the model out quarter by quarter and put in the timing of how that store lag happens, and like I said, things like the CCR. The CCR initiative is almost all SG&amp;A contract labor resetting stores, so when those stores hit and things like that. So I'd say it's a little more complicated than that, but in general you're probably not too far off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just a follow-up on the pharmacy side. You talked about the AWP hit. I'm assuming some of that's being offset by a better dispensing fee at certain states. Any other positive offsets to that we can look forward to as the year goes on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I think &#x2013; David, Greg. I think &#x2013; we are working state-by-state to try to get improved dispensing fees, and that's certainly something we're focused on. I think that things like improving our generic penetration rate to help offset it, the services we're talking about with flu shots and so forth that we're going to be rolling out will help offset some of that. We're also looking at taking out the supply chain costs as well and operating costs with our transforming community pharmacy initiative, as well as our supply chain efforts to try to offset it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Will generics be a net positive or negative this year? We have another kind of light year ahead of us here, and I'm just wondering how the profitability levels will be for that product anyway?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think obviously we're not going to see another big wave until latter half of 2010, 2011 on generics. But at the same time, we work to improve our utilization, our penetration of generics &#x2013; of the existing generics &#x2013; as much as we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks for taking my question. I'd like to just go back and talk a little bit more about Medicaid. The states all have pretty significant budget problems. Do you think that they're looking at the AWP cut as maybe sufficient for them to cut their Medicaid reimbursement, or are you expecting that there could be another round of cuts as they try to balance their budget?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question, Meredith; this is Greg. I think it's hard to say. It varies state by state. I think some of them may see the reduction as sufficient. Some, depending on the state, may be looking for more. And we're just going to have to certainly work with each state individually and try to bring them all other solutions to help reduce costs. But believe me, we've got focus on each individual state today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the states generally don't do much to incent patients to fill with generics. Is that changing? Are they getting more understanding about the benefit of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're working with them to help them understand that for every X percent in generic utilization, there's X percent savings. And I think us getting with state Medicaid directors and helping educate them and look for alternative solutions is exactly where we're going.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, Mike, I have another question just about AMP. Can you give us an update about where that stands; is that going to put into place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's obviously hard to predict what comes out of the healthcare reform. Certainly with the Senate probably passing something, they're most likely passing something before the holiday. There is AMP legislation and language in both bills. We feel good about the new definition of AMP, how the benchmark is established, and we're obviously looking to make sure we get enough of a multiplier on top of that AMP to make sure that pharmacists can afford to continue to serve Medicaid patients across the country.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from Debra Weinswig with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks so much. Obviously, the flu-shot program by any measure has been a huge success. So two questions. One, what did you learn from this that you can apply to potentially other initiatives internally? And then have you done any analysis around the retention rate of the new customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Debra, I think the first thing this tells me and tells us is that this is a great illustration that consumers across the country value the convenience and access that community pharmacists can bring in addition to prescription drugs. For us to administer better than 5% of the nation's seasonal flu shots I think basically indicates that.</p>
          <p>As far as the learnings, I think certainly there are ways that now if we go into next season we're going to be able to improve the process as far as some of the administration work and so forth as patients come in. But I think as far as new services, there's plenty of opportunity to do more script-like services in our community pharmacists such as flu shots.</p>
          <p>Retention rate, I think we saw that about 40 to 42% of the flu shot patients were new to Walgreens. We won't know the retention probably for another 30, 60, 90 days. Certainly that's something we'll be analyzing to get a better understanding of that. And then once we do know, then next year we can certainly work to make sure that we have good programs out there to improve that retention rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then in terms of POWER, can you talk about the savings &#x2013; and obviously it's just been a few markets that have been driven so far by the initiatives &#x2013; and how should we think about a rollout plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, kind of the big idea here, as we call it, is transform community pharmacy, of which POWER, as you know, is one initiative. There's other things &#x2013; dynamic workload balancing, some of the reengineering efforts we're doing. But so far so good in POWER. As you know, we're strong in two states now, and Florida is over 10% of our business. And we've rolled out now in Arizona &#x2013; Phoenix &#x2013; but so far so good. We're seeing, again &#x2013; we're seeing good customer service levels now. We're seeing more importantly a lot of time freed up for other things. In Florida in flu shots, we gave 15% or more of our total flu shots in Florida without adding any overtime pay. And honestly that would not have been possible or even remotely possible without the POWER initiative to pull some of that transactional work out.</p>
          <p>So we feel very good about it. Again, it's taking shorter time to fill pharmacy, and wait times is one of the key elements of success. So that's helping as well. But we feel good about it, and we feel that both the front end and the central-fill have broader applications across the country.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think with transforming community pharmacy, that initiative, there's really kind of three buckets there that we talk about. One is what we're doing within Florida and Arizona with centralization and some of these tasks that Wade just mentioned. The other is we're continuing to leverage the dynamic workload balancing technology system across the entire nation to leverage excess capacity in some stores to help others. And then third, really, we're just going back into the existing pharmacies and looking at the complete workflow and the work process that takes place to continue to find ways to improve processes and take costs out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then last question. Can you talk about traffic and ticket in the quarter, and were there any real differences by month?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you repeat the question? Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, can you talk about traffic and ticket in the quarter, and were there any real differences by month?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Debra. I think we're seeing traffic hold pretty good. We're up in traffic. We are down a little bit in ticket. Our units per customer are running a little bit down. So therefore, we feel good that we're swinging doors, people are coming in, and that kind goes to the promotional point that we don't really need to overpromote people to get inside. The real focus now is driving and working basket size and unit per customer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And even though our traffic has been kind of robust, as Greg suggested, over the quarter, it was a bit heavier in September-October, driven by the flu shots traffic. But still, even as today, we still feel pretty good about what we're seeing in the numbers.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. You guys redid your distribution contract with Cardinal. How much did that help in the gross margin in the November quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, it's Greg. That must have been over, what, a year ago, I guess, at this point in time. But certainly we worked with Cardinal. They're our main supplier, and obviously we feel like we've got good costs and a good rate with Cardinal. But we don't give that out, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Has that then been part of &#x2013; when you talk about your gross profit savings in Rewire &#x2013; I'm sorry, not in Rewire. But when you talk about your gross profit savings as part of your $1 billion, is that the SKU rationalization, or how should we think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean the $1 billion CCR -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. You said &#x2013; you broke it out &#x2013; it's not all SG&amp;A; part of it's gross profit, part of it's &#x2013; could you just talk a little more about the gross profit savings, of the $1 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yeah, let me explain. The Rewire for Growth initiative, which will have ultimately a $1 billion benefit, in the short term some of the one-time costs are in things like SG&amp;A, consulting fees, and reduction in force, et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But a lot of the one-time costs are in cost of goods for inventory write-downs due to SKU elimination and the like. So it's the timing of the one-times in cost of goods year-on-year that means that de facto all of this doesn't flow net to SG&amp;A. So we can give a reconciliation table, but you'll see year-by-year benefit and year-by-year costs, and some of those costs end up being in SG&amp;A, and some of those costs end up being COGS, and some end up being in other. And you have to reconcile each one of those to know where the net impact shakes out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'm sorry. I misunderstood. So is there any &#x2013; once you work through this short term, is there any cost savings in your gross profit line long term, or is it all going to be in SG&amp;A once you get through the -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's going to be in SG&amp;A basically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All of it's going to be in SG&amp;A. Okay, I misunderstood that. I'm sorry. And then I guess my &#x2013; there was a pretty big cancer injectable drug that went off patent in August, Eloxatin. Just to clarify, through your specialty you're not really participating in any of the oncology market? And is that a market that you're looking at long term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. John, to clarify, yeah, we are in the oncology space, and we anticipate playing a bigger role in oncology going forward. Frankly, our infusion platform that we have built over the last couple years with OptionCare positions us extremely well to play in oncology going forward, because a lot of those drugs are not only injected, but they're infused drugs. So we definitely think we can put together a unique service model to work with both payers and pharmaceutical companies that are in the oncology space.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then lastly, just sequentially in the February quarter as the flu shots slow down &#x2013; just isolating the flu shot in your gross margin in the November quarter going to the February quarter, how should we be thinking about pulling that out in the February quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, there's a lot of different puts and calls. Obviously we had, as you know, the basic flu in this quarter, and then next quarter we'll have some H1N1. How much remains to be seen, as Greg said. So those are effectively helps because of the margin and how that flows through. We also have some other things like reimbursement pressure, which might have slight different timing quarter-to-quarter. So again, I think that it's probably a little bit too early to say how all those will flow through exactly, especially because H1N1 remains a little bit of an unknown for now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

          <p>Thanks, Andy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. Greg, did I hear you say you expect a good sell-through for Christmas? And if I heard you right, is that more driven by the lean inventories or sort of the day fall, or do you have some history that says, when there's a big snowfall, it kind of &#x2013; with this kind of timing it's going to force people to the stores as well or <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andy, to that weather point, I tell people this is the time of year when a retailer becomes a weatherman. But I do think that based on our position going in, that depending on how this last week certainly comes together, I feel pretty good with as far as where we'll be on the amount of seasonal left over that we've to reduce.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; and then last year, as I said, I think it's an opportunity for us. Last year, all retailers out there certainly were in a position with some pretty large carryover quantities. So I think &#x2013; I guess the combination of where I believe we are this year, depending on how this last week comes through, and as compared to last year, I think there's opportunity there for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can you remind me, did you make a concerted effort last year to reduce the pack-away, which really takes some margin hits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we &#x2013; I don't think you'd say our philosophy had changed much. We had always kind of had a pretty aggressive markdown where we'd go 50% maybe throughout the season. And then depending on the quantity of the item, we have a pretty sophisticated system that will help us determine what that markdown needs to be. Is it 50%, do we need to go to 75%? Based on last year's inventory level, we were &#x2013; in many cases we were on the more aggressive end of that markdown program. So nothing's really changed as far as our carryover or our pack-away program. I think this year, as I said, I think we're in a better position so I'm not as concerned about the aggressive markdowns that we took last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and my other question, could you update us more on the direct-to-payer initiatives that you've started? And I think you just briefly mentioned it. Maybe could you quantify maybe the number of folks you're talking to or proposals on the table, or what kind of expectations you might expect to see for &#x2013; close deals similar to the ones you had with Caterpillar in maybe the next year or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Andy, I think first of all I want to clarify: When we talk about going direct to employers, managed care organizations, PBMs, we're talking about going direct with all of our services. And I think if you go back in time five, 10 years ago when the industry was a little more fragmented, it was a little more difficult for a drugstore chain to go direct to an employer or direct to managed care organization.</p>
          <p>Today with our suite of services, we have everything that an employer or managed care organization would like to take to their clients. So we're talking about going direct &#x2013; especially going direct with retail pharmacy programs. Our work sites, which are now &#x2013; I mean, what I would say becoming more of a employer healthcare solution to take to employers as well as managed care organizations. So we've got a robust pipeline. If you look at the employer healthcare solution model, a lot of employers that are interested in trying to figure out how to control their healthcare costs while improve the quality of health for employees, there's a lot of interest in that product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And lastly for Wade &#x2013; sneak one more in, but just a technical one. The 400 &#x2013; the Texas stores, did the cost to do that, is that in part of the 42 million in restructuring, or is that in addition to, or was that captured under previous quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The cost of all the CCR refurbs is not included in the kind of one-time cost, so it's a separate initiative. And again, this 30,000 to $50,000 per store is mostly SG&amp;A, mostly SG&amp;A, and again, for the Texas area we don't have the refurb package in yet, and that will be coming &#x2013; the refresh package will be coming on the next wave of all stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so was most of the work completed the quarter you just reported, or sort of split with the prior quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, a little bit split.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from John Heinbockel with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Greg, if you look at what you're seeing from the consumer, do you think they have slowed down their spending here in the last month and half, or do you think you guys as a channel are getting crowded out by mall-based retailers as people kind of go back and spend on those type of products, such that post-Christmas you don't get crowded out as much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John, I do think that it's the consumer &#x2013; macro consumer in general. And I think they are indeed spending less on discretionary, and I think that includes seasonal this year. I don't believe we're being crowded out. I think what we are seeing every &#x2013; for the past several seasons, whether it's Halloween, back-to-school, or Christmas, we are seeing shoppers that are becoming more and more last minute. And that's the reason we said this week obviously is an important week for us, because I think we're well positioned to take advantage of those last-minute shoppers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When you think about the consumer, if that's the case, then January's not going to be a lot different than December. When you think about the consumer getting healthier, do you think your comps &#x2013; well, outside of CCR and beer and wine &#x2013; that your comps will basically keep pace with the labor market and unemployment and that'll be the telltale sign for an improvement in comps?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I do think that post the Christmas holiday season, there are a lot of non-discretionary purchases with seasonal goods.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think once we get through the holiday, we should see less of an effect on pure seasonal merchandising and the effect it has on our comp.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And as part of the CCR retool with the decor package, are you making any other changes to departments, whether it be cosmetics, or it's basically just the decor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With CCR 1, as we kind of call it, which is basically the refresh that we're talking about in Houston and Dallas, and in the addition of decor package, that's pretty much as is. We are looking at certainly the modifications, and maybe the changes that we learned regarding SKUs and so forth that I mentioned earlier. We are indeed looking at additional opportunities to improve the format, whether it's in beauty, whether it's in expanded food, and beginning to look at pilots and a better understanding of how we can improve the experience and become more relevant to the future shopper.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So we could see that &#x2013; that could be part of CCR 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know if I'd call it part of CCR. I think that -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; I think CCR, you'll see a CCR 2, which will be discontinued modification improvement of the refresh that we have out there now. I think some of these others I'm talking about, John, would be bigger format changes as we understand how we can leverage that footprint that we have now in areas like beauty, food, and so forth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And finally, Wade, just two quick ones, the CCR cost, how much of that is incremental as opposed to what you normally would've spent? And then secondly, you guys now have 3 billion plus of gross cash. How do you think about doing something with that, because obviously you're not earning much from the bank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the CCR cost, effectively almost all of it is incremental, and it's really -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; it's really because of the nature of how we're executing it. We're doing it very quick, we're using outside crews and things to make sure we have minimal disruption in our stores. So &#x2013; now, again, we're hoping the benefits of CCR kind of help close to pay for this thing on the run. So that's how we've kind of positioned and talked about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And again, I think in terms of the size of the investment, it's actually a pretty minuscule investment relative to the impact that we get in the stores and expect to get.</p>
          <p>On cash, I mean we've laid out our cash priorities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously it's not great having money in the bank earning almost no interest, but we also want to be very smart and very ROIC-driven. So just because we're generating cash doesn't mean that we're going to feel compelled to do something that doesn't earn a good, robust return for the company and for the shareholder. So -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we have time for one more question. Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin with Jefferies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, thanks. I'll be quick; I know we're at the end of the call. So I just wanted to go back to the CCR in Houston. Is that helping or hurting sales? I know we kind of didn't answer what it's moving comps up by, but is it &#x2013; do you guys view it as helping sales at this stage or hurting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Scott, it's, as I said earlier, it's a little too early to tell with some of the variables that we've got thrown at us right now, as far as the season and the hurricane. We're confident in Houston and so forth. But believe me, we'll have better insight by the next call and be able to feel a little bit better about where we are and what kind of numbers we are seeing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Note that all these stores always had a planned dip, just from the initial &#x2013; not shutdown, but just the work going on. So we've modeled what that planned dip is. In most cases, we're doing better than the planned dip. But still there is a structural bend as you get into this initially.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So as we look at 3,000 &#x2013; and I guess I also had a question on the decor package. My impression being down in Houston was you actually did switch the decor package, and so is this, say, another switch of decor? Just a clarification there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Scott, it's a good question. And when we went in, we gave a refresh to the existing decor package, which was minimal in cost, but what we're looking at rolling out in March is a complete new decor package different graphics and so forth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, Wade, talking about the dip, as we do 3,000 stores, any magnitude there of what kind of &#x2013; and is it mostly front-end, or how do we look at the dip?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, mostly front-end. It's something that &#x2013; it's a &#x2013; we haven't given a number, but it's something that &#x2013; get for two, three weeks, come out of it, and then go positive. But I don't think it's going to be that material that I would worry too much about it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then one final thing on the SG&amp;A, just so I &#x2013; I know we're kind of beating this a little bit &#x2013; but are your thought process here that &#x2013; and I think you said that kind of 7 to 8% growth range there, that would seem to be a little bit above where the Street was and could take your earnings down below the 240 level illustrating I guess is down there, is that how I should be looking at this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, the reason we gave clarity on SG&amp;A first and foremost was just because we want to make sure that we maintained transparency and credibility with you and all of our stakeholders in terms of these Rewire for Growth benefits so that people can see that they actually are being delivered. And again, because there's lots of moving parts in that SG&amp;A and in some cases maybe lack of clarity on how the new stores, the rolling average, how that impacts, whatever. There is kind of a wide range out there in terms of how SG&amp;A is modeled. But that, I think, is really the key thing that we wanted to focus on with this, is just to make sure that people understood how should they look at SG&amp;A, how can they have confidence over time that in fact these Rewire savings are being delivered as committed.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And consulting fees in the quarter &#x2013; and that's my last one &#x2013; what were they?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it was about 7 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>7 million, so that's coming down nicely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, clearly over time, I think we feel we did the right thing by getting lots of outside help. So &#x2013; because in fact a lot of what we've been doing is kind of changing the tires while the car is moving, and our people are working very hard in their day jobs. So the additional capability has been helpful so that we can keep running the business. But clearly over time we've got lot of great people, and we'd like to be much less reliant upon that and much more dependent upon our great people.</p>

          <p>Folks, that was our final question. Thank you for joining us today. We'll announce December sales on January 6. Please note that reflects our new schedule of announcing monthly sales on the third business day of the month rather than the second business day. The following week, we will hold our Annual Shareholders' Meeting on January 13 at Navy Pier in Chicago, starting at 2 p.m. Central time. Afterward we will host a Q&amp;A session for analysts who are attending. We hope to see you there.</p>
          <p>Our next quarterly financial announcement will be Tuesday, March 23. That's when we will announce fiscal 2010 second quarter results. Until then, thank you for listening, and have a happy holiday and a great new year.</p>
