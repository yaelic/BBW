      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks very much for coming. We do appreciate your flexibility in accommodating a slightly different time than usual.</p>
          <p>What I would like to do is to start off this morning by briefly reviewing the highlights of our performance in the first half and put them into the context of the longer-term development of the group. Tim will provide you, as always with the texture and detail behind the numbers and then we'll go to the question-and-answer session.</p>
          <p>In my presentation, I'm going to focus on two key areas. First, an overview of the results that we achieved in the first half, and I'll comment on the significant progress that we have made across the group during that period.</p>
          <p>We are very pleased to be announcing our return to profitability just one year after our acquisition. This reflects the hard work of our over 1,000 employees who strived to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>I'll also talk about how we will operate over the next several years and how we intend to fill out and build out our profit model. I'll then address our longer-term prospects. We believe that we can build industry-leading effectiveness and efficiency. This will allow us to add greater value to our customers and will support high quality growth over the next several years.</p>
          <p>Let me begin by reviewing the first half highlights. At the prelims, we shared with you the great progress that we are making and the particularly strong momentum we had in the core businesses. I am delighted that we have advanced the organization on all fronts and on a combined basis we reporting a Group profit of &#xA3;1.6 billion, 1.3 billion on a statutory basis.</p>
          <p>All of the key line items in the profit and loss statement are showing positive momentum and excellent results with income up 5% costs down 5% and impairments down by 51%. What's especially pleasing is that we have seen good levels of profitable growth and new business flows in our customer relationship franchises.</p>
          <p>We have made excellent progress on the integration program. We achieved a run-rate savings of 1.1 billion at the end of June and we are highly confident of meeting our 2011 target. We have continued to reduce the size of our balance sheet with a further reduction of 23 billion of non-relationship assets in the first half.</p>
          <p>We have improved our funding and liquidity position. We reduced our reliance on the wholesale funding markets by 32 billion since acquisition and have repaid 33 billion in central bank funding. And we further strengthened our capital with core Tier 1 rising to 9% up from 8.1% at the start of the year. This remains well ahead of regulatory requirements and meets the stress tests.</p>
          <p>Overall, I'm delighted with our performance in this last half. We are building momentum on all of the key line items and we have a strengthening platform from which to drive future growth.</p>
          <p>The operating divisions had a very good half and I wanted to touch on a few points that demonstrate the real strength of this business. Helen and her team in the Retail Bank had an excellent half delivering a profit of &#xA3;2.5 billion. Income grew strongly, costs were well controlled, and we saw a good improvement in the asset quality ratio.</p>
          <p>We were very pleased with the growth in the retail customer deposits, which were up some 6.6 billion for the half. Equally important is the growth in sales volumes, which reflects our success in attracting new customers and building deeper relationships with existing customers.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the Wholesale Bank, under Truett's leadership, we saw a return to profitability with a substantial reduction in the impairments. Impairments fell by 69%, reflecting the rigorous risk management approach and prudent provisioning that we applied to the problem portfolios.</p>
          <p>We opened up another 60,000 new commercial bank accounts and committed 24 billion of gross lending to commercial and corporate accounts, demonstrating our support for customers in these critical sectors of the UK economy.</p>
          <p>The Wealth and International business reported a loss of 1.6 billion, reflecting the increased impairment charges in the International units. Impairments rose by 52% in comparison to the same period in prior year, but were down 15% on the second half of 2009. This is in line with our guidance. The majority of the increase related to Ireland as a result of the continued deterioration in that country's economy.</p>
          <p>I was very pleased with the performance of the Wealth units, which we have identified as a growth opportunity for the group. We opened up 13,000 new private banking relations in the UK and customer deposits rose by 1.3 billion across the division.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Insurance, Archie and his team delivered a profit of 469 million in the first half. Our focus has been driving profitable business rather than sheer volumes. Total income was down 10% with lower sales, but improved ongoing internal rates of return. These rose by some 15% &#x2013; well to over 15%.</p>
          <p>The team has made good progress on the integration and costs are down 15%. We have launched a single bancassurance proposition across the group, and we continue to believe that this represents a significant growth opportunity as we help our customers meet their life pensions and investment needs.</p>
          <p>We have also continued our capital efficiency program and the division upstreamed a further 2 billion of Tier 1 capital to the group, which will go some way toward mitigating the potential impact of Basel III.</p>
          <p>The integration program remains a key focus throughout the group and it is critical to underpinning our drive to become a leader in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. This is one of the largest and most complex integrations ever undertaken in the UK and so far, we are proceeding letter-perfect.</p>
          <p>The synergies stack up well when compared to other financial services integrations, both in terms of the percentage reduction of the addressable cost base as well as realization cost. We are delivering synergies from four main initiatives.</p>
          <p>On organizational design, we have removed the obvious duplication created by the merger and we have put in place a matrix with eight layers and eight spans. In this category, we have already achieved the majority of the savings expected. In systems and processes, the priority for the first 18 months has been on the development and testing of a common set of IT platforms and aligning our processes.</p>
          <p>Over the next 12 months, we will begin roll-out, and we expect to see major benefits coming through. This is also critical to our positioning the organization to better serve our customers. Property has provided a good flow of benefits, and we are on track to exit 1.4 million square feet by year-end. We are on track to achieve our 2 billion target at the end of 2011.</p>
          <p>We previously set out detailed guidance and I thought it would be helpful to summarize our current performance against that set of metrics. In terms of revenue growth, we delivered 5% in the first half and this represents 8% real growth if we take out the impact of the liability management gains.</p>
          <p>Our margin increased to 208 basis points, somewhat ahead of guidance and we expect to see a further modest increase in the second half. Our cost income ratio improved by 440 basis points to 43.5% well ahead of guidance. The integration program as I mentioned is going extremely well.</p>
          <p>Impairments improved by 38% against the second half of 2009. This is a better performance than we had expected and represents the success of the divisions in auctioning the portfolios. Our balance sheet reduction program is firmly on track with an 83 billion reduction already achieved against our target of 200 billion over the five years.</p>
          <p>I am pleased that for the first half we are performing in line with or better than guidance. The progress that we have achieved &#x2013; given the progress that we have achieved thus far, I'll set out new guidance for the coming periods later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>That covers the last half. Let me now return to the longer-term prospects for the group and why we believe we are well positioned to deliver sustainable growth over the coming years. Our economic outlook remains cautious, but we believe that gradual recovery is the most likely outcome. We have factored this into our business plans.</p>
          <p>We have taken a conservative view and reduced our forecasts in 2010 back to 1.3%. However, that now looks on the low side, given the data released for the second quarter. We are assuming a steady pick-up beyond 2010.</p>
          <p>We expect to see residential and commercial property prices rising modestly over the next couple of years. Our forecasts are below consensus, and we are not dependent on a faster recovery for our growth story. We continue to anticipate that company failures and unemployment will peak this year.</p>
          <p>Our financial outlook is based on a range of economic and regulatory scenarios, and having thoroughly stressed all of our portfolios, we remain confident of our capital position and our growth prospects.</p>
          <p>I won't go through all the points on this slide, but it is clear that the industry faces a period of significant change. There will be more stringent regulatory requirements, particularly affecting capital and liquidity.</p>
          <p>There would be challenges to the shape of banks through the reviews that are being launched, looking at both the types of business conducted and the competitiveness of the market. At the same time, consumer expectations are rising, with regulators leading the move to change standards across the industry.</p>
          <p>We continue to believe that the industry remains highly competitive with relatively few barriers to entry and that UK consumers receive good value as is evidenced by independent research. The new environment will be challenging for all financial institutions and we are actively engaging on these issues to try and achieve an appropriately balanced outcome.</p>
          <p>We have always believed that our strategy of focusing on customer value is the right one and the best way to deliver for our shareholders. But with the heightened regulatory backdrop, this strategy will serve us especially well, as it addresses many of the issues currently under discussion.</p>
          <p>So, with that as a backdrop, let me now describe how we think about the phasing of the development of the group going forward. On acquisition, our first priority was to establish control over the enlarged Group and address the immediate issues regarding capital and funding and put in place a risk framework.</p>
          <p>During 2010, we continue to make progress against these areas, but we are evolving our focus toward the elements of the profit model, which we expect to drive our future financial performance. Our return to profitability in the first half is evidence that we are on the right track.</p>
          <p>Each one of the line items is moving in the right direction. We are growing our top line, driving positive operating leverage and reducing our impairments. We would expect to see continued improvements in our profitability over the next several periods. Our improved performance will be sustained over the longer term by embedding our customer value strategy across the group.</p>
          <p>Our objective will be to build the industry leading efficiency and effectiveness. This will enable us to provide greater customer value resulting in deeper relationships and the development of high quality market share. We expect our strategy to drive strong and sustainable earnings growth, generate capital and deliver high returns.</p>
          <p>In many ways, we think our model is even more viable in the new environment. We believe successful banks in the future will combine cost and capital efficiency with deep customer understanding to provide real value for customers. That leaves us very well positioned.</p>
          <p>We are combining two highly efficient organizations and together aided by the synergies we will create an industry leader with the capacity to invest more in its customer propositions. Our ongoing investment in data management and <mark type="inaudible" /> site tools will give us unrivaled understanding of our customers &#x2013; customers' needs, helping us to build deeper relationships with them.</p>
          <p>This will truly set us apart in terms of what we can offer to our customers. We will understand them better, we will offer them better products, better pricing and better service. By providing better value to our customers, we will also provide better value to our shareholders. We will deliver strong sustainable growth with predictability and good returns.</p>
          <p>This slide briefly sets out the measures we are driving into the business and reflects how we will report on our future progress. Our efficiency measures will include operating leverage, the cost income ratio, our investment levels and loss ratios.</p>
          <p>In terms of growth, we are looking at target customer acquisition backed by measures of relationship depth. The enhanced customer value we will provide will be reflected in our satisfaction ratings, which we will measure through net promoter scores. This is a higher standard than normal satisfaction ratings, but we believe it is critical.</p>
          <p>For shareholders our performance will be measured in terms of return on equity, earnings per share and dividend capacity. We will also measure our progress as an organization against other stakeholder metrics, such as employee engagement and community involvement and these are very important to us. It is by focusing on all of these metrics that we will able to ensure that we deliver the growth potential of the new franchise.</p>
          <p>I would like to now tell you how the group will deliver against our strategy by providing updated guidance.</p>
          <p>This slide sets out the financial performance we expect to achieve over the next several years. We expect to deliver 6 to 7% income growth per annum from our core businesses through our focus on customer relationships. We set that top line growth objectives as we expect to grow faster than the nominal rate of growth of GDP.</p>
          <p>We consider driving faster income growth, where we believe that the range that we have set out is consistent with the more conservative risk appetite that you would expect from Lloyds and our desire for lower volatility through the cycle.</p>
          <p>The rate of revenue growth across the group will be partially offset as we continue to run down our non-relationship assets and meet our state aid requirements. We expect to see our margins return to above 2.5% by 2014 more in line with our historically rates. We expect to achieve market leading efficiency with a cost income ratio of around 40% by delivering the integration savings and maintaining our focus on the positive operating leverage.</p>
          <p>This will enable us to further invest to strengthen our customer proposition and to support future growth. On impairments, we continue to apply our more conservative approach to risk, which is underpinned by unparalleled customer insight. This should result in a portfolio that settles in to a consistent 50 to 60 basis points of impairments. We expect impairments to be moderately lower in the second half of the year and will continue to improve thereafter.</p>
          <p>We will continue to shrink the non-relationship part of our balance sheet, so that we can focus our capital on supporting customer relationships. That will allow us to reduce our capital intensity and support a loan to deposit ratio of under 140%. We are expecting our returns on equity to be over 15% in the medium to longer term.</p>
          <p>Given the regulatory uncertainty, we can't be more specific on ROEs at this stage, but we expect that we will in the top quartile of world-class banks. We also expect to return to a more normal dividend policy in the future.</p>
          <p>In finishing, let me summarize my three key messages.</p>
          <p>First, we had a strong first half and delivered 1.6 billion of profits. We have greatly strengthened our balance sheet and funding positions, and we have a strong profit trajectory. Second we are putting in place the building blocks for a strong business, control, profitability and growth.</p>
          <p>Third, we are building the UK's most customer-focused franchise. We have a growth strategy that will combine our skills in delivering efficiency and building the customer relationships in order to generate customer value. That in turn will drive shareholder value. The positive trends that we have established and our plans point to strong sustainable, profitable growth for the future.</p>
          <p>Thanks very much for listening. Let me now turn it over to Tim to take you through the detail of the numbers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you very much, Eric and good morning everybody. This morning I'm particularly pleased to be presenting a robust set of result which demonstrates the underlying momentum that we are delivering in our business. On top of that, I want to share with you some of our views on the future shape of the group, which will be supported by our increasing strength in the key disciplines of capital and funding.</p>
          <p>In the first half we demonstrated that our core business is in good shape with a strong trading performance against the backdrop of a stabilizing economy. The group delivered resilient revenues, a strong cost performance and a significant reduction in impairments. In addition, we have continued to make excellent progress with the integration of HBOS. And all of this has contributed to the acceleration of the group's return to profitability.</p>
          <p>Looking now at our business performance in a bit more detail. We delivered good revenue growth of 5% driven by margin expansion, and excellent cost control with expenses down 5%. Impairment losses were half those of the same period last year and materially lower than the charges in the second half of 2009 and this is significantly ahead of our February guidance. The reductions principally come from our wholesale and retail divisions, but all divisions are showing strong trends.</p>
          <p>As, Eric said, it's good to be back in profit and we are pleased with the profit before tax of 1.6 billion for the first half, compared to the loss of nearly &#xA3;4 billion last time. Our core Tier 1 ratio has significantly increased to 9% driven by the benefits of lower risk weighted assets and the generation of core Tier 1 capital through a number of liability management exercises.</p>
          <p>Before I get into the meat, let's just look briefly at the divisional performance. Retail delivered a particularly good performance with a significant increase in profits. This was driven by strong income growth and margin expansion, tight cost control and a very good reduction in impairment losses.</p>
          <p>Wholesale returned to profitability driven by a significant decrease in impairment losses reflecting the economic climate and further supporting previous guidance that impairments peaked this time last year. And this was offset by lower net interest income, primarily from the successful non-relationship asset reductions, and of course, the previously guided decrease in trading income.</p>
          <p>Wealth and international delivered a better performance for the first half overall and pleasingly a reduction in Irish losses, compared to the second half of last year. Our insurance business performed well in a difficult market and delivered profits up 18% on the first half of last year and this was achieved through lower sales as the division focuses on its value and not volume strategy.</p>
          <p>At the group level, the combination of improving margins, cost synergies and lower impairments led to a strong performance in the first half and these trends confirm or beat the guidance that we set out for the group in February.</p>
          <p>Let me now look at key revenue trends with you.</p>
          <p>Excluding liability management gains income rose 8%. Growth in net interest income was 7%, driven by a strong margin expansion, more on that in a second which outstripped the impact of reducing assets. The main contribution of this growth came from retail and includes the effect of continued migrations of mortgage business on to standard variable rate products. Across all areas, new business margins were higher as assets were priced to more appropriately reflect risk and the duration of the underlying funding.</p>
          <p>Other operating income also increased up 8% and this includes an increase in the mark-to-market values of our ECNs. These increases partly offset lower income in retail due to lower growth lending volumes and reduced fee income and also in insurance reflecting our withdrawal for the PPI market.</p>
          <p>Turning now to margins. The net interest margins rose strongly to 208 basis points as higher asset pricing, more than offset the impact of lower deposit margins and a 5% reduction in average interest earning assets. Asset margins benefited as pricing better reflected the true cost of funding and risk as well as seeing the benefit of funding spreads normalizing. In all businesses, the continued return to appropriate pricing for risk and lending duration together with a more stable LIBOR to base rate spread, resulted in a strong increase in net interest margin.</p>
          <p>One driver of this as we touched on just a moment ago is the continued trend of customers moving onto and staying on, mortgage standard variable rates, encouraged by the current low interest rates.</p>
          <p>Looking at our expectations for margins going forward. Margins in the first half are at the upper end of the range of our expectations that underpinned our previous guidance for 2010, but I do expect to see a modest amount of further margin improvement in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>In addition, we continue to see prospects for margin expansion in the future alongside asset pricing gains, slow but steady base rate rises, which will eventually feed into wide liability margins and of course an assumption of stability in wholesale funding markets.</p>
          <p>Overall, we believe that the margin is likely to return to more than 2.5% by 2014. This margin outlook reflects our core economic and regulatory assumptions for the medium term and includes the impacts of the group's asset reduction program together of course with the assumed cost of refinancing as wholesale funding matures.</p>
          <p>Now let me pull together all these drivers of income and look at how it is going to perform going forward. We expect net interest income to grow over time, reflecting the expected increase in margins. The negative effect of the anticipated fall in Average Interest Earning Assets due to the desired reduction in non-relationship assets will be partially offset however by core business growth.</p>
          <p>Our relationship strategy will support OOI growth through both banking cross sales and growth in the insurance business, particularly including the benefits of increased product profitability. Although I guess I should add here that we must expect some volatility from ECN valuations.</p>
          <p>On balance, we expect OOI to be a fairly constant proportion of total income. In summary, and as Eric said, we are targeting 6 to 7% income growth from core businesses, which will be partially offset by the desired reduction in non-relationship assets.</p>
          <p>Turing now to cost performance. I am going to be brief on costs. They are down 5% through strong cost management and integration delivery and adjusting for lower operating lease depreciation you can see that Business As Usual costs including inflation rose modestly allowing for the continued investment in growing our core business.</p>
          <p>On synergies, well, what more can I say? We are delighted with the progress being made and we are firmly on track to deliver &#xA3;2 billion per annum of cost synergies and other operating efficiencies by the end of next year. So where does this all get us to in terms of cost?</p>
          <p>We have seen a continued improvement in cost efficiency with a further reduction this time of the group's cost income ratio to 43.5% equivalent to 45.1 if I exclude liability management gains. We have further cost savings from the integration programs to come through and thereafter we will still be seeking further efficiency improvements as we optimize our cost income ratio in the medium term. The combined effect of all this will help us towards operating at a cost income ratio of about 40% by 2014.</p>
          <p>I would now like to spend some time looking at impairments. As we have said impairment losses have halved since the first half of last year and are materially lower than the charges in the second half of 2009. And as we all know these introductions are significantly ahead of our February guidance. In retail impairment losses were materially down particularly reflecting prudent risk management stabilizing house process and the benefits of continued low interest rates.</p>
          <p>We saw an improvement in credit performance in both the secured and unsecured portfolios and these improvements have come through somewhat quicker than we had expected at year-end. Pleasingly the number of mortgage customers new to arrears has stabilized over the last 12 months and is now well below the peak experienced in the second half of 2008. We expect to see modest improvements in retail impairment charges in the second half of 2010 compared to the first half.</p>
          <p>Next year and as the UK economic environment gradually improves, further improvements will be delivered but at a significantly slower rate than this year. The wholesale charge for impairment losses also fell significantly, now it is just under &#xA3;3 billion. The decrease reflects the stabilizing economic environment with particular reductions in commercial real estate losses and a material slow down in the value and volume of newly impaired loans.</p>
          <p>Within these trends, we expect the volume of underlying impairment losses from traditional trading and manufacturing businesses to increase this year, as the full impact of slower economic growth filters into business insolvencies and asset values.</p>
          <p>Though we have spoken previously about this typical time and lag effects, which we have all observed in previous recessions as the economic grows in to a recovery phase. However, the effects of this are significantly less than the benefits of lower absolute impairment from the commercial real estate and real estate related portfolios that we saw last year.</p>
          <p>Of course, we remain vigilant in monitoring changes in economic conditions and to individual lending positions and we continue to invest heavily in expert resource to help us work with customers to restructure their businesses on sustainable basis, thus protecting employment wherever possible.</p>
          <p>In Wealth and International impairment charges were down 15% on the charge in the second half of last year and the level of losses continues to be dominated by the economic environment in Ireland. We continue to believe that the impairment charge for the division peaked in the second half of last year, although economic conditions continued to be monitored closely.</p>
          <p>Looking now at the impacts of our portfolio management and provisioning policy if I may, well, the value of retail impaired loans fell during the period, as a result of improving portfolio performance and including the benefits of some criteria changes made two years ago, which resulted in fewer cases now entering collections.</p>
          <p>I've already commented on the lag effect of realizing impairments for corporate type loans, and this is evidenced in the NPL trends for both wholesale and W&amp;I. And these patterns are to be expected and reflect the longer curing and rectification of period for such assets as we seek to work with borrowers to land the best overall results for both the borrower and the bank.</p>
          <p>At Group level, impaired assets increased slightly but our coverage ratio also increased, principally due to increased provisions on Irish assets. Of course, we're not driven by our coverage ratio, but our independent Group risk teams are confident that we have appropriate coverage.</p>
          <p>Turning now to how we see asset quality in the future. Well, over the past 18 months we've seen substantial improvements in the group's asset quality ratio. And we believe, given our current economic outlook that the impairment charge will decrease modestly in the second half of 2010 with further reductions next year and beyond. We, therefore, expect further reductions in impairments, and we aim to bring the group's overall AQR down to 50 to 60 basis points per annum in the medium term.</p>
          <p>Before turning to the balance sheet and capital strength, I'd like to update you on the drivers and performance of our Insurance division. Well, as you saw in the earlier numbers slide, the business is doing well. And this is a result of strict product and channel participation choices emanating from a value over volume strategy. Their integration is progressing very well with synergies in the first half ahead of our expectations.</p>
          <p>Following the launch of our new product suite for IFAs last year, the integrated bancassurance suite has just been launched, providing a consistent base from which to deploy our bancassurance expertise.</p>
          <p>The business continues to make excellent progress in improving the profitability of the combined product set, and certain low returning products sold through the HBOS heritage channels have been discontinued. As a result, the first half of 2010 has seen strong increases in new business profits, new business margins, and importantly, in internal rates of return.</p>
          <p>Managing the use of the group's capital is critical. And significant work has been undertaken to optimize this division's contribution to Group capital and to mitigating the potential impact of Basel III. Over &#xA3;2 billion of core Tier 1 capital was repatriated to the group during the first half, and as a result, we have delivered a material reduction in the potential impacts of Basel III.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to move on to our balance sheet, the progress made in asset reduction, and the strengthening of our capital base. Firstly, asset reduction. Well, looking at the assets in our banking businesses, which encompasses loans and advances to customers as well as available for sale assets, we have continued the good progress on the reductions that we achieved last year.</p>
          <p>In the first half, we've achieved a 23 billion reduction in assets, whilst maintaining our support for core businesses and core customers where overall asset levels were flat as new lending fully offset customer repayments.</p>
          <p>Let me take you through the position now on non-relationship assets. Well, you will recall that last year we set out our strategy to reduce non-relationship assets by some &#xA3;200 billion by the end of 2014, and it continues to be our intention to manage these assets for value. And given the current economic climate, our primary focus is unchanged and remains on running these assets down over time.</p>
          <p>In addition, we're progressing well with the initial plans to execute the divestment of retail assets in line with our State aid obligations. The overall balance sheet reduction will provide the group with increased optionality and flexibility from the resultant releases in both funding and capital. And over time, this will facilitate further reductions in wholesale funding, the repayment of governments and central bank funding and, of course, provide substantial capacity for core business growth.</p>
          <p>As mentioned, in the first half of this year we achieved a 23 billion reduction of such assets on top of the 60 billion that we delivered last year. Although sadly this included some impairments I'm actually very pleased with the progress made in what were more difficult market conditions than the second half of last year. On top of strong reductions in treasury assets, we've made good progress on reducing other portfolios, including commercial real estate, joint venture investments, leveraged loans, etcetera, overall, very good progress.</p>
          <p>Moving on then to RWAs and capital; well, risk-weighted assets have reduced 6% as a consequence of balance sheet reduction, the lower risk mix of the loan portfolio, particularly with reduced exposure to unsecured retail lending and the generally improving credit outlook. Over the medium-term, we expect to see further reductions in RWAs as a result of both balance sheet asset reductions and a positive pro-cyclical impact from the expected improvement in the U.K. economic environment. The Group's capital ratios have increased significantly with a total ratio now of over 13%, a Tier 1 ratio of over 10% and, perhaps most importantly these days, a core Tier 1 of 9%.</p>
          <p>As I said earlier, through the implementation of capital management and restructuring initiatives, we've reduced the amount of core Tier 1 capital embedded within the Insurance division by &#xA3;2 billion, increasing the core Tier 1 capital in the group's banking entities by the same amount.</p>
          <p>Whilst this has no overall impact on the quantity of the group's core Tier 1 capital under current Basel regulations, the quality is much improved, and these initiatives will significantly mitigate the impact of the proposed rule changes announced by the Basel Committee. The Group has a strong capital base and is in a solid position to deal with what are constantly changing reg. cap requirements. But putting all our guidance together, we expect capital and capital ratios to strengthen materially over the medium-term.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look at the Basel III changes announced last week, and I believe that we will all agree that the impact of the changes for the group will be positive. The easing of the rule on the deduction of insurance capital, together with the transfer of capital that we achieved in the first half, will bring a substantial reduction in the potential impact of this rule change on our capital base.</p>
          <p>Now that the group is profitable again, the group's deferred tax asset is expected to have reduced considerably before the implementation of the new regulatory capital requirements. The other increases in deduction from core Tier 1, if implemented as proposed, are not expected to have a material effect on our capital base. The definition of future Tier 1 capital securities may well be tightened, but we expect all of our existing securities to be grandfathered.</p>
          <p>The proposals around increased risk-weightings, of course, are mainly concentrated for investment banking activities, rather than retail and commercial banking activities. And therefore, the impact from this aspect of the proposals is not expected to be material for us. Changes in other areas, such as liquidity rules, have either been deferred or actually they are easing the criteria initially set out earlier this year. Overall, we welcome the changes announced by the Basel Committee and we will continue to work to ensure that we maintain robust levels of capital, as capital requirements for banks continue to change.</p>
          <p>Turning now to funding and liquidity; well, during the first half of this year, we have substantially reduced the absolute level of wholesale funding by &#xA3;15 billion to 311, as a result of a combination of good, continued relationship customer deposit growth and, of course, the further reduction in non-relationship assets.</p>
          <p>Not only is our wholesale funding requirement down significantly yet again, but we've also broadly maintained the maturity profile, with 49% of wholesale funding having a maturity date greater than one year. The reduction of less than one year funding over the last 18 months is some &#xA3;32 billion and our reduced use of government and central bank facilities, illustrates the very strong progress that we are making.</p>
          <p>Throughout the turbulence in global wholesale funding markets, the group has continued to benefit from a diverse range of funding products, senior and subordinated, secured and unsecured, as well as, of course, a range of currencies. This included the addition of a U.S. medium-term note program; a second regulated covered bond program and a new French CD program.</p>
          <p>At the same time, and as mentioned earlier, we've seen good growth in customer deposits, despite a decrease in deposits in our Wholesale division, reflecting a reduction in price sensitive deposits in Treasury and trading.</p>
          <p>This strong performance in the half has enabled us to reduce our funding taken from government and central bank sources by &#xA3;25 billion. A significant proportion of the remaining 132 billion matures, of course, over the next couple of years. However, the group's balance sheet reduction plans will avoid the necessity to refinance much of this funding.</p>
          <p>Our primary liquid asset buffer has been maintained at over &#xA3;80 billion, with over 50 billion of this held as cash at central banks, and some 30 billion in AAA rated government securities, such as gilts or U.S. Treasuries. And this is a high quality, extremely liquid portfolio. It is these primary assets that are the main focus of our liquidity management, and, of course, for the FSA's new liquidity regime, which broadly mirrors the proposed Basel III liquidity changes and we've been operating under this new regime now for the last couple of months.</p>
          <p>Relative to the size of the balance sheet, the group does not have significant senior term funding issuance requirements. As I previously guided, over the next couple of years, we expect our public capital and term funding issuance to be between 20 and &#xA3;25 billion per annum.</p>
          <p>We've already made excellent progress on our 2010 plans having already completed some &#xA3;18 billion of issuance this year &#x2013; public issuance, excuse me. In addition, during the first half of the year, the group completed a further &#xA3;8 billion of term funding issuance via a series of privately placed transactions. First half issuances in aggregate have a very satisfactory average duration of 5.9 years.</p>
          <p>It's also worth highlighting here that we've continued to issue, either publicly or privately, throughout the volatility in funding markets in the first half of the year. But perhaps more importantly, we continue to do so without placing too much reliance on any single funding market.</p>
          <p>All of this confirms that even in very volatile markets, the group can successfully access diverse funding sources, tapping into the appetite of a wide range of investors and investor types in multiple geographies and we will continue to expand this approach over the next 12 months.</p>
          <p>Let me therefore summarize our key messages on funding. We've successfully continued to reduce the absolute level of wholesale funding and our reliance on short-term funding, whilst growing our base of high quality relationship-based customer deposits. We're maintaining a substantial high quality primary liquid asset buffer, the majority of which is held in cash at central bank. And we've substantially reduced our government and central bank support.</p>
          <p>We successfully completed &#xA3;18 billion of public term issuance, drawing on a very diverse range of funding sources. And we're planning to continue to reduce our wholesale funding, whilst reinvesting in our core business franchises. The flexibility that we are creating is exactly in line with our previous guidance and over the next four years, we expect to achieve further significant reductions in the group's wholesale funding requirements.</p>
          <p>This reduction will be driven by the expected runoff of non-relationship assets of around &#xA3;120 billion and further customer deposit growth, which if we assumed growth at an assumed market growth rate of about 4% per annum, would lead to an additional &#xA3;70 billion of customer deposits for us. Importantly, this combination will allow us to continue to invest in building our core customer lending.</p>
          <p>So in summary overall, we have delivered on all of our promises, with higher income and higher margins, lower costs and impairments, as well as terrific progress on integration. The capital base is stronger and our funding position has been further strengthened.</p>
          <p>But notwithstanding the words on the slide behind me, we have set out today a lot of guidance about how this management team will build on and deliver against the earnings potential for the enlarged Lloyds franchise. The guidance covers target margins, income growth, cost efficiency potential. It covers the benefits of reducing the capital intensity of our balance sheet and the flexibility that we are creating to grow our core business. It's a great combination.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'm going to hand back to Eric and question time. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Peter Toeman from HSBC. Could I test you on the robustness of your sort of margin forecast of 250 basis points, because within that, there's sort of some forecast of a 10 basis point increase in the cost of wholesale funding, which you gave us six months ago, but in the interim, the group's CDS spreads are probably higher now than when you gave that forecast. So I wondered how robust those forecasts are to changes in the cost of term funding, if you could give us some guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question, Peter. I'll give this sort of an umbrella answer then turn it over to Tim. What we feel is that we will return to something that looks more like our historical margins. As you recall, for about the first half of the decade, up until 2007 in fact, we ran between 2.7 to 3.0 in terms of group margins. What we feel is that given the mix of business that, in fact, we will return to something that will look closer to that. We've guided to above 2.5%. Included in there is the refinancing of the SLS and CGS. Although we didn't include it in our disclosures this time around, we continue to believe it'll be about a 10 basis point impact. But very clearly, in that assumption is also that we will expect base rates to increase. We will decrease our wholesale funding and some of the more expensive hot money that we have already burned off. So it is a cocktail of impacts, but we continue to believe that we'll return to something that looks more close to our historical averages. Tim?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you've given a fairly full answer, but it is the combination of all of the above, Peter, and I would stand by the guidance that we gave earlier this year on the 10 bps impact of refinancing our way through the repayments of SLS and CGS. Of course, a large part of it won't need refinancing at all through the benefit of asset reduction and deposit gathering, but it is included in our margin guidance today.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, Eric. It's Tom Rayner from Barclays Capital. Given the improved margin guidance, I'm a little bit surprised that revenue guidance seems to have softened from high single digit to 6 to 7% before the impact of the balance sheet rundown. I wonder if you could comment on that, and maybe add what you think the impact of the EU State aid related disposals will have on both your sort of target margin and ROE. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I think one of the ways to look at it is that we have continued to refine our guidance in part, because we're tracking ahead of where we had previously guided. If you recall, we had said that we expected to hit high single digits within two years. We, in fact, if you eliminate the impact of the liability management, are there this &#x2013; in the first half of 2011. What we did was we very carefully calibrated where we want to set our risk appetite and what we believe is that growing faster than the nominal rate of growth in the economy is sine qua non we don't want to lose ground.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we want to set our risk appetite so that we don't encourage unnecessary risk-taking. We want to have lower volatility over the cycle. So that's how we arrived at broadly the 6 to 7%. What we expect is that as we run down the non-core portfolio, obviously we will get closer to that number. But we feel that this is a robust business model, because what we have said is along with that 6 to 7%, we expect impairments to normalize and to have positive operating leverage. So we feel that it is a robust business model. Tim?</p>

          <p>Thank you, Eric. Tom, we haven't given any update on the likely income cost impairment profile of the retail divestment since the prospectus for the capital raise was issued last autumn. But clearly, what we are doing is delivering increasing profitability for our retail business through a very strong delivery against our synergy targets. We're seeing the impairment profile improve. We're seeing a better pattern in both secured and unsecured portfolios. On top of that, of course, the actual shape of what we eventually divest is we'll take some time to be fully cemented and emerge. And, at the appropriate time, then we'll give more clarity on what we would expect the profit delta to become.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Ian Smillie from RBS, and two questions please. The first one is on the core revenue from which you're giving the 6 to 7% growth ambition, could you quantify for us what you're defining as core revenues please of the total 12.5 billion? And within that, whether that includes or excludes the PPI contribution, which you stopped selling earlier last month, I think it was? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is given that margins are ahead of expectations, could you, Tim, perhaps revisit your thinking with us on the portion of the wholesale debt funding, which is over one year? And perhaps some temptation for you to carry a bigger proportion of over one year debt in order to have, "a safer balance sheet structure", given that there is more coming back to you from the asset pricing story.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, very clearly, I'll take the second question, and then ask Tim to round it out and answer the first question. Very clearly, over time, what we expect is as we bring the non-core part of the balance sheet down, we do not replace it one-for-one. What we have said is we're going to basically take off about 200 billion over the five years and that we will grow our relationship businesses by about 100. But as we bring down the non-core assets, as we grow our deposit base -- as you know, in the retail bank, we grew by about 6.6 billion.</p>
          <p>As we, in fact, have pre-impairment cash flow which is coming in very strongly over the next several years and we continue term issuance, our balance sheet will change quite considerably. And what we will do is measure what we think is a prudent short-term to longer-term balance, if you will. As we evolve that will also obviously take reference to what's going on in the marketplaces. But what we believe is that we will shrink our wholesale funding quite considerably over the next several years and we will evolve our funding strategy as we bring down the balance sheet. Tim?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Let me clarify the first part of that on core income. I was just checking the page reference there. In page 10 of the release today, there's a statement in my section, which says that about 80% of last year's underlying income relates to core. And underlying is defined as income excluding the gains on liability management transactions. So that gives you the anchor number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And would you like to comment on the -- rather than the total wholesale funding burden of the group, the split between less than one year and over one year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I've forgotten that question. Well, as you know, our stated preference is to keep more than 40% of it funded more than one year. We've operated materially more prudently than that profile for the last 18 months. And if you look at the reductions that we've achieved, all of those reductions have come in less than one year. So we're today at 49%.</p>
          <p>I'm pretty comfortable with that kind of a profile. But Ian it will go up and down; it'll go up and down just under the laws of gravity as you have lumps of maturity that comes towards you. And I'm reasonably relaxed over that. I'd like to keep it over 40, so I think that's where we stand.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much Eric. It's Simon Samuels from Barclays Capital. I just wanted to ask you a question about the retail deposit market. If I look on page 67 of the release it shows your customer deposits in the half year grew by about &#xA3;4 billion. If I go back to the IMS statement, you said at the time that customer deposits were up by about &#xA3;5 billion in the first quarter; so 5 billion in Q1 and according to page 67, up 4 billion in the half year. And well, I guess the first point is, is that analysis correct, i.e. you had a small deposit outflow in the second quarter?</p>
          <p>And the wider question really is how realistic it is to grow deposits at the circa 4% pace that you think the market's going to grow at? And in particular at what cost, because there's a lot of stories about other people being very aggressive in the deposit market. So two parts, first of all the volume side, and secondly about price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer again in a more umbrella fashion, and then ask Tim to comment. If you basically think about the attraction of sticky customer deposits, clearly we look to retail and to private banking as the principal sources of growth there, those are the highest quality; those have the longest duration behaviorally. And we are particularly well positioned.</p>
          <p>If you think about it, the branches do not really serve for the asset side of the balance sheet. Customers can get assets quite efficiently through other channels. What you really have branches for are, in fact, to have current accounts and savings accounts; that's where customers go primarily. And so, we are very well positioned. We grew, during the half, 6.6 in the Retail Bank. We grew our Private Bank deposits about 1.3 billion. So those are clearly great progress.</p>
          <p>The corporate deposits, they are customer deposits and they do renew, but they are clearly more rate-sensitive. They are clearly ones that have shorter durations behaviorally. And so what we are doing is clearly growing the stickier deposits, the higher quality deposits, and we are continuing to grow corporate deposits, but we are less concerned about those. Tim?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Eric. I mean the numbers you quoted are absolutely correct, and I did reference from the podium, a drop in some of the more price-sensitive, and particularly in the treasury and trading areas. Quite frankly, it's nice to have the luxury of a strong funding position that enables us not to need to bid for some of these items that are price-sensitive, and particularly in that desk they're very, very short-term.</p>
          <p>These tend to be corporate treasuries that are placing money literally on the basis of a bip here and a bip there. They're very, very short-term. Nice to have, but if you don't need to have them, and you can see from the progress we've made on funding, there wasn't the need to have them. So, numerically you're absolutely correct.</p>
          <p>If you peel back the layer of the onion, what I would show you that actually in the Retail division deposits are up 12 billion in 12 months, which is 5.5% growth. And remember when I &#x2013; what I said in February, I talked about letting go a large amount of perfectly understandably as to why they were put on the balance sheet, heritage HBOS hot expensive Retail deposits. So peel that back, we are very, very pleased with the profile, and the quality and stickiness of our relationship growth. It's a good story.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so what -- in your margin guidance, what assumptions are you making for the competitive environment for retail deposits in the U.K.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, we have a whole range of assumptions in our margin guidance. That does include reflections worked on with the retail management team on what the competitive environment will be, both for asset product as well as liability products. And that is incorporated in it. What I did say in my -- and also in my words was that we do expect, in time, which means not in the short-term obviously, in time to see some liability margin widening. And that's reflecting our combined views on the competitive pressures there will be on both assets and liabilities. And the dynamic of those will change somewhat as the base rate environment moves, and that will be perfectly normal actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think -- thank you, Tim. I think the very broad answer to the question is that we expect to have a reasonably intense competitive environment. The U.K. environment has always been a top quartile value for the consumer. So the consumer does very well because the competition is high, and we would forecast that to continue. And we also believe that there will be more focus on customer deposits as we go forward. When we had securitization markets open and other forms of funding, there was probably less of a concentration around customer deposits. We believe that as markets won't return to the same levels as previously, we will continue to see greater and greater competition. So that's incorporated in the forecast. I think I see Michael back there; Mike Helsby?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you; it's Michael Helsby from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, sorry word full. Just thinking about your capital position and I hear that, Tim, you say your capital is going to grow strongly from here on out. And you clearly got a core percent ratio of 9%. Basel III has been significantly diluted, as you said. The RWAs are going down; you're not paying a dividend or potentially paying a dividend until 2012.</p>
          <p>Presumably when you do sell Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester it'll be at a profit. You're up-scaling capital from the Life business, which is clearly helping as well. So I guess the question is, when I look at page four of your presentation, and I look at the middle slide, and I've got control, profitability, and sustainable growth is from 2012 onwards, do we have a box that says capital return? So I'd just like to hear your thoughts on that please. And I've got just a small follow-up on Ireland.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks for the question. Very clearly, we believe that this will be an enormously capital generative group, and what we have guided, and what we have said is that, we think that we have sustainable growth over the next several periods. We've told you, how we're going to do it, by growing the top line positive operating leverage, bringing down the impairments. And it is based on adding customer value, so there's not a lot of mystery here.</p>
          <p>Yes, we do believe that we will be capital generative. Dividend policy will be set at the time. As you know, we have basically a prohibition until January of 2012, at that point the board will decide whether we're going to return to a progressive dividend policy, which has been the hallmark of Lloyds for quite a while. So the capital levels that we will hold in some part will be determined by not only our dividend policy, but also how the regulatory environment actually plays out.</p>
          <p>So we can't give you much further guidance than we've given you, either on capital levels or returns at this stage.</p>

          <p>Okay, just the follow-up on Ireland. I noticed from the appendix in the slides that the Irish development commercial real estate book, the NPLs are running at 90%. I think they were 76% at the full-year. I think there's a joke in there, maybe they can go to 100. But what's the NPL cover in that book, and how much of the fair value has actually been allocated against that book please?</p>

          <p>The answer is somewhere in the 132 pages. Let me find it if you want me to quote, the right number. The NPL coverage in Ireland is 41.6%, on page 85.</p>

          <p>Yes, but if you looked in the &#x2013; you're right, look in the appendix to my slide show, you'll see it broken out there between development and investment properties. I think you are right; I'm not sure the AQR is split in there. But I think the 90% impaired is a number I recognize and there's about 50% of the investment property is also impaired. We'll see if it gives you any more information.</p>
          <p>Just bear with me a second &#x2013; it's in there, is it? No, there's no more information, okay. Yes, 46% of the exposure is development, 90% impaired. I've got my numbers right, Eric; it's improving &#x2013; 54% in investment of which 45% is impaired. And the coverage ratio is as I quoted you a second ago.</p>

          <p>Robert Law of Nomura. Can I go back to the margin guidance please, and the slide you gave on page eight of your slide pack. You are there indicating over 2.5% on the margin. And as you say that may go back to the kind of margins you enjoyed previously, but the mix of assets has changed a lot; there's a lot more mortgages now.</p>
          <p>So what I'm trying to explore here is the kind of improvement or increases you see in the asset yield of your portfolio, because presumably you are seeing liability pressure and you talk about pricing changes, but most of those are now already, I think the phrase you use is, already seen. Can you give us some idea of the increase in asset yield you're expecting as a result of this improvement in the margin?</p>
          <p>And can you comment about how much of the balance sheet reduction you're expecting to make up in new business growth? And thirdly, on the funding side, despite your comments about easing the short-term funding I think your wholesale under one-year maturity has only fallen by about 2 billion this year and that helps the margin. Can you comment about how you see that moving over the margin guidance period so we can get some idea of the drivers behind this guidance please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you for the question Robert. Turning first to how do we see asset margins? And you're right, our funding &#x2013; our balance sheet &#x2013; excuse me, our balance sheet mix has changed, because of the heavy preponderance of mortgages. I think that over time what we will see is something that has basically a more balanced asset mix, if you will. What we are looking for, is to change the way in which we price virtually across the board, and this will take some time. But what we have is superior customer information, as you know, and as a result of that we will be able to price customers on the efficient frontier. This is part of our offering value to customers.</p>
          <p>So if we can better assess, because we have better information, a customer's credit worthiness, we will be able to price them very efficiently. Somebody who prices below us is making a bad decision because of their propensity to default and so on won't warrant the pricing that is lower than that frontier. So what we will be able to do is to build competitive advantage, we will also be able to optimize our pricing models as a result of it.</p>
          <p>So what we are doing is looking to change our asset pricing models from what we have had historically, albeit that you are right, they still will bear some relationship to the kind of products that we have on our balance sheet and we expect those to evolve over time as well. Your second question was what are we expecting in terms of run down in assets versus how much we intend to grow the relationship businesses? I think that we are staying by our guidance that we will run down 200 billion over five years, and grow 100 billion in the relationship businesses, net down 100. I think your third question was related to less than one-year funding. Tim?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me respond to that. I was just flicking up a page, because if you look at how the profile has changed over 18 months, then the proportion or the pound notes of more than one year is flat at 151 billion and the whole of our 32 billion reduction is in the less than one year space. What's happened in the last six months, the 2 billion that you referred to is quite simply the laws of gravity meaning that maturity dates are approaching us. And I think it's the strength of the funding that were done during the period so far that is enabling us to maintain the proportion of our funding that has a maturity of more than one year.</p>
          <p>Just because the maturity date is coming towards you, of course, it doesn't change the cost of that individual piece of funding. So the margin impact overall of wholesale funding in the six months is a single bp. So there is no benefits to the margin from what you're thinking might have been going on in there. It's simply gravity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how does that change over the next three or four years under your planning scenarios?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what I said on the margin guidance slide, I didn't speak it from the podium, but there are words in here which say and I'll just read it to you. It's from page eight. The blended average rate of wholesale funding rises as funding source mix and duration evolves over the plan period. And that's a blended rate, but remember of course, the volume is coming down significantly through the benefits of the asset reduction program and deposit gathering, and just the normal business generation of cash flow from stronger profits. So that's the delta between, if you like the rate on line, if I can borrow an insurance term, versus the volume effect.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Yes, Jonathan Pierce from Credit Suisse. It's just one question actually. The fair value unwind in the appendix, I don't remember the old numbers you gave us, but it looks to be quite a lot bigger at the half year stage than your forecast at the end of</p>
          <p>last year. It looks like you have got about 3.6 billion to come through 2011 onwards, I think it was sub 1 billion before. What has driven the increase in those fair value unwinds and are they completely tangible? Will they completely benefit capital over the next few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They are completely capital-benefiting, yes. And one of the main reasons for the difference is the success of the liability management exercises that we have undertaken in the first part of the year which, by definition captured a future debit unwind that would have come through and hurt profits and capital. And therefore, the outer years aren't suffering that debit and therefore the underlying credits are still coming through. That's the biggest reason for it.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Steve Hayne from Morgan Stanley. Just two questions. One on the cost of risk guidance of 50 to 60 basis points, can you clarify what proportion of the book will be mortgages by that outer year and very explicitly does it exclude the required EU divestment, i.e. 19% of your mortgage book? That would be question number one. And question number two, on your per-annum 20 billion to 25 billion of issuance over the next two years, how much of that will be senior unsecured? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So let me deal with the second one first. What we have said is, from our term issuance programs, we will continue to draw on a wide range of sources and work with a number of different investors and investor types and we will do it on a global basis. There's a chart here which shows the proportion of our funding year-to-date that has come from securitizations versus unsecured. It's also broken down by currency.</p>
          <p>So I can't actually give you a proportion that will come from different markets. What I can say is that we will continue to be using our assets where we can, but we will maintain presences in a number of markets for debt issuance and debt investment. And our debt program will be about the same size next year, but I haven't got it broken down between the different areas we'll tap. It will, to a degree, depend upon demand, which has clearly been higher than our initial thinking that it would be for the Lloyds name in the first part of this year, which is very encouraging. And I've forgotten the earlier part of your question.</p>
          <p>Yes, thank you Eric. We haven't split out or given guidance on what the overall size of any particular book will be in the future, with the exception of &#x2013; if you look at my non-relationship asset run down slide, we have given a very, very rough idea of where the individual portfolio sizes of what will it non-relationship assets might be at that time. And I've attributed about 20 billion of that to what may be left on sub-prime and self-cert mortgage books, which are completely in run-off. There's no new business been written on that since the day of the acquisition of HBOS.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Aaron Ibbotson here from Goldman Sachs. So basically you say that you think that you have sufficiently provided for the impaired loans, and you've got, as mentioned, 90% of the developer loan impaired and I guess, around 60% if I combine the whole corporate and commercial real estate book. So basically my question is, shouldn't we expect a relatively dramatic fall off in impairments in Ireland? You seem very cautious in your guidance. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that our caution &#x2013; and we have been cautious about Ireland ever since we have started to report on the acquisition. The country continues to have a difficult economy. There is no activity as such in terms of buying and selling, and we have basically seen the latest tranches going into NAMA, coming in at very considerable discounts. So all of that leads to continued caution. But we believe that we have taken a very prudent stance and we'll see how it develops over the next several periods.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thank you. Can you just clarify very quickly then. So if you today look at your impaired loans, you don't currently have any specific expectations that you would continue to take impairments on those currently already impaired loans? Is that how we should read you are sufficiently provided?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. What we would say is that given the expectation that we have for the economy, given where we expect the macroeconomics to work, we believe that we have provided sufficiently as of today. Now, if there is anything that changes, whether it is some of the covenants or the macro economy that could impact our provisions positively or negatively.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to know, in terms of &#x2013; it's Joe Dickerson from Execution. I just wanted to know in terms of the margin increase from 2.08 to 2.5, of that 42 basis points can you give us some idea of what proportion is accounted for by improving deposit spreads? Because I note that you have a 4% base rate assumption by 2014. And I just wanted to know what proportion from deposit spread, so we could put some sensitivities on that. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have not given specific guidance in terms of how that 2.50 will breakdown. And very clearly it will &#x2013; the evolution between 2.08 and 2.50 plus will depend in large part on base rates. But it also &#x2013; we will have to gauge the competitive temperature at the time for deposits, we will have to look at what asset demand looks like and so on. So it's very hard to give absolute precision, but what we feel is that, that guidance, and returning to a more historical view of what profitability should look like in this market place is what led us to the guidance, and we feel reasonably good about it.

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Andrew Lim from Matrix. I notice on page 104 of the report, you've got a 1 billion gain from a pension curtailment gain. Would it be fair to say that in the absence of that in the second half that operating costs would increase half-on-half or would you still be guiding to a reduction?</p>
          <p>And secondly, you talked about &#xA3;2 billion capital repatriation to core Tier 1 capital, and firstly, the core Tier 1 capital has increased by over 3 billion, much more than the earnings that you made in the half. Where does that 2 billion come from exactly and is it for the Insurance business? And if so, what would have been the impact on the solvency ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take this all right. You can rest assured that the pension curtailment gain is not included in the expenses that contributes to the &#xA3;1.6 billion of profit that we're reporting for the first half. We show that separately below the line and we've not allowed the reported numbers that we present today to benefit from that one-off item. So fear not, for the impact on the second half expense profile.</p>
          <p>As far as capital is concerned, the overall Group core Tier 1 capital is of course unchanged under the current rules from the repatriation of capital from the insurance companies, but you have an increase in quality of the capital that you have. The benefit that we get under the current regulations is actually at the total ratio where I have today to deduct my investment in insurance companies and clearly I have a lower investment in insurance companies today because they've given me some back. But the core Tier 1 quantum is not different.</p>
          <p>The largest contributor to the increase in absolute core Tier 1 profit that you're seeing, there is a reconciliation at the back, actually comes from the liability management gains, where we've got the conversions into core Tier 1 of both some Tier 1 and some Tier 2 debt as well as the absolute profit that one captures on those transactions through the face of the income statement, which is the 430 million that I pulled out separately on my slide. But, look, it is confusing and if you want me to just run you through it then I'll happily &#x2013; we'll have a huddle down the front and we'll go through it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you, Arturo de Frias from Evolution. Two questions on Insurance please. Well, I think, one you nearly answered now. The reason why the supervisory deductions for December to June is because you have taken out this 2 billion from the Insurance, is that...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's part of it. Of course, it also rises because the business is profitable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Because the embedded value is going up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, fine. Okay. Thank you. The second question is on the profitability of the Insurance business then. Even if &#x2013; even after having decreased the embedded value or having decreased the future allocation of capital to Insurance, because of this 2 billion deduction, the return on equity of the Insurance division is still low. I think you have reported nearly 500 million of pre-tax, which after tax and annualized could be, I don't know, in the region of, say, 100 or something like that. Do you still have 11 billion of potential supervisory deductions which would imply future capital allocations under Basel III?</p>
          <p>So, we are talking about a business that is still generating below 10% return on allocated capital under Basel III. And now that you have a group guidance of ROE of about 15, that ROE below then is increasingly out of sync, if I may say so, versus the profitability of the rest of the group. So what's your view on future profitability for the Insurance division? And that 15% Group ROE target includes a substantial improvement in the Insurance profitability or it's because you are expecting the non-Insurance divisions to generate ROEs close to 20? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Why don't I take a crack at it and then I'll ask Tim to give his view as well. What we fully expect is that the &#x2013; we've seen the shape of things to come. If you look at our results during the first half, you in fact saw that our internal rates of return came in at over 15%. And that's just a result of basically being much more selective in our products and focusing in on profitability, and then we will continue to do that.</p>
          <p>What we have also signaled, and I included this in my comments, was that we expect that bancassurance will take a much more prominent view over the next several years than it has in past. And bancassurance, as we know, is much more profitable than going through the IFAs.</p>
          <p>What we also know is that we are going to have a fairly substantial change in the distribution and insurance as we have the changes to the retail distribution coming through. And we'll have to see how those finally shape, but that will change the profitability as well as the channels.</p>
          <p>So, what we fully expect is that the Insurance businesses will in fact be better performing over the next several years. They are an integral and strategic part of our Group. What we believe is that with an aging demography and with a higher saving nation what we will find is that more people are turning to insurance products for their investment and pension needs. And so that's where the Insurance businesses fit.</p>
          <p>Tim, do you have any further thoughts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think part of the proof of this is in the pudding that's already been baked. We've seen a significant improvement in new business profitability in the Insurance division with new business margins up from 2.4% a year ago to 3.4% this year, which is a terrific performance.</p>
          <p>We've turned off all distribution of a large number of very poor returning heritage HBOS or Clerical Medical branded products. And we're now redirecting all of that activity into Widows-based products, which have a better customer proposition and also give us a better return overall.</p>
          <p>So, the profitability is growing strongly and a value not volume strategy is absolutely the right way to play this business going forward. And that's what's delivering the step up in new business profits and encouragingly the levels of IRR that we were seeing in the first part of this year at over 15%. So, the first part of your question is wrong. I'm afraid, Art, you won't get a free ride on the back of the banks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, it's Ian Gordon from Exane BNP Paribas. I've two questions please. The first one on capital and it's a bit of a semantic one really. Just to clarify your previous answer, when the board meets in February 2012 to work out what to do with the emerging capital surplus to the extent that it does decide to declare a dividend, would that be described as a 2011 final dividend and have the same characteristics notwithstanding that the embargo was only run off the previous month?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is on the evolution of customer loans during the first half. I guess I was mildly surprised when there was modest growth in the first quarter. The shrinkage in the second quarter felt more in line with previous guidance and more in line with what the Bank of England data is telling us.</p>
          <p>Never mind what the Right Honorable Member for Twickenham may think is your view on the drivers of the Q2 reduction, primarily the fact that credit worthy customer demand has remained week? Or was there any notion of you choosing to be more proactive in managing down your wholesale funding requirements by choosing to shrink the balance sheet a little bit faster?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me take the questions in order. First, our prohibition imposed by the EU is that we can pay no dividends before January 2012. So you could conceive a dividend paid based on final results of 2011, should the board choose to view that as a sensible thing to do? So, is that now clarified? Okay, thanks.</p>
          <p>Second, in terms of &#x2013; is it a question of supplier demand is really what you're asking. What I would tell you is that we're very pleased. Now, let's separate out the pieces. On mortgages, we extended 15 billion of new mortgages during the half. I think that that part can be taken out. We're basically ahead of our target there.</p>
          <p>In terms of the SMEs and corporates, we extended 24 billion of new credit facilities during the half. Now, that's up 27% over prior year. And what you have to remember is that that is a gross number and it is on credit facilities. In other words, the customer may not actually draw down against those facilities. So we are very pleased that we are continuing to make credit available, but that availability is not always taken during the same period as the granting. That would be the first point.</p>
          <p>The second point is, our application volume is down about 25% over the past couple of years. And what it basically says is that customers are taking a very prudent view that they are no longer extending themselves, because there is some uncertainty about what their order books will look like and what the future holds.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, if you look at the net figure we are about flat, which means we're seeing a fair number of repayments even though we are making more credit available. I think there is some further evidence, when you look at our overdraft usage and our usage against committed lines, but that again is relatively flat. It says that customers are not taking up the credit lines that are available. So, we would say that it is a demand issue, but clearly what we are doing is supporting our customers during these more challenging times by making credit available, whether they choose to avail themselves or not is again a different question.</p>
          <p>Okay, Simon, I guess we're sort of somewhat winding down, Simon Samuels please?</p>

          <p>Thank you. I want to go back to the revenue target numbers, and you'll appreciate that there's going to be a lot of focus on that, particularly today seen as you unveiled it. So, the remaining shrinkage of the not wanted assets are generally going to be flatter margin assets. And so the very simple question is, I assume you know what the earning &#x2013; sorry, what the revenue impact of the remaining balance sheet shrinkage is going to be. And so my question is, why don't you share that with this audience? So why don't you tell us what you actually think revenue growth will be after including that impact?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's actually not quite at that level of precision. Let me give you an example. We have an over concentration in commercial real estate, and we are very happy to commit that we are going to bring that down, but you couldn't say which specific loan is going to come down during that period. So, there is a range of alternatives, and that's why we, in fact, don't give further guidance that would be an example. Tim?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I agree with that. I'd also challenge the presumption that all of the items in the run down portfolio is a high margin asset. I wish that were the case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. But my point is, you've had to make a zillion different assumptions in getting to the 6 to 7% growth number, excluding this piece that's shrinking, so you know, which must have made &#x2013; include a whole load of assumptions about margins on new mortgages and SMEs and everything else, so there's a ton of assumptions that have gone into that, so why can't we just...</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we did say, Simon, and we repeated in here what I said at in February, which is that we don't expect the run down of these non-relationship assets to have a material impact on our financial performance. So we've repeated that, yes, of course I'm talking about earnings, because along with a supposing one had one of those non-relationship assets that was, indeed, high margin, I might still want short of it because I wouldn't like the impairment risk. So I'm actually far more focused on earnings impact than I am on individual lines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's just that you've given us guidance that seems hybrid, some of the items include the effect of the asset run down, some like the revenue growth, don't. And it just &#x2013; I don't know, it seems an odd thing there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, to a degree it will be what it will be. I mean, what we've said is, what we believe the core business will do, which is that we're targeting 6 to 7% growth on total income on the core business. What we've said is, we expect that to be partially offset, so we wouldn't expect it to be fully offset, partially offset; and otherwise, where in the partially? I guess it depends largely, of course, on the pace at which we achieve the run down. And we've been very, very clear right from the start of the asset reduction activity 12 months ago that we will manage this portfolio for value over time.</p>
          <p>Our capital position is very strong. Our funding position is perfectly satisfactory. We therefore have a very 'comfortable' position that we can take on these assets, which is that we will run them down for value over time and that we will not be flooding the market with anything that we happen to think has to go. And of course, if we were to give more concrete or restrictive income guidance, then actually we might be restricting our own ability to do the right thing by some of those customers and some of those opportunities and potentially even hurt the overall group value. So we're retaining a degree of flexibility for ourselves and we can do that because of the strength of the overall position that we're in at the moment.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks; it's Chris Manners from Morgan Stanley. I just had a question on the risk-weighted assets, this is page 120. It seems that most of the reduction in your risk-weighted assets came on the retail side, about a 22 billion reduction out of 30 billion total. Now, your retail loans actually only went down by 1%. Your retail RWAs went down by around 17%. Is that a definitional change or a change in risk weights there or &#x2013; and how should we think about that moving going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd refer you back <mark type="inaudible" /> I'd refer you back to the words I gave in the script. Part of this is a lower risk mix in the portfolio; some of it is the improvements that we've seen in the house prices, as well as the overall credit performance of individuals. But, of course, what you do have in there is you also have a reduction in our unsecured retail exposures and they tend to have a higher risk weight. So if you like, there's a bit of everything in there.</p>

          <p>Very good. Michael, back to you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Michael Helsby again. Just two questions really on funding, 18 billion of public issuance, sorry &#x2013; yeah, public issuance, 8 billion of private issuance, so you've kind of got to your 20 to 25 for this year already; so I'm just thinking for the second half of the year do you just carry on and start to pre-fund 2011. So if you could give us some thoughts on that?</p>
          <p>And just also on the net stable funding ratio, that was quite a significant change given the size of your mortgage book. So I was just wondering if you could put that into the context of how you think about the mix of funding in long-term, short-term and that whole funding requirements, and whether that regulatory shift has actually influenced what you think you need to do in terms of term funding? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, Michael, if &#x2013; we committed to 20 to 25 billion of public issuance and we're clearly about 75% of our goal if you take the higher number, and we didn't set a goal or guidance for the private issuance. So I don't think you want to add the two together. What we will continue to do is to as we see opportunity we will continue to use the term issuance market. And no, we're not wedded to a specific year-end target. What we will do is look to the market and we'll see when things are good for us, so we very well could pre-fund if we so chose if the markets allowed. Tim, did you want to take the second part?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you're absolutely right, Mike. The changes announced by the Basel Committee on the NSFR and the other liquidity pieces do favor retail banks. Clearly the change in the weighting on mortgages as an element of that calculation is beneficial to us. Likewise, the change in the sensitivity assumptions around retail deposit is also a benefit.</p>
          <p>In terms of the second part of your question, which is, does that affect our strategy and our mix and everything else? The answer is no, not really. I mean, one of the great things about the mortgage book that we have and the mortgage proposition that Lloyds has, is it's very much focused on the prime market. And that has given us a huge amounts of AAA collateral that enables us to access funding markets that maybe not all mortgage providers can have. And you've seen us access the RMBS market very successfully in the last six or nine months.</p>
          <p>That's part of also our thinking around loan to deposit ratio guidance, because Eric and I may be the only people in the land who don't like the ratio, particularly and won't be guided by it. It says nothing about the quality of your assets or the very significant flexibility that you can get from quality mortgage assets, which actually help you open up much more diverse funding opportunities for such a book; diversity as to duration, which is important for a prudent liquidity risk profile of your balance sheet, as well as diverse accessibility for global funding markets to access. And you can do that much better if you've got a prime mortgage book. So, at the moment, no, I wouldn't say it's affecting our mix strategy. We're comfortable with the direction we're going.</p>
