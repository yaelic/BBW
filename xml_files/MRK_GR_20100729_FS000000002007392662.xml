      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'm going to present the second quarter results of our group of Millipore and, as usual, the outlook for 2010.</p>
          <p>The very nice second quarter summarized on page three and I am going into more detail starting on page four. As you can see there, total revenues for the second quarter rose by 16% to &#x20AC;2.2 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. Production cost remained flat, so that gross margin went up by 22% to &#x20AC;1.7 billion. This fine gross margin was a decisive booster for the bottom line as SG&amp;A increased by a substantial 22% as well.</p>
          <p>Investments into marketing and selling went up as planned, driven by the launch preparation of Cladribine tablets. Other operating expenses include the Q2 portion of transaction costs for Millipore that have reached around &#x20AC;32 million, of which &#x20AC;8.5 million were booked at the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Investment in the research and development remained stable. In the end we see a 42% increase of the core operating result yielding a core return on sales of 21% after 17% last year. The return on sales always means return on revenues.</p>
          <p>The financial results shown on slide five within the portion between operating result and net income includes the interest for the bonds issued in March and fees of &#x20AC;5 million, both related to the financing the Millipore acquisition. We will start to see the effects of these increased interest payments in Q3 along with the consolidation of Millipore.</p>
          <p>Our underlying tax rate of 24.2% is in line with our target. Core EPS of &#x20AC;1.44 improved by 31% compared to the year-ago quarter.</p>
          <p>We achieved an underlying free cash flow of &#x20AC;360 million as presented on slide six. This is mainly due to the increased profit after tax at low tax payments compared to the high tax payments a year ago.</p>
          <p>I already have pointed out before that we have a lot of provisions in the balance sheet related to litigation where settlements are near or even around the corner and that payment will put pressure on the free cash flow. None of these payments has happened so far. That doesn't mean none of them will ever come; in the case of Dey, the provision may even be insufficient.</p>
          <p>Key balance sheet data for the group on slide seven. Comparing the figures to December 31, 2009, the main difference derives from the 3.2 billion Eurobonds issued in March 2010. As the corresponding cash inflow has been invested short-term, net debt was not affected. Consequences, we were in a net cash positive by &#x20AC;230 million compared to the net financial debt of 263 million at the end of last year. The figure excludes pensions and our special pension fundings. Shortly after the end of the second quarter we paid the Millipore purchase price, which will return us to a net debt position in Q3.</p>
          <p>Now slide eight shows the financing of the Millipore acquisition. The purchase price of &#x20AC;5.2 billion has been financed, as we mentioned, 3.2 billion Eurobonds, commercial papers of &#x20AC;400 million and cash of &#x20AC;1.6 billion. As expected, Moody's adopted its credit rating to Baa2 with stable outlook after the closing following Standard &amp; Poor's adoption to BBB+ rating immediately after signing. This is perfectly in line with our financial strategy to have an investment grade rating.</p>
          <p>Over all, we reached good conditions for the financing of the Millipore acquisition, and you can also see on the slide that the term loan that was used for the offer of the Millipore acquisition has now been cancelled. This saves us a lot of fees. And in addition to that, so that we never use this loan, we plan to repay the 500 million bond in November out of free cash flow.</p>
          <p>The next slide is slide nine. Millipore's revenues for the second quarter grew 12% from the previous years totaling $458 million, now this is U.S. dollars. Underlying this performance was organic revenue growth of 14%, which was primarily generated in Asia-Pacific and the Americas.</p>
          <p>On a divisional basis, Millipore's Bioprocess Division generated 18% organic revenue growth, a record high for the division, while its Bioscience Division grew 7% from the previous year.</p>
          <p>Millipore posted a record gross margin of 58.6% and a 24% increase in its non-GAAP operating profit with a non-GAAP operating margin of 24.2%.</p>
          <p>Now turning to slide 10, I will touch upon Millipore's Q2 GAAP financial performance. Millipore incurred approximately USD20 million of one-time charges in the second quarter, which are reflected in the results you see on this page, which means the operating result. The main non-GAAP adjustment is the amortization of the purchase intangibles related to the previous acquisitions, which totaled a little over 30 million. Millipore also incurred approximately 5 million of charges related to the subtraction with Merck. So you can see that the non-GAAP Millipore figure is something similar to our core operating result that we disclosed for Merck Serono.</p>
          <p>On slide 11 I show the essence of Millipore's balance sheet. The balance sheet was in very good shape, as Millipore used its free cash flow to continue to improve its net debt position. Millipore has also effectively worked down its inventory balance as part of its working capital initiative.</p>
          <p>This already brings me to the updated forecast for the full year 2010, including the old Merck and Millipore standalone, and I will explain how the guidance come together. On page 12 you see the elements of our new combined Merck Millipore forecast that now includes the forecast for the old Merck Group, as carried out in the past, and the, as mentioned, standalone Millipore forecast for the second half.</p>
          <p>We will switch our reporting to a new divisional structure when we report third quarter results in October and possibly another new structure in the coming year as the integration goes on.</p>
          <p>Now on page 13, our outlook for 2010 for the Merck Group. Based on the very good first half year results and our expectations for the rest of the year, we have amended our guidance given in April. We raised our forecast for three of our four divisions, resulting in an increase for the group. The outstanding development is the ongoing performance of Liquid Crystals that lead again to a raised guidance. The revenue forecast is now 50% increase coming from a range of 15 to 20% and the operating result is expected to grow by 160%, which was previously only 60 to 70%, and that is a very steep increase indeed.</p>
          <p>For Merck Serono, revenue growth is now expected to be 7.5%, up from 2 to 5% with a core operating result increase of 12%, up from zero to 10%. The recovery of our pigment business and the ongoing performance of the rest of our Performance &amp; Life Science Chemicals division has led to the guidance increase of revenue and operating result as shown on this slide.</p>
          <p>The increase in Consumer Healthcare is now 8% increase, which is in line with a previous &#x2013; sorry, 5% increase, which is a reduction from the range we had to 5.10% (sic) [of 5 to 10%] . We have a reduction in the Consumer Healthcare operating result increase, but we will not continue to be in losses as in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>The aforementioned adjustments are reflected in the outlook for 2010 for the group. This is the line Merck Group excluding Millipore core. Revenue growth is now expected to be 12.5%, the raise from 3 to 7% previously, and the increase of the core operating result is anticipated to be 40%, up from 4 (sic) [5] to 15%. On this point, when coming to the 12.5% guidance, let me point out how we want to phase the guidance or on which steps we want to make the guidance, and we have said that we will move in 250 percentage point &#x2013; basis points, so we will increase 10, 12.5, 15. So I've heard that some of you are astonished that we guide after the point figure, and this is the reason why. So we increased, the steps are 250 basis points. So included now are projections for Millipore's second half total revenues of &#x20AC;670 million and core operating results of &#x20AC;165 million. We now expect up to with a 21% revenues increase and a remarkable 55% jump in the Merck Group including Millipore core operating result.</p>
          <p>I'll give you &#x2013; I have given you in the following pages an explanation how we come to the 670 million guidance of Millipore for the revenues and the 165 million core operating result for the second half.</p>
          <p>So on page 14, we see in the dollar area that we expect a 9% revenue growth in 2010, and this projection includes the effects of currency at current exchange rates. This top-line growth will result in 9% growth for non-GAAP operating income and 17% growth in non-GAAP EPS, both substantially above Millipore's previous guidance. So we are not alone as we look at the first half in increasing our guidance on the back of a very good second quarter.</p>
          <p>On this slide 15 there's the reconciliation of the revenue guidance to the second half euro guidance. This year we start with a total revenue of USD1.8 billion, which converts to &#x20AC;1.385 for the whole year. We deduct the first half, we do the adjustments for U.S. GAAP because this was all non-GAAP, and for IFRS, which in sales is only the trade, and we come to the total revenues of &#x20AC;670 million.</p>
          <p>The same goes on the next page for the operating result, where we start again non-GAAP USD405, which at the exchange rate for &#x2013; with the applied exchange of 1.30,  the existing exchange rate, results at &#x20AC;312 million. For the full year we deduct the operating result of the first half, again non-GAAP, and come to &#x2013; with the deduction of Millipore purchase price allocation, we come to a core operating result for the second half of 165. This is the guidance for the core operating result of Millipore in the second half. We also have estimated an amortization of the purchase price allocation, which is of course very early and preliminary and prone to adjustments, but we wanted to give you a feel about the ballpark area, which is here &#x20AC;179 million, which have two main ingredients: one is the step up of the inventories, which is 86 million. So it is 86 million in total and will be written off completely in the second half. The amortization of the intangibles, that is of course a far higher amount and will be written over longer period, and that will be 93 million.</p>
          <p>In the second half we will also have more transaction and integration costs and that will lead to an operating result of minus 40. So a loss of minus 40 compared with a core operating result of plus 165.</p>
          <p>And on the next page there is an explanation how we come to these amortization figures by giving you a feel for the again also very preliminary purchase price allocation. We have total acquisition costs of 4.2 billion as we said. The equity adjustments are 695. And so we have had to allocate 4.458 billion, out of which half goes to the identified intangible assets that are mainly the customer relations, and this will be depreciated over longer period, and there you see the 93. The tangible assets are insignificant. And then the step-up of the inventories of 86 plus deferred taxes of nearly 800 million, and liabilities and provisions of 31 remains a goodwill of 2.6 billion.</p>
          <p>This is a guide so that you can get a feel for your models how we calculate the purchase price allocation. I'm aware that this amortization is not so interesting for you but we need to have &#x2013; be clear about this reconciliation.</p>
          <p>I would also like to have a word on how we treat looking forward our exceptionals. At the moment we do not include major exceptionals because we only guide the operating result. But there is a lack of understanding, I feel, about the difference between exceptionals and what is often also referred to as one-offs. And therefore, we would like to highlight that looking forward exceptionals will be considerable amounts that relate not to the current business. So in future, and that is a slight change to the previous concept, also big amounts that relate to the current business to still existing business will be digested in the operating results. The exception one-offs we would like to leave because one-offs suggests that they don't reoccur. We would like to highlight that these are the important items and therefore that they are not in one year there and then the next year they are not; in the next year, they are other important items. And we always have to include a certain amount of important items in our revised forecasts.</p>
          <p>At the end of the forecast I would like to again look at our liquidity position. As it is known, we want to reduce debt already this year and we hope that we will be able to fully pay back the bond in November out of our free cash flow. And in addition, we want to reflect the good performance in an increased dividend, and our expectation of the free cash flow is that debt reduction and increase of dividend can live side by side.</p>
          <p>With this, I conclude my presentation. Thank you very much for your attention. I hand now over to my colleague Elmar who will comment on our pharmaceutical business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Michael, also warm welcome from my side. Let's now start with the key financials on Merck Serono on slide 18.</p>
          <p>As already highlighted by Michael, Merck Serono had a strong second quarter and continued its profitable growth. Sales increased by 8.7% to &#x20AC;1.3 billion compared to &#x20AC;1.2 billion in the year ago quarter, boosted by strong sales of Erbitux and Rebif as well as positive currency effects. Furthermore, our CardioMetabolic Care products contributed significantly to the sales.</p>
          <p>Royalty and commission income rose in the second quarter by 30% to &#x20AC;101 million due to adjustment, positive currency effects and milestone payments. However, royalty income declined in some countries as patents expired.</p>
          <p>Our gross margin went up by 11% to &#x20AC;1.2 billion in the quarter and the reduced adds to production cost increase was below revenue growth. Production costs included stock-up expense for the new large-scale biotech production center in Switzerland of &#x20AC;5 million in Q2.</p>
          <p>The 12% increase in total marketing and selling expenses is influenced by the prelaunch costs for Cladribine Tablets. The 14% jump in commission and royalty expense is mainly driven by higher Erbitux sales, especially in Japan, and higher royalty income.</p>
          <p>Merck Serono's research and development costs slightly declined to &#x20AC;296 million. Improved gross margin more than compensated higher marketing and selling costs and led to a 14% jump of the core operating result to &#x20AC;307 million.</p>
          <p>We learned from you that the definition of royalties and commission income is not evident to all of our investors. Therefore, we included additional explanatory slide 19.</p>
          <p>I am now summarizing pages 20 to 23. Despite the stocking effects in the U.S. in Q1, we posted increased sales of Rebif, Gonal-f and Saizen. As outlined in our last conference call, our U.S. subsidiary EMD Serono was converting to a new computer system during April. Second quarter sales in the U.S. were negatively affected by &#x20AC;50 million shipments pushed forward into the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Despite the fact that Rebif has been affected the strongest by this phasing effect, worldwide organic sales were flat compared to the year-ago quarter. However, half year sales were up by 10.2%, and thereof almost 8% is organic driven by Europe and USA. In the USA only two-third of the growth is based on the price increases.</p>
          <p>Recent developments of our neurodegenerative diseases franchise are shown on slide 21. It is worthwhile to stress the extremely good news on Cladribine Tablets. Cladribine Tablets are the first drug in the world that was improved as an oral disease-modifying treatment for multiple sclerosis. Russian health authorities just recently granted marketing authorization for Cladribine Tablets and the product launch is planned for early 2010 and '11. The drug recently marketed under the trade name Movectro. With this we achieved a key milestones in the program process of Cladribine Tablets.</p>
          <p>As announced two days ago, FDA have not only accepted the Cladribine Tablets NDA for filing, but the application has also been granted a priority review. We also expect a CHMP opinion in September, as previously told.</p>
          <p>Now let's move to the oncology developments on slide 24, starting with Erbitux performance. Erbitux grew 23% in the second quarter to a record &#x20AC;210 million. The growth is broad-based where Europe contributed also with 19% over the last year. We have a proven strategy that is paying off. A global survey now shows the 66% of colorectal cancer patients are being tested for KRAS, indicating the preference for targeted treatments.</p>
          <p>This survey is supporting our strategy of customizing cancer care. As we had some misunderstandings regarding the future growth of Erbitux, I now would like to comment on this. We expect Erbitux to continue its year-on-year growth trend, but with reduced growth rates versus previous years. Due to seasonality and the impact of price reductions in some countries, we may not see quarter-on-quarter growth in each quarter as we have seen over the last few quarters.</p>
          <p>As reported, we resumed our Stimuvax clinical program in lung cancer in June, following FDA's decision to lift the clinical hold of the START trial.</p>
          <p>The study that's remained on clinical hold by the FDA is the Phase III STRIDE trial in postmenopausal hormone receptor positive women with advanced breast cancer. In July we decided to close the Phase III STRIDE trial in breast cancer patients given the early stage of the trial only a smaller number of patients had been enrolled so far. We see no possibility to provide data required for the lift of the clinical hold for the STRIDE study within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
          <p>Merck Serono remains highly committed to the development of Stimuvax in non-small lung cancer and to the best being of the patients. We will continue to work closely with the health authorities and to investigate the potential benefit Stimuvax might offer for patients with cancer types other than lung cancer, such as breast cancer.</p>
          <p>Slide 25 shows the updated pipeline including the recent developments. Let me add to the aforementioned that we expect FDA's official response regarding Tesamorelin in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Page 26 provides an overview of the pipeline catalysts over the next 12 months.</p>
          <p>On slide 27 we present the key financials of Consumer Healthcare Division. We generated revenues of &#x20AC;140 million in the second quarter, an increase of 9% despite of negative currency effects of 2.6%. UK sales were hit by a fire in May that destroyed a warehouse containing Seven Seas nutritional substances. Marketing and selling rose by 33% and R&amp;D by 44% as the division continued to implement its strategy of focusing on strategic brands.</p>
          <p>Substantial decline of the operating result to minus &#x20AC;5 million reflects the ongoing high marketing and selling as well as higher R&amp;D costs and the top and the respective bottom line effects out of the UK warehouse fire.</p>
          <p>Slide 28 shows our healthcare sales by health theme. Sales for everyday health protections were mostly affected by currency issues in Venezuela.</p>
          <p>This is all from my side. And I would now like to hand over to Bernd.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Elmar. Welcome also from my side. Before I will comment on Millipore, let me first start with our classics. The Chemical Division's Liquid Crystals and Performance &amp; Life Science Chemicals. Key financials of Liquid Crystals are shown on slide 29.</p>
          <p>We continued the good performance of our Liquid Crystal business and have beaten the already outstanding first quarter result and certainly also your expectations. This development is mainly a result to the overall positive market environment. We also benefited from the strong demand and fast penetration of our PS-VA technology. DisplaySearch raised its LCD TV shipment forecast for the second time this year. The higher demand is, amongst others, due to the acceptance of new technologies in TV like LED backlighting and 3D. PS-VA is the preferred technology in these premium segments. The increasing demand in for PS-VA is the main reason for our favorable product mix. However, we constantly face decreasing prices even for PS-VA as volumes are going up.</p>
          <p>Ongoing good capacity utilization as well as operational excellence helped us to achieve a strong improvement in unit costs. Therefore, revenues continued to climb in the second quarter, jumping 50% to a record &#x20AC;284 million compared to 189 million in the year-ago quarter.</p>
          <p>Changes in foreign currency added significantly by 13% to our growth, but the lion's share, 37%, was underlying organic revenue growth driven by strong demands and positive pricing. Gross margin doubled to &#x20AC;204 million.</p>
          <p>Our operating results nearly tripled to &#x20AC;151 million from the lower level of &#x20AC;52 million in the year-ago quarter. The return on sales improved accordingly to 53%, coming from 27%. Underlying free cash flow more than doubled and is reflecting the overall very positive developments.</p>
          <p>The very good second quarter results are very impressive when looking at the performance development since 2008 on slide 30.</p>
          <p>The key financials of performance in Life Science Chemicals you will find on slide 31. Total revenues of &#x20AC;360 million were 21% above last year's second quarter due to a good performance of all three divisions and is supported by a 7.4% favorable currency effect. Pigment sales were like in the first quarter especially high compared to last year as demand in both the automotive and cosmetic industries improved.</p>
          <p>In addition, although our Laboratory and Life Science Solution businesses grew double digit, perfectly in line with the major player in the industry. Both our classical as well as new and innovative products contributed to this strong growth trend. As an example, we successfully launched the innovative Eshmuno chromatography series which helps our customers to improve productivity and yields in their biopharmaceutical production.</p>
          <p>As strobes is mainly volume driven, production capacity is being fully utilized and the level of back orders in some segments of the business is increasing.</p>
          <p>The gross margin grew by 44% to &#x20AC;189 million compared to the year-ago quarter. The operating result more than doubled to &#x20AC;47 million with a return on sales of 13% compared to 6% for the previous year. But gross margin and operating results were slightly below the respective first quarter figures due to negative currency effects on costs of sales and SG&amp;A.</p>
          <p>I now would like to comment Millipore's second quarter performance in more detailed. Please switch to page 32. Millipore posted its highest quarter of organic revenue growth in the past five years. The company's profitability is benefiting from increased operating leverage and newly launched high-margin products. For example, the company sold more than 500 units for a product called Scepter, which is the world's first fully automated hand-held cell counter in the first quarter that the product launched. Millipore continues to invest in R&amp;D and is focused on driving innovation in fast-growing markets. Furthermore, Millipore continues to generate attractive free cash flow and posted a 75% increase in its free cash flow during Q2 after generating record cash flow in 2009.</p>
          <p>Millipore's Bioprocess Division benefited from increased production of vaccines and monoclonal antibodies by biopharmaceutical customers in all geographic regions. Additionally, the company's Bioscience Division, which sells product used in the laboratory research, saw strength in the academic accounts and healthy levels of investments by large pharmaceutical customers.</p>
          <p>From a geographic prospective, Millipore generated 12% organic revenue growth in the Americas, 27% organic revenue growth in Asia and 9% organic revenue growth in Europe.</p>
          <p>Let me now provide some more details on how the Millipore acquisition will transform our chemicals and how we are going to report to you in the future. Following the announcement of the acquisition in March, we informed you about the upcoming changes to the divisional structure of our chemicals operations, which we show on slide 33. On slide 34 you will now find more details about our reporting structure for the second half of 2010 and for 2011 onwards.</p>
          <p>As of the third quarter of this year, we will start to report according to the new structure with the divisions Merck Millipore and Performance Materials. Merck Millipore combines Millipore's activities and the two Merck's Performance &amp; Life Science Chemicals business units, Laboratory business and Life Science Solutions. These activities will be divided into three business units, Bioscience, Laboratory Solutions and Process Solutions from 2011 onwards.</p>
          <p>Finally, we have bundled the remaining Liquid Crystals, pigments and complementary products businesses into the new Performance Materials Division. Given the very unique nature of the Liquid Crystals business, we plan to report prospective sales figures separately also in future.</p>
          <p>I would like to conclude my presentation with brief comments on Merck Millipore integration process. As Head of the new division Merck Millipore, I'm fortunately that we have all Millipore's</p>
          <p>key managers onboard with us. Now that the transition is closed, we will continue to keep retention of our key talents as a key priority. We are on track with our planned activities and we already set up the newer project structure. We look forward to run the businesses of the new divisions with an experienced and highly committed management team.</p>
          <p>I look forward to provide you with a more comprehensive picture of our new business at our Analyst and Investors Day in September.</p>
          <p>Thanks for your attention. I'll hand over. Markus?</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question today comes from Matthew Weston of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my questions. I do have a number. First of all we could start with pharma. One of your competitors in multiple sclerosis, Bayer, this morning provided guidance for their expectations for Betaseron going into the second half of this year and 2011, suggesting high single-digit to low double-digit revenue declines were likely with the arrival of oral medicines. Can you give us your views on what will happen to Rebif volume and price going into the second half of this year and next and what's included within your guidance?</p>
          <p>Secondly, regarding Liquid Crystals, clearly you've had a fantastic performance with this return to a monopoly situation with PS-VA. Can you walk us through your expectations as to when some of your competitors may be able to compete within PS-VA? When should we expect this bonanza period of margins to come to an end or is it sustainable?</p>
          <p>And then finally, Dr. Becker, you made a clear point to stress the impact of one-time costs within the Merck P&amp;L. Can you explain to us what important influences and what exceptionals you have included within your guidance for the full year 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let's start with the pharma question. Obviously I cannot make comments about Bayer's guidance to because it's up to them to guide you. However, I believe that the oral impact on our product range will be, if at all, very limited because I cannot see many weeks of launches of Novartis in the USA nor in Europe. So therefore our guidance assumes that Rebif will perform as it performed up to now because we are still launching our electronic device in many countries and we have a very attractive full device set available which is the best in the market. Furthermore, Rebif established itself clearly as the interferon of choice. Therefore that gives us positives going forward for the remainder of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So then let me answer &#x2013; try to answer your question on Liquid Crystals. As you know, we have two competitors and they are not very transparent in what they are telling. So therefore if I could foresee when they are ready with a new innovation, I definitely would be pleased to tell you. But trying to answer your question a little bit different, I think there are clearly some elements of sustainability. One is the improvement of manufacturing costs. We have done a lot of process and efficiency improvement which of course will stay and we are continue to work on this.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we always have said that we want to try to escape a tough price competition by bringing new innovation and added value to the market. This is of course also true for the existing technologies and is also true for PS-VA. In fact, it means that what we are actually selling to our customers and what you find in the consumer end product is PS-VA in the third generation. So whenever a new competitor may enter this market, I think he will come with a first generation product, which gives me confidence that they will not have dramatic effects all in a short-term to our business.</p>
          <p>Finally, I am not sure that we will see in 2011 competitors' product in commercial products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. This brings me to the guidance of exceptionals and important charges or income. There is no exceptional included in the guidance. That goes also for the possible replenishment of the Dey provision I mentioned in my presentation. As far as important events are concerned, these, looking forward, will be in the first case impairments and impairments follow impairment tests, which require a triggering event and we check these as yearend exercises as before. We have included a ballpark amount but not individual, clearly identified important items.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. If I could just have a quick follow-up. So if I were to go back and look at what are now classified as important influences at Merck and estimate that something between 100 million and &#x20AC;150 million has always been a feature of your annual financial results, timing has obviously been very changeable. What you're basically saying is something along the lines of that average amount has been included in your guidance.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will now move to Sachin Jain of Merrill Lynch for our next question. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. That was Sachin Jain for Merrill Lynch. Just a couple of question on pharma then back on Liquid Crystals. Just on pharma, just with the Cladribine news flow, I wonder whether you could update us on two things. One, the extent of SG&amp;A increases expected for the remainder of this year. You've obviously flagged an increase in this quarter. Just where are we in that build? And whether you could update us on when we will know whether Pfizer opts in or not. And then whether you could update us on when you expect to hear back on the new Cladribine patent.</p>
          <p>And then back to Liquid Crystals and the margins, I just want to make sure I understand your commentary. Are you suggesting that without further PS-VA competition, the existing margins can be maintained next year? Did I understand that correctly? And then just related, could you provide color on the price deterioration you've seen in PS-VA? I think you mentioned that in your opening comments. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Let's start with the questions for Cladribine and SG&amp;A. Of course this is also somewhat dependant on the regulatory news timing which we receive. As I told you, we expect a response from the CHMP by end of the third quarter, meaning end of September. And if this arrives in a positive session then Merck might keep that SG&amp;A. If there is a delay based on this, then obviously there is some room for improvement the cost. All our expenditures are milestone-driven. So we have clear milestones. Obviously now, the SG&amp;A numbers which triggered a certain milestone where we start to ramp up investments. So we do this in preparation of the launch. So I cannot guide you. I think we could maybe take the assumption if everything is fine that we keep at this rate. If not, then we have some activities to bring these rates down.</p>
          <p>Regarding Pfizer, I cannot tell you a lot because this agreement is confidential. So that's actually what I can tell you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>IP, Cladribine, I told about it many times in previous calls that our planning now is competent enough that we assume a patent in the USA going well into the 20s. But you have to be patient then until we have everything issued. I would not like to divulge your information to my competition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I just assume that you would get those patent extensions prior to launch?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But does that make any difference, because I assume anyway a fully supported launch for this fabulous drug. So the patent for me is not at the quintessence do I launch differently to those. That depends. We will make a full launch statement as soon as we are able to do so.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On pharma. I've got mostly Liquid Crystals questions. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Liquid Crystals now. So if I understood your question correctly, in an unchanged market and especially competitive environment, that means no direct competition for Liquid Crystals, we are confident that we can deliver attractive margins like we did in this quarter.</p>
          <p>And with respect to the price decrease, I can tell you that the overall over the whole portfolio, the price decrease is in the low double-digit range. The special figures on PS-VA we can't share because of competitive reasons, but what happens these days in PS-VA is a normal commercial volume increase. So if customers now pay 10 times the amount they have paid a period ago, then this goes along with some normal commercial <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for taking my questions. Two if I may. First of all on the chemicals. So have you seen any restocking mainly at Liquid Crystals and all the pigments or the other Performance Life Science chemicals?</p>
          <p>And then on pigments again, last call you said that the pigments are not yet tight as the organic pigments have been tight already in Q1. Are they now tight? And on Liquid Crystals again, this kind of margins now you expect to see no competition product comes on the market <mark type="inaudible" /> stay on this level. So as the demand picks up further, can we have a kind of sensitivity analysis for the operational leverage effects on Liquid Crystals? What does it mean for the margins? That would be very helpful. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I got all the points right? So first what is stocking effects, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think that we don't have complete visibility, especially not on Liquid Crystals, because there was a complex supply chain coming behind. What we hear from markets and customers is of course actually there is a high activity which we expect for quarter three to prepare for the yearend business, and depending on this, we will then see. There was the expectation that there will be some calm down in Q4 and Q1 in this industry. Otherwise, we don't have specific indication of overstocking, but I think in all chemical business we see coming back to normal business activity, which means refilling the stocks and the warehouses.</p>
          <p>Pigments question, whether we are tight in supply... or what was your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, market is tight, yeah. A still tightened supply and therefore...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there was some tendency of tight supply, but this is not really special for pigments, this is on all levels. So I think raw material supply in some areas is tight, even logistic capacity to ship products out of your warehouse is in some areas tight. So I think we overall see in chemicals strong upswing of economic activities and there are some effects on tightness.</p>
          <p>And the last one, I think we are now in a very, very attractive range of profitability. And I think if we can stay in this range, we have to do a lot to further improve, therefore, I don't think that I can comment more on the sensitivity analysis what happens if the business will continue or grow more in terms of volume.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks very much for taking my questions. One question on Liquid Crystals. So I was just trying to get an idea of how many of your customers out of the big four are now using PS-VA. I think you told us at the first quarter that the first line had come online for that and that we were to expect more in the second quarter. I was just wondering how many extra lines will convert to PS-VA later this year and possibly through 2011 as well.</p>
          <p>And then just secondly, you've mentioned that you're already on the third generation of the new PS-VA technology. I'm wondering if you can give us an idea of how quickly you can replicate that technology and go beyond PS-VA, whether we can see another technology that could come in before, say, an OLED to fill the gap if you get extra competition beyond 2011.</p>
          <p>And then a question on pharma, on the royalties within &#x2013; in the Merck Serono. You mentioned that there were adjustments in FX effects this quarter that masked a sort of &#x2013; patent expiries declining the rate of margins &#x2013; the rate of royalties. I wondered if you could give us an idea of what the absolute effects of the adjustments in FX would be so that we can have an idea of the run rate going forward and the drop-off in that line for Merck Serono. That would be very useful. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Liquid Crystals first. So we have five major customers in the liquid crystal industry. And we don't comment too much on the business of our customers, therefore please understand that I can't give you details how many lines at customers are using PS-VA or not. But it brings me to another comment, that PS-VA is a technology which requires that you work very closely with your customer because there is some change and investment in their manufacturing lines necessary. This has been successfully done with more than one customer that I can confirm. And this also means that the improvement in the third generation deals a lot with making the process of manufacturing PS-VA displays easier and more convenient and, of course, less costly for our customers. It's not a complete new technology, but there is always also some further development in specifications like switching times or contrast ratio and so on.</p>
          <p>We are working on new technologies. We always said that there was a lot of investment in R&amp;D and you see that this has continued on a high level, which could be a new display technology mode based on liquid crystal, so not OLED. But for the time being we can't predict when such technologies may go to the market because it really depends as our customers are willing to change again manufacturing lines, whether they see enough differentiating potential in the new technology. But as I always confirmed, I think there is more on Liquid Crystals to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And regarding the royalties line which we have, the biggest influence on those is a) the sales of the licensing which we have, which are predicted to us and reality is sometimes different and you have to make adjustments.</p>
          <p>Secondly, many of those are actually paid in U.S. dollars as they are based in U.S. dollars and therefore you have big impacts on the exchange rates. So in this line they're pretty limited. Currently, we have accounted for a double-digit milestone payment from a outside project which we have. As you know &#x2013; or not knowing, we have seven outside projects which get developed by partners, and if successful, and here we talk about Delazidone which files in the U.S. to the FDA it's winning a milestone payment throughout. This was also, if you want, a unique event in the quarter, not to be repeated in the next quarters.</p>
          <p>The demographic's very difficult to guide you since I cannot predict the sales, which is the biggest influence on <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen, and thanks for taking my questions. Two questions on Cladribine and follow-up questions please if I may. Regarding the Russian approval which you have received and I was wondering whether you could update us on pricing you have in mind, if that's possible. And also a follow-up question on the patent situation for Cladribine. Can you remind me of the patent situation for Europe? That would be helpful.</p>
          <p>And then two questions on Millipore, if I may, regarding the very strong performance of the Bioprocess Division. You mentioned in the presentation that this was due to strong demand from biotechnology customers in all geographic regions, which I think is quite astounding. So I wonder if you could update us on why that performance was so good. Was it also due to new product introductions, or do you have a particular set of very useful products which the industry at the moment demands most? So that would be helpful. And then also why the operating margin was so strong there. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the Cladribine price, obviously I cannot tell you this because that's again competitive information which we're not allowed to divulge. I can only tell you I regard got Cladribine as a new innovation into the market, bringing advantages over current therapies, and then you can make your own points about it.</p>
          <p>Regarding the patent situation in the EU, that's the same patent situation as in the U.S. And I guess we enter to the U.S., so we are confident to get the patent. But in the EU it's not so important as we expect to get 10 years dosage protection as this is a new entity developed by an independent company. So therefore the patent is not so crucial to get in Europe However, we're lucky to have it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Millipore, I think the key driver for the strong performance in Q2 was the Bioprocess business and there were a couple of driving growth sectors. One is that a couple of customers are building inventory in advance of expected therapeutic approvals. The other is that we have in general a growth of marketed monoclonal antibodies observed and we deliver into these manufacturing processes the consumable products. And lastly, some of our customers have run their manufacturing campaigns for key drugs already earlier this year than anticipated, so pulling some of the sales from the second half into the first half of 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So basically a question of phasing there with these customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's basically a question of phasing, so that you were able to book some of the revenues already in Q2 which otherwise you would have expected for Q3 or Q4.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take our next question from Marcus Wieprecht of MainFirst Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. This is Marcus Wieprecht, MainFirst Bank. I have a question on the Life Science Chemicals markets, and that relates to both your former PLS division as well as the Millipore Bioscience Division. As far as I understand, the Millipore division, you reported a healthy 7% organic growth in Q2, and you mentioned in the presentation that the growth in your Life Science business within the PLS division was double-digit also in Q2. So that reads quite positively and is a bit in contrast to other companies in that area, Beckman Coulter or Thermo Fisher, which at least to some extent, I think supply similar customers. So my question would be how is your view generally on this life science, in particular academia market, what's the impact on budget restraints, do you see any slowdown in the second half? That would be very helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think definitely Millipore has a very exceptional growth shown in the first half. If you look more detailed in this growth then you'll also see that a strong &#x2013; or a much stronger growth comes out of the biotech markets than out of the classical pharma market. So therefore, I think the specificity of the product offering of Millipore has highly contributed to this great figure. And we observe basically the same with our Laboratory and Life Science Solutions business.</p>
          <p>So overall, I think that the market is healthy. We see some increased spendings in laboratories and reasonably good capital investment situation, which is quite <mark type="inaudible" /> for me, but it's important for the <mark type="inaudible" /> type of products. So as you all will see in the guidance, we are positive for the second half, and see, let's say, a little bit slower increase in top-line growth for the second half I have explained by the pulling of revenues into the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Holger Blum has our next question from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. Holger Blum, Deutsche Bank. One question on the Liquid Crystals business. You mentioned also isiphor and other phosphorus material. What kind of opportunity you see broadening your display business beyond the traditional liquid crystal supplying additional components to a TV?</p>
          <p>And secondly, just more traditional questions on the interest rate and tax rate. Is the Q2 run rate of the financial result a good indicator for the coming quarters or were there any exceptionals in there? Secondly, on the tax rate, underlying 24% again in the quarter. Would that be higher if we include Millipore in the consolidation? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I understood your question correctly, then you asked for other products in Liquid Crystals which we do and which we have. Is this correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Okay. So there is some single-digit million turnover in the LC business which is from other businesses which is actually nicely growing. I think, however, it's all more or less related to the display market. It's on one hand materials we use to manufacture LED, and the driving factor for the LED business these days is the backlight system for the TVs. There are some other products like etching paste and which will be applied in touch screens. So there is a, let's say, broader portfolio around product which go into the display manufacturing process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But now two or three year &#x2013; or three year view, how much of the other business could be the total of LC versus now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So especially with TVs, the difficult predictability of the LC business, I feel not able to give you a concrete ratio. So it also depends a lot of the acceptance of these new technologies and of course it also depends on how the Liquid Crystal business will develop in a few years because this is the ratio. But the LED material, we are very bullish that this market will continue to grow and that from 2013 onwards we also will see more LED applications in the lighting market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to finance, the situation is as follows. We have already out of the money we need to pay for Millipore, we have taken 4.2 &#x2013; 3.2 billion in the bond market which we invest. But near to nothing, because if you short-term invest without any risk, you don't get any return. So in addition, we need to take up a little bit more money, which we have done with commercial papers. Commercial papers cost near to nothing as well. And we had in the second quarter, if you remember, I mentioned the 5 million fee that will of course not repeat itself. So I think more or less the same amount looking forward would be a good guess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tax rate going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The tax rate going forward. In the course of presenting the Millipore acquisition, we have assumed that the &#x2013; at the time, present Millipore tax rate of 22% is not sustainable and we have said that it will go up, and that implies that the 24% tax rate that we show now will prove to be the bottom for a time to come once we have integrated Millipore. When we will be able to turn that trend round again, I am unable to <mark type="audio gap" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bad line to split, Holger. Can you still hear us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I couldn't hear everything, but was the conclusion that the tax rate should be around 24% then in the future, or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that was not the conclusion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The conclusion was since the Millipore tax rate will not stay as low as it was before the acquisition, the blended tax rate will probably be higher than the max standalone tax rate now. I am unable to predict at what level and I'm also unable to predict when this trend will turn around again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Just have one remaining question. I don't know if you can &#x2013; regarding Erbitux, I don't know if you can give us the split geographically or by indication on this project and the good performance we saw in this second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be a good question for ourselves because there are no IMS data by indication for Erbitux. And also by country and geography, we are currently not issuing sales numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have some more specific questions on Erbitux or?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will now take a question from Matthew Weston of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Many thanks. Just one quick follow-up. If I look at the FX impact in the Liquid Crystal Division, over the previous two years it's actually been quite different from exchange rate moves between euro and yen, which I think is the prevailing currency, whereas in the first half of this year the FX link has been exceptionally close to euro/yen. Does that mean that some hedging has now fallen off and we are likely to see a direct impact of FX benefits falling through to the revenue line of that division?</p>
          <p>And if I can cheekily add another one on. Just to check, the revenue guidance that you give by division for full year 2010, is that a local currency growth rate or is that a fully reported revenue growth rate? And if so, what currency assumptions are you making?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The guidance is a nominal, means fully occurring currency fluctuations. The issue is a bit more complex than your question suggests, because we have currency fluctuations and we have hedging. For example, when the yen went down to 1.45, we had hedges at 1.40. So it's not always the same as it appears. When the dollar was at 1.60, we had hedges at 1.32. And looking forward, we were very lucky that now that the exchange rate was very good for us, we had very few of these old hedges, because the yen was even better than the marvelous hedge that we had at 1.50 that was at 1.12 at a time. We didn't hedge the yen at that time, we didn't hedge the dollar. So we had a very low hedging through the peak of the foreign currency. When this changes again, for example, the dollar has gone through the 1.30 ceiling, which is important for us, then the hedging will start. So if you discuss assumptions, the assumption is in the guidance that we will continue to have this successful currency hedging as in the past.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Two quick ones. On Erbitux, you mentioned that 66% is now the KRAS testing, and that's obviously the maximum I would imagine for the penetration of the segment. What do you think is the current saturation in Europe and the rest of the world? Just the rough proxy will do here. Thanks a lot.</p>
          <p>And also, on Rebif, the 4% growth in the second half, of course, as you mentioned, was not the underlying growth due to the wholesaler effect. If you were to take the adjusted effect, can you give us a very rough volume/price split just maybe by proportion? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Coming on Rebif, yes, most of the growth in Europe is organic volume growth, I guess even more than we actually see in our numbers because we had price declines in some of the countries. In the U.S. I said that from the growth there, two-thirds was based on price. So that's how it is, roughly. And if you want to have some numbers, I can give them. In the U.S. we had roughly a 3% volume growth out of roughly 10, seven was price. And in Europe, 8% growth, which is all volume. So we claimed actually market share in the MS market, which is a very good news.</p>
          <p>Regarding Erbitux, I forgot the question. What was the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The KRAS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, saturation, KRAS. I disagree with you that 66% is the highest penetration which we might see for KRAS testing and I think this number can be pushed up higher. And actually I believe that now physicians seeing maybe some success with targeted therapy, that I could see the day where this is actually a standard test in nearly all of the patients coming into the system. But that will take some time and the ramp up has been extremely fast.</p>
          <p>Regarding the penetration rate, as I said before, I do not have penetration rates. I can only guess, and I believe that Merck in the first line colorectal we have for the whole market, obviously if you take in the KRAS market you have to take actually another calculation. I think we have roughly 20% market penetration of the whole market, which will give you something about 34 for the KRAS-related market. So therefore plenty of potential available to us. The same is true for <mark type="inaudible" />, where it is higher because we don't have competition there. But that makes us confident that on a year-on-year we will see further Erbitux growth as outlined.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Two questions. First, do you expect an FDA Advisory Committee to look at Cladribine? If so, do you have any idea when it might be?</p>
          <p>Secondly, you've got rather more positive in terms of your guidance over the last three months. Now, clearly liquid crystals is very hard I think for everyone to forecast. You've got much more confidence about Merck Serono and Performance &amp; Life Sciences. If you look back three months ago, where specifically were you too negative then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On Cladribine, I do not know if I expect an advisory board or not. Gilenia has one, so there might be a possibility that it is. And obviously it should be, if so, in the six months in <mark type="inaudible" />. So we have to wait and see on this one.</p>
          <p>Regarding the guidance for Merck Serono, I think we had some major changes where we got much more certainty about. Number one is U.S. healthcare reform, it was just decided end of last quarter, and we have now time to calculate the impact for us, which gives us more security.</p>
          <p>Number two, Erbitux performance in Japan is still keeping up despite Takeda launching Timax. We have also some more information about there.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, we have seen that the emerging markets keep up very well and actually come back with some growth rates which we have seen pre-crisis. And since Merck Serono in the last three years has been the fastest growing company of any pharmaceutical company in the emerging markets, roughly 20% per annum, and our exposure rate in the emerging market with nearly 20% is also together with Bayer's the highest in the pharmaceutical industry, this gives us some confidence that the momentum of the growth in those emerging markets is actually counteracting to the price reductions which we see or might see in Europe. And all these factors make us much more comfortable to come with the new guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For Chemicals, the real good month in Q1 was March, and at this time we still have been a little bit cautious because we did not oversee completely to what extent this was all only restocking or whether it really was the upswing into a more actual business activity, which then adds fortunately the concerned over the following months, and, of course, we now also have this dramatic positive influence of the currency and adds a much better fact to be assuming in our guidance that we will see positive currency treatment also for the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously this is true for Merck Serono too. Thank you.</p>
