        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome you to our Q1 results conference call.  Let me turn directly to the figures.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of 2008, we sold approximately 504,000 vehicles, 9% more than in the year before.  However, more important than this key number is the fact that Mercedes-Benz Cars and our Vans and Buses units achieved their highest sales volume ever in the first quarter at strong EBIT numbers.  Group revenue at &#x20AC;23.5 billion was almost exactly at the level of the previous year.  Adjusted for exchange rate effects and changes in the consolidated group, revenue increased by 4%.</p>
          <p>We achieved a strong EBIT of &#x20AC;2 billion which reflects an increase in EBIT of 45% to &#x20AC;1.2 billion at Mercedes-Benz Cars.  Daimler Trucks and Daimler Financial Services recorded EBIT figures lower than in the previous year but in light of the challenges these divisions currently face these are quite remarkable results.</p>
          <p>The EBIT of our Vans, Bus, Other segment includes the gain of &#x20AC;449 million from the sale of our real estate at Potsdamer Platz and charges of &#x20AC;491 million related to Chrysler.  Please note that the charges related to Chrysler had no cash impact.  The EBIT of the first quarter of 2008 includes a gain of &#x20AC;0.1 billion from the transfer of interest in EADS compared to &#x20AC;1.6 billion in the prior year quarter.</p>
          <p>On chart 3, you can see the key figures for the first quarter in comparison to last year's results.  Net profit at &#x20AC;1.3 billion was significantly lower than the &#x20AC;2 billion in 2007 which included the tax-free gain of the EADS transaction.  The free cash flow of our industrial business was &#x20AC;1 billion.  The net liquidity of our industrial business was at a level of &#x20AC;11.7 billion at the end of the quarter, thus only &#x20AC;1.2 billion below the year-end level despite our share buyback of &#x20AC;2.7 billion during Q1 2008.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to the divisional results, starting with Mercedes-Benz Cars on chart number 4.  The division's unit sales increased by 17% to 318,000 vehicles reflecting strong growth of 10% for Mercedes-Benz passenger cars and for smart sales, which almost tripled to 31,000 units.  The S-Class was once again the clear market leader in the luxury segment.  Deliveries of the C-Class rose by 57% to 113,000 vehicles.  The C-Class sedan was market leader in its segment.</p>
          <p>Sales were especially strong in the NAFTA region and in Asia boosted mainly by China.  At &#x20AC;12.5 million revenue exceeded last year's level by 4%.  The higher unit sales overcompensated for the negative exchange rate effects in the less favorable bottlenecks.  Adjusted for exchange rate effects revenue increased by 7%.</p>
          <p>Chart number 5 shows the development of EBIT.  The EBIT of Mercedes-Benz Cars rose by 45% to &#x20AC;1.2 billion.  This corresponds to a return on sales of 9.2% compared to 6.6% in the first quarter of 2007.  This steep increase reflects the market success of our products both at Mercedes-Benz passenger cars and at smart.  In addition, our efficiency enhancement measures continue to payoff.  Long-term structural and process-oriented improvements have been and continue to be implemented in the line organization.  On the other hand, EBIT was negatively impacted by exchange rate effects from the continued weakness of the U.S. dollar and by higher raw material prices.</p>
          <p>As far as new products are concerned, we keep moving forward.  In January, Mercedes-Benz presented the Vision of the GLK and the new generation of the SLK at the Detroit Auto Show.  Shortly after that, we unveiled the new CLC Coupe with its very fuel-efficient turbo diesel engines.  At the beginning of March, we presented the new generations of the SL Roadster and the CLS 4-Door Coupe, which are now even more attractive as a result of various design and technical changes.  And we also remained in the driver's seat with respect to our BlueTec models.  At the New York Auto Show, we unveiled the R 320, the ML 320 and the GL BlueTec versions.  Thanks to their modern diesel engines, all three of these vehicles fulfilled the US Bin 5 emission limits and also have the potential to meet the future Euro 6 standards.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to Daimler Trucks.  The Truck division sold 108,000 vehicles worldwide, 10% fewer than in the prior year quarter.  The Trucks Europe, Latin America units sold 34,000 vehicles in the first quarter, once again achieving the high level of the prior year quarter.  A production loss due to a supplier's production downtime caused unit sales in Western Europe to be lower than in Q1 2007.  We assume, however, that we will be able to compensate for this production loss before the end of this year.</p>
          <p>Due to the economic slowdown in the U.S., Trucks NAFTA continued to suffer from the weak demand for trucks in the U.S. and Canada and sold 27,000 vehicles.  This was 40% fewer than in the prior year quarter, also because the first quarter of 2007 was the last strong quarter before the market contraction related to the new emission regulation, EPA 07.</p>
          <p>Trucks Asia increased its first quarter unit sales by 18% to 46,000 units.  Fortwo suffered from weak demand in its home market.  Fortwo international business however showed strong growth.  Revenue of &#x20AC;6.3 billion was 13% lower than in 2007 resulting from the sharp market decline in the NAFTA region and also from the weakness of the U.S. dollar.  Adjusted for exchange rate effects, revenue decreased by 9%.</p>
          <p>The unfavorable market situation in the U.S. reflecting a difficult economic environment and sales resistance as a result of the new emission standards introduced in 2007 caused negative impacts on Daimler Trucks earnings.  An additional impact on the earnings came from the units we lost due to the production downtimes at one of our suppliers, which are expected to be compensated over the rest of the year.  Although these costs could not be compensated by higher volumes in Latin America and Asia, positive effects resulted from our efficiency improvements and the better product positioning.  Nevertheless, we achieved a return on sales of 6.4% in the first quarter and in light of the market situation we think that is not a bad result.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, you can see our new Mercedes-Benz Actros.  We unveiled the third generation of our flagship in the heavy-duty business in January.  This vehicle has been further improved with a large number of individual modifications affecting economy, comfort and design.  Since the launch of the first generation of the Actros in 1996 more than 550,000 units of this vehicle have been sold in over 100 countries.</p>
          <p>With the Mercedes-Benz Atego BlueTec Hybrids and the Mitsubishi Fuso Canter Eco Hybrid, the first hybrid trucks were handed over to the European customers.  This confirms our leading position with regard to hybrid trucks and buses.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to our Van operations shown at chart number 10.  In the first quarter of 2008, the Mercedes-Benz Vans unit sold 69,000 vehicles setting a new sales record for the quarter.  This was above all the result of strong demand for the Sprinter of which we sold 42,000 units between January and March, 18% more than the prior year.  The higher sales volume also led to a significant increase in revenue to &#x20AC;2.3 billion.</p>
          <p>In light of the growing relative share of the Van and Bus business within the Daimler Group, we have decided to start disclosing the EBIT figures for van and buses.  Vans achieved an EBIT of &#x20AC;168 million, reflecting a very positive sales development.  Daimler Buses, which is shown on slide 11, sold 9,200 buses and chassis and therefore, surpassed last year's volume by 11%.  Both Latin America, mainly driven by the market development in Brazil and Western Europe contributed to this favorable development with double-digit growth rates.  As a consequence of the growth in volume, our Bus business also increased its revenue to &#x20AC;919 million, 13% more as in the first quarter in 2007.  The EBIT of Daimler Buses for the first quarter was &#x20AC;75 million.</p>
          <p>Some of the Bus and Van products are shown on slide 12, including the new Setra TopClass 400 Bus we started to deliver in January.  The Setra TopClass 400 features a variety of technical innovations and optical improvements and is our most important product innovation in the Bus business this year.</p>
          <p>The EBIT development of Vans, Buses, and Other segment is shown on slide 13.  The overall earnings of the segment were &#x20AC;371 million, compared to &#x20AC;1.9 billion in the prior year quarter.  The segment EBIT in 2008 includes a gain of &#x20AC;449 million from the sale of our real estate complex at Potsdamer Platz in Berlin.  The Q1 2008 figure also includes a gain of &#x20AC;0.1 billion from the sale of our non-strategic EADS holding, the so-called excess shares.  In the prior year the EBIT of the Vans, Buses, and Other segment included &#x20AC;1.6 billion related to the reduction of our equity investment in EADS.</p>
          <p>EADS itself contributed &#x20AC;22 million to our EBIT.  In the prior year EADS results from ongoing business was &#x20AC;279 million.  In addition, Q1 2007 had been impacted by &#x20AC;114 million due to the restructuring.  Further burdens on EBIT resulted from our stake in Chrysler, which are shown on slide 14.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of April, the IT systems of Daimler Financial Services and Chrysler Financial were separated.  We have thus now completed the separation from Chrysler Financials activities from both a technical and a legal point of view.  In addition, the international Chrysler sales organization has been separated and the Chrysler-related sales activities have been placed into new companies.  These companies have been prepared to transfer to Chrysler.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, the EBIT impact resulting from Chrysler was &#x20AC;0.5 billion.  Please note that this has no cash effect.  This includes charges of &#x20AC;246 million from the ongoing business and additional, mainly restructuring-related special reporting items in the amount of &#x20AC;94 million.  These figures mainly reflect developments at Chrysler in the fourth quarter of 2007.  However, please note that these results are by no means indicative for the results further reported by Chrysler &#x2013; to be reported by Chrysler Holding LLC due to substantial valuation differences between U.S. GAAP used by Chrysler and IFRS accounting used by Daimler.</p>
          <p>In addition, charges of &#x20AC;151 million resulted from the impairment of rights related to residual values of Chrysler vehicles.  This asset reflect the rights to participate in residual value gains of Chrysler leasing vehicles at the end of the lease term and had to be written down due to decline of used car prices.  As of March 31, 2008, the book value of our share in Chrysler Holding decreased to &#x20AC;547 million.  Outstanding guarantees provided by Daimler were reduced by 0.3 billion to US $0.7 billion.  Correspondingly, the collateral provided by Chrysler on an escrow account decreased by 0.1 billion to $0.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to Daimler Financial Services.  The contract volume of our Financial Services business increased by 2% to &#x20AC;58.3 billion.  Adjusted for exchange rate effects and changes in the consolidated group, the increase was 7%.  In the first quarter, we started to consolidate 15 more financial services companies, mainly in Eastern Europe and Asia.  Approximately one-third of our portfolio is in the Americas region and two-thirds is in the rest of the world.  A &#x20AC;16 billion portfolio is managed by the Mercedes-Benz Bank in Germany.</p>
          <p>New business in the first quarter amounted to &#x20AC;6.7 billion.  This was 2% below the prior year.  Adjusted for exchange rate effects and changes in the consolidated group the decrease was also 2%.</p>
          <p>Our earnings, however, continued to be negatively impacted by the expenses to be incurred for the development of a new Financial Services organization in the NAFTA region.  As shown on slide 16, the EBIT of our Financial Services division was &#x20AC;168 million compared to &#x20AC;214 million in the prior year quarter.  Higher cost of risk due to the economic slowdown mainly in the U.S. also had negative impacts on the reported earnings.  Nevertheless, our cost of risk still remains below the long-term average.</p>
          <p>Coming back to the Group level, now let's take a look at the net profit and earnings per share.  Net profit was lower than in the first quarter of 2007.  This is partially due to the lower EBIT and also results from the fact that the gain on the transfer of interest in EADS in the prior year was not taxable and had thus boosted net profit.  In Q1 2008 we had tax expense of &#x20AC;674 million compared to &#x20AC;711 million in the prior year quarter.  Earnings per share in Q1 amounted to &#x20AC;1.29.</p>
          <p>Our key balance sheet and financial figures are shown on chart 18.  Compared to the end of the 2007, we further decreased our gross liquidity from &#x20AC;17.1 billion to &#x20AC;11.7 billion.  This still includes a dividend, which has distributed after the Annual Meeting in early April.  We are still in the process of melting down our excess liquidity, which resulted from the cash inflow in connection with the Chrysler transaction.  The net liquidity of our industrial business of &#x20AC;11.7 billion was &#x20AC;1.2 billion lower than at the year-end but still at a very high level, despite the &#x20AC;2.7 billion used for the share buyback in February and March.  With cash inflows of &#x20AC;1.3 billion, net liquidity was positively impacted by the sale of the Potsdamer Platz complex.</p>
          <p>The Group's equity ratio adjusted for the dividend payment was 26.9% and thus reflected that at the level of the year-end 2007.  The equity ratio of our industrial business increased from 43.5% to 44.9%.</p>
          <p>For the first three months, the free cash flow of the industrial business was &#x20AC;1 billion compared to &#x20AC;2.9 billion for the prior year period which still contained a cash inflow of &#x20AC;3.5 billion from the transfer of interest in EADS.  The current year figure includes proceeds from the sale of the real estate complex at Potsdamer Platz yielding an amount of &#x20AC;1.3 billion.  The cash flow was impacted by an increase in inventories at Mercedes-Benz Car, a usual pattern to prepare for the spring selling season.</p>
          <p>Slide 19 summarizes the effects of the share buyback program we executed between August 2007 and March 2008.  In total we bought back 100 million shares equivalent to &#x20AC;6.2 billion.  The second tranche which started after our Annual Press Conference on February 14 comprised 50 million shares equivalent to &#x20AC;2.7 billion.  We canceled all treasury shares prior to the Annual Meeting and got a new approval from our shareholders in April.  Our steps to optimize the Group's capital structure will be continued.  The timing will depend not only on the Group's cash flows and net liquidity but also on the developments in the capital markets.</p>
          <p>Our excess liquidity resulting from the Chrysler transaction is currently used to repay maturing liabilities and, therefore, will be further reduced during the course of the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Given the current conditions of the financial markets, with spreads for new debts at extremely high levels and the uncertainty regarding the potential impact on the real economy, it is reasonable to use excess funds for our Financial Services for a certain period of time.  As soon as we return to normal capital market conditions we will decide on further measures to optimize our capital structure.  This target is still committed and on our agenda.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to our expectations for the year 2008 as a whole.  The economic development is currently subject to many uncertainties.  Market expectations have been reduced, especially for the three major sales regions and above all the passenger car volume segments.  It can be assumed that overall demand for passenger cars will be significantly lower than in 2007 in the United States, will remain flat in Western Europe and will rise only slightly in Japan.</p>
          <p>With regard to markets for commercial vehicles, we expect moderate growth of the overall European market due to the robust development of demand for medium and heavy trucks.  In North American market, we do not see any signs of recovery at present.  We, therefore, assume that the cyclical recovery of demand for trucks will commence at the earliest in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Although we, although the overall economic picture became more cloudy and the automotive industry including Daimler currently faces more headwinds, we confirm our sales targets communicated on February 14, 2008, when we presented our 2007 figures.  We assume that Mercedes-Benz Cars will continue increasing its worldwide unit sales in 2008.  Daimler Trucks are expected to rise unit sales in 2008 compared to the prior year reflecting positive developments in unit sales in some Asian markets and Europe.  We still expect a recovery of unit sales in the NAFTA region.  However, this depends on the overall development of the economy in the U.S.</p>
          <p>For the Mercedes-Benz Vans unit, we anticipate a continued rise in unit sales, mainly due to the new Sprinter.  And for Daimler Buses, we expect unit sales to remain stable on a very high level.</p>
          <p>What does all of that mean for our earning strength?  Mercedes-Benz Cars continues to anticipate a further increase in EBIT.  We will effectively pursue our policy of continued efficiency improvements and we will continue inspiring our customers with fascinating products.  At Daimler Trucks, further efficiency enhancements in combination with the anticipated higher unit sales should increase earnings once again in 2008.</p>
          <p>At Daimler Financial Services, we are aiming to achieve a return on equity of at least 40% also in the year 2008 despite the expenses for setting up our own Financial Services organization in NAFTA, in North America.</p>
          <p>Let me add here that we are, of course, well aware of the financial crisis and its potential impact for the real economy.  Nevertheless, on the basis of the divisions' projections, which we confirmed today, we expect Daimler to post 2008 EBIT from ongoing operations of well above the prior year level.  However, effects related to Chrysler are not included therein.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention.  I will now be happy to answer your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Bodo Uebber.  Ladies and gentlemen, you may ask your questions now.  I will identify the questioner by name, but please also introduce yourself with your name and the name of the organization that you are representing before asking your questions.  Two practical points, firstly, please avoid using a mobile phone, as this disturbs the quality of the call for everyone, and secondly, please ask your questions in English.  Before we start the session, the operator will explain the procedure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon.  I have three questions, if I may.  First of all, on the Truck division, I wonder whether you could clarify within the first quarter or at least specify how much the production hold hit your earnings.  Was this a low triple-digit number or is this too high?  And secondly, on the Truck side, in Western Europe we are seeing throughout the industry that orders are decelerating, I understand from a phenomenally high level but could you maybe help us how we should see the year progressing and especially with a light on 2009 is it fair to assume that the truck industry will see its peak in Western Europe in 2008?</p>
          <p>And secondly, as you would expect on Financial Services, could you give us an update on where you stand with regards to leased assets, residual value assumptions, how it works at Daimler, when would you be forced to take charges similar to BMW that we've just heard?  And lastly, also with regards to Financial Services, where do we stand with refinancing conditions, how are credit market conditions for Daimler?  And with a light on share buybacks, would you say that currently the situation is back to normal that you would commence your share buyback program or are we not yet there?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />, thank you for your questions.  That was a lot of questions, so let me start with your first one regarding the Truck unit and the impact of the production downtime we had.  We are currently &#x2013; we are speaking about 6 to 7,000 unit in the first quarter.  We do assume that we can offset these 6 to 7,000 units during the course of the year.  The overall impact is roughly say two-digit, three-digit number, it's &#x20AC;100 million roughly, 110 precisely, but &#x20AC;100 million is a fair number for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Secondly, you asked for the order intake development.  First of all, I have to say I am happy with the order intake development.  We have minus 16%, somewhat in the first quarter but as you said on a very high level.  It is to say that if you compare this with other competitors numbers even, let's say this kind of decrease is even a better one and we have to state that also all our order backlog is together with this number further increasing, so that means our &#x2013; we are now in seven to eight months of giving orders out.  And so I am pretty happy with that situation.  Overall, we expect the market in total to be positively together with Eastern Europe, so Western Europe together with Eastern Europe should contribute fairly positive.</p>
          <p>We had also three days in orders, Eastern was not a very favorable month this year for March, so I am overall happy.  We do see also not any cancellations as other might has announced it.  We have a very conservative as always I do think so, how to count order intakes.  Our next year's numbers, of course, it depends a lot of the overall economic development.  As far as today I am seeing that we have not reached big issue from U.S. coming over to Europe.  And as far as the Eastern European markets are fairly increasing also next year and Middle East is doing its contribution I would even say that for next year we have a positive, let's say, market development.  Whether that goes slightly down and slightly up we will tell you, of course, in February 2009.</p>
          <p>So your last question with regard to residuals and our impacts here and the question compared to P&amp;L, of course, I do not make any comparison to BMW at first hand, but I can state we are sufficiently covered with our provisions and write-offs we have done on the credit side and also on the residual value side.  When we go back to the residual values, for example, in revising of &#x2013; we very early took measures in 2006, when I remember right, when we changed our &#x2013; some of our philosophies, when we changed also processes in terms of how to get the cars back.  I do think we are very conservatively in setting the residual values on the one hand.  We are also better, I would say even than last year in optimizing the structure between lease maturities getting to auctions and lease maturities getting to dealers.  It's roughly &#x2013; we are 10 percentage points better in this regard to less to the auctions which have the residual values and I do think our conservative approach in this regard helps up too.  So we saw, of course, a deteriorating in the first quarter.  We have applied, of course, the whole situation to March for our residual value setting process we do have which we do each quarter.  And that's it, so you don't see us here posting any one-time charge-offs or anything.  So we doing our job each quarter in this regard and I do think from our risk management processes and fine.</p>
          <p>The question is I do think you will raise the second question, okay, what does happen when it further goes down?  We even think that we are &#x2013; they are also somewhat protected.  Of course, you cannot exclude worst-case scenarios.  But you have also to see a little bit of a seasonality in the residual values when you look at the Mannheim index, for example, you see some, of course, some seasonality in this regard.  So what I said, you have to look at this closely but I do think we are very reserved in this regard.</p>

          <p>...on the share buyback refinancing.  Currently of course, it's expensive to go outside into the market, so it means our commitment to optimize our capital structure is our commitment, so our target is clear.  We have announced it and we stayed through this target.  But right now it does not make sense that we go into the market for a couple of billion refinancing and take in the high spreads which we have today even that we got upgraded by Standard &amp; Poor's.  But EBIT comes down again, we will look at the very best point of time and then to come a little bit by surprise as always you know to come back to further do our, let's say, optimization of the capital structure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh hello, good afternoon.  I have several questions.  First of all, a follow-up on the Financial Services, could you maybe be more specific in terms of the cost of risk.  You mentioned that it has deteriorated but it's still below the long-term benchmark, but could you put some figure on that?  And also have you seen an increase in the delinquency, especially in North America?  And also the issue of refinancing cost, to what extent this cost have increased in the first quarter for Financial Services?</p>
          <p>I have a second one on Chrysler.  The remaining book value is now at 547 million, if I am correct.  Would it not be safer to impair the entirety of this remaining equity value?  And a final question on Mercedes, if you could maybe elaborate a bit on the hedging policy, where you stand today towards both the dollar and the pound?  And in the earnings walk down, which is more qualitative than quantitative, could you put a figure on the raw material impact and maybe the expected burden for the full year?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of questions.  So let me start with, Georges, with the first one.  Regarding the credit losses, we have in first quarter globally, now globally talking, 0.48%, so 48 basis points in terms of credit losses, which compares to Q1 2007 of 0.33.  That's 33 basis points, which was over the year, total year, 39 basis points.  And, of course, this reflects a development in the U.S., which deteriorated somewhat in the first quarter.  That you can see, of course, within for example, our Truck business EBIT.  Mercedes-Benz in the U.S. was even a little bit positive in terms of repossessions, for example, in the first quarter, but of course, from this kind of trends you cannot make up the total year development.  But you also can see slight tendency of increasing delinquencies in Europe and the other countries but by far, as I said right now, it is not at the long-term average.  And if you take the number of 48 basis points, I do think you can make your comparisons.</p>
          <p>Your second question was the Financial Services cost.  Of course, as of today it's very positive because we don't have to go to the capital markets.  That means that our financial expenses for the Financial Services business in this regard is not impacted by the kind of financial crisis you see in the U.S. and across the board because we had this excess liquidity from Chrysler.  In '08 arms length, behavior to Financial Services, we rate Financial Services with market rates in their expenses.</p>
          <p>Regarding Chrysler, you stated rightly that we have a book value of 547 million and you asked okay, why don't you write it off?  Honestly, my answer is, if I could do it maybe but there are rules and regulations, of course I have to apply and there are also -- also are auditors which have to, let's say, look at the stuff.  So this reflects right now equity consolidation of Chrysler, so means when Chrysler done some early development and here we have to account IFRS and not U.S. GAAP and there are certain different evaluations of certain subjects.  So it hits then our equity, then it hits our book value and that is what it reflects.  So you &#x2013; and as long as we say that this value &#x2013; at this value these hits which we have are non-cash impacts and, therefore, the value &#x2013; overall value of Chrysler even if you see the actions of the management they take are more, let's say, in the right way of increasing our value in this state, so there is no reason to write it off to zero or to a different number than we have stated.</p>
          <p>Your fourth question was do our hedging policies have not changed  Of course, the question, as you know, whether I do some hedges when the dollar is at 1.59, so it is the same number we had at February 14.  It's roughly 80%.  It's the same number as of February.  And I stated also at the Press Conference that we have roughly 40% in 2009 and these are more or less the same numbers for the British pound.  It's also 80% and roughly 40% in 2009.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.  Arndt Ellinghorst from Credit Suisse.  Two questions, the first one is on Mercedes.  Normally there's a certain seasonality in the profitability of that business, with I guess better profitability in Q2 and Q4 moving forward.  Has there been anything special in the first quarter that you came up with such a strong margin or should we expect a similar pattern as normal for the remainder of the year?  And secondly, on residual values again, could you just clarify how you markdown your residual values in the year?  Do you mark them down end of March or do you mark them down on an average Q1 residual value assumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your second question is a very interesting one because I do think you would like us to draw a comparison to some other who disclosed the numbers as of today.  Honestly, we are looking at the total situation of January, February, March, so there is no average discussion.  So even if your residuals are going down in March, you have to consider it for the impairments you have to take or you have not to take.  So you cannot work in this regard.  So we are working on the total situation including the March situation, so end March is the answer.  The total March includes also the end of March.  If you mean the &#x2013; I don't know whether there was a 31st, whether it was a Sunday, I don't know but the total months development.</p>
          <p>As I said before, we do that very conservatively.  We have introduced many, many measures years ago.  We are aware of lease maturities.  We are aware that the stock is coming back.  And as I said before, we are optimizing the total structure and we were successful with that.  Compared to last year, we could reduce the auction volume, which is absolutely positive because there you get, of course, the worst prices.  If you go to a dealer, of course, it's better.  And we have a cushion in our lease rates regarding conservative residual value and, therefore, we have done our stuff this quarter as we have done it last quarter and the quarters before in all our looking at the residual values, necessary impairments or whatever.</p>
          <p>Your first question would be for the normally development of Q1 to Q2, Q3, Q4, I would answer this question more or less yes.  Was there anything special in Q1?  I would say, no, as the once we have already discussed about the U.S. dollar.  Of course, if you mean that it it's something special, of course, it is special in this way.  If we get to 2009 and 10, of course, if it would stay at the current level, of course, your hedges are going down and therefore, of course, you might have better, let's say, hedge rates in the first quarter than in 2009 first quarter.  Therefore, of course, you could mean that it's somewhat special.  As material prices, raw material prices have also their, their impact &#x2013; therefore, there was a question, I think two questions before which I have not really answered, so there are impacts but we are able right now on a net approach to compensate this with net savings.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening.  It's Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley.  Two questions, if I may.  First, on the North American truck orders, up 80% in North America and in the USA specifically year-on-year, how much of this growth in orders is due to the Mexican situation ahead of the June, July pre-buy, how much of it is just reaching dreadfully easy comparisons or is there any even a slight heart beat of a recovery although I know you have already addressed that last point.</p>
          <p>Second question, you have mentioned in some statements in the past and most recently around the release of your annual report that you'll keep your options open for cash usage including perhaps investments in batteries, electronics and powertrain-related investments.  Is there any rationale for you to consider making an investment in companies that do those kinds of things through either a minority investment or something greater than a minority investment?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To the last answer, you know, we have the same opinion as we had in February, yes, of course.  Adam, yes, we hold true to our strategy.  If there are any, let's say, opportunities in this regard, investment-wise up and down the value chain, we are looking at this stuff and, of course, that we have always said, besides doing good products and investments we are open in this area.  But, of course, right now it's early to say in areas like batteries and other stuff to say something there is nothing, which I can now say whether we have a target of something like this.</p>
          <p>Your question regarding NAFTA, I'm a little bit difficult with the question on Mexico.  I do think I need to tell you that you have to call Friedrich Lauer and we'll look for this question because here on hand I have not the information about this.  Regarding NAFTA, especially we have not a bad order intake.  So I'd say it's a little bit better but, of course, it's not a trend.  We don't see yet a trend that the order intakes gets better now for the second quarter, so it remains as it is.  We had some good order intakes in fourth quarter but these were special deals, one deal or two deals, which you see the numbers are a little bit down again in the first quarter, so the situation is as it was in February, no new information.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon.  Three questions, just the first one, just to go back a little bit on the U.S. residuals, am I right in assuming therefore you are saying you have looked at the position for the quarter one as a whole and you're comfortable with your 2010, 2011 returns in terms of vehicles relative to that level, i.e., you have not just reviewed your 2008, you've also reviewed future returns.  And then two, if you could just give us some idea as, on the residual value side, do you look at it every quarter, but do you also take write-ups as it were, i.e., if a particular region is seeing better residual values, I understand maybe Germany has, do you actually write that back up?  And then finally, question three, just on Western European truck orders, maybe give some idea as to how those orders are running and do you expect to pre-buy ahead of Euro 5 in 2009?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Adam, to your first question, of course, that is part of, of course, policy but also accounting policy.  We take the whole portfolio into consideration, so the whole leading portfolio.  That includes also the lease maturities for 2009 and 2010 and maybe also 2011, then we walk into 2008.  We are not allowed, which I do think is good news for you, to do write-up, so it's not possible, having done an impairment, to write it up again.</p>
          <p>And your last question regarding the order intake, so we have commented on the 2008 number.  We don't see here in Europe these kinds of pre-buy effects, which we have &#x2013; which you see, of course, in the U.S, or have seen.  It might change also to there, might change, but there is not a huge impact we see as long as there are not big incentives out to do something.  We don't see an impact there on pre-buying effects, not huge ones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is the orders year on year up in Western Europe then?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Europe year over &#x2013; you mean in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Current orders in &#x2013; is somewhat in Western Europe down, which we've disclosed.  In Western Europe but of course, but we have disclosed it in now fact sheet which we have on the Internet by 21%.  But as I stated before, they are on a very high level in Western Europe and also taking into account a little bit that Eastern was this year not very favorable for the first quarter numbers.  We have order backlog increases, so we are happy with the development in Western Europe but on top, of course, Eastern Europe, Middle East is offsetting this kind of downturn here, so we are even in other regions far better.  In total we have 12% more worldwide but as I said before, you have to also to look to Eastern Europe and Middle East and other countries and that development looks &#x2013; although we have impacts in the economy in U.S. but it looks good in these countries right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, could I just go back to the residuals in Germany and thinking also about the UK, I mean in those markets are you assuming now higher lease rates, i.e., are you starting to be a bit more concerned on the residual side given your experience in other markets or are you not making any changes to your current lease rates when you are selling cars at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said before that we are conservatively with our lease rates, there is no necessity now to change our philosophy and pricing across the board, even not in Germany.  In Germany, we don't have any problems here.  With our used car prices and everything, we are by far one of the best in terms of the residual values if you compare that to the competition in many, many segments, very good positioned and no sign of issues here.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon everyone.  Two quick questions, if I may.  First question, could you maybe give us an indication on the vehicle sales development in April so far, especially on Mercedes-Benz Cars, given that the month is almost over already?  Secondly, is there are any specific timeframe you are obliged to keep the 19.9% stake in Chrysler, maybe as part of the sale agreement with  Cerberus or could you theoretically reduce or sell that stake if you feel that this would be the right thing to do?  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your first question to sales in April on Mercedes-Benz Cars, of course, I cannot give you on all Vans and Buses and everything, but on Mercedes-Benz Cars, you can expect a double-digit increase in April compared to last year's April.  That is roughly an estimate I can give you for MBC, so that means Mercedes-Benz including smart.</p>
          <p>The timeframe for Chrysler, we have done the Chrysler deal and we have certain reasons, of course, to take the 19.9% and right now is not the time to talk about selling it off.  We had certain reasons to stay with the 19.9%.</p>

You said that you had &#x20AC;150 million write-down on participation rights and residual value gains, how big is that asset at all?  Where can I find it in the financial statement and how big is the risk on that asset of further write-downs?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello this is Chad Thomas from Bloomberg News.  I am wondering about the decline in sales in the North American truck market.  Obviously last year you had this drop that was related to the pre-buy effect from 2006.  The sales decline that we are still seeing now, is that purely economic concerns, in other words the pre-buy effect is completely gone at this point?  And my second question is I am wondering where you stand on a decision on the Russian, possible Russian truck plant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, your first question, of course, the first quarter last year was impacted by prepaid used engines in 2006 and therefore, we had customers with the old, with the EPA 04 regulation, and therefore, we had &#x2013; we could sell to these customers these old engines, so to say, at this point of time, and therefore, of course, a decrease you see is a huge one.  Although if you compare now the development in the first quarter to the fourth quarter then you see, let's say, a little bit of a flat development which reflects the economic development in the U.S. and not anymore the pre-buy effect.  Your second question, of course, nothing has changed, we do think about assembly line plant in Russia, but we have not made a final decision.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, Daniel Schwarz, Commerzbank.  In the quarter three, do we have further &#x2013; to expect further set-up costs for the separation of Financial Services in NAFTA?  And the second question is for trucks do you expect only increasing unit sales or also increasing revenues in 2008?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question, yes, we have also extended in the second quarter in Financial Services because we have made these transfer in April.  And therefore, also some cost aspects are related to the second quarter.  And your last question is, we don't give revenue expectations, so take our sales assumptions.  Some of that is, of course, related with the U.S. dollar if you compare it, but I do think the sales number is the best thing you can take.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right and that was specific to Mercedes then.  It didn't affect other truck makers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as I know it was related to us but we had also impacts in the Car business and in the Van business roughly but not as huge as it was in the Truck business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay, so &#x2013; okay, so you could have &#x2013; you just consider it will make up for the other divisions as well then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on R&amp;D, I mean when you look at the overall, you give a global number, so obviously that affects the Trucks, the Buses and as well as the Car division but the difference between capitalization and amortization is 123 million, I calculate.  How much of that IAS 38 benefit goes to the Car division?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, we have the higher &#x2013; say, I don't &#x2013; I have to look up the numbers because I do think we, of course, we have this process, you are right.  So it's &#x2013; we had a higher capitalization ratio as I also said in the February conference call, predicted for 2008 due to the certain development of car lines, powertrains and hybrids.  Therefore, we have an increase in the capitalization ratio, which goes roughly into the direction of 30% for Mercedes-Benz Cars and for Trucks roughly somewhat over 20% for 2008.  And if you take the numbers of 2007 you can do &#x2013; so I don't have here the breakdown of this.  I have the total as you have the total and the break I would say it is more to the Car side than to the Truck and Van side.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Next question from <mark type="inaudible" /> please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.  I'm calling from Detroit and I have a question on the Chrysler notes on slide 14.  The first question is I thought that you said that the book value had declined to &#x20AC;547 million.  Could you give me what the value was prior to this reporting or is that just the current value?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was nine hundred and something, 900 plus.  Wait a moment.  We have it precisely.  It's 916 million and now it's 547.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And the notation of the guarantees, are these loan guarantees that Daimler had provided and by reading this, does this mean that Chrysler has retired some debt or taken some of those guarantees off of your books?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, these guarantees are at the end of their term, so to say.  From our point of view, I cannot comment on what is within Chrysler but it was pretty, let's say, it's pretty eased up.  For example, it is the energy side where we had a guarantee also in former days when we owned Chrysler and we stayed with this guarantee and now it gets to the end of the contract, and therefore, the guarantee is not anymore there and some of the collateral is also not anymore there but the difference looks a little bit &#x2013; looks of course favorable in terms of guarantees to collateral right now than it was three months ago.  And it will go down to the, somewhat to the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So this is basically a &#x2013; this isn't an asset guarantee that has expired and eventually you will run out, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right, right, right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  Thank you very much.  Those were all my questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take the next question from <mark type="inaudible" /> please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's <mark type="inaudible" />.  Just one question on the trucks.  Could you just kind of comment the German weakness?  How much of this is due to &#x2013; sorry, how much of the share loss is due to bottleneck capacity issues?  How much is actual underlying market weakness?  And to what extent do you expect to regain that share loss going forward through the year?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am sorry <mark type="inaudible" /> I have already answered this question.  This was the 6 to 7000 units number, which we tried to offset over the course of the year, so 6 to 7000 units.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Well, I guess, what I am trying to understand, your underlying volume, I understand that, but in terms of the reduction in share, how much of this is in terms of the orders, should I say, how much is this...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Order intake wise, there is no impact.  These orders, these 6 to 7,000 units, of course, were orders, I don't know, 12 months ago or eight months ago, whatever.  I don't know today, so the order intake is not impacted by the 6 to 7,000.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me ask another way, how much of this...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The market share, you are right.  The market share is impacted, there you are totally right.  The 6 to 7,000 unit had a negative impact on the market share, which you can also see in our fact sheet.  If you would move that number in again, we are fine with our market share, you are right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's not, the real question is how much of this weakness is due to end market weakness and how much is it due to the delivery times getting pushed out?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I, maybe I don't get the question right now.  So the total market share decrease is related more or less to the 6 to 7,000 units.  So there is no weakness at all of us in the market on the one hand and as I also said before that our order intakes right now are not showing the sign of weakness, but are adding to order backlog too.  So there is also no concern right now that the market assumption, that Western Europe and Eastern Europe together has a stable development compared to 2007, that is something we also can state today as we have stated that in February.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just a quick follow-up there, because all your competitors are saying that it's because of the lead-times that it's being delayed and that's the reason why the orders are kind of falling fairly sharply, not necessarily that the underlying market is coming off.  Do you subscribe to this weakening orders, it's a market issue or it's actually just because lead-times are getting stretched and therefore, customers are delaying their purchases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, even I would not see that as a market weakness because it's &#x2013; as I said before, for us this is a high level of order intake which reflected our order backlog is already increasing again somewhat, so we are not in a good position.  And as I said also before, we have no cancellations and other stuff.  We are also in this regard somewhat conservative, or we are doing it right.  And therefore, there is not a concern right now for the market at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have no further questioners on my list, so I would like to take the second question from Arndt Ellinghorst.  Arndt Ellinghorst?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can hear you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, sorry.  Thanks again for taking me on once again.  On Financial Services again, and on accounting issues there are differences it appears in how carmakers account for leasing and financing business.  For instance, at Daimler we see operating lease assets in the industrial division.  Could you talk a bit about how you account for, especially leasing between the industrial business and financial services and why that differs between carmakers and especially regarding revenue and profit or loss recognition in the different divisions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Arndt, a very good question and that goes into the heart of how to &#x2013; from my point of view how to do business.  Because we give you a value at the end, it's nothing else in determining a lease rate on the one hand and the lease rate on the one hand does also with residual value, a combination to the price positioning of the product.  And therefore, when you are price positioning the product you have to look &#x2013; if you talk about 40 to 50% leasing rates, penetration rates, you need to look at the leasing rates and therefore, you cannot decouple the residual value setting process from the price positioning process.</p>
          <p>And therefore, in our company, we have decided a couple of years ago, four to five years ago, to develop in the direction that the residual values are in the responsibility of the industrial part of the business as far as major risks are concerned.  We have a kind of risk sharing for the first layer of risk, that is, for example, in the U.S. 2%, where the 2% risk is shared by financial services and the industrial part.  So we have a part where we do support the collaboration between &#x2013; within the process but there's risk sharing but the main residual value risk is with the industrial part of our divisions.  And that makes in total a lot of sense because when you do the one thing, you are positioning your price and talking about lease rates in the markets and you have to hold risk.  In the other hand you might do some decisions, which are not right.</p>
          <p>So we have only one responsibility, of course, with the knowledge of financial service, which are day-by-day in the market and are transferring this knowledge to the industrial part.  And we have some committees, of course, where we discuss used car strategies and re-marketing strategies and so on and so forth as one value chain in this regard and I do think that's the right way to do the business.  So I would never go for a separated responsibility on the one hand, residual values with financial services and so to say the other responsibility with the industrial part of the division.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>We'll take the next question from Philippe Barrier please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.  Philippe Barrier, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale.  Just a short question regarding the cash flow statement, we could view that in first quarter, the CapEx investment in property, plant and equipment was holding stable at &#x20AC;0.8 billion, what should be the trend in coming months that we could understand that the CapEx for the new Group should possibly increase in '08 and '09?  What shall be the trend in the next quarter regarding CapEx for industrial business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Overall, but there is also what we have said in February that we do expect investments increasing.  We've also disclosed this in our annual report when you might look at this, again page 78 in our annual report we have stated that it will increase over time.  That was Q4 '08 and '09 depends, of course, on some products to come on the one hand but also overall we stated that we have to do some investment in terms of powertrains and other stuff, so we are not talking about R&amp;D.  So this trend we have already disclosed with our annual report and that you see also over the time of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question from Georges Dieng, again the second round of question.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you for taking me back.  Yes, I was just wondering is there a scope for additional real estate gain?  And what is the estimated value of your so-called non-core real estate properties?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Georges, of course, it's two years ago when we addressed kind of 3 to &#x20AC;4 billion and if you now sum up all the stuff we have done, and we said we analyzed the 3 to 4 billion.  When you now go back how much of this we have sold so there's not much back.  There are little things, which I even do not have to talk about right now.  So it's done.  The project is so to say over.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  Can I ask a follow-up on the Truck business?  I was just wondering how you assess today the situation at Fuso in terms of improvement, earnings improvement and, let's say, the conversions within the Group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have &#x2013; just two weeks ago, we made an in-detail business review, which showed us that Fuso is doing according to plan, even a little bit better but, of course, depends on how big the number is.  But from the development point of it, they do fine compared to plan.  We are doing &#x2013; we have improved returns on the international side that we also targeted before, so that the margins should be better on from Japan.  Looking at the exports from the Japan point of view we should have a better margin.  So that's all, it's fine and they are doing with, of course, everything but this recall of course comes to the end and so they have more time to work on the, let's say the further cost restructuring the further efforts to increase, for example, their price positioning in Japan.  You've seen &#x2013; might have seen we have lost some market share in the first quarter of 2008 which little bit demonstrates that we are not going this year-end rally &#x2013; year-end rally means the fiscal year in Japan is end of March, where some competitors going with special margins into the market, we don't do so.  We are able to improve also our margins in Japan domestic-wise and so we are, let's say, here quarter-by-quarter going into the right direction.</p>

          <p>Okay, we take next question from Michael Shields please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, it's Mike Shields from Reuters in Frankfurt.  I just had a question, I am not sure I understand entirely how you can say you are seeing no signs of the  recovery in the NAFTA heavy trucks markets, if the orders are up 79% in the first quarter and in the U.S. is up 80%.  I mean am I missing something there, or I mean do you not see the orders as a sign of recovery or you're actually waiting for sales to pick up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I might be too conservative, okay that might be the case.  But if you compare this development, the question is these kind of ups and downs, of course, we do know the customers, which are ordering are behind these order intakes.  And therefore, it's our assessment that this is not a trend which you can now take for the second quarter and the third quarter and assume this kind of running rate as increase, that it increases another 10%, another 10%.  It would be nice that it would be the case, but we cannot state right now.  From the information we have, due to the customers we have as order intakes there, that we can say that we have here &#x2013; we have a better situation than in the first quarter.  But if you look at the fourth quarter, for example, we had higher order intakes in the fourth quarter.  Now we are down again, so that's what we mean that the current situation is on our watch list.  We have to look into the markets and we cannot state that this weak situation is over.  It's not over, not from our, today's point of view.</p>
