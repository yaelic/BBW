          <p>A very good day to you, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Nestl&#xE9; 2008 Nine Month Sales Conference Call hosted by Roddy Child-Villiers, Head of Investor Relations. As usual, there will be a presentation and then we will open for questions and answers.  My name is Chris and I'll be your conference coordinator this morning.  Throughout the conference, your lines will remain on listen-only.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  Thank you.  And now I'd like to hand the conference over to Mr. Child-Villiers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Welcome to Nestl&#xE9;'s Nine Month Sales Call. As usual, I'll take the disclaimer as read and move directly to the highlights slide.</p>
          <p>Organic growth for both the Group and Food and Beverage business is unchanged from the six months at 8.9%, comfortably above our long-term annual target of 5 to 6%. These numbers demonstrate that we continue to have strong momentum in the business, and accordingly we've upgraded our guidance on organic growth for the full year such that we now expect it to be about 8%.</p>
          <p>We've received a lot of questions on our financing in the last few weeks, so we've included a slide later in the presentation. Key message is that our high credit quality aligned with our strong and predictable cash flows is enabling us to benefit from a flight to quality in the debt market.</p>
          <p>Next is our usual overview of the various elements of sales. I'll start with the Group, including pharmaceuticals. No change in the nine-month organic growth from the first half figure, still very strong at 8.9%. This therefore represents an acceleration in Q3 from Q2. Real internal growth, or RIG, is at 3.4%, with pricing at 5.5%.</p>
          <p>The material change from the half-year is the contribution from acquisitions, less divestitures, at 2.5%. You might remember that this was 3.2% at the half year. Finally, foreign exchange took 8% from our reported sales in Swiss francs, a slight improvement from the half-year, which was at 8.3%.</p>
          <p>For Food and Beverage, the numbers are very similar.  Organic growth is identical at 8.9%, with RIG contributing 3% and pricing 5.9%. The contribution from acquisitions, less divestures, was 2.5%, with acquisitions adding 3.1% and divestitures taking 0.6%. Foreign exchange took 7.9%. In total, the Group's sales grew 3.4% or 2.7 billion to CHF81.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Next is an overview of the performance of our total Food and Beverage business, including the globally managed businesses Nutrition, Waters and Nespresso, as well as our joint ventures.</p>
          <p>Our business has continued to enjoy strong momentum around the world. Europe's organic growth has accelerated in the third quarter, particularly due to an increased pricing effect in a number of the larger food categories, as well as in Nutrition.</p>
          <p>In the Americas, organic growth remained above 9%, with a slightly lower RIG than at the half-year. A number of the categories such as ambient dairy and PetCare experienced slower RIG in the quarter while a number such as frozen food, confectionery, ice cream and soluble coffee accelerated.</p>
          <p>In Asia, Oceania and Africa, the organic growth was unchanged from the half year. Again, there is marginally more pricing and marginally less RIG than at the half year. The RIG picture was mixed by category with some slower and some accelerating during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking across the total Food and Beverage business, we achieved 16.8% organic growth in emerging markets and 5.1% in the developed world. I'm sure you'll agree that these figures demonstrate the strength of our business around the world as well as the resilience of our brands in an environment that is still impacted by the effects of high agricultural commodities.</p>
          <p>Let's now dive deeper with an update on our primary reporting. This next slide gives the overview and underlines what I have just said about the broad based strength of our business. Let's discuss each of the elements in detail, starting with Europe.</p>
          <p>Sales for the nine months were CHF21 billion. Organic growth was 6% and RIG at 2.1%. The zone's strong momentum has carried through from the first half of the year with key Western European markets and businesses achieving good levels of organic growth, particularly Great Britain and the pan-European PetCare business, both of which were high single-digit for the nine months. There was a good acceleration in Germany in the third quarter, due particularly to the Maggi culinary business.</p>
          <p>France has been resilient so far and remarkably consistent in achieving the same positive level of growth in each quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>Turning to our successful Eastern European business, organic growth has continued its slight accelerating trend in each quarter of the year and is in the mid-teens.</p>
          <p>Let's look briefly at Europe by category. All categories have achieved positive organic growth for the nine months. The bigger categories, Chocolate, Culinary, PetCare and Soluble Coffee, achieved high single-digit organic growth. The main drivers are the same as at the half year; the re-launch of KitKat, the successful launch of KitKat Senses, the re-launch of the NESCAF&#xC9; range and the rollout of NESCAF&#xC9; Dolce Gusto, a good innovation pipeline in PetCare, replicating successful launches in North America, good communication around nutrition and health in culinary all being examples.</p>
          <p>Also, as you know, Nestl&#xE9; has good exposure to the fast growing hard discounter channel as well as traditional retail, and generally speaking is in categories or segments that have relatively low private label presence. In Eastern Europe, all our categories except the small sugar business are achieving double-digit organic growth.</p>
          <p>Next is the Americas.  It reported sales of CHF23.8 billion. Organic growth was 10.7% and RIG 3%. There was higher single-digit organic growth in North America and double-digit organic growth in Latin America.</p>
          <p>North America achieved a good improvement in the third quarter. There was increased pricing in PetCare and there is slight improvement in Ice Cream's RIG. Frozen Food also contributed to the improvement, posting a good recovery in line with our guidance at the half year.</p>
          <p>Those of you who worry about HOT POCKETS will be pleased to hear that its organic growth is above 5%. It is benefiting in particular from some very good nutritional messaging on LEAN POCKETS as well as some broader innovation and launches.</p>
          <p>Chocolate also accelerated strongly, so this category has certainly benefited from an earlier buy-in for Halloween this year than last year. Soluble coffee continues to perform well.</p>
          <p>Latin America's slowdown in organic growth from the first half was due to ambient dairy, which though still growing double-digit, reflected lower milk prices in the region. Soluble coffee, PetCare and Biscuits accelerated during the quarter, while Chocolate and Culinary slowed little. Almost all categories are achieving double-digit organic growth.</p>
          <p>Next is Zone Asia, Oceania, and Africa. It achieved sales of CHF12.7 billion, organic growth was 13.2% and RIG 4.5%. The cumulative RIG is unchanged form the half-year, but the half-year was heavily rated to the first quarter. These numbers therefore demonstrate strong momentum in this zone.</p>
          <p>Our other zones, major emerging markets such as Middle East, South Asia, Africa and Greater China, are achieving double-digit organic growth. I'd point to our scale, the strength of our brands and distribution, and the success of our PPP strategy targeted at low-income consumers, as key drivers of this strong performance.</p>
          <p>As you know, we went through a reorganization of our Japanese business last year. We are now enjoying positive RIG and organic growth there, reflecting in part the low comparatives from last year, but also an improved performance with products flowing from our pipeline to the market, including NESCAF&#xC9; Dolce Gusto and the new NESCAF&#xC9; refill that has taken 15% of the market within four weeks of launch.</p>
          <p>In the Japanese PetCare market, we've taken leadership in cat, which is the bigger segment. All the key categories in the zone achieved high single-digit or double-digit organic growth.</p>
          <p>A few words on China.  To talk milk specifically, our situation in Mainland China is good relative to the market. The ripples from the events of last month have, however, washed over the dairy industry, creating cash flow challenges for wholesalers, disruption in the supply chain and confusion among consumers.</p>
          <p>More broadly, our total Mainland China business is doing well with double-digit organic growth, and will, we believe, continue to do so. Apologies for the Nestl&#xE9; lawnmower going past outside the window.</p>
          <p>Moving now to Nestl&#xE9; Waters, they reported sales of CHF7.6 billion. The organic growth was minus 1% and the RIG minus 3.2%. This performance is unchanged from the half year. It reflects the slowdown of the bottled water category as well as trading down to lower price brands in Western Europe and North America.  Our emerging market business continued to deliver organic growth above 20%.  The two-billionaire brands, Poland Spring and Nestl&#xE9; Pure Life, achieved positive growth as did the premium brands San Pellegrino and Perrier. Nestl&#xE9; Pure Life is now the number one water brand in the world.</p>
          <p>Those of you in the UK who understand how irrational is the environmental debate around bottled water can now share in Nestl&#xE9; Pure Life's success at ASDA. John Harris, the CEO of our Water business, will discuss this category further at our webcast press conference later this morning.</p>
          <p>Next at Nestl&#xE9; Nutrition. Sales were CHF7.8 billion, organic growth was 9.6% and RIG 4%. This performance points to a full year outcome not much below its long-term target of 10% annual organic growth.</p>
          <p>The Infant Nutrition business continues to perform really well, particularly Infant Formula, which is comfortably into double-digit organic growth in the Americas and AOA, and not far off double-digit in Europe.  Innovation is driving growth, so it is good there to report that the pipeline is rich.</p>
          <p>We are pleased with our launch of NaturNes baby food in Europe starting in France and rolling out from there, now also in Spain.  This is a new offering in baby food, 100% natural with a new cooking process and benefiting from its competitive advantage, cooking in aseptic packaging, enabling a new range of ingredients to be included as well as a greater ability to add active benefits to the products. This is the biggest innovation in packaging in baby food since the move from tins to glass 50 years ago.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, we've been working hard across the Baby Food, Healthcare and Performance divisions to improve our profit mix through rationalizing our range and SKUs. As you might expect, this has slightly slowed down our organic growth.  This rationalization has also been part of the merging process of Novartis's Healthcare business with our own. The integrations of this business and of GERBER, also acquired last year, have been completed.</p>
          <p>Finally in Nutrition, a word on Jenny Craig.  This, together with Performance Nutrition, is the most sensitive of our Nutrition businesses to economic conditions. We have seen a trending down from the amazing performance that we enjoyed in the first quarter. That said, the organic growth for the nine months is above the level achieved in 2007.</p>
          <p>Last, Nespresso and our Food &amp; Beverage business, our Food &amp; Beverage joint ventures bracketed under Other Food &amp; Beverages. Sales were CHF2.9 billion. Organic growth was 22.8% and RIG 19.7%.</p>
          <p>Nespresso's momentum has continued unchecked, with organic growth in the high 30s. Cereal Partners Worldwide had a strong third quarter, whilst Beverage Partners Worldwide slowed somewhat, reflecting tough comparisons resulting from last year's launch program. This organic growth remains above 20%.</p>
          <p>Now next we have the slide summarizing the product Group performance. I have covered much of the detail during my run through the zones, so I'll just go briefly through the product groups.</p>
          <p>Powdered &amp; Liquid Beverages achieved sales of CHF13.7 billion. Organic growth was 13.1%, and RIG 8.1%. This product group continues to deliver a very strong performance.</p>
          <p>Soluble coffee has maintained its good momentum. By the way, you might be surprise to know that over 50% of our sales of soluble coffee are in emerging markets -- 52% to be precise. Organic growth of Powdered Beverages is bit slower than at the half year.</p>
          <p>Milk Products including ice cream had sales of CHF15.9 billion. Organic growth was 10.8%, and RIG 1.7%. The organic growth of ambient dairy products is experiencing the effects of falling milk prices, but remains double-digit in most markets. The RIG in dairy is also positive.</p>
          <p>The COFFEE-MATE billionaire brand continued to perform well across all zones. Ice cream's growth improved a bit during the last quarter. Premium brands and those characterized by healthy consumer propositions continued to outperform.</p>
          <p>Prepared Dishes &amp; Cooking Aids reported sales of CHF13.1 billion. Organic growth was 6.3% and RIG 1.4%. This is an acceleration from earlier in the year due to an improvement in frozen food in the US and Maggi's continued strong organic growth in Asia and Africa, as well as its good recent performance in Germany.</p>
          <p>Confectionery achieved sales of CHF8.7 billion. Organic growth was 9.1% and RIG 2.8%. This is a broad-based performance, with high single-digit organic growth in all three zones. The acceleration from an already strong first half reflects mainly the early demand for Halloween in the US relative to last year and a good performance in the UK with some early Christmas selling.</p>
          <p>PetCare had sales of CHF9 billion. Organic growth was 11.4% and RIG 5%. The acceleration in the third quarter reflects the effects of the necessary pricing action taken late in the first half, with demand proving to be quite resilient.</p>
          <p>Pharmaceutical Products have sales of CHF5.6 billion, 9.5% organic growth and 8.9% real internal growth.</p>
          <p>Alcon and the joint ventures, Galderma and Inn&#xE9;ov continue to grow nicely.</p>
          <p>My final slide before wrapping up is on our financial position. I should say that we do not feel any particular need to discuss this. As you know, our exceptionally strong balance sheet and predictable cash flows makes us the gold standard in the industry. We've included this slide simply because we've been getting a lot of questions. Our message is simple: Nestl&#xE9;'s debt has been more short-term than long-term rated because this has been the most cost efficient strategy.</p>
          <p>We have seen continued demand for our commercial paper in September and October and we continue to place it at sub-LIBOR levels. We expect to end 2008 with lower net debt than at the end of 2007 due to the $10.4 billion inflow generated by the partial disposal of Alcon. These funds received in July have a maturity that reduced our exposure to the commercial paper market.</p>
          <p>We are continuing with our share buyback at the accelerated pace announced in August, such that by the end of the year we will probably be running about CHF2 billion ahead of where we would otherwise have been, with about CHF13 billion of the 25 billion completed.</p>
          <p>Our commitment to capital expenditure is unchanged. We will continue to support the needs of the business with a particular focus on higher return, higher growth businesses such as Nestl&#xE9; Nutrition and Soluble Coffee. As an example, I'm sure you all saw this week's announcement of a CHF240 million investment in a soluble coffee facility in Russia.</p>
          <p>To summarize then, Nestl&#xE9; continues to perform at a high level. We expect to finish the year well above our long-term target for organic growth at about 8%. Our financial position is strong, and a competitive advantage today as always.</p>
          <p>I'd be happy now to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  Okay. So, ladies and gentlemen, your question-and-answer session will now begin. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Marco Gulpers from ING. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning Roddy. Congratulations on the results. Two questions, if I may. The first is on your statement with respect to margins. You are continuing to see progress in margins. Could you update us on whether you are happy with underlying consensus expectations of 30 basis points reported? That's question number one.</p>
          <p>Question number two is on negotiations with the trade. You've mentioned during September that you're forecasting still some three to 4% input cost inflation for next year. I was slightly surprised by the high pricing you still have to take in the third quarter and was wondering how much further pricing you still see coming? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Marco. I wasn't aware that I made a comment on margins, but in any event I will talk about the consensus. I mean the consensus is for a 30 basis point improvement in the EBIT margin. And I think to achieve 30 basis points despite currency headwinds is always going to be a challenge. We were able to do so at the half year and we intend doing so again. That said, one thing we don't believe, as some of you do, is that the second half is going to easier than the first half.</p>
          <p>So on the trade part. I think, I mean the thing to remember about pricing is that the pricing that we are reporting in the third quarter of 2008 is a reflection of all the pricing that we've taken since Q4 2007.  It's not just pricing taken in the last month. It reflects the comparative over the third quarter of 2007 and therefore the trend of the pricing in the meantime. That said, I mean there has been more pricing. We've taken pricing in PetCare and in some of the other categories as well. So there has been some more pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Marco.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of David Hayes from Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Roddy.  I have three questions. Okay, one more broad and one more specific. On the broad side, I mean just in terms of the third quarter progression, is there anything that we should be looking at in terms of the slowdown, either markets or product category? I mean looking at the full year guidance, you're kind of assuming on our numbers slowdown in organic sales of about 5.7% in the fourth quarter. Looking at the third quarter, looks like there's nothing wrong with the world. Is there anything that you'd highlight that we should be aware of in the fourth quarter in terms of slowing?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, and a bit more specifically, just in terms of pricing.  I mean, Europe in particular, big jump up in pricing from I think 2.7 in the second quarter to 5.2 in the third. If you just talk a bit more about what's driving that in terms of, again, of timing of price increases and the areas that maybe you've seen those in? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So why we think we'll trend down from 8.9 to 8 by the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, there are number of things. I mean, first of all, as I said in my speech, our confectionery business has clearly benefited from some earlier buying against Halloween and Christmas to last year.  So those are, if you will, sales that were made in Q4 last year that are Q3 this year.</p>
          <p>The order business continues to be slow. We're launching NESCAF&#xC9; Dolce Gusto in four markets this year, Japan, some in the Americas and elsewhere in Europe. Those are in the market in September for pre-Christmas sales. So obviously, there is a big kick-up in September from that launch, which will then work its way through the final quarter.</p>
          <p>We think Nutrition will be nearer to 9 than 10. It's currently nearer 10 than 9. And as I said also in the speech, the ambient dairy pricing is coming off. So there are a numbers of things going on that I think would help us, although give us justification for thinking we are going to have a slower fourth quarter. And I think the pricing, and I don't want to repeat myself, but it's not all about what we did in Q3. It's about what we did in the year leading up to Q3.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But certainly in Europe, Chocolate, Culinary, Soluble Coffee and PetCare all had increased pricing. So there is pricing going through. They are the main categories that are always affected.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just quickly, you mentioned ambient dairy prices coming off. We saw yesterday I think it was, or certainly this week, a couple of competitors talk about coffee prices coming down in some markets. Is that something that you're following, seeing, would we expect in the second -- in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, if you look at the traded commodities from June to October, they're all down double-digit percentages.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And this is a reflection of the, this is my speculation if you will, getting out of those commodities, but that's a very short-term dynamic. I think mid-term the commodity prices will be more driven by the economic condition, in other words by consumer demand. And I think longer-term, all the good things that are driving our business in terms of growing populations and growing incomes that are good news for us, will also drive the commodity prices. We've been forecasting lower commodity prices, remember we said that back in June at our seminar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And therefore the positions that we've had have reflected that view. We maybe looking opportunistically to change the view if lower prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much. Thanks Roddy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Cox from Kepler. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I have two questions for you. Well, I'll limit myself to two, shall I say. Just you can come back to that comment about the Americas. I think you said that volume was slowing down in the Americas, but otherwise it looked okay there. I wondered if you just give us any update on the US situation. Are they trading down, trading up, trading whatever it might be? And then just on the channels in Europe, I wondered if you just give us some idea the different growth dynamics? Because you mentioned that you're in categories where private label tends to be pretty underdeveloped. But I guess you are probably growing stronger in discount channels than maybe in the traditional retail channels.  As a little add-on to that, it seems to be an improvement in Europe in Q3. Is that just because some of the retailers have been fighting back, some of the mainstream retailers, and you've gained from that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jon. Good of you to respect the rules and limit yourself to two. The &#x2013; no, I said that the RIG in the US had accelerated in the quarter, not decelerated. Frozen foods recovered nicely, as did both the STOUFFERS business and HOT POCKETS. Ice cream was slightly better. So, I didn't point to a slowdown in the US in the quarter. Latin America was slightly slower in terms of RIG than in the half.  And that was a very specific situation in Mexico where we are launching a very -- sorry, we are lapping a very heavy 2007 launch for example in our milk business. And that's had a slightly negative impact on the RIG in the Mexican dairy business, which is a very big business, so it does move the dial.</p>
          <p>Europe, I haven't got any data on growth trends in the different channels. And we did give you that data at the half-year.  Well, we gave it to you actually at the beginning of September. So I don't imagine it's changed very much from then. What we saw at that stage was double-digit growth in hard discounters. Rather slower growth in the traditional retail. But our business was outperforming both in the hard discount channel and in the traditional retail channel.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Roddy. Could I just ask on your finance cost, I think given the short-term weighting of your debt, has the turmoil in the financial markets had any impact on your interest costs for the second half relative to what you were looking at previously? And secondly, can I just, going back to the -- your response to the first question on the margin consensus outlook.</p>
          <p>And further just make sure I got this right.  I mean, you say you still think that the consensus is a realistic place for people to be in your comment about some people looking for stronger performances in the second half versus the first? Your first half, you are up 30 basis points, so the consensus is looking for a similar performance, so I take it that was a comment on some of the outliers rather than on the consensus itself?</p>

          <p>The answer to question two is, yes. The answer to question one is that we guided the first half of the year to about a billion, as the income statement cost and we're sticking to that guidance.  Be about a billion for the net financing cost.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Roddy. Congratulation also from my side for the good result. I have also two questions. One question is about China, could you give us a sense about the market down there, giving also the experience you have, when these issue is about these problems -- product problems are coming through? And could you just tell us also how much your chilled dairy business grew in nine months and also in Q3 and what market growth was there? And the second question is about private label in the US and also in Europe, have you already seen trading down and/or private label issues in the US?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Alain. China, I'm not sure that I can add much to what I said earlier on. I mean, there's clearly been -- I mean, it's a terrible story for the consumers and there's clearly been disruption in the market. As I say, we are outperforming the market in dairy in mainland China. The rest of our business is continuing to perform very well. And I think that's all I can say. I mean, we're obviously increased our number of R&amp;D experts and scientists and the like.  We have taken some of them consistently to China to help the local people to accelerate all the testing and stuff that we needed to do. So the situation is being managed very, very well.</p>
          <p>I would just repeat what you all know, which is that, we apply the same standards, the same quality levels, the same procedures in China and everywhere else in the world that we do in Switzerland and all the other developed markets.  There's only one way of doing business at Nestl&#xE9;. At the press conference after this call, Paul Bulcke will talk a bit more about China, but there is not much more to add than that really.</p>
          <p>Chilled dairy, I mean we have a chilled dairy business anymore, but so far as we have one, it's doing pretty well. It's doing sort of high single-digit organic growth. Then private label.  I haven't got much to say.  I mean, as I said in my speech, where our categories are relatively lowly exposed. And to give you an example, in the soluble coffee in the UK, which is, as you know, a very intense private label market, less than 20% of the soluble coffee market is private-label.</p>
          <p>In categories where we are more exposed, Water, we are clearly -- we are clearly struggling from down trading, as I said in my presentation. Ice cream, I think, is more of the big large tubs, which is private label, where we're less present. I think what I would say is that we are benefiting from our strategy of focusing on the -- on added value categories and increasingly on the more premium end of the categories where we are playing. We have strong differentiation from not just private label, but also from our branded competitors.  And that what's driving these strong numbers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Patrik Schwendimann, Z&#x3CB;rcher Kantonalbank. Good morning, Roddy. I have two questions, first regarding Latin America.  You still have a very nice double-digit growth in Latin America. But it seems, I mean, overall the environment is getting tougher.  What are your expectations there for I would say next year? Are you feeling already some slowdown there, or still very optimistic? And secondly, regarding the Nutrition business, which still had a nice growth of 9.6%, but which was coming down quarter-by-quarter. You were mentioning Performance Nutrition and Jenny Craig.  What should you expect for the next couple of quarters? Do you see some more slowdown in nutrition, or still would say, no it's possible to get the 10%? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Patrik. Nutrition I think will be nearer to nine than 10, but that's still within reach of our long-term target of 10%, so a slight slowdown. And as I said, the big business there, infant nutrition, is performing very well. The healthcare nutrition business, the RIG and organic growth are not yet really benefiting from the inclusion of the Novartis business because that's only just coming to those figures. So hopefully next year that will be a benefit to the RIG and organic growth numbers.</p>
          <p>Also as I said, the RIG and organic growth numbers are softening slightly from the rationalization that we've been doing of brands and SKUs. So this is, I mean, it's a story that you are quite familiar with for Nestl&#xE9;.  We've been clearly focusing on improving the product mix in the category by rationalizing some of the SKUs. So. as ever, it's not just about growth, it's about the Nestl&#xE9; model, and the Nestl&#xE9; model for Nestl&#xE9; Nutrition, driving both high topline organic growth, but also the margin. And I think that's what we we'll be doing this year and next. In Latin America, we have seen a mix picture by category and by country.  Some are going faster, some are going slower. The one thing that is consistent is that the pricing is coming off in ambient dairy, which is exactly what you would expect here in view of the milk prices in the market. But we are not seeing anything that points to regionwide slowdown or acceleration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You are still also optimistic for next year for Latin America? So you don't see a major slowdown there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't see a major slowdown other than the fact that the pricing will come off in shelf-stable dairy.  And shelf-stable dairy is about a third of that business. So it clearly has a notable impact on the Latin American organic growth number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot, Roddy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Our next question goes from the line of Xavier Croquez from Exane. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Roddy. I'm sorry to go back on my first question to nutrition. If I take quarterly figures roughly I have 14% for Q1, 8% for Q2 and let's say an unchanged Q3 at seven. Just to clarify the comment you made initially and the comment you made in the previous question, the swing between Q1 and Q2 which has remained stable in Q3 was mainly due to Jenny Craig and Performance Nutrition is what I understood from your initial comment, that the rationalization of healthcare is going on. And that actually infant formula continues to be robust throughout the three quarters.  That's my question. Are we still cruising at around 10% in the core IMS business, Q1, Q2, Q3 is my first question?</p>
          <p>And the second question is, I didn't hear much comments on Russia. What is the current mood for sales and consumption? And how is your business doing in that country because there are some concerns on that major growth driver? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Xavier. As you will recall, the first quarter in Nutrition was the anomaly. If you remember, the 2007 quarterly Nutrition numbers were pretty steady at a high level, but not as high as 14. They were, I think, around the 10, 11, 9 or 10 level. And that's what we are now seeing after Q1 again, a return to the level of around 9%, 9, 10%. So Q1 was the anomaly, and, yes, it was Jenny Craig that accounted for the anomaly. And Jenny Craig is now returning to more normal levels of growth. Yes, infant nutrition is continuing to perform at the same level give or take as at the first quarter. It's still into double digits, performing very well, particularly the infant formula business.</p>
          <p>Russia, I mean clearly we have a very positive view on Russia or we wouldn't be investing CHF0.25 billion in a new factory there. The trend through this year has been of accelerating organic growth in our Russian business. And that is both driven by RIG and by pricing. And it is true of just about every category that we're in. So we are seeing a very strong performance in Russia. Worth remembering, we are the second largest food and beverage business in Russia. The largest international or non-Russian Food &amp; Beverage business in Russia. So we have strong market positions and we're in dynamic, fast-growing categories. So it's a super story for us at the moment. And it's also across a very nicely profitable market.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I thought I'd come back for a second go. Just to clarify on that, you said CHF1 billion as your net finance charge for this year. I thought your guidance was around 800 million at one point. Did I understand you correctly there? Can you just clarify that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure. No, we had, I think from memory we had I think 530 financing cost at the half year.  And we said that we'd about double that for the full year. We never guided to 800 and I'm just reconfirming that the guidance hasn't changed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks so much. Because I was thinking that you might do something with the money coming in from Alcon that might help you a little bit in the second half of the year. But obviously not.  But, okay, thanks.</p>

          <p>There are always winners and losers, aren't there? And that's clearly reducing our debt. But we're spending more on the share buyback and other stuff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Any thoughts for the next couple of years then because you're talking about maybe your net debt being slightly lower at the end of this year? I guess holding all things equal with the buyback on the one hand and the cash coming in for next year, I guess your net debt will be down again slightly.  But so I guess we should be still thinking about another CHF1 billion in financing costs for the next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in these markets, it's a bit of a risky number to be trying to forecast. But there's nothing, the fact that we are continuing to achieve sub-LIBOR rates on our paper tells you what a strong position we're in.  And we're clearly going to do the best we can, but I'm not going to commit to a financing cost figure at this stage for next year. But whatever the environment is in the debt markets, we are fantastically positioned to benefit from a flight to quality, or as you've seen in the easier times, from our strong balance sheet.</p>
