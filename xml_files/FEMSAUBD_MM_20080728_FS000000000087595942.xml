      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to FEMSA's second quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Joining me today are H&#xE9;ctor Trevi&#xF1;o, Coca-Cola FEMSA CFO and Juan Fonseca, from FEMSA Investor relations.</p>
          <p>In an environment of sustained raw materials and the inflationary pressure across the markets during the second quarter, we were again able to grow our consolidated operating income, ahead of revenues and coming close to double-digits.</p>
          <p>On a rolling 12-month basis, we have achieved operating leverage every single quarter, which highlights our team's commitment to growth and productivity gains, as well as the sustained benefits of our integrated business platform. All of our operations, soft drinks, beer and OXXO stores contribute to our 7.7% topline growth, reaching 40.6 billion pesos or $3.9 billion for the quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of the macroeconomic environment, even though we continue to see resilient consumer demand, it is increasing the evidence that overall growth expectations for the region and particularly for Mexico are decreasing. The central bank has reduced its GDP forecast for the year by over a full percentage point from 3.8 to 2.7%, while inflationary pressures continued to build and as a result, interest rates continued to rise. But we'll continue closely monitoring the economic evolution as well as a decent market dynamics and we will keep adopting our strategies as needed going forward.</p>
          <p>In terms of our results for the quarter, we should highlight that FEMSA Cerveza's positive pricing trends in the key Mexican market, combined with contained administrative expenses partially offset the continued pressure coming from grain prices and sustained marketing activity.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, Coca-Cola FEMSA closed the acquisition of Remil, the new franchise territory in Brazil that was already consolidated in our June results, and continued to capture the benefits of integrating Jugos del Valle into its platform.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, OXXO opened 215 net new stores to reach 5,851 nationwide, picking up the pace of expansion and delivering strong bottom-line growth for the ninth consecutive quarter. And altogether FEMSA consolidated operating income growth was 9.4% with a slight margin expansion of 20 basis points and net majority income increasing 12%.</p>
          <p>I would like to remind you that beginning this year, according to Mexican FRS, we have discontinued the use of inflation accounting. For comparison purposes, the figures for 2007 have been restated in Mexican pesos with purchasing power as of December 31st, 2007 and our results for 2008 are in current pesos.</p>
          <p>Moving on to our business units in greater detail, FEMSA Cerveza delivered solid volume growth in the quarter, reflecting still resilient consumer demand trends, despite price increases implemented at the beginning of the year, and to a lesser extent, some unfavorable weather conditions experienced during June in Central Mexico. Beer volume in Mexico increased 2.9% lapping a 3.2% second quarter last year.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., our exports grew 4.4% lapping a very strong growth of 27% in the second quarter of 2007, even as the overall economy in general and the beer import category in particular continued to spotter. In fact according to the beer institutes, imports fell 3.1% during the first five months of 2008, so we feel pleased with our performance in these key markets.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, our volume performance was back on track and we grew almost 13%, outpacing industry growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. Incremental volumes of our Sol brand contributed a third of our growth in the period. We continued to be in an investment phase in Brazil, allocated significant resources to the development of our brands, and we continue to be encouraged by the results achieved so far.</p>
          <p>In terms of Mexico pricing, the price increase rolled out at the end of 2007 until the first quarter of this year together with incremental volumes from the State of Chiapas that were brought under our direct distribution early in the year, as well as some mix effect resulted in almost 3% higher average price in real terms.</p>
          <p>We must note that the second quarter figures reflect six months of the incremental pricing from Chiapas, so we can expect the effect from this additional volume to be less relevant during the third and fourth quarters.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, revenue per hectoliter in real terms was stable in local currency and increased 2.3% in Mexican peso terms, driven by the appreciation of the Brazilian real against the Mexican peso. Price increases implemented in the first quarter offset some incremental off-trade volumes that were shifted from us to the Coke bottling systems since the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>And as for exports, revenue per hectoliter in Mexican peso declined 7.5%, reflecting a strong peso during the quarter, while the fast growth of lowered price <mark type="inaudible" /> resulted in a slight price decrease in dollar terms.</p>
          <p>Cost of sales increased 9.0%, well ahead of revenue growth. Higher fixed cost absorption, favorable aluminum hedges, and a strong Brazilian real as applied to a dollar cost partially offset significant grain price pressure experienced during the quarter, resulting in a 4.2% increase in average cost of goods sold per hectoliter. The gross profit increased 5.8% for the quarter, however gross margin declined by 90 basis points.</p>
          <p>Finally income from operations increased 0.6% to 1.7 million pesos in the second quarter. Selling expenses increased 11.5%, driven mainly by the increase in our direct distribution volume coming from Chiapas, as I mentioned, as well as by sustained marketing and distribution channel investments. Isolating the Chiapas effect, selling expenses would have grown more in line with revenues. As was the case in the analysis of the unit price, these figures reflect six months of the Chiapas operations.</p>
          <p>And conversely, our municipal expenses declined 2.3%. As a result of this, operating expenses added only 20 basis points to the gross margin contraction with the operating margin decreasing 110 basis points to 15.7% of total revenues.</p>
          <p>Wrapping up our remarks on Cerveza, we can say that we again made progress in our main business initiatives. We've continued increasing our brand equity and the availability of our products across our main markets, while managing to balance our objectives with a challenging environment and delivering a set of numbers that is consistent with our short and long-term goals.</p>
          <p>Turning to our soft drinks business, Coca-Cola FEMSA increased its operating income 8.9%, lapping a 10.5% increase in the second quarter of 2007. In spite of some operating disruptions on unfavorable weather conditions in certain markets, this was a tremendous achievement, we think.</p>
          <p>Cost benefits resulting from lower sweetener prices, mainly Mexico, and depreciation of the local currencies in the largest markets combined with operating leverage in most markets resulted in 40 basis points of operating margin improvement to 17.1%. Price increases implemented across the operations and volume growth, mainly driven by our non-carbonated beverage portfolio, resulted in 6.7% growth in revenues to over 18.5 billion pesos or $1.8 billion.</p>
          <p>In the key Mexican market, as we anticipated in the first quarter, the addition of Jugos del Valle to our portfolio in the traditional channel delivered 60% of our incremental volumes in the quarter, but the majority of the balance came from the growth of brand Coca-Cola.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, average prices were stable including our fast-growing jug water business and grew 0.8% ex-jugs. Volume growth, stable pricing, and some operating leverage resulted in a moderate increase of 1.2% in operating income during the quarter. However, our balanced geographic portfolio continued to deliver results with Latincentro and Mercosur contributing the majority of the operating income growth in the quarter, and particularly, pricing in Mercosur combined with tighter expense control in Latincentro and operating improvements across the different markets to achieve these results.</p>
          <p>If you were unable to participate in Coca-Cola FEMSA's conference call last Wednesday, you can access a replay of the webcast for additional details on the results. And then also strong traffic growth for the quarter of 14.3% offset the reduction in the average ticket of 12.2%, this on a non-comparable basis, resulting in a slight improvement of 0.3% in same-stores sales in the quarter.</p>
          <p>As has the case in the fourth quarter of 2007, the reduction in the average ticket is being driven by a migration from consumer purchases of prepaid cellular phone cards, for which we book the full sale prices revenue to the new electronic air-time purchase, from which we only book the amount of our commission as opposed to the full amount of the recharge.</p>
          <p>For comparability purposes, if we book the full amount of the electronic recharges, OXXO's average ticket would have grown in the low single-digits during the quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of new store openings, we accelerated the pace adding 215 units during the second quarter for a total of 754 net openings in the last 12 months, slightly ahead of our 2009 target of approximately 730 stores. Revenues increased 11.2% during the quarter, reflecting strong growth among most product categories.</p>
          <p>Gross margin improved 300 basis points, largely driven by the change in the way we book prepaid cellular air-time, as I just described; helped as well as by an implementation of improved pricing strategies and promotions and by a strong performance from high margin categories such as coffee and alternative beverages.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses increased above revenues due to higher operating costs at the store level, mainly energy and maintenance related, as well as expenses related to the strengthening of OXXO's organizational structure that are being carried out through 2008 as laid out in our plans for the year.</p>
          <p>Despite the rising operating expenses, OXXO's operating income increased a little bit over 40%, contributing half of FEMSA's consolidated growth and expanded its operating margin by 140 basis points to reach 6.5% of revenues.</p>
          <p>Once more, OXXO made progress on both the strategic and the operational fronts in the quarter. The accelerated store growth and the continued deployment of the processes and technological enablers that will allow OXXO to take its competitive position to new levels are being achieved while profitability targets are met and sometimes exceeded. OXXO continues to grow as a unique and formidable element of our integrated business platform.</p>
          <p>And so summing it up and in line with our long-term message, once again, our team was able to make progress along our key business objectives, while delivering good result in a challenging environment.</p>
          <p>And with that, I would like to open the call for your questions. Operator, please. Operator, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Javier. The question and answer session will begin at this time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And we'll take our first question from Tufic Salem with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, Javier. My question is regarding price increases in beer in Mexico, if you can &#x2013; your competitor mentioned this morning that they are taking price increase up to about potentially 4%, and, as we speak. And I was wondering, if you could give us a sense of what you are seeing in the market, and also what your strategy is regarding this price increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Tufic, hi. If you remember we've said that we are starting rolling out prices at the end of last year and the first quarter. In the end, we were able to pass something like a, maybe 4.5% price increase at the beginning of the year. And we said that during the rest of the year, we will be very attentive to the consumer purchasing power and the economy performance overall to look for opportunities, in terms of being able to pass a little bit more of the high cost inflation that we were suffering basically on the grain side to consumers.</p>
          <p>And on our part, what we have been doing, I would say since maybe last month, the month of June, we have been identifying also some markets, product package can go for presentations in which we feel strong consumer demand still present us with the possibility of also applying some price increases. We have been doing that consistently for the last, I would say, 45 days. So far, what we've seen is that the market has been able to take those increases. We are trying to manage both dimensions of the business, both the profitability of the business considering the pressure on the cost side and also looking at again the demand from the consumer base.</p>
          <p>And I wouldn't dare to say a total number in terms of what the opportunities for price during the next month or couple of months would end up to be, but what I can ratify is that we are willing to still take advantage of those opportunities in price increases that we see in the market considering the situation we have on the cost side. 3 to 4%, to my personal belief, seems doable. We will need to take the next, maybe month, month-and-a-half to look if this is the case. But, we feel confident that the market dynamics and the reasons behind the industry doing these kind of exercises on the pricing front are well &#x2013; are good reasons for being positive about this possibility to take. So, we are basically doing what we've said, which is managing the business under the circumstances of the year, and we've been taking advantage of some of those windows of opportunity in some markets, and we pretend to continue doing so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, and can you just explain a little bit further &#x2013; that you can we give us more sense of &#x2013; how &#x2013; this price increase, how is it different, may be in terms of regions, packages from what we saw &#x2013; from the price increases we saw at the beginning of the year? Is there anything that strikes you &#x2013; is there a highlight of this difference?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, any price increase, it looks very different, one from the other, both in terms of timing, channel, product brand, architecture. And I would say &#x2013; the only comment that I would make is that we think we have gained a lot of knowledge in terms of how to do these things in order to maintain, as much as we can, the customer base without any effect.</p>
          <p>And so, we are looking at prices in which we feel we have strong brand equity going into the right direction, good strength in terms of our competitive position, and managing price gaps against the competitors, so we can, again, manage the business both for the long and for the short term. So, that will be my comment, Tufi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and our next question comes from Lauren Torres with HSBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I guess it's a follow-up to the answer you gave to the previous question, and also hearing Coke FEMSA last week talk about some softness in Mexico. I was just hoping you could be a bit more specific over the last month or two. What are you seeing with respect to consumer purchasing activity, be it at your beer business or just looking at the flows at your OXXO store business, are you seeing a slowdown here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Let me try to separate these in basically three concepts. One, yes, the month of June and the beginning of July didn't seem as favorable as the performance of the businesses had until May. But still, it's, I would say, too soon to tell to be sure about what's been going on in the last 45, 50 days.</p>
          <p>There's definitely a weather effect in Central Mexico and also in Southern Mexico because of weather, precisely. The performance of the different geographies still doesn't really tells us a story by which we can attribute the performance to, for example, the price movements we've been making because we have still some very good performance in geographies in which we moved already pricing and in some others in which we haven't &#x2013; maybe the volume performance is not as good. And the overall performance of the economy, I just mentioned that definitely we're looking for a second semester in which the growth should now adapt to the new circumstances of the economy overall.</p>
          <p>So, I would say that it's still a little bit too soon to tell. As I said, we will be very careful of managing pricing opportunities looking at consumer demand going forward, and of course, if you compare performance in beer from the first to the second quarter &#x2013; first year, the first quarter grew about 7% but that had a lot of &#x2013; that had a lot to do with the performance in the first quarter of 2008 and '07 which you remember was a very, very difficult quarter for us.</p>
          <p>So all in all, I would say, June and July presenting, I would say, a little bit or quite different behavior from comparing to numbers to May, but still, I would say, a little bit soon to tell; nevertheless, of course, our second quarter perspectives being not as strong as the first semester.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And we'll go to our next question from Robert Ford with Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning, everybody. Good morning, Javier. I had a question with respect to the admin expenses, they are down 3.4%, but part of that is the elimination now of the amortization of ERP, and I was wondering what that number was? And as you move forward to upgrade your systems platform and consolidate your systems platform with Coke FEMSA, when and what kind of new charges can we expect going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I don't &#x2013; Hi, Bob. I don't have those precise number here with me, and I'm not in same room as the rest of my colleague. So if Fonseca help me out with the first part of the questions, please, Juan, go ahead. And on the second one, I would say that the project in which we are trying to upgrade and amalgamate the platform, we'll start to roll out the bulk of the expenses, I would say, into the second part of 2009, and I would say that the incremental spending would be not material considering the net effect of the finalization of the amortization of the first phase of the ERP, and now the second project, and also by the fact that most of the expenses incurred in this kind of projects are going to be capitalized and then amortized in like a four-year period. So the real effect into the P&amp;L, I think will start to flow into the P&amp;L in 2010 and '11. Juan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Javier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to understand that correctly, so when you upgrade finally and the numbers begin to hit the income statement in the second half of '09, the amortization scheduled, plus you're sharing the platform of a much larger business, revenue base, right? As you share the cost for that platform, is it materially lower than the amortization schedule you had for your previous ERP system?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I am not sure about, it's going to be substantially lower. What I can share with you is that I don't &#x2013; we don't think it's going to be substantial, a substantial impact as it starts to go through the P&amp;L on an amortized &#x2013; amortization basis for the next four years, starting in 2000 &#x2013; late 2009, early 2010, depending on the time the rollout of the project starts to kick in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me just finish up with the previous question, thanks Jennifer. Follow-up on the amount of the ERP that was being amortized, we had talked in the past about something like a $20 million per year number, and so it was about 50 million pesos per quarter. So very consistent with what we said before. Thanks, Jennifer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And our next question comes from Alan Alan&#xED;s with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Two quick questions. The first one has to do with beer in Mexico and the second one has to do with beer in Brazil. Beer in Mexico, we continue to see very solid growth of OXXO and that is very good. Could you tell us how much beer is being sold right now through OXXO and what's happening with the other channels where FEMSA Cerveza is selling their beer? Because this morning Modelo reported and we continue to see similar trends of growth between Modelo and FEMSA; however, FEMSA has OXXO growing so fast. So I wondered what's happening with the other channels, mom-and-pops, on-premise. Any color that you can give us to understand better will be very, very valuable, Javier? And the second question regarding Brazil, it's a clarification. You mentioned that prices in reals were stable. However, when we use the exchange rate that you provide in the press release, we see a 12% price decline from the second quarter of '07 to the second quarter of '08. So I was just wondering what explains that, that decline in prices and beer in Brazil. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alan, and hi. Juan, I will ask you to help me with the second part of question and in terms of Mexico, if I recall correctly OXXO should account for something like 12%, a little bit in excess of 12% of the beer that FEMSA Cerveza in Mexico sells. And you are right, in the quarter, Modelo basically just informed a growth for the quarter, which is basically pretty much in line with our growth for the quarter also. If you look at the accumulated figures of the June, that's a different story.</p>
          <p>In a quarter-by-quarter basis, this is, I would say, a difficult thing to measure because competitive dynamics and volume performance throughout the regions are having two players with very different market share positions in the country make it very, very hard to really have a good read on a quarter-by-quarter basis. We tend to look this more on a last 12-month rolling or at least on a up to June kind of figures.</p>
          <p>And looking at those we feel really comfortable about making progress pretty much in line with our short, medium terms objectives, so, of growing slightly above the industry in the Mexican market. And of course, just keeping in mind that a lot of the OXXO growth is not necessarily connected in a direct way with market share gain, because a number of stores are pretty much open in places in which we have dominant positions.</p>
          <p>Once we put all considerations together, we feel pretty comfortable that we're making progress in gaining our short- and medium-term strategy of outgrowing the industry. And Juan, if you can help me out with the Brazil question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Javier. Alan, hi. In terms of the price projected in reais, we have 101 for both years, 101 reais per hectoliter. So, we &#x2013; that's why we refer to it as stable, basically, the exact changed price second quarter '07 versus second quarter of '08. So, what we can do is, maybe offline, go over with you in terms of the exchange rate and whatever glitch is there maybe either our model or yours, but definitely, the price in local currency is at the same levels as last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll go to our next question from Carlos Laboy with Credit Suisse.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Javier, how is your strategic thinking &#x2013; or how are your strategic imperatives different today from what they were maybe a quarter ago, given all the changes we've seen in the global beer landscape, specifically on a number of areas, on four or five areas? One is on share buyback. You can give us an update on what the Board's thinking is on share buybacks. Two, on your Brazilian beer exposure; you've managed that business for profitability rather than for major market share mostly? Do you see a need to reset your objectives of market share footprint in Brazil? Three, M&amp;A, maybe of coke bottlers. And four, of accelerated integration of beer and soft drinks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Hi, Carlos. On the share buyback, I would say we are basically where we were last time with his colleagues. We still think that's the best way to create value for shareholders for the long term. At this point and juncture of time, share buyback is not something that we're thinking to do.</p>
          <p>We would like to remain with flexibility within the balance sheet and managing the business still on growing as much as we can organically and connecting that with M&amp;A question again, we think that we have a number of opportunities that again, we would like to keep fostering relationships and trying things.</p>
          <p>And I think in the last year, the Remil, Jugos del Valle pieces, if you put together, it really basically presents a very good opportunity for FEMSA to allocate a little bit in excess of $500 million in very good investments we think for the future. So share buyback is not an option as we speak, but it's always a thing that we keep looking at, and that we will be willing to do if we think that the Comercio convenient use of resources for shareholders for the long term.</p>
          <p>In terms of the Brazilian beer exposure, I think maybe we have not be conveying these message in the right way, but I wouldn't convey the message saying that we are managing Brazil in terms of looking at a short-term profitability threshold to be achieved, I think with the management discussions every time centered around what is good for the business and at what pace it is reasonable for us to continue taking cost out of the system, managing our business agenda in terms of developing the right portfolio and working in a very collaborative environment with our bottler network distribution partners of Coca-Cola in that market.</p>
          <p>And if we had in the past conveyed the massage that we were looking for, let's say EBITDA breakeven last year and this year, let me tell you as a matter of fact because of the slow start of the year and because of the price commodity pressures that were softer in that market in 2008 and because our very strong commitment for basically, as I said being the second viable player consistently for the future in the Brazilian market. This year we may be off that target, which in the end was the result of the strategies that we thought were good for the beer business in Brazil for 2008.</p>
          <p>So, if market conditions for the first quarter and commodity pressures arise in the first quarter also for the Brazilian business, we're not saying, well, we had a financial metric to be pursued in 2008 and we're going to do crazy things there in Brazil for 2008. So we're taking advantages for as much as opportunities that we see in the Brazilian market, and I think that if you look at our performance basically growing 15 and 13%, last couple of years, and now this quarter again being up at there at the 13% level, we are as aggressive as we can be in terms of managing the development of our business in Brazil, but at the same time we are not &#x2013; I would say not doing what we think is reasonable in terms of spending behind the brands.</p>
          <p>We could spend maybe double what we're spending in the brands, but I don't think the result would be twice as good as we are looking today. So we are, given the brands what we think is good for them in the proper timeframe and that's the way we are basically managing our beer business in Brazil.</p>
          <p>And in terms of accelerated integration, we have also conveyed the message in the past and I don't think this has changed a lot in the last three months as you started your question with. We are doing a lot of efforts when we talk about integrated models in Mexico, we have learned that we have a number of opportunities on different levels of integration and the two businesses, Coca-Cola FEMSA and FEMSA Cerveza continue to grow to work very, very closely in a number of efforts and not only between the beverage businesses and also we are very, very successful also in bringing up some much more closer to both beverage businesses too.</p>
          <p>On one side work on a more-and-more efficient basis on both order taking and delivery products from Coca-Cola and in Cerveza too also, but also at the same time, we're and we share this in the past, we've taken advantage of consumer knowledge we are gaining in OXXO to precisely fine-tune our commercial propositions to consumers in OXXO on our most important product lines, which are soft drinks and beer.</p>
          <p>So, I would say that with my commentary, I hope I covered the four basic dimensions of your question, Carlos. And I will be happy to expand later on these, with you also.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple of quick follow-ups in beer, I am not sure I fully understood your opening comments about the Chiapas direct distributor. Were you implying that some of the revenue and cost for the full six months were in the second quarter numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're exactly right, Lore. We use to be minority shareholders on the Chiapas with a very influencing family in the Chiapas State together with another partner. And we acquired the majority of the shares of that operation, which on a normal basis, Chiapas would represent something like 2.5% of the total volume of our business.</p>
          <p>And we consolidated into the second quarter of the year, the full six months, because of some mechanics of the transaction. So, even though it's only 2.5% of the volume, we, in the quarter, basically included the effect of the six months, so on the quarter that 2.5 would be more like in the 4.5 to 5% because of the seasonality. But going forward, my comment was the effect going forward would be more in line with the 2.5 numbers that I just mentioned.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">

          <p>Thank you. And our next question comes from Jos&#xE9; Yord&#xE1;n with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My two main questions were answered, but maybe a follow-up as well on Brazil. And clearly your market share over the past year in Brazil, according to Nielsen has gone down, but it has clearly come up and I was just interested in your &#x2013; maybe in your internal studies as to what's your market share has done over that time and who have you sourced the market share gains from? Is it all AmBev or is it the other two guys as well? Any color you could give us here would be helpful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure, Jos&#xE9; Yord&#xE1;n. Yes, I just mentioned Nielsen show I mean numbers, which makes us hard to believe that could be right because of the growth rates we have been, I mean experiencing and sharing with you guys. So, we think it has a lot to do with the way these guys take down samples, yes, both in terms of geographies and channels and that would be my comment, I mean relating to the Nielsen numbers.</p>
          <p>In terms of where do we think we are making most of the progress, I would say that instead of looking it at a competitor base, we think that we are doing good progress basically in Northeastern, Northwestern, and Central Brazil. We think that if you look at the growth rates, which are published by the only player that really publishes reports, we maybe taking some share, I would say small percentage or &#x2013; I mean tenths of percentage points from the leader in the market, and we still think that the bulk of it is coming from the second and fourth player in the Brazilian market, that is Schincariol and Petr&#xF3;polis.</p>
          <p>And we think that this is being done in the right way, which is managing pricing in a better reasonable way, but expanding distribution for our brands, working together with the Coca-Cola bottlers in terms of doing these work and also at the same time, restructuring the portfolio, and as I just mentioned, a bulk of the volume is coming from the Sol brand, which is good in terms of the structure of the portfolio, we are trying to built in Brazil. So that would be my &#x2013; my answer of that.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We'll next take a question from Alex Robarts with Santander.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everybody. Thanks. Just a still on beer, thinking about your guidance and I guess, it's &#x2013; currently for the year in '08, it's flat EBIT margin. And looking at 2Q and as you said earlier in the call with the growth expectations decreasing here in the second half in Mexico, how confident are you about achieving this guidance. I mean I assume that you're sticking with the guidance, a flat EBIT margin growth or flat EBIT margins this year? And I mean how do we think about this price increase vis-&#xE0;-vis the guidance? I wanted to clarify or ask clarification as well regarding Chiapas, I mean could you give us a sense of what was organic Mexican beer volume growth without that effect in the quarter, if that's possible? And then the final thing is just, our research suggests that last week you've made a solicitation, I guess, to register some of your Brazilian beer brands in Peru, I guess Kaiser and Bavaria, Summer Draft, is that correct? And what's attracting you to Peru, is this the next board concept, or is it a local? Did you plan to actually brew the brands in the country? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Alex, hi. The first part of the question, I would say that we are still confident that we can manage in the second half of the year the business in such a way that we will be able, at the end, to maintain margin as opposed to 2007. Of course, the degree of uncertainty, I would say it's a little bit higher because again, the question remains of how strong consumer demand is going to remain on an environment in which economic growth is coming down. But at the same time, we feel confident that again with the right level of leverage on pricing for the next couple of months, together with adequate measures in terms of promotional activity in order to support that price increase we'll get as there. Of course, the comments that I just made in terms of the pricing opportunities and how, I would say, confident we feel that we will be able to implement some of those in order to pass along to consumers, some of the commodity pressure on the cost basis we're suffering. I think that we feel comfortable because of the main reason we've been sharing in previous conference calls, which is we still feel that our brand equity numbers are moving in the right direction. So, whatever is feasible to do in the marketplace in terms of pricing power for consumers, not hurting a lot of their purchasing power, we don't feel we're going to be left behind. We may be a little bit ahead or at least of their &#x2013; at the same pace that our competitor is moving prices, maybe in a very different way in terms of geographies and packages and channels, but all in all we don't think we will need to really move pricing in a substantial different way than the competitors, that our local competitors in Mexico are doing. As a matter of fact, we feel as in the past both in '07 and now in '08 that we are basically leading the industry in terms of signaling the way of queries price ahead in terms of &#x2013; ahead of price movements. And the second part of the question, I don't think Peru is the attraction in terms of having some markets in looking for some opportunities. I wouldn't really signal to those as very important ones. I will tell you that the same we do you should very much focus on what we're doing in our three core main markets, Brazil, <mark type="inaudible" /> Mexico. So, that I will say to much more practical thing than anything else, Alex?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Alex, this is Juan. I'd just like to touch on another part of your question in terms of the CapEx expect, there are implications for price because when you &#x2013; when we consolidate this, we get the margin. So, the price per hectoliter is impacted and there are implications on the selling expenses because also we now have to assume those as our own, but there are no implications for volume, in other words the 2.9% number that you saw includes Chiapas, that includes all of the territories, whether they are under our direct distribution or through third parties. So, I guess, yeah, this has no implication for volume, all of the growth is organic in Mexico. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Celso Sanchez with Citigroup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a question on the Brazilian beer situation. We've heard a lot of noise in the market the last several weeks about the potential for tax increases and formulations probably seems to be pretty unclear. I don't know if you have any update on that at all. On understanding I think we have is that January 1 is when it will be implemented, but in terms of how it might impact your portfolio? And then the second thing is <mark type="inaudible" /> are you seeing any impact so far in July or a &#x2013; as a result of the changes in these drinking and driving laws?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Celso, so on the first one there's nothing really new. I would say that, of course, the industry is presenting its case to the authorities, and again the wide range of latitude that the authorities have to decide on the next month, how to implement the  <mark type="inaudible" /> of factors. I don't think we would be expecting something, I mean, quite radical. I think we have a good &#x2013; I mean a number of arguments and rationale so wide that wouldn't be good for the industry and the country as a whole. So, even though we would assume that there may be some effects on both our businesses beer and soft drinks, we are at least confident so far that we will be able to present our case in order for the effect not be as radical as &#x2013; I mean as some people may think. But there's nothing new, just the fact that we're very close trying to present our case to, basically, the authorities down there in Brazil. The second part of the question, so far it's very, very, I mean, hard to &#x2013; from the overall numbers and looking at the channel performance, look at a clear trend. We think that in the next six months we may feel &#x2013; we may have a much more precise impression if this is having some effect and of what magnitude. But so far it is very hard to say still.</p>

          <p>And we'll return to Ms. Lore Serra with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Just quickly on the outlook &#x2013; well, two questions same theme. When we look at the beer results in the second quarter, should we have the view that most of the raw materials pressures that you've spoken about, are they fully reflected in the 2Q or will they get more intense as you get to the second half? And then if you could just tell us looking at 2009, any preliminary thoughts on the raw material outlook in your various businesses for '09 versus '08? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I would say that most of the price pressures on commodities for '08 are already reflected in the growth rate of the beer business at least in Mexico, a little bit differently in Brazil. There may be some additional pressures on the fourth quarter basically in Mexico, because of the way we buy barley. But that wouldn't say something, which should be substantially different than the effects that we've had until the second quarter. Into '09 we still are looking at big pressure on grains, which on our case is a little bit hard to hedge against. Nevertheless, we will find some way &#x2013; indirect ways in order to hedge using maybe some other grain prices in order to be able to do something there. We still see some pressures on aluminum going forward, maybe not as huge, the ones we saw first until '06, '07, not this year, but in the last couple of years. And we have hedged, I would say, maybe a little bit in excess of 50% of our needs into '09 of aluminum needs. And Juan, I don't know if you want to help me with the rest of the questions in terms of soft drinks or if H&#xE9;ctor is around, also he can share some of his comments on Coca-Cola?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean would leave H&#xE9;ctor just to elaborate a little bit on the sweeteners side in terms of Coke FEMSA, because that has been the big story. The fact that we have gotten kind of a break on the sweeteners side, H&#xE9;ctor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. What we were commenting last week on this front is that, our expectation is that sweeteners related to corn, basically high-fructose corn syrup, we expect some pressure on that. And at the same time, we're expecting some reductions in the prices of sugar &#x2013; cane sugar. And we expect to see the &#x2013; what we mentioned is that it's really hard to set a target for that because of the volatility that working on the oil prices. Given the last two weeks on the oil prices, we may expect some reductions on that front, but the general sense is that we will still have some pressure on BD for the second half of the year.</p>
