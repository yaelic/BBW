          <p>Good afternoon. This is Mariana Rodr&#xED;guez, Investor Relations Director for Walmart de M&#xE9;xico y Centroam&#xE9;rica. Welcome to our earnings call to review the fourth quarter of the year 2012 and also the full year numbers. Here with me is Rafael Matute, Chief Financial Officer for Walmart de M&#xE9;xico y Centroam&#xE9;rica.</p>
          <p>I want to remind everyone that we will be hosting our 9th Annual Analyst Meeting tomorrow, Thursday, February 21.</p>
          <p>Rafael will start by looking at Mexico results.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mariana. Total income for the fourth quarter was up 6.4%, and comparable store sales grew 2.1%. Gross margin was 23.7% this year versus 23.2% last year, up 49 basis points mainly due to our good planning for the season.</p>
          <p>Expenses in Mexico grew 8.6%, in line with the average installed capacity growth for the quarter. The majority of the stores were opened during the last days of December, impacting expenses more than sales in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Operating income and EBITDA grew faster than total income for the quarter, as the increase in gross margin offset the growth of expenses. Operating margin was 10.5% versus 10.2% of last year, and EBITDA margin was 12.2% versus 11.9% of last year, an improvement of 29 basis points.</p>
          <p>The bank continues to show progress. Supplier and consumer loans were 1.4 and 1.6 times what they were a year ago. We reached 451,000 credit cards, 1.4 times what we had last year. Deposits amounted to MXN4.3 billion, 1.5 times the amount we had at the end of the quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Now let's move from Mexico to our operation in Central America. Central America total income was 5.3%, with a 1.1% increase in comparable stores, both figures on a constant currency basis. In peso terms, total income amounted to MXN15.1 billion, a 0.5% decrease over the last year's fourth quarter, as the Mexican peso appreciated against all currencies in Central America.</p>
          <p>Gross margin increased 68 basis points from last year, reverting the negative trend for the first three quarters of the year.</p>
          <p>Expenses grew faster than sales and were up 6.1%. Operating income, and EBITDA from Central America increased at a stronger rate than total income &#x2013; 8.1% and 6.8% respectively, both figures on a constant currency basis.</p>
          <p>Now we will see the consolidated results for the fourth quarter. Consolidated total income grew 5.5%. Gross margin went from 23% to 23.5%, an increase of 53 basis points. Operating expenses increased 23 basis points as a percentage of total income. EBITDA for the quarter grew 8.3%, faster than sales. EBITDA amounted to MXN14 billion, MXN1 billion more than last year.</p>
          <p>We tested the goodwill for the purchase of Central America for impairment. This was done by independent third-party. As a result of the study, the company recognized an impairment loss of MXN5 billion. This amount represents 13% of the purchase price of Central America. The company reassessed the contingent liability recognized as part of the acquisition and canceled MXN4.9 billion. This figure represents 78% of the contingent liability.</p>
          <p>Total impact on income before taxes was MXN122 million.</p>
          <p>Now a brief update on our full year results. I will start with the results for the year 2012 for Mexico. Results for 2012 in Mexico, including retail stores and banking, can be summarized as follows. Total income was 10% to MXN361 billion, MXN33 billion more than last year. Comparable store sales were up 3.8%. Gross margin was 22.9% versus 22.6% last year, thus growing gross profit by 11.5%. Expenses increased 11.2% and represented 14.3% of total income. Operating income and EBITDA grew at a faster rate than sales &#x2013; 12.3% and 12.1% respectively. EBITDA for the year amounted to MXN$38 billion and represented 10.6% of total income.</p>
          <p>Breaking down the numbers between retail and banking operation, we can see that for the retail operation total income amounted to MXN360.8 billion, an increase of 9.8% versus prior year where EBITDA amounted to MXN38.9 billion, represented 10.8% of total income, and increased 11% compared to 2011.</p>
          <p>Though the bank had a MXN537-million negative impact on consolidated EBITDA, this amount is lower than the negative MXN843 million of last year's impact. Retail + Bank total income increased 10%, and EBITDA increased 12.1%.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at Central America. Central America reported total income of MXN56.3 billion, a 12.9% increase over the last year. This includes currency impact. On a constant currency basis, total income was up 7.7%, while same store sales grew 1.7%. Gross margin for the year 2012 was 20.7% versus 21.5% the prior year. This reduction is mainly impacted by markdowns in second and third quarters to clean inventory. Expenses increased 7.3% compared to the 7.7% increase in total income. Operating income and EBITDA were down 18.9% and 10.3% respectively on a constant currency basis.</p>
          <p>Although we are certainly not satisfied with the 2012 Central America results, we were able to revert the negative trend in margins in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at the consolidated numbers. Consolidated total income reached MXN418.1 billion, MXN39.3 billion more than last year and a 10.3% increase. As a percentage of total income, Walmex gross profit increased 16 basis points. Expenses increased 14 basis points also as a percentage of total income. EBITDA for the year amounted to MXN41.2 billion, MXN4.0 billion more than last year, and an increase of 10.7% compared to 2011.</p>
          <p>As we grow and reinvest in the business, our balance sheet becomes stronger. We continued to deliver strong free cash flow, closing the year with MXN28.2 billion in cash, MXN3.0 billion more than last year. Our strong balance sheet allows us to spend capital and return income to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.</p>
          <p>Our total CapEx spent in Mexico and Central America in the year was MXN14.7 billion. We paid a dividend of MXN9.6 billion, and in addition the company repurchased 27 million of our shares for an amount of MXN1.1 billion. Inventory declined 0.6%, which favorably compares to the 8% increase in installed capacity.</p>
          <p>Now I will leave you with Mariana.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Rafael. Last year we added 4.7 million square feet of selling space to our operations. We opened 263 stores in Mexico of all our different formats and 22 in Central America. We increased our installed capacity in Mexico by 8% and by 4.8% in Central America, for a total of 7.7%.</p>
          <p>Talent development is a priority towards building a high-performance organization that supports our growth. Last year we closed the year with more than 248,000 associates. We are a leading company where people can grow, and we have programs for talent development and gender equality that allow us to meet our goal of having the necessary talent to operate today and in the future. Last year 26,610 associates were promoted. 30% of management positions are filled by women.</p>
          <p>We are a company committed to improving the quality of life of less privileged families. Last year we channeled MXN624 million to the communities of the region. Through the Walmart de M&#xE9;xico Foundation, we have contributed to the development of communities living in situations of poverty and vulnerability. More than 137,000 associates participated in volunteer activities.</p>
          <p>Our company focuses on achieving operating standards that respect the environment, and we have achieved a leadership role in sustainability. Some examples from last year: we invested MXN980 million in sustainability projects. We achieved 22.4% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in Mexico and 16% for Central America. We installed closed refrigeration equipment in 86 stores. In Mexico, we achieved 12.3% in water savings at comp units. We planted 9,493 trees.</p>
          <p>I am glad to let you know that our 2012 Financial and Social Responsibility report is now available at our Investor Relations website, www.walmex.mx.</p>
