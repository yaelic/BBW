        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bejay, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today to discuss our 2010 third quarter results.</p>
          <p>Before I start, I just would like to remind you that as usual the percentage of change discussed during this call are both organic and normalized in nature. Normalized figures refer to performance measures before special items, and special items are either income or expenses, which do not occur regularly as part of the normal activities of the company. As normalized figures are non-GAAP measures, we disclose our consolidated profit, EPS, EBIT, and EBITDA on a fully reported basis in our earnings release.</p>
          <p>I'll start the call by sharing a brief overview of the quarter and then Jo&#xE3;o will provide us an overview of our results in Brazil, HILA-Ex, Quinsa, and Canada. I'll close by providing more specifics regarding the third quarter financials.</p>
          <p>Turning to the results, during the third quarter, our consolidated EBITDA was close to R$2.65 billion, which represents a 12.3% organic increase when compared to the third quarter of 2009 while our margins contracted 10 basis points to 44.4%.</p>
          <p>Our Brazil EBITDA increased by 15.4% in the quarter, supported by a 12% volume growth and by a 6% revenue per hectoliter growth with EBITDA margin decreasing by 130 basis points to 47.5%, driven by higher cost of goods sold in the period as we had anticipated, mainly due to packaging costs and higher SG&amp;A due to incremental logistics costs.</p>
          <p>In HILA-Ex, we delivered a negative EBITDA of R$21.4 million in the quarter and registered an organic decline of R$43.3 million versus the same period last year, mainly due to the worst performance of the Venezuela operation and a tough comp related to one-time land disposal in the Dominican Republic during Q3 2009.</p>
          <p>Our Quinsa operations delivered 16.8% EBITDA growth during the quarter, thanks to a 22.9% EBITDA growth in the beer business with volumes up 5.1% while soft drinks' volumes were down 2.2% and EBITDA down 17.4% which were higher input costs, mainly sugar and also SG&amp;A.</p>
          <p>In Canada, domestic volumes decreased by 5.4% in the quarter due to both interest decline and market share loss while our EBITDA increased by 7.6% with margins increasing by 610 basis points.</p>
          <p>Normalized profits reached R$1.8 billion in the quarter, which was 47.5% higher than last year. Normalized earnings per share increased by 46.5% in the quarter. I'll comment further on profits at the end of this call.</p>
          <p>Now I will hand it over to Jo&#xE3;o as he starts to look a little deeper into the results of each of our operations. Jo&#xE3;o?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nelson, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Starting with industry trends, we saw better performance across most markets in which we operate, except for Canada and Venezuela, and the consolidated beer volumes delivered solid growth of 10% in the quarter, mainly driven once again by our Brazilian operations. Going deeper into Brazil, the cost of macroeconomic environment continues to support the good performance of the industry and our continuous focus on innovation and brand equity continue to deliver very good top line results.</p>
          <p>Specifically regarding Beer Brazil, the positive trends we saw in the first half of the year continued and regained 170 basis points of market share compared to last year period. As a result of the combination between market share gains and industry growth, Brazil Beer volumes grew 12.5% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>The market share gain was delivered in the right way since we were able to find a new and better ways of connecting with our consumers. We are very pleased with the performance of our innovation over the last three years both in liquids and packaging, which represents more than 10% of total beer market volume.</p>
          <p>As we are looking forward to the summer season, we expect our innovation like the recently launched Skol 360&#xB0; to continue to play a key role in supporting our growth. Our beer net revenues per hectoliter in Brazil increased by 6.2% this quarter as a result of price increase, in line with inflation and on top of that, we increased our direct distribution while excise tax remains flat versus 2009.</p>
          <p>Now talking about our cost of goods sold. Brazil Beer cost of goods sold per hectoliter was up by 8% in the quarter, as we were negatively affected by higher packaging costs, including the impact of imported cans as previously stated, which shall also be the case for the last quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>The SG&amp;A grew by 19.4% in the period as a result of volume growth, general inflation, incremental investments to support our innovation, and higher logistics cost as a result of increasing direct distribution and changing sales mix towards the North and Northeast of the country.</p>
          <p>Normalized Beer EBITDA finished the quarter with growth of 17.1% versus the same period last year and EBITDA margin declined by 100 basis points. Our CSD &amp; NANC volumes in Brazil delivered 10.4% growth in the quarter as a result of the improved macroeconomic and industry conditions, while we kept our market share almost flat, standing at 17.6 as an average for the quarter.</p>
          <p>In our soft drinks business, regarding brands, we were also able to improve most Guarana Antarctica  brand health key performance indicators, which will support our long-term growth in the cycle.</p>
          <p>Net revenues per hectoliter grew 3.9% organically in the quarter as we continue to be impacted by price increase slightly below inflation. Cost per hectoliter increased organically by 19.2 as a result of our sugar hedge, PET resin, and packaging mix.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A excluding depreciation and amortization increased by 9.5% in the period as a result of volume growth, general inflation and logistics costs. Our EBITDA post in the quarter a 7.5% growth with a margin contraction of 310 basis points. Year-to-date, turn positive &#x2013; EBITDA turned positive again at 1.8% versus last year.</p>
          <p>Turning now to HILA-Ex, volumes increased by 4.1 in the period as a result of a better industry trend in most of the countries we operate except for Venezuela and Ecuador, while in Dominican Republic, we reached our all-time high market share.</p>
          <p>HILA-Ex EBITDA was negative 21 million, posting negative growth, mainly driven by our performance in Venezuela, where we just closed a deal we announced last quarter. We are very glad in this important step to improve our performance through this business combination with Regional <mark type="audio gap" /> commitment with the region. We closed the operation of October 20th and are ready to start.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Quinsa, and our operation in the south of Latin America, we achieved a 16.8 EBITDA growth based on better volumes &#x2013; better beer volumes and strong revenue management. We are enjoying industry growth in most of our beer operations and higher market share throughout the region. However, Argentina remains our main challenge in terms of market recovery, mainly in soft drinks.</p>
          <p>We continuing heavily supporting our mainstream brands in all of the countries. We developed strong campaigns and innovations aimed at increasing communication, renewing visually identities and gaining presence in all of our markets. Among our innovations, we launched a new <mark type="inaudible" /> Quilmes label, more modern and attractive, and Quilmes Vamos Cero, a new variety on the Quilmes family with a refreshing and easy-to-drink concept. We're also introducing varieties to the Patagonia brand such as Bohemian Pilsner and Weiss, a wheat variety. In our other beer operations, we've developed winter campaigns and increased our airtime with great content to communicate our brand attributes. The premium segment continues gaining presence within the region. We still have to out-perform its direct competitor in leading the segment in Argentina.</p>
          <p>In soft drinks, we have been very active in the market and in the media, with a main event that recently took place: the Pepsi Music Festival. We focused on market execution with actions aim at optimize our sales price to price &#x2013; to precise straight spend management, helped by premium beer sales increase in most countries.</p>
          <p>In terms of cost and expenses, we are experiencing higher costs of labor and inflation. We are also suffering important increase in soft drinks raw material, mainly in juices and sugar as well  <mark type="inaudible" />. We are introducing initiatives to achieve savings and industry efficiency to offset these higher costs. This quarter, our soft drinks operations still show the strong EBITDA contraction, but we are able to see important improvements from the preceding quarter. We are also confident that we will be enjoying better results soon as the industry begins to recover, and revenue management initiatives are already placed to recover margins.</p>
          <p>Overall, we're confident we can continue delivering excellent results as we focus on maximizing our top line, with solid support to our brands while we are achieving efficiency and further cost savings.</p>
          <p>Turning to Canada, Labatt resumed EBITDA growth in third quarter 2010, as lower volumes were compensated by significantly lower cost base, leading to an EBITDA increase of 7.6%. Volumes were down 5.4 versus third quarter 2009, which is a similar decline to that reported in the second quarter. The decline remains due to domestic sales, however, it is characterized by a miniscule decline of 2.4 in the lower level of share loss at 110 basis points. In fact, Labatt's improved 30 basis points versus the average second quarter 2010 level.</p>
          <p>In regard to domestic net revenues for hectoliter, Labatt's experienced a decline of 1.7. This result was driven by three main factors. The first accounting for roughly half of the decline was the harmonization of sales tax in Ontario, and tough comp due to Bud Light Lime buildup. The final factor was the refresh promotional grid we announced in our last conference call in order to stabilize our profitability share equation, that is, to balance market share performance and net revenues per hectoliter.</p>
          <p>COGS per hectoliter declined by 11% in the third quarter as significantly lower commodity hedges and continued efficiency improvements combined to drive costs down versus last year. Also we began to see positive benefit of closing the Hamilton brewery in April of this year. SG&amp;A declined by 12.4% in the quarter due to lower volumes, market expense phasing in the lower variable compensation accrued versus last year.</p>
          <p>Moving to final quarter of 2010, our focus remaining entirely on our core business. I'm encouraged by our ability to deliver positive financial results through continued cost management while we're working to achieve a sustainable balance between profitability and market share.</p>
          <p>Going back to the overall Ambev business, I want to wrap up by saying we're satisfied with our results in general. In Brazil, we've improved our margins compared to the first half of the year, mainly due to lower costs and kept the strong top-line growth, as well in Quinsa, where we delivered double digit EBITDA growth as a result of better industry and market share gains.</p>
          <p>And in Canada, where despite the difficult industry environment, we were able to return to positive EBITDA growth and we are putting in place the necessary action plans to address our main challenges and opportunities. Particularly in Brazil, we should continue benefiting from a positive momentum in terms of industry while moving steadily with our CapEx expansion projects.</p>
          <p>In Latin America South and Canada, we expect to continue to focus on improving our results. We remain committed to our cost-connect-win approach, and we will continue investing behind our brands and focus on innovation to deliver sustainable and profitable results.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to say I'm confident, we will continue our drive to deliver our goals, thanks to our great people who are the major assets of our company. Now, I'd like to go back to Nelson.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jo&#xE3;o. In this final section, I would like to guide us through the main items between the normalized EBIT of R$2.3 billion and profit of R$1.8 billion disclosed on page three of our release. Our net financial results, which is positive R$48.4 million which R$291 million better than last year. This explains by lower net interest expense as a result of a lower debt and higher cash and equivalents, gains on derivative instruments related to the results of our ongoing hedging policy, as well as gains related to currency effects over trade payables, mainly Venezuela.</p>
          <p>Our effective tax rate in the period improved to 22% compared to 32.7 last year. The main reason for this decrease were lower withholding tax on dividends received from subsidiaries abroad and higher non-taxable gains, mainly government grants as well as lower non-deductible expenses.</p>
          <p>Cash generated from operations in the year totaled R$7.5 billion, which is 11.5% higher than same period of 2009. Our net debt decreased to negative 1 billion at the end of September, compared to positive 3.2 billion at the end of December 2009. However we have takes R$2 billion of dividends and interest owned capital on October 14th, leading out pay outs gross of R$3 billion year to date, and have announced it, additional R$2 billion to be paid in December,&lt; taking the full &#x2013; total 2010 amount goes to R$5 billion.</p>
          <p>I will now turn back to the operator and open up for questions. Please, Bejay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Lore Serra from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, or good afternoon. And congratulations on the results, I wanted to ask a question about the cash flow. You mentioned that the cash flow generation has been very strong. And I think if we look after CapEx, it's been something like R$5 billion so far this year. And you're going to dividend out a total of R$5 billion, I guess if you do the R$2 billion. The implication of that is that you're going to deleverage a lot this year because I presume you would generate cash in the fourth quarter. So can you talk about where you expect the balance sheet to end the year and whether or not there's a possibility of increasing those distributions beyond the R$5 billion that you've earmarked so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Hi, Lore. This is Nelson here. Well, regarding your question, what we have been experiencing in terms of the use of cash is well, first of all a stronger cash flow generation, as you said. Even after all the investments we did, we are trailing to an increase versus last year, a significant increase. And that's why we are also making an important increase versus last year, payout lab, all right? With the 5 billion which we announced it, should be in the soon to go, we will have between dividends and from capital, right? You &#x2013; we will have a 40% decrease versus last year.</p>
          <p>And again, the ongoing process here remains the same, in the sense that, once this cash is generated, of course we first looking to our investment possibility, be it investing even further behind our operation and assets in Brazil, to cope with this growing demand, eventually looking to a transaction, for instance, in the country that we are in, in Central America. So all of that has not changed, our focus to invest in the business, but of course, even after all that, there is still this, let's say, which we call unnecessary cash, the natural way is to pay it out.</p>
          <p>We always decide on the allocation of these payouts on a regular basis with the board, and our goal, as we said before, is definitely &#x2013; I mean, I'm not pursuing a net cash position like the one we saw in September, which was more a one-time type of situation, given the constraints we had during the second and third quarters in connection with the capital increase process that took a little bit longer than we expected.</p>
          <p>So after that, we were able to resume. That's why we have this 4 billion announcement again, 2 billion to be still paid, and you continue to assess the investment opportunity, but in fact, we have so  strong cash flow preservation, we should see this growth in payout ratio again, this year, at this moment for this year, 40% above what we had last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, I understand that, but you ended last year with about R$3 billion of debt, and if I just take the R$1 billion of cash and I net the 4 billion, you're already at that level, and then you'll generate cash. So it sounds like you will in fact be leveraged this year. I mean, could you give us a sense of where you expect the net debt to end the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the end of year, it depends a lot on what they're going to have in Q4, right? I mean, it's a very important quarter for us. It's a quarter where we normally, you will see tough comps, and you see also improved movements in the market. And that can bring some uncertainly. I wish I could give you more specific guidance on that, but we're not I mean making any forecasts at this stage for these numbers in December. Which again, it will be a picture like September was, and our goal is to manage on a constant basis, and not on a quarter-by-quarter basis.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thank you. Good day, everybody. Congratulations on the results, guys. I had a question with respect to some of these non-recurring adverse impacts, specifically with respect to the impact of having to import all the cans, particularly given how well the Northeast is doing, the logistics as well and I know you've repositioned or re-launched Brahma Red. So it seems to me that that's also adding to perhaps this shift in your mix for cans. How much of that, this impact or the deterioration in gross margin year-on-year, is attributable to the can impact? And when we look at the higher SG&amp;A, how much of that is non-recurring in nature? And when you go into the fourth quarter, what do you expect it to be? And then as you transition into some of the new capacity, how much of an improvement can we or where do you think things will normalize out to as we go into 2011, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Bob, it's Jo&#xE3;o here. Okay, first starting in &#x2013; with 2010, of course a lot of it is still going on, right? We still have a very important quarter to go. The fourth quarter is our most important quarter.</p>
          <p>I would say that, as we started the year, we had an impression that VIC, our variable cost, would grow in line with inflation, and it's not, right. And most of the reason why it's not is related to that. Okay, so one way to think about the variable cost is that you would probably be growing in line with inflation, if it was not for let's say importing the cans and a little bit of the logistics piece that goes into the variable cost as well. Depending on how strong the fourth quarter is in terms of volume, more of it will come into place.</p>
          <p>It's a little bit more difficult to predict 2011. Of course we should need much less imported cans, because all the suppliers have already announced new can lines that will come in place in the end of the first quarter, beginning of the second quarter. So if there were any imported cans they would &#x2013; they could be mainly in the first quarter, if needed, right. We don't know yet whether it's going to be needed or not. But it would be a much lower number. "Regardless" of the volume next year because a lot of capacity is coming as I said in the second quarter next year.</p>
          <p>In terms of the logistics cost that is even more depended, much more dependent on the volume growth of 2011 and the imported cans because the imported can suppliers, local suppliers are coming into production capacity. Logistics costs will be a combination of all the new plans that we have just starting now, starting the last few months and starting this month, that will be up and running next year.</p>
          <p>This will of course offset a good portion of our logistics costs for next year. If it's going to be the total amount or a partial amount, it will depend how much we grow specifically in those areas, the more distant areas of next year.</p>
          <p>So not giving a lot of numbers here, but of course it's going to be a better year, but difficult to give you a lot of idea how much exactly. I think the best one is really the VIC growth, the variable cost growth this year, with or without the impact of this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That helps, Jo&#xE3;o. Out of curiosity, could you tell us how much of your volume today is in cans versus where it was this time last year? And then how much volume are you shipping up into the Northeast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't open that much detail, but of course the Northeast is where we have gained most share this year, and the North is how much we grow the most. What we have been saying, what we have been opening, let's say, is that we grew around 25% overall, not necessarily in cans, our overall growth. And to be quite honest, the growth was pretty good across the board, across packages, and not just cans, okay. It was strong volumes in the 600 ml, in the one-liter, in cans. As we have I think what's important to remember is the North, the Northeast and the Midwest were the three areas that we enter with innovation in the latter part of last year or the beginning of this year. Okay, so that's why it took it a little bit more time to grow at the same comparable ratio as the rest of the country.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Torres from HSBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everyone. Actually if I could first just clarify your response to the previous question. So with respect to your comments on initiatives for margin improvement, should we still assume though for the most part thinking about ingredient costs, packaging costs, logistics costs for the fourth quarter, we should see similar pressure, but as a result of comps and initiatives, we should see gradual sequential improvements as we course through the year? Is that a correct way of thinking about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Lauren. This is Nelson here. I think the right way to think about it is with regards to the impact of imported cans in our COGS, the last quarter will be the toughest of this year. It's where we're going to have the highest impact in terms of the imported cans. So that's going to be even worst than what we saw for instance in Q3.</p>
          <p>Of course, there are some elements that will bring on the other hand, positive impact in our COGS on the last quarters. One of them is the effect our currency hedges is going to be slightly better than what they were in Q3. So in Q3, they're pretty much neutral versus previous year. In Q4, they're going to be slightly positive.</p>
          <p>So by the way, both much better than what you saw in the first semester of this year when we had the worst currency hedge. But again, in terms of COGS, there will be an important impact still in Q4 because of the imported cans and maybe some of it will also be there in Q1 2011.</p>
          <p>On the SG&amp;A part where we have the incremental logistic costs, as you all mentioned, we already have the CapEx or the investment of 2010 up and running in the fourth quarter. So that will bring us some extra CapEx in the North and Northeast regions because we &#x2013; in a way we are investing is proportionally there.</p>
          <p>So there will be a logistics costs just above the average, the historical average, but they're going to be at the lower level for instance what we saw in Q3, so two different directions in terms of COGS extra pressure because of the imported cans in terms of SG&amp;A. It's still an impact, an important impact of logistics costs, but it's going to be lower than what we saw so far because of the investments that we made in that already, I mean, the new line there already lies.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So sorry. And on the sugar side, you know our hedging policy, right, I mean, we normally have commodity, and sugar's one of them, and on a rolling 12 months base. So it's going to be pretty much at the level where it is. So the point is, different from other commodities &#x2013; I mean, after a big, big peak, they went down, and some of them are rebounding back now. Sugar is at a higher level already for some time. So it's going to be still a third quarter for us, but X, no number, a specific number, and the price of sugar will remain there in Q4 as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. If I could ask just one other question, too, generally speaking as we think about next year, you said you're seeing improvements in a number of your markets, but ,excluding Venezuela and Canada, I think a lot of that pressure is more market-driven or industry-driven. Curious as we think about next year initiatives you have in place like I guess thinking if these market conditions remain challenging, how do you kind of manage that and your general outlook at this point as we think about those markets for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Lauren. Well, I mean, to be quite honest, I mean, we've been facing tough &#x2013; we face &#x2013; in most markets, we face very tough markets in 2009, and a lot of them improved during 2010. So if they're to maintain the same as they did this year, will be a lot of the &#x2013; I mean the things we are going to do, there will be a lot of things we did this year. I mean tighten where necessary in terms of expenses, right, put some money back if necessary again, but I think we are very knowledgeable about the markets and very knowledgeable about running the business in these ups and downs.</p>
          <p>So if things continue to be tough in some markets, we have to continue to use the same tools we have. I think what we have added lately to the tool kit, which I think will help us in any market, including a tough market, is to rely more in innovations than a few more to our consumers as well, whether it's an upturn or the downturn.</p>
          <p>I think if there is an upturn, I mean most of our premium brands, I mean most of those markets we have very good market share positions, we will benefit. But if it's a tougher market, I mean the mainstream brands where we also have a very good positioning, also have an appeal with new price points, given the different package that we have launched in different markets.</p>
          <p>So I think we're in a good situation in case that happens. But having said that, it is of course too early to talk about 2011 and whether the economic momentum or the macroeconomic scenario will be slightly different or very different from what it is today.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jo&#xE3;o and Nelson, and congratulations for the results. The clarification on the outlook for COGS and the D&amp;A was very useful.</p>
          <p>Thanks. So my question has to do more with Canada. I mean, you're seeing there an underperformance, both in the quarter and year-to-date, in terms of market share. That doesn't seem to be explained by a substantial difference in pricing. Actually, it seems that you're underperforming there both in terms of volume and pricings versus your main competitor year-to-date. So I was wondering, what are the kinds of actions that you're taking in Canada? And what should we expect going forward, specifically for next year, in that territory, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Alan. This is Jo&#xE3;o. You are right. I mean, we are not particularly happy with this quarter or the year-to-date in the Canadian results. I think what explains it &#x2013; I mean, the main difference, given that price and volume don't fully explain, I mean really the full combination is, in terms of their innovation, they came with innovation, they are not lagging against themselves last year.</p>
          <p>So they launched two, let's say, new line extensions, the Miller 2 and the Mosul M and they basically have close to one point of share this year, while they had basically nothing last year. And in our case, our innovation is specifically Bud Light Lime. It's pretty much the same share this year against the share last year. So we're totally, the comps are much tougher in this particular case.</p>
          <p>So going forward, what are the things that we started doing last quarter that I think are starting to show some improvement and we hope will take us from here to a better position against our main competitor? I think first we can say that Bud &#x2013; Bud 4 that we recently launched last quarter showed very strong performance in the third quarter. So that's one part. Second Bud Light Lime continues to show strong results, I mean Bud Light, which is now a 5% market share &#x2013; 5% share of the Canadian market. So that continues to grow from last year to today. And Bud Light Lime left a significant market demand in the third quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>The combination of all this is that from last quarter to this quarter, we show the sequential market share growth of 30 bps. I think as we continue to invest behind those brands, we will continue to see a better performance in terms of share and volume. And together with that, we'll come better pricing. Remember also that we mentioned in the last quarter, and I said in the speech about the promotional grid as we were rebalancing the prices of last year. At the end, EBITDA grew 7.6%, margin did expand, and I think we should go into the fourth quarter with easier comps. So we should expect a positive fourth quarter. And we will continue to build from there.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Gustavo Oliveira from UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jo&#xE3;o, Nelson, and good afternoon, everyone. We have a question on your accounts payable in your working capital. We saw a substantial spike in your accounts payable, and I wonder whether that is related to some of your can imports that you're getting by the terms of your suppliers or if that is specifically to any other negotiation you're going through. So if you could provide more color on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Gustavo, I think in terms of accounts payable, you already touched on the fact that we have can imports that are more expensive on the ForEx gross, the outstanding balance. The other thing that we have been doing is to always I mean try to improve payment terms, so we had some improvement this area. But the other important element there is that there is an increase in our CapEx, right, and normally, we had payment terms on all the equipments that are higher than the average. So in that sense, there is a kind of a mix impact that we are buying a more representative amount of things that have a longer payment term.</p>
          <p>So the purchase profile in a sense is more skewed towards a longer payment term suppliers, and typically we're talking about equipment and all the machines for the CapEx. So a combination of better terms, that was marginal, the impact on canning costs, definite there, but more important, the purchase mix has also increased towards suppliers with longer term, so all that is helping our say working capital and minimizing the need to invest cash to finance our business.</p>
          <p>So in that sense today we have a negative working capital, which is great. I mean we can grow business and still generate cash through this growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a follow-up on the CapEx. The four quarters where you going to have the higher percentage of your R$2 plus billion investment in CapEx, is that already accounted for in the accounts payable? Or you're going to have &#x2013; you're going to continue to see an increase in accounts payable? And then the first quarter of 2011 is when you're going to see more pressures in your cash generation because you're going to have to pay on this CapEx. Just to get an idea of how the cash flow should behave over the next few quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I see your question. I think, we already have year-to-date something like 1.5 billion of the 2 billion we are going to be invest in these incrementals. So it's pretty much &#x2013; I mean if you think of nine months out of the 12, there will be given incremental, I mean, in relative terms, a higher concentration of CapEx in last quarter. But that will build, and that will even help our payables, and the cash impact of this increase is going to be seen more towards 2011, given the type of terms we do have with our equipment.</p>
          <p>I'm talking more about the equipment side. Like if this is get you a city works and all sort of services, that is always paid within the quarter. Just the last month, that's a regular payment term, I have around 30 days, and that is paid for the beginning next year. So about it &#x2013; too much &#x2013; all of it already accounted for in the outstanding payables amount, given that we already did 1.5 billion year to date, but there will be a certain upside in Q4.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. My question is about &#x2013; I mean I appreciate you talking about the can pressures remaining in the fourth quarter, et cetera, but I also I mean noticed that the market is still growing 10% basically on what's essentially the toughest comparison in third quarter '09. And I guess number one, I'd like to get an idea of when you think the market will start growing five or six versus the 10 or so of the last five quarters at least and then tying into once they've been in the ABI press release that basically said that the fourth quarter EBITDA growth, organic EBITDA growth would be materially higher than in the third quarter. How much of that comes from Ambev? I appreciate that part of that comes from the U.S. price increases they had, but some of it, almost mathematically has to come from Ambev, right? So if you could give us any color on those couple of items, that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jos&#xE9; this is Jo&#xE3;o. Hearing the call, I think Felipe answered the question saying he wished he could talk more about it. So there's not a lot we can talk about it. I mean, as you said, there is the math. I think what happens is I mean basically you have for both ABI and Ambev, I think we have a somewhat easier EBITDA comps, okay? Which is not really the case for volume comps, okay? So in terms of volume comps, actually the fourth quarter is our toughest comp. Third quarter was actually very good, I mean better than I think anyone could predict because I mean we grew the 12 on Beer Brazil, talking about on top of 12, so of course this was very strong. But I think the fourth quarter is a tougher comp for two reasons. One, because the quarter before it was also as strong as the third, but also you always have sort of a price increase during the fourth quarter, which he usually has any back on the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>And remember that in the fourth quarter last year we had a lot of innovations that were coming fresh into the marketplace, and some of them with a very strong volume impact. So I would say that the fourth quarter is a tougher for those two reasons. I think another thing that mattered for this year and will matter for next year in terms of what sort of volume growth anyone could expect is the tax increase, okay. I mean assuming there is a tax increase again it could be on the upper range or in the lower range. So I think a lot of what happens next year, assuming that is short term will be somewhat dependent on that. I mean of course a year that has a higher than average tax increase has an effect on volume. And we have to be ready for that and adjust our sizing, our structure to that. But of course, for whatever reason, a tax increase, I'm talking about <mark type="inaudible" /> doesn't happen, we also have to be ready to go after the volume if there is an opportunity.</p>
          <p>So, the moment to be forecasting volumes, of course with three very good quarters behind us, I think the quarters going forward are more difficult, one because our tax increase should come at a point in time. 2010 was an election year. It was very important to have the investments. A lot of money was pumped into the economy. I mean you should see some impact of all that in 2011. I think the good thing is that we start 2011 on a very good share position. We never had this share position. It gives us choices. I think very good choices. We can choose how to play and how much to adjust and how much to wait for reactions from our competitors. So assuming that a tax increase comes into place, I hope not but assuming it will come, we are in a better position to pass that price increase onto prices and see reactions of competitors.</p>
          <p>So making a long story short, difficult to project. I think the reference on ABI is much in terms of easier comps than anything else. And for Brazil in specific beer, tough comps, volumes, not as tough on the EBITDA level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And if I could follow up on your comment on the market share because it sounds like sequentially third quarter versus second, your market share went down half a point. Was there any specific issue you can point to there, any competitive response? Or will that turn out to be a one-time impact or I mean I can appreciate that when you raise prices you guys usually are the first to lose share. But if that comes in late December/January, why is it happening this early?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Jos&#xE9;, I'm looking here through my numbers but actually I think we gained because we reached our all-time high actually last month, so that accounts. So I don't have the exact figure as I'm talking here. We're looking for the exact figure, okay, but it may be &#x2013; drop &#x2013; it may be half a point, 0.3, 0.2, okay. But it seems to me liners likely slightly higher, okay? So really there is no explanation. I think as prices usually move in the fourth quarter, I think the fourth quarter is when we &#x2013; the fourth quarter and first quarter are usually the quarters where we have some share movement because we enter with the price and then competitors will take between one month to four months to move their prices, so fourth and the first are the quarters actually to watch and third is actually the one we actually reached our all-time high share.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Really just discussing the outlook for 2011, as the revenue line in Brazil continues to be supported by the macro, it's been a bit of a volume story or quite a bit of a volume story for a while now. I appreciate that you haven't made any public announcements on your pricing strategy yet and perhaps there's some dependence there on tax increase timing, if there is a tax increase, but on the mix shift side, how can we think about in 2011 some of the drivers? I guess specifically in the first instance, the Northeast growth, presumably the pricing there obviously is lower than it is in the Southeast, but to the extent that you move and grow in the Northeast via direct distribution, more than you might in the rest of the country, I wonder how that affects mix?</p>
          <p>So I guess question number one is, what's your direct distribution level in the Northeast and the North relative to the national? Is it below the national level? And if it is, do you see a lot of the growth next year or in the months ahead coming from direct distribution or do you see it continue through third parties in the Northeast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Celso. This is Jo&#xE3;o, I mean, very good question. I think this is one of the questions that also the market will help us to answer. I would say to start answering it, I would focus less &#x2013; I mean we don't open the percentage exactly of the execution per region, but I would say that the focus on the growth were much more on the innovation front of everything that we launched in the North and the Northeast. And the fact that we had a much worst share there to begin with, that let us, the combination of the liquid innovation, starting with the Brahma Fresh that we launched more than two years ago, and then coming with the liter and then coming with different cans, I think that had a much bigger impact with price points that were price points that let's say the emerging class C of those markets is definitely appealed to them. And also building a stronger brand equity with Skol and with Brahma Fresh and in certain regions also with Antarctica. That's what led us last year to gain substantial share in the North, and this year to gain substantially share in the Northeast.</p>
          <p>I think going forward, we will learn where the market and us "will" take the mix to. I think as I was saying before, we wanted, and we were lucky, and we worked well to be in a better share positioning, so now that we can have choices. Okay and that includes an internal view on the mix. I think an opportunity for the next few years, why I think 2009 and 2010 were years where we supported a lot the mainstream brands with a combination of liquid and package. Maybe we can have an end equation starting in 2011, "starting" of course we've been working for that for a long time, but maybe we could have the mainstream and the premium being taken care. So that's an opportunity going forward, Beer with the Skol 360, Beer with Stella, and Beer with the launch of Bud. I think that combination of that stronger portfolio can be something that may help us on the mix side as 2011 evolves. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact, that premiumization was just the follow-up question on the other side of the coin, I suppose, which is we've talked about this for quite some time in Brazil and in Argentina clearly we've seen a major shift upwards in the premium side. I think if I'm not mistaken the market share of the premium category for you is about double what it is for in Brazil. So, you mentioned Bud, you mentioned Skol and maybe perhaps the Northeast's role here. Do you see that evolution in 2011 finally beginning to push premium as a percentage of the industry materially higher in 2011 or is it still a much more gradual pace as we've seen in the last few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Celso, we had a challenge on the mainstream in Brazil, which was not the case necessarily in Argentina, as you saw when you visited the market a couple times there, right? So there you had the more established and maybe a stronger share position, and I think the team in Argentina did and still are doing a great job on the premiumization. They could do that given they had a very established share position in the mainstream.</p>
          <p>I think we &#x2013; although of course we have had for a while a very strong share position, I think we were more under attack. We needed to protect and attack also in the mainstream. We did that in the last couple of years and luckily and good work continued to work in our favor. And I think now we have the means and, let's say, the time to also focus. That's why we're working to be an end year, a year of mainstream and premium, and hopefully we can put some speed into place.</p>
          <p>It was difficult during 2010. We wanted to do more things during 2010 but volume came very strong and we had to make choices. At the point in time, we planned to launch Bud this year, but given the capacity situation and given that we also wanted to launch the Skol 360&#xB0; which I think is a great liquid that we now have a new line extension before it's going into the marketplace. So on the other side, things that we had in the pipeline that were ready to go, we did that. And I think next year with the new capacity that we brought into the place and the new share position we have in the mainstream, I think that will give us the chance to have as an internal objective to grow both segments. So this is something that we were planning to start in 2010. We were not able to for the reasons I just mentioned, but we will have this objective for 2011.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thank you very much. And I just wanted to ask a little bit about the price increase. I mean given all-time record high market shares, given canned cost pressures in the industry, it seems to me that this is a perfect time to push on price, irrespective of what the tax authorities do. I mean they're getting more tax revenue, right? The tax rate is a percentage of value, not volume. So they're doing just fine. Is it &#x2013; could you talk a little bit about the timing, the magnitude, and how you might implement your pricing this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Bob. I mean let me take advantage of the question and report back on, Jose, on the market share, so the right &#x2013; the number is we have a 70.6 share in Q2 and it went to 71.1 in Q3. So gaining a 0.5. So as I mentioned, we gained share sequentially and that goes into your question that we are in a better position, you are right. I cannot anticipate anything. We still don't know what the government will do. You are right. We will be in a better position. So we should take advantage of that. But remembering that we, I mean, as a leader, also whatever we do, we will affect market demands in the very subtle equation on how we play that.</p>
          <p>So, again, great to have choices. We will try to make the wisest choice between the equation of price and volume. And we have that choice in Brazil given what happened in the last few years. And we will see that in the last months. In the next months, we will see what happens, again better position, choices, but yet too early to give you much detail on the pricing strategy for the summer.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Can you just talk about competition then with respect to how rational competition is behaving? What kind of discipline you're seeing in the industry? It seems as if there's been a little bit more discounting. And certainly from Sol and some of the Heineken brand portfolio in Brazil, I was wondering if I could get your perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say, Bob, I mean that's a very good question, and one that of course we watch it on a daily basis. I would say on returnables in general more rational. Okay. I mean we haven't seen so much in discounts. We've seen some promotions, it's true, on disposable, but on and off. I wouldn't say that someone dropped the prices down by X and then continued that way. I mean I think we have seen the occasional discounting during holidays. We have had actually a lot of holidays during these last few months in Brazil. And holidays is a time of the month or a time of the year that people discount in general, everyone. Okay. So that may be why you are taking or seeing a few discounts here and there, nothing different than other years. I should say quite positive center overall. But again, this coming quarter, the fourth quarter, is the one to watch how competitors will respond to an event, to the price increase that the marketplace will see.</p>

          <p>Yeah. Hi, Celso, indeed when we commented for 2010 on the implied FX rate, we're looking into like 1.99. But of course, if the volume growth ahead of our expectations, and also given this spot rates we had in the course of 2010, we are going to have a full-year number better than this.</p>
          <p>Our current estimate, it can be between $0.04 or $0.05 lower than this or around 1.94, 1.95, the effective rate for 2010. We are having &#x2013; we already have a majority of our 2011 exposure locked in, given our policy. But since you haven't finished that, we believe it's better to provide a view on that in the next quarter when we announce the full-year results and the floor can be able to talk with more certainty about 2011.</p>
          <p>It's going to be getter than this year, of course. I mean when I say we had a large majority of our exposure not there, we think what is left may change by couple cents up or down. That's why I don't want to commit to anything at this stage, but it's going to be lower if you take the average rate year to date, the spot rates but it's word of reference for us in 2011 hedges. We are significantly lower and that of course will help our costs for next year.</p>
