      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good afternoon, good morning for all of you. Excited to be here to speak about our results. I would like to start on screen number two, with our highlights for the year. We had a recurring net income for the quarter of BRL 3.5 billion and for the year BRL 14 billion.</p>
          <p>ROE was 19.3% for the quarter and 19.4% for the year, and I will comment this down the road. Assets exceed BRL 1 trillion overall, but overall, I would say that we had a very challenging year. 2012 was not an easy &#x2013; we had a reduction in rates, pressure on margins, delinquency increasing. But I believe that we end up the year in good shape, because we were able to control delinquency as we will show you down the road in this presentation. We finished the year below the levels of December 2011 and I think this was a great achievement for the year.</p>
          <p>Margins are reducing and we have been managing the P&amp;L of the bank in order to adapt to this new environment. I think we are very successful in controlling expenses and this made it possible to deliver this result what we have.</p>
          <p>Provisions for loan losses are now on the way down in accordance with the NPL trends. So I think that we are ending the year in a much better shape than we started the year, when NPLs and provisions were increasing.</p>
          <p>We announced over the year also our big investment in technology, BRL 10.4 million is to be invested over a three-year period. This has to do with the new data center that we already started to build 100 kilometers from S&#xE3;o Paulo. We are also investing in new technologies and new systems, new architectures in order to comply with &#x2013; in order to be able to do what we plan to do in terms of product and services, in terms of ability to serve clients so on and so forth.</p>
          <p>We also announced a partnership with BMG. I think we are pretty much in line with the schedules in order to make it operational. It will start in March, fully operational. It's already in piloting terms, but anyway we are supporting BMG, acquiring the loans, so that they could expense the distribution force and we probably will start in high levels of production for the JV, a higher level than we expected when we planned the acquisition.</p>
          <p>We've also been awarded, in the year, the tender offer for the minority stake of Redecard. It was excellent. We spent &#x2013; we invested BRL 11.8 billion there, that's shown in the screen &#x2013; the next screen on page three. We accounted this transaction as a capital transaction, aligned with the international standards and which will be our consolidated financial statement in IFRS.</p>
          <p>The important thing, I believe, in this, the way we accounted here, is the fact that this will not impact our results in the future. So the full impact of the premium that we paid for Redecard is already on our balance sheet in our consolidated statement. So there will be no impact overall for that.</p>
          <p>Even though we have this equity reduction, we believe we are in good shape in terms of capital levels. We ended the year with 16.7%, which is very comfortable. And considering the adequate treatment for deferred tax assets that we have here in Brazil, our core capital ratio, according to Basel III concept, would be <mark type="indiscernible" /> (07:08), after this impact because of Redecard. So we are in good shape in terms of capital and we believe that the acquisition will be on our goals.</p>
          <p>On page four, we have our P&amp;L. I won't comment on the numbers, but I will more spend time commenting with you that our strategy as the way we have been describing with many of you is already paying off. We can show clear results of what we have done for the year. We, at the beginning of last year, we decided that we should change our risk appetite. As a matter of fact, this started, I think 2010, but in 2011 was fully implemented, completely changed our risk appetite, so that we move it out of some sub-prime, high-risk kind of segments and assets.</p>
          <p>And nowadays, we have been seeing that this already is paying off at the end of the year. In fact, although our margins are still declining, as we expect, because we moved out of those segments, high margins, our service revenue and insurance revenues have been increasing sharply in the end of the year. Although we have some seasonality there, I believe that the numbers are above the seasonality issue. So I think that we're expecting already coming down the road, those aspects.</p>
          <p>And although margins have been reducing &#x2013; margins have been reduced, the expenses for loan losses also have been reduced. So things are coming to the right place as we have been describing as a plan. But now, it's not a plan, it's already on the numbers.</p>
          <p>Also, we have been very focused in terms of getting more efficiency. So we have been controlling our expenses, non-interest expenses in a very tough way for the year. We had a 1.8% growth in non-interest expense, so that this was below inflation, it was much below growth and revenues, so we have been gaining efficiency. And this is something that we plan to keep close eyes on this part of the business.</p>
          <p>Next page, page five, we show what we classified as non-recurring events. Non-recurring events, decided by the fact that in those issues here, we have changed the criteria that we were using to account for them. For instance, in terms of economic plans, we have done a very detailed analysis, case by case analysis, so that we had a more precise provisions for the commitments that we have ahead, much more precise than we had before when we used to use a more simplified model to make the contribution &#x2013; the provision.</p>
          <p>The same &#x2013; that's the same case for the labor claims. We went for a much more detailed analysis of a large piece of labor claims, and not using the average as we were two years before. So, this would present a change in terms of criteria at the U.N. Also in terms of loan losses, we have changed some of the models in order to have a more close, precise rating for clients that needs change. So this does not &#x2013; if we were using the same criteria that we were using in previous quarter, we would not have this level of additional provisions. But since we have changed it because we believe that this is appropriate, now we have this additional provision that we are putting on non-recurring expense.</p>
          <p>In the next page, page six, we make a interesting calculation showing that and it's very important because some of you have questions, if this would not be recurring. I would like to say this is related with much more on exclusively with a change in criteria. And does not have to do to any specific asset or loan that is past due. And so, I mean, any provision pertaining to the quarter related to past due loans were done on the recurring statements.</p>
          <p>Here, we have only done revision in our criteria, so that we classify this as non-recurring. And this can be &#x2013; this is very clear here on page six when we apply the idea, the concept of, okay, let's assume that we would have get the level of coverage of past due loans and provisions, at the same level that we had the quarter before. When you see the numbers, you can see that we have improved our coverage, by a large extent, bigger than what we have classified as non-recurring. So what we are doing is really making our provisions stronger and not having to do anything about, or rather loans that are already past due. So this was a concept that we used for that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (13:42).</p>
          <p>Next page we have this ROE of 19.4%, which was benefited by the fact that we had reduced the equity of the banks because of the Redecard transaction. If we had not done that, the fourth quarter would be 17.7% in terms of ROEs. So this new level of ROE has to do also in part with the &#x2013; really accounted for Redecard.</p>
          <p>Loans have been &#x2013; was a slow growth year in terms of loans. We have grown 9%. And here we had the clear impact that can be seen in the vehicles and the very small and middle market companies loans. Those two segments, we have very, as a matter of fact, negative growth in both segments that impacted the overall growth of our portfolio. In those two segments, we are the most impacted by the new risk appetite policy that we have in place. So this was a reduction and we expect that by the second quarter of next year, those two portfolios will be already growing.</p>
          <p>On the next page, page nine, we have our evolution of our net credit spreads, which is the strong green line. Net of interest and net of provisions, so we can see that although we still have &#x2013; margins are still falling, when we look net of provisions, it's already stabilizing and we expect it to grow next year.</p>
          <p>The overall means have reduced more sharply this quarter for many reasons and I will explain this in the next page, page ten, the very different attack here. First, we had an increase in volume that put some additional revenue on our margins. But given the new risk appetite and the new risk appetite has impacted the way we calculate what the volume that we are booking in different products of the bank.</p>
          <p>So higher products, like for instance, overdrafts which are higher-risked products and higher margins, have been reduced in our portfolio. So this is an example of the mix of spread has been impacted because of this new underwriting policy.</p>
          <p>Also the acquisition of Redecard reduces our cash position in BRL 12 billion almost, and this also reduces the margin. Although we do not have any more the minority shareholding participation in terms of bottom line was a positive impact. We also had the Selic rate reduction, which also impacted the numbers. And finally, we have, which was a minor part, the margins and other effects that were compressed for different reasons here.</p>
          <p>So this was an important understanding of how our business is evolving. Further compression in margins was pretty much explained by the fact that in many ways, we already expect, the main factor was the mix of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (17:57) which was a result of the new risk appetite.</p>
          <p>Those are the bad news, but the good news we start to see in the page 11, which accounts for delinquency. The delinquency ratio has been consistently reduced and we have been, during the whole year, reduced our level, our short-term delinquency ratio and NPL ratio has already came down by a large factor. And on the next page as well, you we can see that over 90-day NPL ratio is also already showing good results here, both in companies and also in consumers.</p>
          <p>I have to mention that on the consumer side, we have sold assets of our affiliated companies in the amount about BRL 480 million. This had some deep impact in our overall delinquency ratio. So even if we did not have those assets, we still have a drop to 4.9% but a good drop coming from 5.1%. The assets that we have sold were auto loans which we had delinquent for more than one year, so we are adopting this as a new policy. This won't have the same level impact in the coming quarters because this was the total stock of loans over the one year that we had. Now on, we will see much smaller numbers because it will be basically the new things that we have below one year that will go on as profit.</p>
          <p>Our coverage as a result of all those things, all those improvements and the additional provisions that we have made has improved in good amounts, we have come from 149% to 158% in terms of coverage ratio, so above last quarter and above December last year.</p>
          <p>Let's move to page 15 just to show that our franchise of capital deposit from clients is very strong. We have gained some market share this year. The growth we had was 15.5%. So very strong signal of client franchise. We achieved more than BRL 1 billion <mark type="indiscernible" /> (21:04).  As a result of that, since the loans have not grown as much, we have improved the ratio of loan to funding <mark type="indiscernible" /> (21:22).</p>
          <p>Page 17 is just a picture of our new strategy that we have commented during the year at the bank, putting more emphasis on insurance and services revenue. Given the fact that we are &#x2013; we have had a reduction in margin. So this has obviously helped somehow the margins and we have grown the last quarter, total revenue have grown, mainly given this new trend.</p>
          <p>We have some seasonality in those numbers, clearly. But even though the improvement was above the seasonality level, as you can see when you compare to last year's 2011 numbers, during fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Our efficiency ratio has improved this year, mainly because of our best control of expenses. As we show in page 18, we have grown only 1.8% expenses, so much below the level of inflation, much below asset growth and the policies so and so forth. So the bank is clearly gaining more efficiency and this appears in our efficiency ratio as we can see in page 19. Our efficiency ratio <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:57).</p>
          <p>On page 21, we can see our, movements that we had in our BIS ratio, which has finished the year at the level 16.7%, below the last quarter, September, mainly because of Redecard, that we show here on the slide, but above last year's number. So we are very comfortable with the overall capitalization of the bank. The volume of our trading has kept at high levels, so I think it's very high, very good.</p>
          <p>Then on page 23, we can check the guidance that we gave you for the year what has been achieved and what has not been achieved. At the beginning of the year, we announced that the change in our recent advice, so this affect our portfolio, especially in terms of vehicles and companies. We are not able to achieve the regional expectation, although we were able to achieve the number of divided, which would not include vehicles.</p>
          <p>In terms of fee, I think the main impact &#x2013; the negative impact here was also in terms of the vehicles, which was accounted for the level of service revenue coming from the vehicle origination was much, much lower. So these affected the overall results.</p>
          <p>In terms of non-interest expenses development, as we were above the target, we give you a target of 4% to 8% at the end of the year and then 3.5% to 6.5% and we end up growing only 1.8%.</p>
          <p>Efficiency ratio was very close to the final levels that we originally had expected. We did not achieve it for the full number basically because of Redecard. Expenses, they are very much under control.</p>
          <p>For next year, we believe that we will have a growth. We base these projections in a 3.2% growth in our GDP. So we expect more or less this level of growth and credit portfolio will grow around 11% and 14% and that is seasonal.</p>
          <p>We believe that provisions for loan losses, we will reduce it, it will be a number of BRL 19 billion to BRL 22 billion. And we are very comfortable with those numbers given the very recent trends that we have seen in loan losses and delinquency.</p>
          <p>And services fees and insurance, we tend to grow more trends for the year and we keep our strong hold on the expenses. We believe that we'd be able again to grow below the inflation levels. So we are very comfortable with those three numbers.</p>
          <p>I have to mention that we're also transferring to the risk-adjusted ratio and we believe that there's some &#x2013; the margins will grow one-digit low levels. And maybe on how markets develop and pressures on margins and Selic rate and growth of the economy, this might be a factor. So I would say basically that there are more uncertainty around the NIM growth and more certainty about the guidance that we are giving you in this short period.</p>
          <p>Having said that, I open up for questions. Thank you.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Mr. Carlos Macedo with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Roberto. Good morning, gentlemen. Congratulations on the strong results, strong trends. A couple of questions, the first, if you could give us some color on the loan growth expectations you set out for 2013, particularly in between the lines for what specific areas do you expect more growth for? Of course, you have &#x2013; you've had weak growth on the auto line and stronger growth on the mortgage line. Is &#x2013; are those trends expected to continue to 2013 for a specific line and how does that affect your mix and your margins as a result?</p>
          <p>The second question is with respect to expenses. The guidance you gave 4% to 6%, I was wondering how conservative you are because just looking at some of the trends, for instance, in personnel, average number of employees will be down, the severance expenses that you had in 2012 presumably will be down as well. Those were almost doubled in 2012 related to 2011. Could there be a positive surprise in expenses with expenses growing or being flat year-over-year? Is that a possibility or are you conservatively guiding 4% to 6%? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of expenses, the numbers that we are guiding you are the numbers that we believe that we have real plans for achieving them. And we are very confident that we can achieve. Having said that, I have to tell you that we &#x2013; if you are working in order to reduce expenses, although, I cannot give you any guidance today because I don't have clear plans to implement new things.</p>
          <p>But if we are able to find out new things, I may believe, that we can do a lot of hard work for that, because we have to prepare the bank not only for the next year, but also for 2015 and 2016. So we are still working in new things that we have to improve to achieve this.</p>
          <p>So it is possible that we achieve this number in the lower band clearly, maybe a little bit below, it may be possible, though we don't have any plans for that, I have to say. On the other hand, we don't know exactly how the inflation, how the exchange rate, how the readjustment of salaries, the official readjustment &#x2013; just to give you an example, last year was above 2% above inflation, so if this is something that happens again this year, this will have a negative impact as well.</p>
          <p>The other question was about mix. We believe that on the second quarter of the year, we will have the vehicles portfolio and the small company portfolio back to growth. So, we still have some <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:02) of this reduction in risk appetite.</p>
          <p>For the year, we believe that lower margin products will outgrow higher margin products. I'm talking about Consignado, I'm talking about credit mortgages, I'm talking about big companies, big corporations. So those portfolios, in my view, will outgrow other portfolios that has large margins.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Roberto.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Mario Pierry with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Let me ask you two questions, Roberto. One is, we have seen significant improvements or reduction in head count at the bank over the last roughly 12 months. We saw head count fall by 7%. I was wondering, if you could give us any guidance in terms &#x2013; should we expect this trend to continue, should we see an acceleration in head count reductions, if you could just give us some more color specific to head count?</p>
          <p>And then second question is related to Redecard, or your acquiring business, we saw a significant pick-up in volumes this quarter. So I was just wondering, if you could remind us of your strategy for Redecard, what are you expecting for volume growth in ADRs? That'd be great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of head count, we don't have a goal to achieve in terms of reduction. We believe that we have more opportunities in terms of gaining through the system in other things, not necessarily in people reduction. And we do not have a specific goal on that.</p>
          <p>In terms of Redecard, we had a good quarter, good development. I have to tell you that we recovered some of the market share that we had lost in previous quarters for the year. This was a result much more of things and decisions that we're taking even before the full acquisition of the bank, so I do not really would bring these improvements to the fact that we are already fully owning Redecard. Those decisions we have taken before that.</p>
          <p>We have a new CEO there. We have a plan for Redecard. We are very excited with the opportunities of integrating more with the bank, synergies, in terms of what we have in terms of opportunities with small companies. This is an important relation with small clients. We believe that Redecard is important part of this strategy because it creates opportunity to extend credit in a very solid way, so this is important.</p>
          <p>We also believe that in addition, on the other side, in terms of payment opportunities, Redecard is an important asset, give us a lot of flexibility, give us a lot of power to negotiate with Visa and MasterCard and other brands that are in the road. So we think we are stronger today to negotiate with those guys. So I think we are very happy about the acquisition, they way things are developing and the kinds of things that we can, by integrating it with the bank, we can have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very good. Just if you could go back then to your answer, you're not specifically looking for head count reduction or that you don't have a target but you're looking to improve productivity. Can you just give us some examples or what type of plans you have in place? I think we have been long mentioning Brazil, that the banks could eventually share ATMs. Could you just give us an update on how can you achieve productivity improvements?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do not have and we are not announcing specific things. But I can tell you that, the point that we are we do not have one single silver bullet. So a lot of small things, everybody in the bank is working very hard in all the areas of the bank, improving the productivity. Everybody has this in their own goals, individual goals. So it's a lot of things, some are more relevant, some others are not much relevant, but there are no single important thing. We are integrating, the cost is changing, process, a lot of small things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Daniel Abut, Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of questions. One on the capital situation, now that you explained that after the integration of Redecard and the new level of capital that that implies, you did say in your disclosure that if you apply the general new Basel III rules, even what you understand will be the treatment of the deferred tax assets, you should still be above 10%.</p>
          <p>But what I wonder is, within that above 10% what will be your situation vis-&#xE0;-vis core capital because it appears to me that maybe on the core capital rate, that it will be too tight, depending on your growth plans. And I'm trying to get a sense to whether this is a sustainable situation or sooner or later you may need capital.</p>
          <p>And depending on your answer to that question, then I wanted to ask you about the sustainability of your ROE, now that you've reached this low 19s level in the fourth quarter but it's seems to me that from now on, particularly even the expected decline in provision that you are guiding, your earnings generation should start to improve, how will you feel about your ROE going forward? But again, that's tied to whether you feel your current capital situation is sustainable or not.</p>

          <p>Hello, Daniel. Thank you for the questions. I think we are not clear. I'm sorry for that. We are 10%, the level that we are talking about is the core capital. We are, in terms of core capital, above 10%. I think I was not clear when I mentioned that number. So, this is really something very comfortable. In terms of ROE, clearly, the fact that we have reduced the equity will have an impact in the ROE. Just to give you an idea there, the ROE of last quarter would have been 17.7% instead of 19.4%. So this is a clear improvement.</p>
          <p>But coming to the P&amp;L itself, I'd say that margins will be a very important driver of this, how much ROE can and how much final net income we can get. It will be much more depending on the margin as the net interest income development. I think there's some uncertainty there, we will have to see how the year develops.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from <mark type="ph" /> Mr. Guillermo Miller with Credit Suisse (39:17).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, hello, everyone. Marcelo Telles, Credit Suisse. I have two questions. The first one regarding your extraordinary provisions for loan losses, I was wondering if you could tell us, I mean, what was the amount of the loan portfolio that was reclassified with the different risk ratings? And how much of that portfolio is actually related to the restructured portfolio?</p>
          <p>And my second question is more like a broad question. I mean, we saw a very upbeat guidance on provisions for 2013, which kind of makes sense considering the improvement you clearly have been showing. But on the other hand, I mean, it seems that a very good chunk of that improvement is being offset by an expectation of NII decline. Because if we play with your guidance and we try to derive what sort of earnings we'd be expecting and what sort of NII evolution, it looks like, you would be expecting the NII to go down 5%, more or less 5% in 2013. But then you have a decline maybe 13% in provisions, which will lead to a low single-digit increase in NII after provisions, right?</p>
          <p>But the net effect of that is that your earnings growth would still be around high single-digit, right? So do you think this trend can revert, thinking about 2014? You think you can resume growth in your NII from that point or you think that in 2014, you would still see a relatively slow resumption of NII growth after provisions? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I start with the last question. I recognize that we have some uncertainty in the margin development, we have been sharing this very clear with you. I would say that we do expect it to be slightly positive in general. Although, we see risks of going down depending on market conditions, growth of the economy and then of loans.</p>
          <p>But also we can have also a positive impact coming from less pressure in the margins in the marketplace. So there are some uncertainty, hence, this we would have to see over the year. We believe that this is about pre-provisions level, okay. Part of the provisions we reduced and we expect that net interest income will be very close to our low level positive number in terms of overall growth for the year.</p>
          <p>But yes, there's some uncertainty there. I totally agree that it can be slightly positive. It can be more positive or slightly, very slightly, maybe negative, but we probably are more on the positive side.</p>
          <p>In terms of provisions, the non-recurring numbers, again, the provision that we classified as non-recurring were non-specific provisions for any specific client. It was much more a review of models that shows that from mainly clients, basically retail, mostly small companies. We would be more precise in terms of expected loss for giving the current situation of the loan portfolio. We have more provisions there, okay.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Roberto. And just a follow-up on that question. Do you expect more of this type of provision going forward or this is as much you're going to see in terms of these extraordinary provisions? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>We do not expect any new revision in models. I think we have learned a lot on models this year, as we all know here. We have made a few mistakes. But now I think that things are pretty much in good shape and we do not expect any review in terms of provisions.</p>
          <p>Just taking the opportunity to mention that on page three, although we have stated there &#x2013; I'm coming back basically to the question of Daniel Abut about the total capital ratio above 10%. It's wrong there. We are talking really about core capital above 10%. I'm really sorry to have this mistake here in our presentation. We will correct it on the slides.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for the opportunity. I have two questions. The first one is on your margins. Just wanted to clarify, you said net interest income growth of low single-digits. I mean, I know it's not an official guidance, it's not here on the last page of your presentation but you are providing a little bit of color. So I just wanted to make sure I understood. So what is your expectation for net interest income growth for 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not really giving you a guidance. We are just basically recognizing that there are some uncertainty there. Numbers could be slightly positive, slightly negative, maybe more positive. But I mean, this is basically &#x2013; and this is clearly because we did not give you a clear guidance. There is no &#x2013; we accept that there are some uncertainties there, okay. Basically this is what we can really provide you, Jorge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. So just to understand, so the uncertainties on margins, I mean, you have a loan portfolio guidance, so I'm assuming you know where you're going to grow. You have a provision guidance which I'm assuming then you would know what the mix of the business is going to be. And you have a Selic forecast, which is, I think flat, Selic for the year.</p>
          <p>And just &#x2013; you understand the duration of your loan book and when this will expire and the front book, back book issue. You know what the duration of your assets are and liabilities. So just wanted to understand where the uncertainty is, what part of the margin story is the one that you don't know today that drives you not to have a specific guidance, because it seems to me that all of the pieces you know. I guess I just want to know which part you don't.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know two things. One is the volume. I mean, we have some uncertainty about the volume, some uncertainty about the growth of the economy. And this is an important uncertainty. The other comes from some uncertainty about pressures on margins in the market, okay. If we assume that which &#x2013; if we assume that they will reduce, we are more on the positive side, okay. If we assume that there will be more pressure on margins, we might be on the negative side. But basically, this is what we have, but it's a narrow difference in my view, what would happen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks. Thanks. And then the second question is just also a clarification. Your guidance of provisions of BRL 19 billion to BRL 22 billion that assumes that your coverage ratio remain stable throughout the year? And I ask this, because we did see a big depletion of your coverage ratio in 2011-2012 from almost 180% to about 150%. So, you can do BRL 19 million or BRL 22 billion in provisions without taking out the coverage. Is that the thinking or it includes maybe taking the coverage ratio down to closer to 120%, 130%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Our guidance assumes that we will keep the same policy that we have today for making the provisions. And we would say that the trends of delinquency -positive it is, will lead to increase in the coverage ratio, because we will have lower level of delinquency &#x2013; assets with the same policy of provisions. So I would assume that &#x2013; I don't have the numbers here, but my math would imply an improvement in the coverage ratio.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's pretty much our effective rate would be around 32% to 34%. If you consider that we have the benefits coming from payments of the dividends and distributions. So that's pretty much what we are considering right now in terms of forecast for 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I asked that because this implies an increase of about 4% to 6% compared to what we have posted into 2012, it is correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, something like this, especially because we consider the social contribution benefits in 2012 as a non-recurring event. So that's why we believe that we're going to increase a little bit this effective tax rate in 2013 based on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not the full 6%, Jorg, because we have companies that are already paid for, okay, just remember that. So don't have a clear number yet to give you. But remember that Redecard, for instance, is 4% and will stay 4% with no difference. So we have, I think, another situation that won't change. So the full effect will not be the 6%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Perfect, Roberto. And taking the opportunity to ask a more broad question. I noted that the relevance of other countries in Ita&#xFA;'s balance sheet continues to increase over time. So just wondering how much you believe those other countries could contribute to the bank's total loans in the next couple of years? And whether this could be an additional source of net income generation in your view. You bought, for instance, HSBC retail operations in Chile, I think about 15 to 18 months ago. And HSBC continues to be vocal about potentially divesting from non-core regions. So would you consider opportunities in the Caribbean and in Mexico, if those become available? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that we have to basically &#x2013; I think your question is much more related to the local loans that we do in local markets in Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay. And not necessarily loans that are booked out of Brazil, which we do with Brazilian clients, for instance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, today we can see in our balance sheet, we have like BRL 29 billion in that number. It has grown, I'm not sure how much this year, adjusting for the exchange rate. But it has been growing much more than the local numbers. I think that those numbers would be closer to 15% to 20% and not like the local numbers we had 9%. So we had much higher level of growth in those markets.</p>
          <p>And I believe it will continue, given the fact that those markets, we did not have to adjust any kind of risk appetite. So we have &#x2013; we are stable in terms of growing and we have been growing in all those markets. And those economies, in general, are outgrowing Brazilian economy. So we expect them to outgrow the Brazilian portfolio by a large amount. Although, they still represent a small amount in our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>I believe that any major change in terms of really becoming a meaningful aspect of our revenue would come only after a major acquisition. The current numbers are still below 10% of our loan portfolio, so we should not expect a major, a meaningful impact in our balance sheet in the short term. And we do not have any plan today to do any major acquisition, I don't think there is any possibility of this. Currently, there's no important asset being offered or being negotiated in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>So for the time being, I don't think this would be a relevant thing. But I have to say that we are in the position of interest of investing in other Latin American countries.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys, good afternoon. My question is really just &#x2013; it's a follow-on on a lot of the earlier questions, but it's just a &#x2013; it's a more broad question, I suppose, about risk appetite.</p>
          <p>Roberto, you mentioned that you believe that SMEs and auto loan should start to grow in the second-half. You've also mentioned a lot of uncertainty in your expectations for net interest income. And you've clearly been in a risk-off mode for a while and perhaps that's the right strategy, it's been good for asset quality, it's been bad for, obviously, for your net interest income evolution.</p>
          <p>But what needs to happen either in the macro environment for you to start to grow your higher margin products at a more elevated rate, is it a macro &#x2013; do you need to see better macroeconomic growth condition, do you still feel uncomfortable with the leverage levels of consumers, what is it that would cause you to start to take a more risk-on type of mindset, and obvious &#x2013; since obviously that is really a big part of what will get net interest income growing again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think that &#x2013; I believe that there's &#x2013; the opportunity in that segment, is not the same as it was 10 years ago. 10 years ago, Brazil was basically starting to develop their consumer credit market, and we had high &#x2013; very high level of growth during this period, clients have increased the level of indebtedness of them. So I think that today, the opportunity in this market is pretty much reduced in terms of growth.</p>
          <p>It will stay growing, but much more slowly than it used to do in the past. So we don't foresee this as a major opportunity for growth for us. We believe that opportunities will be larger for growth in other markets like mortgages and payroll loans and things like that with lower level margins, although much, much lower levels than in Brazil.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I see SMEs as a growth opportunity? Yes, I do. Although, I think that margins in that segment also will be much more controlled. I think we will have to use much more collateralized types of loans like Redecard loans, for instance. We can use collaterals of Redecard for loans for the low &#x2013; the small companies. So I think that segment we have probably more opportunities than in the consumer segment, that has to adjust the risk profile.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. And thank you for taking my call and also thank you for slide 10. I think it's pretty useful. And also following up a little bit on the net interest margin questions before, I'm just curious if you can give us a little bit of color in what you've seen in the development of client NIMs for loans so far this year. Can you give us a little bit of a taste of have they been better or worse than the average 4Q 2012?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The trend is the same. We probably, we lose some margins in terms of &#x2013; we'll gain volume, compared to the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (59:23) that you just mentioned. We're still going to gain more volumes. I mean, if you do this at the end of next year, the same chart, I would say that we will see growth in volume, some loss because of credit mix.</p>
          <p>We won't have Redecard, I believe Selic will stay pretty much stable. And there's some uncertainty around the last thing would be the margin, okay. If you have some stable margins of what we are doing today, what we are underwriting today, then probably we would have a positive evolution of the net interest income.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two questions. One is just to clarify that the background scenario for the credit growth this year, which the guidance says between 11% and 14%. Some of your competitors are saying, private ones are saying that they do kind of foresee that the public banks will decelerate their aggressiveness during 2013. I'm just wondering if &#x2013; and sorry, if I missed that during the presentation, I'm wondering if you consider that as part of your assumption for credit growth for 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well last year, we grew 9%, so we are accelerating our growth to a higher level. And this level will depend on either growth of the economy and the situation overall in the market. But we will have growth definitely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Because, I was just wondering how this would play out. I mean, looking at how the economy is going, it's still on a ramp-up phase, and the fact that the new credit being originated in the system, depends too much on public banks for, I don't know, like 70%.</p>
          <p>So, from a top-down perspective, it seems hard, at least when the economy is in a ramp-up stage, it was all down. And the fact that even the economy improves, why would they stop anyway, because it's just a better economic environment, so you don't have a purpose just to stop.</p>
          <p>And from a bottom-up perspective, for the public banks, I mean, it seems they seem to decrease very much interest spreads and tariffs, if they do not compensate in volumes, they will really suffer even more probably that we are going to see. So just wondering that, at least, if this could compromise your ability to reaccelerate growth in 2013 and to such as an extent that you do not choose to take more risk again as you have been more in a risk-off mode recently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we won't change our risk appetite. We are very confident that it will pay off at the end of the day. It will bring the price returns for the capital that we are using to make the loans. I believe that this year 2013, we will see a much smaller difference between public and private banks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on the &#x2013; also on the credit growth and just for me to understand and actually related to the provisions, and of course there have been an improvement in Q4, although if you consider the credit sale that you did and the write-offs, I mean, despite the improvement, I mean, maybe it's not as significant as its appear in the numbers. But it did improve and you're being pretty bullish on 2013 guidance from loan-loss provisions.</p>
          <p>But I'm just wondering if this decline in loan-loss provisions is just more related to the fact that you were in a risk-off mode in the past, let's say, 18 months. Or if you're really seeing an improvement in credit quality out there. And if that's so, and again, I wonder if why you cannot grow more if the public banks are less aggressive. I mean, if the environment &#x2013; it is better and if they didn't do, let's say, didn't take too much risk, why shouldn't you increase your credit growth even more this year?</p>
          <p>And especially on the individual side, I mean, the scenario &#x2013; not really had changed this much in 2013. I mean, people are still employing and they're still making real wage increases. And the fact that they're still leveraged despite the fact it's low or high, but they're still leveraged, at least above historical average. So why would &#x2013; I'm trying to understand if this decrease in loan loss provision is a rebound from the fact that you have been not &#x2013; basically not lending or you see actually a structural improvement in asset quality in this system in Brazil that's why you see that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, we are talking about our numbers. I'm not talking about Brazil's number, the system's  number. We are talking about our numbers. Talking about our numbers, we are very confident that &#x2013; and then we have shown all the numbers here. We can look for many sides and all of them lead to one conclusion: the improvement in the asset quality is very clear, I don't think that this is &#x2013; there is any question.</p>
          <p>I'm not sure about the numbers in the system because I don't know what the banks have in their assets. But public numbers, they do not show the same kind of improvement that we have seen here in Ita&#xFA;. And basically, the reason is because we have been much more careful the last quarter and this is the result of our policy, something very, very clear. So I think that at this point in time, I think that we have a &#x2013; we are very confident that quality of assets is improving.</p>
          <p>I can explain to you why our volume will not grow maybe as much as you would expect, basically for one single reason: if you divide our current portfolio in two types of clients. I assume that one type of client is the client that I am &#x2013; according to my current risk appetite and the other one is the remaining book of clients or type of loans that I would not renovate anymore as long as I can &#x2013; we have the loan fully paid.</p>
          <p>So I have still today, a portion of assets or loans that we, under the current level of risk appetite, we would not have bookings. So I have to finish that level. When you take into account basically the life of loans that I have in my book today that have the risk appetite that I'm talking about, the one I have in bookings, and we see the growth that we are expecting for the future, those are &#x2013; this growth is above 15%. Did I make myself clear?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's very clear. And the question &#x2013; I can, of course, follow- p with you guys offline, but I think the question, the main question I have for 2013 improvement in your numbers which I know that's your numbers is that maybe this is more related to the fact that you've been on a risk-off mode and you have seen improvement in your asset quality.</p>
          <p>But once you start growing again, and if that is the case right, and if the credit quality of the system has not changed, so you basically have choice to take margin risks again. So I'm basically talking much more about 2014, maybe end of 2013. So making more &#x2013; taking more risk again because really the environment of the system has not changed dramatically. So that's why I was trying to relate the loan-loss provision there and the ability for you to actually to grow more on a structural basis, not meaning only 2013. But I don't want you to certainly end the quarter and that, if you can follow up on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. No, just a comment, Rog&#xE9;r can bring you more details on that. But again, we have numbers from vintage &#x2013; the recent vintage that we have in bookings, the last six months are much, much better than &#x2013; in terms of delinquency, much, much better than the ones that we were booking before. So all signs that we have, in any angle that you can see, shows the same kind of trends and conclusions.</p>

          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Eduardo Nishio with Brasil Plural.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you for taking my question. My question relates to delinquency and competition. Delinquency in Brazil as nicely depicted in your institutional presentation is much higher than other countries, right. And all banks seems to be moving to lower-risk, lower-return products, to decrease the risk in their balance sheet.</p>
          <p>My first question relates to this change in mix, is it only the mix that will decrease the risk profile. Is any other initiatives you are trying to implement, not only you, but the industry, to decrease the risk profile? But not only that, probably to try to improve profitability of the next vintages?</p>
          <p>And my second question is related to that, since all banks are moving towards the same products basically payrolls and mortgage loans, it's already impacting prices. How can we avoid the same mistakes that happened in 2010, when all banks were trying to get into SMEs and auto segments, right? Is there any risks you see in the short term in margins for those segments? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Starting with your last question. Currently, I don't see any risk or any problems in the things that we have booked. By the way, as I've mentioned before, the vintage that we have been seeing recently, are the best, probably in more than four, five years. So we don't see any major problem coming from that side.</p>
          <p>How can we assure you that we can keep this for longer time in terms of system? I think it's a matter of discipline. I think banks, when they hurt their hands, they <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:11:09) and they go back home. We do our homework. We go back in a more disciplined way. I think that in 2010, then the boom of the economy, the boom of the market made the banks a little bit lax. We see now, we are much more back to the basics and doing things that are the right things to do for banking. And what was the other question, Eduardo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's related to the mix, is there any other way to improve profitability or to decrease risk aside from changing mix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the right question here is the risk assessment. I think as long as we have the right risk assessment and that we are able to price the risk, we can make a lot of money out of very low-risk assets or high-risk assets. As long as you price correctly and you assess correctly the risk. So there's not really, I don't think the idea that high-risk assets are more profitable than lower-risk assets. I don't think that this is true. It's a matter of really understanding exactly the kind of risks that you are talking about and how to price it.</p>

          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Amit Mehta with PIMCO.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Yes, I'm sorry. I might be reiterating a question asked earlier. But can you just, I mean, can you just give us some color on the net interest margin? I mean, what scenario are you assuming for your kind of guidance, which I understand to be kind of flat to slightly up, pre-provision? And also then, what dynamics concern you that could obviously derail that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Basically, we assume that we will have the same risk appetite throughout the year, okay, which is what we plan to do, and there's some uncertainty given the fact that volumes might float a little bit. And also, what would be the kind of pressure stemming from the marketplace that we might have. So this brings me some uncertainty in terms of what would be the net interest income for <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:13:42).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just coming back to the point made by some of the other analysts in terms of every bank kind of moving into the same segments. Does that make you maybe a bit more sanguine about certain high-risk segments that they may be getting priced better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, it's a matter of knowing what you are doing. It's a matter of doing the right risk assessment for the assets that you are underwriting. Again, we are tracking this very closely and we are very comfortable with the level of delinquency that we booked in our balance sheet today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And sorry, can I just follow-up on one last question. Can you just give me an update on your payout ratio in light of the slower loan growth and where your capital position is? I mean, your payout ratio has been around 25% to 30% and what do you expect going forward from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Usually, the way we calculate this has to be some recurrence and how do you, the gross net dividend is going to have an effect. We are basically floating our payout ratio between 30% and 35% of the recurrent, the net dividend as the recurrent net income and we do not plan to change that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So despite slower rates of growth, you don't think you have capacity to raise your payout ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We believe that we will be able to use the capital in a profitable way.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes. My main questions have been asked. But just a couple of follow-ups here. Just a clarification on the guidance you've given for provisions for loan losses. This, I assume, is gross provisions, so the full recoveries, am I right in thinking that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. And also one other thing on the CapEx you're talking about, IT the BRL 10.3 billion over the next three years. Is this all going to be capitalized? Is any of this going to be expensed through the P&amp;L? And is that factored into your non-interest expense guidance of 46%?</p>

          <p>Good morning, all. Thanks for the questions. It's about your JV with BMG. If you could give us some more color on how it's evolving?
