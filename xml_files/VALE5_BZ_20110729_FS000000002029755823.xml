      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everybody. I think that is really a pleasure to have some time to share with you and to show our views. Let's start with iron ore state. We are very positive on the iron ore market. We know that although Europe and the U.S. faced very challenging recoveries and China continues to have a very strong demand, the inflation in China with the key element and having some concern. I think that we can see some improvement in the second half of the year and we are absolutely positive about the future of China, but for sure we have a lot of concerns about the stability mainly in Europe and the U.S.</p>
          <p>We at Vale we do not worry about supply overcoming demand in the next five years, which we believe that you will see some delays in the supply side, mainly related to some constraints, equipments and the permits and the license. I think that is the scenario that you are watching.</p>
          <p>The second point that I would like to share is about the investment of Vale in steel projects. We're sure you know that we have lost market share in Brazil and we must regain that, although this project &#x2013; through this project impact, we can create and capture demand for our iron ore. We expect it to have around 230 million tons of iron ore coming from Caraj&#xE1;s in the future.</p>
          <p>And right now you are talking about running at 100 million tons. And for sure, it's impossible to build a new Caraj&#xE1;s without knowing the community demand, and we must say that you are not alone there. We have the community and the government <mark type="indiscernible" /> (5:20) and everywhere. They are just expressing what the community is saying. But in our side, it's extremely important to regain the market share that we lost in Brazil, this aspect is very important.</p>
          <p>Regarding the CapEx, I think that the 2011 investment plan remains the same. We know that we are very far from our target, but we believe that we should be able to have spend the <mark type="ph" /> $24 (6:10) billion U.S. dollars at the end of first quarter of next year, but at the same time, to maintain the discipline in capital allocation.</p>
          <p>The third point that it's important to address it's about the Simandou project in Guinea. What I have to tell you is that it's part of the Brazilian government's policy to strengthen the relationship with African countries, go ahead with mining and logistics, it's very important and we would help to get stability in the countries in the West Coast, mainly in the West Coast. We have asked for the Brazilian government's support in the Simandou project, because our agreements will be much more strong. And what I can tell you is that our President, Dilma Rousseff, in fact is giving a strong support, it's not the support, it is a strong support.</p>
          <p>I had the chance to visit Guinea last Monday and I spent some time there, but I was with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Patriota. And as you can see, importance of this cooperation by those in Guinea is so relevant that the minister went to there in order to support Vale.</p>
          <p>One further point that I would like it to address it's about copper and Metorex. Strategically, it's important to be in copper. In my first conference with you, I expressed strongly my view regarding the future of the copper, but first of all, we must have discipline in capital allocation. Again, we continue very positive. We have a good portfolio to grow in copper. In case of having some, I can see acquisition, we will be very interest, but based on the assumption that you have the same discipline in capital allocation.</p>
          <p>I would like to talk a little about the Vale New Caldonia, the former Goro. I had to spend few days there, and what I can tell you that the technology is challenging, but in my view, most of the problems of the Goro project were related to the engineering and not to the technology.</p>
          <p>We are replacing the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (9:35) columns that, in our view, they were not well designed. These columns were responsible for separating nickel from cobalt. And again, I am positive we needed to be patient, but I hope to see good results at the end of the year. And the investment in Vale Nouvelle is done and in fact it's very important to make feasible the production come from the limonite reserves. And we cannot just leave the project as a failure; we're sure very far from this point.</p>
          <p>I know that you are anxious to hear my colleagues from the executive board and I will finalize just by giving some emphasis in some aspects. As you know, we have three main goals which are: returning capital to the shareholders, focus in sustainability and having the right people working with us under a good internal corporate climate. And it's very important, these three points.</p>
          <p>We will continue to work with the same strategic plan. We have a clear growth platform, maintain our leadership in iron ore and nickel and to increase our exposure in copper, coal and fertilizer and we will continue with our policy to return capital to our shareholders in case of having some cash surplus. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you ladies and gentlemen. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Mr. Felipe Hirai from Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Good afternoon. I have two questions. The first one is related to the CapEx increase and maybe CapEx releases we've seen in some of your projects. We saw that you revising the CapEx number for some of your projects. So, the question is what did you doing to prevent this issue and if there is anything that you are going to be able to tell us in the future about some of your other big projects like Simandou and the <mark type="ph" /> expansion (13:00) at Caraj&#xE1;s. My second question is related to the taxation, if you could just comment on what you're seeing on these potential issue of the other liabilities that Vale currently has with the government on the taxation of income for any subsidiaries and also on the potential increase in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (13:22). Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Felipe. In terms of the projects, our strategic projects are going well. And as Murilo mentioned, we expect to at the first quarter of 2012 to compete our program. And I guess that's it. In terms of the liabilities, and we already had provisions, the social contributions, and you were expecting that, there will be no effects on results. It was already provisioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And could you comment a little bit on what you expect on the other liabilities, the pending liabilities that you have with the Brazilian government and also the potential increase in royalties?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's all under discussion and also it's in terms of the royalty increase, it will depend on the new mining code objectives about to be released, but so far we have no news about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Ivan Fadel from Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, everyone. My first question would be related to the base metal side. I see you reported copper and nickel volumes much below what I believe is its full potential due to anticipated maintenance for a few units and also Cliff's stoppage. Can we assume that Vale's copper and nickel volume should accelerate to more normalized levels already in the third quarter and, along with that, should we expect also more dilution of cash costs due to more volumes and due to the absence of the effects of the maintenance cost? That would be my first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question, just as a follow-up on the taxation issue, so I understood that Vale is already paying that R$5.8 billion of tax liabilities or provisions. Was that the final decision from the judgment, so no appealing was actually possible? Was it something that Vale came into terms with the other party so you would settle the dispute? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Tito speaking. Regarding the first question, basically, we have finished the rebuild of the second furnace in Sudbury, which means that we are back to the full production. As you asked, of course, you can assume that on the second half of the year, we'll be producing the 100% in all operations and, of course, we have some of the impact that we saw in the second quarter are related to pre-operating costs of On&#xE7;a Puma and New Caledonia.</p>
          <p>So, of course production in On&#xE7;a Puma is also growing and, as Murilo said when he spoke, New Caledonia is still under a rebuild of the columns. But, in general, the regular production will be in full capacity. We've finished with the shutdowns, the summertime shutdowns, and we are also expecting to see more production coming on strong from On&#xE7;a Puma.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in terms of the fact, this is something that we still going on with these discussions, and it involves all the exporters, not only Vale. But, we just want the ability of not paying anymore. So, we have to pay but will continue with the discussions. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Marcos Assump&#xE7;&#xE3;o from Ita&#xFA; BBA. Excuse me. Mr. Marcos Assump&#xE7;&#xE3;o's line has just dropped. Our next question comes from Mr. Rodolfo de Angele from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, everyone. I have two questions. The first of them is on one-off items, on the operating side it seems both volumes and pricing were lower than what they could potentially be. And so, my question to you what's really the effect of this one-off that skewed the range in this quarter, you know, if could shed some light on what to expect in the next quarters?</p>
          <p>In the same lines on the one-offs, would also like you to comment on the operating expenses. There were some pre-operating expenses from New Caledonia, from On&#xE7;a Puma. So are we going to see more of those, and what do they refer to? And if you could also give us some guidelines there it would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good morning everybody, Marcus is speaking. Talking about prices, I don't know exactly what your assumption about price but, I will comment that there is &#x2013; the only factor that's a little bit different that you can see from past numbers was the carry over, because we have a very low performance in the first quarter, so many shipments were only loaded in the second quarter and our practice is to keep the same price. So, we lost some average price based on this point.</p>
          <p>We also have a little bit more moisture and a little bit slightly lower iron contents. So, when you look at our volume numbers, you are not able to see the moisture inside, that also how is iron units contents. So, these three factors drag a little bit on our average price.</p>
          <p>For the third quarter, we are not going to have this impact based on the carryover. We are not going to have any impact of the carryover because the price will be the same from the second quarter to the third quarter. So, even if some carryover exists there will no price impact.</p>
          <p>Moisture will be lower, because are now getting out of the rainy season, so we expect improvements, lower moisture. Now, this is a huge impact, because as you can see by the numbers we show during this quarter rain &#x2013; the first half of this year, the rain was almost twice as last year, so then the whole the part of this moisture go in the iron one and ship together with iron ore. And iron units we expect some improvement also because of, we have some mines with higher iron ore content that were below water. So, we cannot mine there, so then there is a small losses in iron units. So, putting everything together, I think from our perspective, the price were in line with our management's expectations, but for the market as we cannot see this factors in the volume we introduced, probably you have some difference in your calculations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. About the pre-operation expenses, we had about $200 million at pre-operating expenses regarding New Caledonia and On&#xE7;a Puma. Going forward, once this project starts to produce revenues, these expenses are transferred to the costs of goods sold, but other projects will come on stream, for example, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:05) and other projects. And then, these new projects will tend to have pre-operating expenses as well, so this is probably becoming a recurring effect because of our pipeline of projects. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perfect. And then, my second question on the cost side, it was in my opinion one of the best aspects of the results and I just wanted to ask you, what are the main initiatives that you have in place to deliver such a good performance on the cost side? And also, if there's anything there that's not sustainable in the medium to long term? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually our procurement side area, they tend to close contracts on a long-term basis. So, a lot of the costs that are incurring is due to contracts closed some time ago. So, this pro-activeness of our procurement side is one of the reasons that we can keep our costs under control. And also, in terms of FX rate, we know we have a great currency mismatch and we try to do some hedges in the future market, as you can see on the financial results, and we put part of our cash position in reais, our assets being a part of hedge for our costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me, our next question comes from Mr. Rodrigo Barros from Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for the call. I have two questions. The first one is on resource management, which of course it's a major trend for the sector and not only in terms of exploring mines abroad, but also in terms of companies. There are some news in recent days about the shipping industry in China asking for some protection regarding Vale's own fleet. So, my question is, if possible for Muilo, is in this very, how can I say, competitive and with the government trying to protect the national champions, what will be the strategy for Vale internationalization strategy?</p>
          <p>I mean, should Vale get more closer to the government, or should then use more locally, how to be able to expand it first internationally in the environment of protectionist? And my second question, if possible for Martins, it's regarding the new markets and China. We heard some of our contacts are saying that the Chinese because of the lower profitability, they are actually using lower grades because it's cheaper and also <mark type="indiscernible" /> (24:55) premium. So, if you can comment on this, too. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the relationship with the government, what I can tell you is that we must have a good relationship everywhere. I think that it's very important. You know that we are building a big plant in Canada, because the people from Newfoundland and Labrador requested strongly, regardless of having some surplus in terms of capacity in Manitoba and Ontario.</p>
          <p>We must understand that, and we must have a good dialog with everybody, with the governments, with the communities and everywhere. It's for mining industry, in case of not following this procedure, we'd be in risk for our future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the issue of China is concerned, I would like to say that it's true. The Chinese steel industry, they move very fast from one practice to the other. That is, they look the market regularly, so they see the price of lower quality ore going down, so they move rapidly to this kind of ore. But as they do that, things change again. So, I think it's the market movement that always happens in the Chinese steel industry.</p>
          <p>As a matter of fact, if you look, the price of iron units in the first quarter was $5.71 and it dropped to $5.23 in the second quarter. So, I think that movement was there for a period of time. Nowadays, the price of iron unit is around $5, so some additional adjustment in iron units. That means that really the customers are looking for cheaper ore. At this point, we are very comfortable, because if you have a high-quality iron ore, it's easier to downgrade if you need. So we are in a very good position, because if the market moves to lower-grade ore, we can move to lower grade ore if it was need. But for the time being, with shipping everything we need and everything we produce and we are not seeing any problems in shipping our high-quality iron ore or lower-quality iron ore. The market is very favorable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Carlos De Alba from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning, gentlemen. Two questions. First one is, do you see we could go back into the iron ore price Martins was mentioning, if we looked at the flat index, it should be flat, the third quarter prices versus the second quarter prices. And, given that you had those two issues with moisture iron ore content and the carryover in Q2, would Vale have slightly higher prices into the third quarter than versus the second quarter because you won't have these issues and because of the index prices were flat? That's the first one.</p>
          <p>And the second question, maybe for Murilo is, I would like to explore a little bit the idea that of why Vale must regain shares of iron ore sales in Brazil by investing in steel. If the iron ore market is truly tight for the next three to five years, and with the freight rates having come down as much as they have, and with Vale increasing their fleet of vessels, I don't think Vale is any meaningfully less competitive nation than Australia, so if you could explain to me why investing in steel is so important? Do you make more money selling iron ore in Brazil than you do when you sell it to Asia, so that it really improves your returns? I really appreciate that. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, as far as price is concerned, we are working with the possibility for the price to be the same in the third quarter. Okay. We have &#x2013; the new formula price have several components in it. One is the IODEX price, the iron ore price in the spot market in China, 62% content. The second component is the price of the VIU, the iron units content, that is going down slightly from $5.20 to $5. And other the component is the freight that we deduct from the IODEX plus VIU. So, today looking the situation, how &#x2013; we have already two months in this quarter, the indication is for the price to stay in the range of the 5% bundle. So, there will not be probably change in the price, not up or down.</p>
          <p>For the point you raise about why to make steel in Brazil in order to keep iron ore, we needed to look at very long-term. We are not talking about the next two or three years, but to build a steel mill takes five years to build and also there is, as everybody knows, in the states we mine, people want to have more than only a mining company there. So, and in some extent, if you are not able to do something somebody can do, so &#x2013; and the same argument that can be done for miners can be done by steel makers, how are not steel makers coming to Brazil <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:55) look, if you give me a mine, I give you a steel mill. So, the steelmakers are also investing heavily in mines, so we needed to look at all of those factors to take our decision.</p>
          <p>So, I think it's a very strategic issue. We cannot look only on our opportunistic base. Now, <mark type="ph" /> this is only, (32:15) if we can stay here and everybody will come to buy our iron ore. So, that's the situation today, but you never know long-term, a lot could happen. Vale always has some kinds of participation in the steel industry, okay, we are involved with CSD, we are involved with Minas, we have a lot of initiatives in this into making the best, so it's part of our long-term strategy to have some kind of involvement.</p>
          <p>Sometimes we need it to be stronger on this, sometimes we don't need it to be so strong, but, we needed to look all the situation and all the facts, and we hope that we are taking best decision for our shareholders, looking long term. So, this is a very long-term business. Mining is not a business that you go into and get out whenever you want, so you have to have a portfolio of businesses that can give you sustainability in the long term. I don't know if Murilo is ready to add something on it, but that's the way I see it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Martins, for sure you are right, I think that we can add just two elements, the first one is that we can discuss the largest shareholders as we will do in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:45), but there is a provisions to reduce from 50% to 20%, then it's you want us to have a stake in order to preserve the captives markets for our IOR, then in a long run, you stay as minority in these steel plants. And the second point that, just to say that as far as these communities, they are not happy with the big picture that you're seeing at Brazil. Now you don't have the steel producers in Brazil, they are not doing any investment in steel.</p>
          <p>We are trying to be a mining company. And I think that we have and that we will see some growth in Brazil and the perspective of Brazil is gorgeous and I think of that just as business, we think of that as Martins said in the past, we did a good money with our stake in CSP for instance, on <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:53). It was a good view and having the investment and later on to sell, but again, we wanted to have the minority stake and we believe that with the lack of investment in steel, can see good opportunities in the future. But we are a mining company. Again, we are focused in iron ore, nickel, copper, coal and fertilizer. But we need to understand we are not able to increase from 100 million tons in Caraj&#xE1;s to 230 million tons in the case of not understanding what the community is demanding.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thank you very much for the call. My first question is for you, Martins, as well regarding the iron ore supply-demand balance in China and also the possibility of imports in the second semester rising. If we look at the levels of crude steel production in China, they've been very strong, and if we look at the level of imports in the first semester, they've been kind of a bit more subdued. So, my question is we've been hearing many observers talk about very aggressive destocking cycle happening at the Chinese steel mills, so I just wanted to see if you have also observed the same thing. If you think there will be a very significant restocking effect in the second semester plan that would be important for us. And also, if you see iron ore imports rising in the second semester? That's the first part of the question.</p>
          <p>The second one is regarding China's now drive to create their own domestic iron ore pricing index, if you see the system changing or this initiative from China changing any type of the way the quarterly pricing system is working? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>The second one is regarding the mining regulatory framework in Brazil. Maybe rephrasing everything that we have heard so far from the call and the questions, how has Vale role been in the negotiations? I mean, has Vale been involved in any type of consultation regarding the taxation? I mean, is Vale in discussions currently with the government regarding better outcomes? Do you prefer a royalty or would you prefer a special participation tax? So, this is my second question regarding the mining regulatory framework in Brazil. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Martins is speaking. I'll address the first question. I'll let probably to Murilo to answer the second one. So, as far as the first question, I do not see big change of China market to going forward with a view of new pricing system because when you look at the spot price, you don't see big changes. So, this is a good meaning about the balance between supply and demand, okay, because the price is stable. So, we do not see the same volatility we are used to see formerly.</p>
          <p>So, that means that either supply or demand is not changing too much. I see a stable situation in the third quarter and there is a possibility for some increase in the last quarter. This is normally what happens in the Chinese market, because people try to get a little bit more ore to face the winter season mainly because of the mass production is lower in the winter season in China. But we do not see big changes in the market in this second half. I believe that we are going to be almost in the same level as it was in the first half. Second point, I want, Murilo, do you want to talk about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, for sure. We believe that we could see a proposal going to the Congress, the Brazilian Congress at the last quarter of the year. We didn't receive our first draft of the proposal yet. And it's very important to have a clear legislation in order to avoid misunderstanding. One thing I can tell you, I have opportunity to share some views with our President, Dilma Rousseff, and she understands that we must have the same competitiveness, to have the competitiveness in Brazil regarding other countries.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Hi, folks. My question pertains to your iron ore price realization. I want to make sure I understand clearly. I thought, Guilherme, you may have mentioned and you're saying that third quarter price realization will be plus or minus 5% versus second quarter. And I want to make sure I heard you clearly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have the bands, if the price &#x2013; the average prices stay between more or less 5%, the prices stay as it is, okay. So, that what I said. Looking at this system, most probably is that the prices stay the same as it was in the second quarter. So, our &#x2013; the hyper-mobility is not have any change in the price according to the average optional.</p>

          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Rene Kleyweg from UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen, or afternoon. And so, I'm just following returning on a couple of points. One, could you just quantify the change in the moisture content and the volumes that were carried over and just the rough indication of the change in average grade? And then secondly, in terms of the raw material purchases from third parties, we actually saw a 10% increase in the volumes purchased on fines and a 50% increase in the purchase of pellets, but the total cost of third-party purchases coming down, could you just explain the pricing dynamics for those local purchases and why they're so different from the international pricing environment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as moisture and idle units content, as I told you before there was a slight reduction in the idle units content, we are 0.2% lower and the moisture, on average was 1.5% higher. So, that is a drag on the &#x2013; because we only want the dry ore not the wet ore, and the information we deliver with the numbers of production and sales is based on the wet basis, okay, not the dry basis.</p>
          <p>But the biggest part of the drag in price was caused by the carryover because in the first quarter of last year -- of this year, we lost near 8 million tons production and all of those ships that would be carrying this volume had already arrived in Brazil. So, then there were loaded only during April and then we had to on the former price. So, the carryover was the main drag on our price, the moisture and iron units have much minor impact on price realization.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my call, my question. I just wanted to get back on the tax issue on the payment that you made of $3.8 billion. I just wanted to know, does this mean that your realized tax rate going forwards will increase? And if so, could you please quantify that as well? I mean, where should we expect your tax rate to be over next quarter, should we assume that different levels, the sustainable level for the future? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And my second question is really, to Indian iron ore supply. I mean, we continue to hear of supply constraints out of India, I just wanted to hear your views on the potential impacts derived from Indian supply in the short term, I mean over the second half I mean kind of talk remains relative limited and just wanted to hear your views on that matter. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. No, the payment that we made will not change our tax rate, just the payment of social contribution. So, going forward, this is the 9% that is regularly take and it should look not on the effective tax rate not on a quarterly basis, you should look at the semester. So you'll see more stable effected tax rate if you look at the semester income tax, okay?</p>
          <p>And as far as Indian ore is concerned, it's clear that India is reducing their exports on iron ore because their steel production is growing and they are using more and more locally. So, I believe it that the impact of India in the iron ore market will reduce as time goes by and probably this year against last year they are going to down something around the 20%, 25%. And now it's time of monsoon in India, so now it's time that production always reduces, but on top of it, you have a lot of restrictions that are being adopted by the Indian government in order to keep the ore internally. So, I think and that's very important because India makes lot of this low-grade iron ore that's mainly used in China.</p>
          <p>So, what is going on is that lower, the lower, the Indian ore goes to China, then more is there local production, so Indian ore mainly competes with the local ore and I think for the time being we have a balance what is being reduced by the India ore to China, it's been increased by local production and some newcomers that are coming to the market. So, at the end when you sum up everything, the impact is almost neutral. And so, I think this situation will continue next year with more newcomers probably a little bit more of local ore, but a lower Indian ore also going to China.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. I want go back to the realized prices for iron ore again, and I'm just collecting the answers from a few of the other questions that have been asked. If your moisture content does recover that 1.5% in the current quarter, that there's maybe $2 a ton there, and if you're average iron ore growth goes up say 0.2, say another $1 a ton, so that's about $3 a ton, because that carryover tonnage issue won't be there for the current Q3, there's maybe another $4 a ton compared to average realized prices in Q2. So, should we reasonably be looking for an improvement of something like about $7 a ton, for a realized price in Q3 versus Q2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a reasonable calculation, I would say so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And just a final question, can you tell us in Q2, what percentage of your sales were lump ore or compare to volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not a big producer of lumps, okay, our volumes of lumps is between 5% and 10%. So, it's not a big volume, we produce more pellets. And I think if that was a question that was asked before and I forget to address. The lump market is a little bit more &#x2013; there is a good supply of lump ore and competitors are really reducing their premiums on lump ore and this really does not affect us because we are not a big producer of lump. But on the other hand it creates market that can completely does on the high end, which is pellets. For some of our pellet customers can use a little bit more of lumps and that could put pressure on the pellets premium, I am sure that today there is some pressure on the pellets premium because of this high, better availability of lump ore. But we are not a big lump ore producer.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, gentlemen. First question is regarding to iron ore volumes. IF you could comment a little bit the performance in July given the end of the production constrains and also if you maintained 2011 volumes of nearly 310 million tonnes?</p>
          <p>And my second question is to Murilo if you could comment a little bit on copper, your views on copper prices given the potential supply constrains that we're seeing in the market right now? And also, if you are going to continue to peruse a mix of organic and M&amp;A growth to increase the exposure to this metal? And if you can comment where would be the best location and where do you see the biggest opportunities to develop new Greenfield projects on the metal? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay I'll answer on the first question. Really July has been a very good month. We have the end of the rainy season, it's over, so we'll probably have one of the best months of our history and so with that we will continue to maintain our forecast for the year of 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Marcos, thank you for your question. You are right about the copper price but, unfortunately, my crystal ball is broken. But I think that next year the price can be above $10,000. Regarding the organic M&amp;A, I think that M&amp;A is an opportunist issue, but you are always looking for some opportunities. But anyway, we have a good portfolio, good projects to be implemented in the next coming years. Regarding the location, I think that Latin America, Africa, Indonesia, I think that we can see good opportunities in terms of copper coming from there.</p>
