        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thank you, Giovanni. Good morning, everyone. So you guys saw in the press release this morning, another solid quarter; 6% organic sales growth and orders generally in line with expectations despite an uneven macroeconomic environment. Earnings per share were $1.47 in the quarter and that's up 13%, and free cash flow was robust at 132% of net income.</p>
          <p>There's a lot of uncertainty and things to worry about in the world economy, and things like continued high unemployment in the U.S. and Europe, a weak U.S. housing sector, the banking crisis in Europe and the political impasse in D.C. to name just a few. But importantly, order rates across most of our businesses remain generally in line with our expectation for the year, sustained by continued strength in emerging markets and a resilient commercial Aerospace aftermarket. The developed economies have certainly slowed a bit over the past few months and commercial construction markets remain particularly weak in the U.S. and Europe. But the economies in China, India, and Brazil, while slowing slightly, are still delivering growth rates well above developed economies.</p>
          <p>Also, airline traffic continues to hold up and capacity discipline is expected to result in another profitable year for the airlines. In addition, Boeing and Airbus, holding large backlogs, have both announced increases in their build rates buoyed by emerging market demand and replacement of older, less fuel-efficient fleets. So uncertainty, clearly, but we've operated in this kind of uneven and uncertain economic environment before and we know how to respond.</p>
          <p>With the slower macro growth outlook, we're taking preemptive steps to position the business to grow earnings next year by taking out even more costs as we &#x2013; even as we continue to invest in growth areas and in bringing new technologies to market. So we're increasing our restructuring estimate this year from $200 million previously to $300 million plus, while keeping to our commitment of restructuring equal to one-time items for the year.</p>
          <p>We still see sales for this year around $58 billion, that's up around 7% from 2010 and with better than expected third quarter results and only one quarter to go, we're once again increasing our EPS guidance. We now expect 2011 EPS to be up 15% to $5.47 a share, that's up from our previous guidance of $5.35 to $5.45. The higher EPS outlook reflects benefits from lower interest costs, lower taxes, and higher profits at Sikorsky partially offset by lower profit expectations at Fire &amp; Security and around $0.05 of deal costs relating to the pending Goodrich acquisition.</p>
          <p>On Slide 2 now, turning to third quarter results, as I mentioned sales grew organically at 6%. Carrier had another strong quarter with 9% organic growth driven largely by continued strength in the Transicold business and growth in emerging markets. And Sikorski grew 21% organically with higher aftermarket sales and more military aircraft shipments.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share were $1.47, that's up 13%. Restructuring expenses of $0.06 in the quarter were partially offset by $0.04 of net positive one-time items. In comparison restructuring and one-time items in last year's third quarter was a charge of $0.09. So excluding restructuring and one-time items in both third quarters, earnings per share increased this year by 7%. Lastly FX was a benefit of about $0.04 in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now just the usual reminder that we're going to talk to our segment results, excluding restructuring and one-time items, and on that basis, the segment operating margins of 16.3% in the quarter was 10 basis points lower than last year. This benefit is from cost reduction and operating leverage from higher sales across the businesses were more than offset by higher E&amp;D investments. E&amp;D was higher by $62 million versus last year's third quarter. All of that increase was Pratt &amp; Whitney as they continue to develop four separate gear turbo fan platforms.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, free cash flow in the quarter was 132% of net income. That's great performance even as we contributed $156 million in cash to our domestic pension plans. In addition, we also contributed $450 million of stock to the plans this past quarter. Even at the current low interest rates, our domestic pension plans are now nearly 90% funded, and we don't see the need to make additional contributions to our domestic pension plans through at least the end of next year. With year-to-date free cash flow at 109% of net income, we now expect free cash flow for the full year to exceed net income.</p>
          <p>We spent $675 million on share repurchase in the quarter, and this concludes our share buy-back for the year with a total spend at $2.2 billion. You'll recall that we decided to suspend share buy-back for the next 12 months as a result of the Goodrich transaction.</p>
          <p>Okay. Slide 3. As you can see from these order trends, order trends are generally in line with expectations with the exception of some weakness at Fire &amp; Security. Commercial Aerospace aftermarket remains solid with Pratt &amp; Whitney's large commercial engine spare orders up 3% for the quarter, and that's on top of 35% growth in last year's third quarter.</p>
          <p>Hamilton Sunstrand commercial spares orders were up 24%. That's after 13% growth last year. Carrier's U.S. residential HVAC orders increased mid single digits in the quarter. However, we did see a shift in consumer buying patterns with more and more customers opting for lower-featured, lower-efficiency products. At Otis, new equipment orders were up 12% at constant currency, driven by emerging market growth, and we continue to see strong growth in the emerging markets with the combined BRIC orders for the commercial businesses up a strong 23% this quarter.</p>
          <p>So despite a slowing world economy, we saw another good quarter with strong organic sales growth, solid earnings growth and robust cash flows, all while we continue to invest in these game-changing technologies. I'll come back in a minute to talk about the remainder of '11 and our outlook for 2012.</p>
          <p>But for now, let me turn it over to Akhil to take you through the business unit in detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Greg. Turning to Page 4. At Otis, both sales and profits in the third quarter grew by 12% with operating margin of 23.7%, in line with the prior year. Foreign currency accounted for approximately eight points of profit growth and seven points of sales growth. New equipment sales in the quarter were up 9% at constant currency led by strong growth in China and Russia. Service sales were also up, with continued growth in contractual maintenance and repair.</p>
          <p>The positive impact in operating profit from higher sales volume and some real estate gains was partially offset by new equipment pricing and commodity headwind. As Greg said, new equipment orders increased 12% at constant currency with continued strong growth in emerging markets, led by China. Their orders were up over 30%. Orders in North America were flat and were down low single digit in Europe. Otis closed the quarter with a strong new equipment backlog, up 9% versus prior year at constant currency. We remain confident in full year profit growth of about $225 million at Otis on high single digit sales growth.</p>
          <p>On Slide 5, Carrier profits increased 13% on 8% higher sales. Organic sales growth was 9%. As expected, Transicold's first half organic growth rate of about 50% has moderated to high teens. Similar to the second quarter, North America residential shipments were mixed with split system units up mid-teens, and gas furnaces down mid single digit. Profit growth was driven by solid conversion on volume and continued good performance in our joint ventures, partially offset by commodity headwind.</p>
          <p>Carrier posted a record Q3 operating margin of 12.7% even as we saw a significant movement in the U.S. residential business towards low-margin, entry-level units. Carrier remains on track with our prior guidance of profit growth of about $325 million on 10% organic sales growth.</p>
          <p>UTC Fire &amp; Security delivered profit growth of 8% in the quarter on 5% higher sales. Organic sales were up 2%. Product businesses were up high single digit, and service and install businesses were down low single digit due to continuing softness in the U.K. and Americas businesses. Third quarter orders were flat year over year organically. Backlog continues to be strong and is up approximately 15% organically both year over year and from the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>Operating profit in the quarter grew 3% at constant currency. Benefits from higher overall volumes and a favorable litigation resolution were partially offset by continuing productivity challenges and a very soft market in the U.K. With the slowdown in the order rates and continuing productivity issues, we now expect full year sales at Fire &amp; Security to be up mid single digits on 3% organic growth and operating profit to be up approximately $100 million instead of $150 million.</p>
          <p>Turning to Aerospace on Slide 7. At Pratt &amp; Whitney, sales were up slightly from the third quarter last year. Sales from higher aftermarket and increased large commercial engine deliveries were partially offset as expected by fewer military engine deliveries, lower Rocketdyne and Power System sales, and unfavorable currency at Pratt Canada. Large commercial engine spare sales were up about 10%.</p>
          <p>Operating profit in the quarter was down 11%. The benefits from net higher sales were more than offset by high E&amp;D and unfavorable currency at Pratt Canada. Restructuring savings offset higher pension costs. Excluding E&amp;D, operating margin was about flat. We continue to expect Pratt's full-year operating profit to be down around $100 million as we continue to invest in next generation product platforms.</p>
          <p>Hamilton Sunstrand posted another solid quarter with profit growth of 11% on 8% higher sales. Sales growth continues to be led by the aerospace, aftermarket and industrials businesses. Notably, commercial spares were up more than 30% versus last year. Areo OEM sales were flattish as commercial aero growth was offset by lower space and defense volumes.</p>
          <p>Profit growth in the quarter reflects the benefit of higher aftermarket and industrial sales and lower E&amp;D, partially offset by lower military vehicle sales and higher new program warranty costs. Operating margin was up 60 basis points year-over-year to 18.7%. As Greg said, commercial space orders increased 24% year-over-year with book to bill slightly above 1. Industrial orders were up about 10% at constant currency. Based on Hamilton Sunstrand's strong year-to-date performance, we now expect operating profit for the full year to be up more than $100 million on high single digit sales growth.</p>
          <p>Turning to Sikorski on Slide 9. Operating profit increased 34% on 21% higher sales. During the quarter, Sikorski shipped a total of 73 large aircraft, nine more than the third quarter of 2010. 66 aircraft were based on military platforms and seven commercial. There were no deliveries of Canadian maritime helicopters in the third quarter. The contract requirement is for four additional aircraft in the fourth quarter, but customer discussions indicate that need may be only for two or three more. Sales growth in the quarter was driven by higher international military aircraft deliveries and increased aftermarket volumes.</p>
          <p>Solid conversion on net higher sales resulted in margin expansion of 110 basis points to 12.1%. Of note during the quarter, Sikorski delivered three S-70 I aircraft to it's launch customer in the Middle East. These deliveries mark the first for Sikorski's international variant of the BLACK HAWK. For the full year at Sikorski, we now expect profit growth of approximately $125 million on sales growth of high single digits.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to Greg for wrap-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Akhil. So it was another good quarter, strong organic sales growth, earnings growth, and cash flow, all of that in the face of a slowing world-wide economy. We're very confident in our increased EPS guidance of $5.47 on $58 billion of sales for the year. That's up 15% earnings on 7% sales growth. That's the kind of performance you've come to expect from UTC.</p>
          <p>As you know, we've announced some transformational news, recently. First of all, of course, the largest acquisition in our history, in fact one of the largest Aerospace acquisitions ever, Goodrich Corporation. It's a strategic transition that will boost UTC's position in the Aerospace system sector and will generate significant customer and shareowner value. As you know, Goodrich products are complementary to UTC's and our combined technologies will provide more intelligent, more electric, and integrated products that customers are increasingly looking for. Also, Goodrich has a stable and strong aftermarket with higher content on newer platforms similar to Hamilton Sunstrand. We're bringing together two great companies. As we said earlier, we expect this deal to close in mid 2012 and we would expect it will be accretive to EPS in 2013.</p>
          <p>Last week, I'm sure you all saw, we also announced agreements with Rolls Royce to acquire their share in the IAE joint venture as well as to partner on future engines for mid-sized aircraft, most significantly utilizing geared turbo fan technologies. When this transaction closes, we'll likely consolidate IAE which will results in incremental sales at Pratt &amp; Whitney in 2013 of over $1.5 billion representing the remaining two-thirds of IAE. We also expect an operating profit benefit in 2013 of $75 million to $100 million which is largely Rolls Royce's 1/3 share of IAE's profits partially offset by the amortization of intangibles. This deal will also streamline support for the A-320 family of engines, enable a smoother transition of V-2500s to the GTF platform and provide significant long term benefits to Pratt &amp; Whitney's aftermarket business from the increasing installed base.</p>
          <p>The new partnership agreement with Rolls Royce is further validation of the game-changing GTF technologies. In the meantime, the GTF development programs at Pratt remain on track, meeting all of the key milestones and performance benefits, on fuel efficiency, noise, and emissions.</p>
          <p>Also, you probably saw, we announced two key organizational changes. These changes will allow us to continue to drive growth and margin expansion on both the aerospace and commercial side of the business. Our seasoned management team will build on the same agenda that made us successful, portfolio transformation, offering integrated systems and solution to our customers, and continued cost reduction.</p>
          <p>So we talked about our increased guidance this year and some transformational news, but I'm sure what most of you are interested in, of course, is what about 2012? So let's look at 2012. This is on now Slide 11. As always, a lot of puts and takes at this time of the year. The outlook for some of our end markets certainly feels weaker today than just a few weeks back. And we're certainly looking at tighter DOD budgets, although longer term we will benefit from being on the right platforms such as the JSF, the 53K and the BLACK HAWK programs. And international military markets still offer significant opportunities despite the DOD budget cuts.</p>
          <p>Yields on ten-year corporates have come down, of course that puts pressure on our pension expense. At a discount rate of 5% we'll see around $0.15 of head wind next year. Not much we can do about interest rates, but we have done the tough things in sun-setting the U.S. pension plan. So in a little time and a small rise in interest rates, this problem is going to go away; it'll be in the rear-view mirror.</p>
          <p>And we've talked in the past about E&amp;D at Pratt peaking in 2012. That will be a headwind for us next year. Again, more detail on that in December. Also assuming a mid-2012 close, the Goodrich transaction will be dilutive to earnings next year by about $0.30 to $0.40 from financing and other deal costs, accounting conformity, amortization of intangibles and restructuring costs. Of course we expect this deal to be solidly accretive in 2013 and beyond as we start to realize the synergies and get some of the one-time costs behind us.</p>
          <p>On FX, that remains a big unknown. Just within the past few weeks, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against most currencies. The euro, as you know, went from $1.45 in late August to $1.32 in early October and now it's back at $1.38. Given this volatility, we'll make a call on FX rates for 2012 once we get closer to our outlook meeting in December. And of course you all know the impact FX can have on UTC earnings, both positive and negative, but really too early to make a call.</p>
          <p>Of course, we know how to operate in uncertain times. Our increasing restructuring in 2011 and this will generate additional savings in 2012 and our companies are better positioned than ever to grow earnings with a strong aftermarket, significant presence in emerging market and high content in the growing commercial aerospace segment. So in spite of all of the headwinds, the uncertain economic environment and the Goodrich-related dilution, we still expect earnings growth in 2012. As is our normal practice, Louis will provide detailed guidance on 2012 at the December 15 Investor Meeting in New York.</p>
          <p>So, solid results year to date and we're confident on delivering on our increased outlook of $5.47 a share, 15% earnings growth on 7% sales growth. We see a strong trend in emerging market orders even as developed markets have shown signs of weakness recently. We've stepped up our cost reduction efforts and continue to drive margin expansion, not just this year, but into 2012 and beyond. And as always, we're committed to grow earnings even in a difficult environment. We have a seasoned management team and we're focused on what we can control, that's cost and operational excellence.</p>
          <p>So with that, let's stop and open up the call for questions. Giovanni?</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And first on the line we have David Strauss with UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, you talked about ratcheting up restructuring this year. Can you give us a sense, any quantification of what kind of tail wind that would provide next year, not only the additional restructuring you're doing this year, but also the benefit of 2009/2010 restructuring?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So again, we're going to take up restructuring from $200 million to $300 million plus. We've got some good news coming on the tax line that we see &#x2013; we've got visibility to a gain on a disposition. So again, restructuring equals gains for the year. I think that's first and foremost. As I think about next year, we're going to see at least $200 million of tail wind from restructuring into 2011 &#x2013; I'm sorry, into 2012. We're going to do some additional restructuring at Sikorsky as we size the business for the &#x2013; what's happening in the marketplace. I think as you're always also looking along with Scott Buckhout at some additional reductions on the commercial side as they bring those two businesses together. So there's lots of things to do and some of that is actually going to be good short-term payback.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then as a follow up, again thinking about next year, I know FX is a moving target, but I think for Pratt Canada that should be locked in at this point. Can you talk about the headwind there? And then from a commodities standpoint, given the move in copper and steel, what kind of &#x2013; what kind of tail wind that could provide next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, this is Akhil. For Pratt Canada, you're right, most of it is locked in. We expect about $50 million headwind next year as the Canadian dollar was still stronger against the U.S. dollar versus what we had hedged before. On the commodities, we deliberately put it on a question mark column right now because the copper goes down to close to $3 and wants to start to go back up. We'll see how it all shakes out and Louis will give greater guidance, more detail in December.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's important to note, though, I mean commodities, we have seen pricing has stuck on the Carrier side. We have moved prices up on Otis as well in response to some of these commodities. So for the year, although it's still going to be a headwind of $150 million, I think we've got about, what, 50% of our copper locked in for next year already? So again I think as the prices that Carrier announced, they take effect October 1. Those stick. It shouldn't be a huge headwind.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And last one on the interest expense line, you had talked about first it was going to be relatively flat, then $50 million lower. It looks like it's going to be a lot lower now than in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it is, David. And some of it is, if you recall, we talked about having an issuance of about $1.5 billion early fourth quarter. And now we're moving that out because we have cut back our share buy-back, our cash flow is coming in stronger than we expected. So that's all good news, and that's what we're reflecting in this increased guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Thanks a lot.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, just first on Goodrich, Greg, can you give us a little more granularity on the $0.30 to $0.40? I certainly applaud you for taking it all in and not ignoring it, if you will. But how much of it is actually kind of deal-type noise versus kind of true kind of economic restructuring?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, let me try and give you the thesis here as best that we can do it today. I just want to stress here that we are still &#x2013; these are preliminary numbers because there are some big moving pieces like on the accounting conformity side, but you're going to pick up about a half a year of Goodrich earnings assuming a late June close. Then you've got about $200 million of actual deal costs, and that includes the integration teams. So that's a cost &#x2013; most of that goes away in year two. You're probably down to $25 million or so of discontinuing integration teams. You've also got interest on the new debt which is about $200 million. I think they've got about $70 million of interest on their old debt.</p>
          <p>Accounting conformity, we're guessing on a full-year basis that will be about $300 million in the first year, so a half a year is $150 million, but again, remember, excess over averages is going to go away down there. The pre-production E&amp;D is going to go away. We still need to work through the details, but let's say that's $150. Intangible amortization is about $300 million. $200 million of that's for inventory write-up, write up their inventory, amortize over inventory turns, so that happens relatively quickly. Then there's the customer intangibles, another $100 million of that gets spread out over the next, I don't know, 10 or 15 years.</p>
          <p>Then, of course, you've got the equity issuance. We have assumed in the math you're going to do a $4 billion equity issuance, about 50 million shares. That costs about $0.15. So those are all the pieces. I think by the time we get to December with Louis we'll have a little better feel for that. We'll have some of this stuff nailed down, the timing of the debt and all that, but that's kind of broadly where we are.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are there any substantial deal costs with closing the IAE deal? Will that deal be modestly accretive post closing? Or is it dilutive in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. it should be modestly, and I say modestly, accretive. The fact is we're not borrowing any money, we're not using any bankers, and I tell you, issuing debt and using bankers is very expensive. So we're not going to do that with the IAE transaction. We're going to use foreign cash, and we'll see just a little bit of good news at Pratt Whitney next year for, again, probably a mid-year close there and maybe just a penny or so of accretion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And finally from me and I'll pass it on. Could you just speak the China demand kind of stepped back, larger across all UTC? I mean obvious the Otis orders look pretty good. It sounds like HVAC is decent. Just the whole state of play there, kind of the tensions in the country on potential slowing demand versus the reality of the fact that there's still quite a bit of activity and how you see things playing out over, say, the next two to four quarters there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's interesting. We all read, of course, we saw that GDP slowed down all the way to 9.1% here. We haven't really seen &#x2013; I told the guys yesterday, we haven't seen a stop sign or even a yield sign in terms of the growth here. We're continuing to make very good traction. Otis orders are up like north of 30%. I think Carrier was almost 20% up. The only place where we have seen any sign of weakness was really at Fire &amp; Security and a little bit at our Sullair, which is the Hamilton Industrial business, that Compressor business, and those are really infrastructure projects where we've seen a little bit of slide to the right. But in terms of the commercial construction, the social housing and the effects of the urbanization trends, those all continue apace.</p>
          <p>So I feel very good really for the next year on China. And, look, it will no doubt slow down if the world economy slows down, but these macro trends that have existed for the last 10 years around urbanization continue. The West is still growing, if not on the East, and we're participating in all those markets.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen &amp; Co.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you, and good quarter. So maybe give us a little bit more color on Rolls. I mean, they talk of this deal adding US$220 million if converted. You talk of it adding, what was it, $80 million to $100 million in op profit. Maybe walk us through the pieces there. And is that number a full-year number? Is it before amortization? How much is amortization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Again, the deal here is a little bit complex, and it's &#x2013; unfortunately, the accounting makes it even more so. But if you think about this, Cai, we paid $1.5 billion for the collaboration rights associated with Pratt's &#x2013; or I'm sorry, with Rolls' investment in IAE. So we get that 33%, and we're going to pay them $1.5 billion at close. The second piece of the deal is we're going to pay flight-hour payments over the next 15 years, and in return for those flight-hour payments we're going to get the intellectual property and the engine designs and the right to produce all of those parts that Rolls is currently producing. All of that gets hung up on the balance sheet as an intangible that will build up, and we'll amortize that over the life of the program. So we'll see, as I said, very modest next-year accretion of about a penny.</p>
          <p>The following year we get about $75 million to $100 million. Again, that's all-in after amortization, and it gets more and more accretive every year. And again, as you stop the engine deliveries on the V2500 in 2015, 2016, it becomes even more accretive because then all you have is an after market stream for the 30 years or so. So I think we're paid a fair price, but this is &#x2013; there's a great return on this and it's really just about monetizing what's going to be a great aftermarket stream on the V.</p>
          <p>Importantly I think, what really set this deal apart for us is Rolls Royce has validated the GTF technology. The fact is, the next mid-sized aircraft, whatever that will be, we're going to be in a partnership with Rolls and we're going to use the GTF as the baseline configuration. And that of course is a big turnaround from where we were just a few years ago. I think it's important, I think the IAE joint venture, our relationship with Rolls, has certainly morphed over time. It's much better today and I think this deal is just a further personification of that</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the benefits Cai, is the smooth transition as Greg mentioned. We're moving the customers from the classic 320s today to these NEOs. And I think that's been a big positive to this whole transaction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No clearly, with the growth in the aftermarket annuity, it's a great deal. But maybe help us understand roughly how much is the amortization likely to be on an annual basis? Is it straight line? Roughly how much is the cost of the OEM engines to Rolls? Those kind of questions, so we get a sense of the leverage in the out years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cai, I don't think we want to get into those details. It was a private transaction and I can probably help you a little bit more afterwards. But that's...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would tell you we're still, of course, working through all of this with regulatory authorities too, Cai. I think as we get closer to the deal close and everything is done, we'll have a better view of all of this. We still have to value all the intangibles. But you can think about, you know, we're going to be building that intangible over 15 years and amortizing it out. It'll build up. So you're not going to see straight-line amortization. But we'll &#x2013; we can get you those details as we get closer to the deal close.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the last one, you talked about kind of issuing 50 million shares. But really kind of going through your cash flow, it would look like you could get away with less, kind of, tell us, kind of, what's the range in terms of the size of the equity offering and kind of flexibility you have if the stock price is a little lower as it is today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's &#x2013; as part of this whole transaction with the rating agencies, we've modeled in a 25% equity issuance of some form, be that a straight equity issuance or be it some combination of mandatory converts or equity. The fact is we're not going to issue stock at $75 a share. That's significantly undervalued. It's why we didn't use stock in the pricing of the deal. We're going to be opportunistic about this in terms of when we issue the equity and how much equity and what form that takes.</p>
          <p>In terms of using foreign cash, clearly if we can bring cash back from overseas if we see a change in the tax law that makes it more efficient, it reduces the need for equity. And if you think about it, at the end of the deal, we're going to have debt to cap is going to move from 32% to call it 48%, all right. That was the ratio that we agreed to with the rating agencies. That's why I think Moody's reaffirmed our rating and why we continue to have the A1P1 on the commercial paper.</p>
          <p>Now if we bring cash back from overseas, it reduces the amount of debt. It'll also proportionately reduce the amount of equity so that we can keep it in line. It's not dollar for dollar, but it's just proportionate trying to keep that debt to equity. I think what's really important, though, is if the law changes and we are able to tap into that foreign cash, 60% of our cash is overseas, it allows us to do a lot more investing here in the U.S.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Greg, nice quarter. Join the chorus on that one. You're, on the Goodrich deal, obviously we recognize you're paying for technology, but also for people. Can you &#x2013; the concern, of course, is that people can walk out the door. Can you talk about how you're handling the potential loss of talent with Goodrich given this nine-month period of uncertainty where obviously Goodrich talent is susceptible to being poached. How are you and Goodrich management kind of help &#x2013; working together to kind of prevent that and keep people steady as she goes while we go through this kind of nine-month period of a question mark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a great question, Heidi. And I think it's something I know that Marshall Larsen and Elaine are working on. We're going to have, bring two great companies together, as I said. And we've got great people at both companies. And the key here is to retain the great people in those businesses. And I think, again, we're going to work &#x2013; I know Tom Bowler and our HR guys are working with their HR folks to make sure that we've got the right incentives in place so that we don't lose the talent. Elaine and Marshall are going through, identifying what the new organizational structure is going to look like. And the sooner we get this deal closed, the easier that it's going to be. And it's all really about the people. Great technology, but without the people it doesn't mean anything. They've got a performance culture. We've got a performance culture. We're going to merge the two of them together.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Heidi, the best example I give to this question is Greg Hayes himself. He came through an acquisition and look where he is at UTC. UTC offers great opportunities for people who perform.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But are you guys able to get in front of these guys and talk about retention guarantees or things that again, because obviously when we see large deals like that, one of the worst things that we've seen commonly happen is the poaching of kind of the best &#x2013; the best talent during that period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Heidi, all I can tell you is we think that UTC is a great place to work. And I think it's Elaine and Marshall's job in the coming months to make sure we convince the Goodrich folks and the Hamilton folks that there's a great future here. And look, it's always a risk, but it's certainly on the radar screen and we're working with the people. We're can't do very much, we just filed Hart-Scott-Rodino this past week, we're just doing the regulatory filings, but as much as we can, we're reaching out to people and making sure they know they're an important part of the future of these great businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you getting any color on whether this deal could potentially close sooner? Or can you make that case, that it helps make sure that you retain more of the company if you could close sooner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We just filed Hart-Scott. So we'll see in 30 days we'll hear back from Justice and then we've got the European and Asian filings to do. We're going to stick to the June closing timeframe here. Sooner is better. No doubt for many, many reasons, people being one of the big things. But we'll work through this as quickly as we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then one final question on it, and it's just a nit, but are there any terms and conditions in the deal concerning how Goodrich does, kind of better or worse during this period? Because, obviously, management had a high sense of how they were going to do. You've done your best due diligence, but if they don't do quite as well, is there any re-pricing potential?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, look, they're a public company. They've got shareowners they've got to satisfy. They've got a performance culture there as I said. They're going to make their numbers that they've committed to. We feel very confident in the forecast that they showed us both for this year and into next. They release earnings here in the coming week or so and I think it will probably be just about in line with what everybody expects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think I know the answer to this question, Greg, but one last final thought on my part. The C Series has obviously &#x2013; we see what's happening in the news there. Can you talk about what this means in terms of any additional headwind this might portend for GTF on the NEO? Does R&amp;D change on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, Heidi, were you talking about the C Series in terms of the schedule or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just in terms of &#x2013; there may be a question at to its future, obviously. But I think that there was some leveraging that you were expecting to happen on what you were doing on C Series that translates to NEO and that may not necessarily be intact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, they are different engines although they have the same essential core. It's just scaled up from the C Series to the NEO. But that's really the extent of the synergies in terms of the testing and in terms of the design. We think the C Series is still going to be successful. We haven't seen a lot of orders recently, but we still think long term this is going to be a great airplane in its niche, which is 105 to 130 seats. It's fuel efficient. It's got great technology. And it's going to be successful. And, really, look, it's going to be out there. We're on time with the &#x2013; with the engine. We expect to, I think, have it certified by the end of next year for entry to service in 2013 still. So we're still going full speed ahead.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Shannon. I think the truck-trailer side has seen reduction in orders, which is not surprising. Some of the large fleets in the U.S. booked big orders early in the year and have now slowed down. So we've seen significant reduction in the North American truck trailer orders on a year-over-year basis, although year-to-date is still very strong. Europe truck trailers is slightly down year-over-year as well. Although containers continue to remain very strong and we're almost 2X what the orders were last year in the third quarter. Now compares there are likely to get tougher in Q4, but so far, so good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then maybe a little bit more about what's going on at Fire &amp; Security and also what you hope to accomplish with the consolidation of Fire &amp; Security and Carrier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The combo with Carrier and Fire &amp; Security is going to create an $18 billion business.  It's going to be headed up by Geraud. And I think the key for that combination was really this focus on building controls. You guys will recall the IBS integrated building system strategy that Louis has been talking about for a couple of years. This is really the end game of that strategy and how it's going to play out. We've created a controls business under Mark Barry, I believe, at, what are we calling it, climate controls and securities systems, CCSS. And I think that the controls is the linchpin to this whole thing.</p>
          <p>At the same time we're going to run the playbook that we've run at Carrier for the last three years. There's going to be portfolio transformation opportunities. There's going to be cost synergies. And it's going to be a great business on a consolidated basis. Two very good businesses and put them together. Importantly we're still on track, I think, for the margin targets that Louis laid out. It was 12% for Carrier and 15% for F&amp;S. We're going to get there next year on a consolidated basis</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It looks like Carrier is running ahead and Fire &amp; Security behind. Is it fair to say the consolidated comes a little bit more from Carrier beating and Fire &amp; Security missing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think we have an opportunity next year for F&amp;S to get to a 15% on a standalone basis. Part of that was through portfolio rationalization. Part of it also is from recovery in some of our markets. If you think about the $15 million drop we've just taken in the guidance at F&amp;S, really the key there was our market in the U.K. I think that business is down earnings about $60 million year-over-year. We've seen some big market issues as the government in the U.K. has contracting spending. We've seen some margin and we've seen some productivity issues. That's really the problem. I think again, we'll get that issue behind us. Once we do that, and we focus on some of the portfolio transformation issues at F&amp;S in terms of calling out some of the under-performers, we still feel confident we can get to the 15% on F&amp;S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And final one, is transforming that portfolio going to be some additional divestitures or is there going to be an acquisition component to this given your desire to build more into the building automation side of things?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think yes to both sides. I think obviously there's an opportunities there to cull the portfolio at F&amp;S. Geraud team have just started working with Scott and his team on that. I think they've got some ideas already. We'll hear more about that in the coming months. But also, Mark Barry's Controls business is an opportunity for acquisition over the medium term here. So, again, I think it's both things we'll be doing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Greg, I was wondering if we could talk about the aerospace aftermarket, clearly, contrasting results on the orders between Sunstrand and Pratt. I was wondering if you could talk about what the underlying drivers are here and whether it is just comps on year-on-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, comps is a big thing. Pratt was up 35% last year in orders last year in the third quarter, up 3% this year. And Hamilton was up I think 13% last year, up 24% this year. If you dissect the Hamilton orders though, what you see is that the parts business, that ongoing recurring spare parts was up about 10%. So pretty &#x2013; not nearly the robust 24% that we talk about. It was really provisioning on 787 that drove the order growth at Hamilton. And again, this is the long-awaited payback for that big investment we made in the 787 and that's going to drive growth at Hamilton next year as well. This is really just the start of the provisioning cycle on the 787.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you expect the numbers between the two divisions to maybe converge going forward because they are so big at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, unfortunately I think the businesses are just fundamentally different. Hamilton is on every platform out there. And they obviously as you see the new aircraft come to market, they're going to see provisioning orders, they're going to see parts from every commercial aircraft out there.</p>
          <p>Pratt's a little bit more limited. I mean you'll see growth obviously from the V2500 fleet. You've got the 4000s out there. You've got some 2000s. But you would expect I think stronger growth in the aftermarket at Hamilton in the coming years as opposed to Pratt. We'll start to see again the V2500 pick up even more strongly now that we've got the Rolls Royce share and then the GTF at the end of this decade will pick up significantly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing to keep in mind is Pratt spares are also driven by the cycling time on the engines and when they come in for overhauls, I think that does drive the timing of the spares a little differently based on the profile of the engines coming in for repair work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the industrial side, Greg, it does look like some of your shorter cycle industries have weakened on the order front in the third quarter. Do you expect this deteriorating trend to continue into the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No actually, if you think about it, orders at the industrial businesses in the third quarter I think were up about 11% at constant currency. Sullair was up 8%. I think Sundyne was up strongly. Milton Roy was up nicely. So all of the businesses on the industrial side of Hamilton were good. On the commercial side of the business, I think you're going to see, again, fairly decent order trends from the emerging markets. The U.S. we're not seeing anything here, right, on the commercial construction side, Europe, nothing much on the commercial construction side in the Eurozone. We're are seeing strong growth of course from Russia, Poland and those markets, but Europe not much, but all kind of in line with what we expected for the year.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. To go back to something you talked about, Greg, earlier in terms of repositioning and a focus. You've done two large deals in a short order of time and you've hinted at some divestitures. Is this just going to be a different effort at reshaping United Technologies' portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>These deals, although they got announced within a couple of weeks ago, really have been in the works for well over a year. And I think Louis and the rest of the senior management team we've been looking at the entire portfolio here. This is really just a part of the overall strategy at UTC which we want to have the growth businesses in growth markets and I think we're positioning the company to be exactly that. And this portfolio analysis is not a one-time event, it's something that we're going to continue to do, continue to look at opportunities both on the acquisition and the divestiture side to better position UTC for long-term growth.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>Just two small items. One is can you talk a little bit about the Maritime patrol helicopter and what are the issues? I mean this has been an ongoing challenge to get it right. I mean frankly &#x2013; and then just one other item and if you can answer that is you had a small &#x2013; what is the size of the real estate gain at Otis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The real estate gain at Otis was how much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About $15 million, Howard, the real estate gains at Otis. So about a penny.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About a penny. As far as the CMHs look we have an agreement with the Canadian government to deliver six interim configuration aircraft this year. The final configuration aircraft will be delivered starting at the middle of next year. We've had some issues with some software glitches. We've had some other issues. But the helicopters are ready to be delivered. I think it's just a question of aligning the customer requirements right now. And I know Jeff and the team have been working with our friends on this for quite some time. And we have the helicopters being they're being built in Stratford. They're ready to ship. It's just a question of what the customer needs at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean I still don't understand what that means. I mean, are we going to see larger losses because of the further delays? And that's the good news is we're going to get them behind us this year and next year more profitability?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think in fact we lose $10 million, $12 million a copy on these helicopters. And that's not really changing in terms of the timing of the deliveries. You're still going to see headwind next year and into '13 as you deliver the remainder of the 28 helicopters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, gentlemen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Yeah, I just had a question on your commercial businesses. I mean you mentioned that in Carrier you'd seen some trading down. I just wondered more broadly, obviously, if the volume outlook in commercial, for low level, if it's managing to deteriorate further in developed economies? You mentioned pricing earlier, but if you see volumes weaken and you see a mix shift, are you worried that pricing generally, when you look at what your competitors are saying and doing, are you worried that pricing generally may start to moderate in the coming months as you see volumes soften and commodities have leveled out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To be clear, I don't think we expect to see volumes softening any more than they already are. If you think about Carrier's residential business here in the U.S., I think the total market for split systems is about 4.7. It's been kind of banging along the bottom there for the last two or three years. We haven't really seen any growth.</p>
          <p>At the same time, as commodities have increased I think we have seen some pricing traction. But the real issue there in the business is what is the consumer sentiment. Last year, we had stimulus-related benefits, rebates, that allowed customers to trade up to higher efficiency units. The stimulus is gone. Those tax credits are gone. So because of the consumer sentiment here in the U.S., consumers are only buying what they need to buy. And they're buying entry level, lower-featured products. And so if you think about the business in the U.S., I think we were up about 8% in the quarter in terms of units. But total sales were flat, because, again, you traded down. So now 75% of what we're selling is entry level SEER 13.</p>
          <p>So look, it's hard to imagine it's going to get any worse than this. There's still 93 or 94 million air conditioners out there in service today that have to be replaced. There's not much going on in the housing market. We don't expect growth in housing. At the same time, we've got a good position in terms of our cost, continue to take costs out of the business, continue to drive margins in that business. And when the market recovers, and it will, we're going to be well positioned to get great operating leverage there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And then if I'm comparing the new equipment orders organically for Otis and commercial HVAC, Otis has been out growing the HVAC orders for the last sort of six months or so. Do you think that's sustainable for any particular reason in terms of geographic weighting or new products or anything else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's really, it's all about China. You think about where Otis' position in China, they saw 30% orders growth rate there. Carrier saw about &#x2013; just under 20% growth in orders. And it's just, the market position that Otis has is just phenomenal. We've got about, just north of I think 22%, 23% market share. We go to market at four different price points in the China market. And they've got a very strong team in place in China. Carrier, good team, they've got good market position. But I think, again, just because of the weighting and the size of the Otis China business, it's going to drive higher growth there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One other factor, Julian, is that in China, orders benefit from social housing which is more of residential type of air conditioning. So like-for-like, while Otis benefits from the residential sort of social housing, Carrier does not. So I think that is a part of the difference as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. And then just one final one, you mentioned some of the restructuring going into Sikorsky. On the commercial side though, both Bell this morning and Eurocopter last month have sounded very positive about what's going on there. So could you just give an update on the different trends in Sikorsky?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think again, what we're seeing on the military side, BLACK HAWK production has probably peaked this year and it'll probably stay about flat into next year. Where we are seeing growth on the military is on the international side. I think we shipped three of the first three S-70is out of Mielec this quarter, in fact. On the commercial side, order trends have not been great. Right now, and again, we're transitioning from the S-76C++ to the S-76D. I think we'll have that aircraft certified mid year next year. We'd expect orders to pick up. But in the interim I think we'll be done delivering S-76s here at the end of the year. S-92 continues to sell well for the oil and gas fleet. And again I think it's &#x2013; it will be a good story, but it's not going to be a great high growth story for next year.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's early and we're not going to steal any thunder from December here, but just wondering if you could tie up all the changes to the 2012 puts and takes landscape and give us a sense whether you think 10% plus, excluding Goodrich and IAE is still a reasonable place to be thinking at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, look, we're targeting 10% earnings growth, Terry, for the businesses. I think again the two big question marks we have right now are really around FX and pension and what happens there. But the base businesses, I think, we're going to continue to push them to get towards 10%. We're doing the restructuring now. We're doing whatever we can to try and make sure that that happens. We've got these big kind of unknowns though around FX and what's going on in terms of the developed economies and the macro environment. I would tell you ex-Goodrich dilution next year, we're going to outperform the peers. We've taken the hard action, we've done what we needed to do on the pension side. We've right-sized the business. And so I think again, you'll be happy, I think, with the guidance that Louis provides in what's a very tough economic environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And then in terms of &#x2013; you made a comment &#x2013; we've talked a lot about different specifics. I just want to make sure we're clear on your earlier comment, that just in the last few weeks you've seen some incremental weakness in end markets. Are you talking about the truck markets? Can you just be clear with us in terms of which end markets you're really thinking of in that particular comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, I look at the Carrier and the residential business in the U.S. and we had a very strong start to the third quarter. I think July was good and then August things started to slow down, and even a little further in September. Truck/trailers is the same kind of phenomenon. There was a lot of early ordering and so we've seen orders pull back on the truck/trailer in the North American market. I think again, it's just as we're seeing consumer sentiment in the U.S. and in Europe, giving the banking crisis in Europe, consumers are pulling back and not spending.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just lastly on the DOD spending outlook for 2012, has anything changed with your thinking there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that it's all about as we had expected. I think we'll wait and see what the super committee comes up with here. We're hopeful that the folks in Washington are going to be able to come together and come up with a reasonable plan with the deficit and hold the defense spending in line. But the worst thing that could happen is stalemate, of course, of the super committee, because the DOD budget cuts would be huge. I don't think anybody wants that to happen. I don't think anybody is going to let that happen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And it sounded like you were a little more optimistic on the international sales, defense sales next year, or am I reading too much into that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's just a continuation of what Jeff's been talking about for the last couple of years. We positioned the business to have a great product offering, that's the BLACK HAWK, in a low-cost manufacturing location and it continues to get traction. There's orders out there from Turkey. There's orders out there for Singapore, for Saudi. I think there's lots of opportunities.</p>

          <p>Back to the Rolls agreement for a second. Does the relationship essentially between you two remain stale until there's actually a platform to pursue? Or is Rolls going to start to share in the core R&amp;D that you have ongoing for the next gen of the GTF?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think they'll continue to be a part of the IAE joint venture because they're going to continue to supply their share of the engine for some period of time until it transitions to us. In terms of investment in the next generation platform, we're both going to go down the path of making sure we've got the best possible technology when that platform becomes visible. We're going to be investing of course in the gear, they're going to be investing in other core parts of the engine. So when the thing does come together, we both have the latest and best technology to offer.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. And then on Sikorsky, the guidance of $25 million increase in EBIT, is that, from Akhil's comments it sounded like potentially a couple of the CHPs were shifting out. Is that essentially what's causing that? Or is it better performance as well? And I guess are you expecting the same number of CHPs or have that &#x2013; has that number slipped out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think, Myles, you're exactly right. It is the shifting of the two CMHP's, if you will. That's what we have taken into account in our forecast here. Their operating performance, even without that, it's pretty good as is. So I think they were tracking well towards delivering on the margin expansion and the growth in the profits that we were expecting. This shift will probably not impact 2012 as such. It may move to 2013 in terms of the deliveries that if &#x2013; that we miss if any this year.</p>

        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if you think about the $50 million drop, about half of that is actually from lower volumes. Orders are essentially flat here in Q3. We had expected, I think, a 5% or so organic growth for the year. We're not going to see that. So that's the biggest piece of this. You also got a little bit of bad news on FX versus our last look. And then you've got the U.K. issue. I say the productivity issue is not just U.K., it's really the field organization where we had expected significant productivity benefits from all of the restructuring actions. We just haven't seen the traction that we had expected to see in the field in the Installation and Service businesses. And the U.K. market is tough. We've recognized after the year, it's worse than what we had expected. We're focused on it.</p>
          <p>These operational issues, they happen. We know how to fix these things. I think that's what Geraud and Scott and the team are focused on right now, is fixing the field productivity issues and fixing the issues we've got in terms of performance. Because look, it happens. It's unfortunate, but we're on top of it and we're going to get it fixed.</p>

          <p>Okay. In both of these businesses that are coming together, Carrier and F&amp;S, you're looking at &#x2013; I'm sure there's going to be some integration from a top-level standpoint in terms of overhead. At the same time, you're looking at divestitures from within &#x2013; it seems to me, at least, from within both businesses, certainly within Carrier working on the international residential and with F&amp;S, you've implied there are some opportunities. So in terms of a chicken/egg situation, which is coming first? Are you really starting now and looking at divestitures or are you going to bring the whole thing together and then look at paring some of the businesses off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have been looking at this portfolio transformation at F&amp;S really for the last year or so. We're closer on that that you might think. Timing wise, Carrier is further down the pipe in terms of some of its divestiture opportunities and they're continuing to work those things so I expect you'll see fourth quarter this year, early into next year, hopefully the conclusion of that portfolio transformation. And then it will start to pick up I would think at the F&amp;S side of the business in the second half of next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Joe, you'll recall, we've been doing stuff at F&amp;S as well. The <mark type="ph" /> man-guiding (59:45) business which is the low margin has out of the portfolio pretty much now over the last few years. It's something we're focused on, but with Geraud's additional oversight, I think we'll probably get some more things done faster.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Finally, you may have given this, I may have missed it. In terms of pension for next year for the overall company, if current rates stay where they are, what's the head wind?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's about $0.15 cents, that's at a 5% discount rate. That assumes, I think, 3% return on assets this year. So, we'll see. For every 10 basis point change in the discount rate, that costs us about $20 million of expense. You guys can do the math. We'll see where we are on December 31. Unfortunately there's nothing to do until then.</p>

          <p>Our final question comes from Deane Dray with Citi Investment.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple of clean up questions. The first is the Otis China escalator problem. Has that all been resolved?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in terms of the root cause, we certainly have understood that, we understood that right away, a supplier issue with a bolt that was undersized. I think, again, we're still working with the authorities in Beijing to make sure that they understand our quality control processes are intact and it's never going to happen again. It's an unfortunate incident, but, again, like any other problem that we find we get to root cause, we get it solved, and we make sure it doesn't happen again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, and I might have missed this, but the expectations for fourth quarter in the price-cost, how does that net out? You said that Carrier is facing some additional head winds this quarter. What's the expectation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think next quarter Carrier will see the benefit of pricing. The commodities are still head wind. So I think net-net, we still see a little bit of head wind but it's going to be a lot less than what we've seen in the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Last one back on residential Carrier, Greg, you talked about the mix shift and the focus on buyers towards the lower end 13 SEER. But it also raises the question of whether you're at a disadvantage in not having a lower price point brand to begin with so that in good, better, best, you're skewed towards the better-best brands with Carrier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact, we do have three brands. If you think about it, Carrier is the premier brand out there and it's the higher efficiency products. You have Bryant and you have Payne at the entry level. I think Payne at that price point competes very, very effectively. In fact, that's where we've seen most of the growth is coming out at the low entry line Payne. It's got a great cost footprint and it's very competitive on the low end. I don't think we've lost any of that share. In fact, we've probably have picked up a little bit as we've been able to leverage that low-end brand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Carrier has a scale, they are the market leaders and hey have the scale to bring the cost down and they continue to work on that every day.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Okay, thanks Giovanni. Thanks, everybody, for listening. Another solid quarter. We're confident in our improved 2011 outlook and we're positioning UTC for 2012 with increased restructuring this year and a commitment to grow earnings even in this tough macro environment. And beyond 2012, we've aggressively invested in strategic deals to transform the business and we've continued to invest in strategic technologies to grow the business over the long term.</p>
          <p>Thanks all for listening. I'll remind everybody that we'll be in New York on December 15 for an evening with Louis to talk about 2012 in detail. Have a great day. Thanks.</p>
