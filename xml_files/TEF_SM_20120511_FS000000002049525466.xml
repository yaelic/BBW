      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mar&#xED;a. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Telef&#xF3;nica's first quarter results conference call. It is my pleasure to chair this call. Today with me are the members of the Executive Committee, so during the Q&amp;A session they will have the opportunity to answer the questions you may have.</p>
          <p>Progress year-to-date shows that we are delivering on our growth strategy, fully executing the priorities set for 2012. First on the commercial side, we have had a very strong start for 2012, leveraging the new propositions launched across markets since second half of 2011.</p>
          <p>Growth in the quarter was underpinned by the expansion of our mobile base, especially on the mobile broadband space. Second, top line has recorded a significant improvement year-on-year as increased commercial push is already flowing into revenue. In the middle of the crisis, we are back to positive growth rates despite material drags from regulation and Spain. Mobile data sales continue to post very solid growth and will drive further top line growth acceleration along the year.</p>
          <p>Third, our businesses in Latin America have delivered an outstanding evolution in the first quarter with sustainable high single-digit revenue expansion. To highlight, Brazil already accounts for about one-fourth of our total revenues, similar to Spain, and despite having our headquarters in Europe, for the first time over 50% of our EBITDA comes from Latin America.</p>
          <p>Fourth, we are setting the new paradigm in the sector, working in several areas including commercial approach, devices and networks that I will explain further later on.</p>
          <p>Let me stress that we continue to invest for future growth with focused investments in mobile broadband and fiber where the quantum leap in terms of coverage is particularly remarkable.</p>
          <p>Finally, on the financial front, we have been productive year to date with 2012 maturities already being fully refinanced, more than 40% of 2013 maturities pre-financed and the Colombian restructuring executed. And we are taking further actions to progressively reduce the leverage ratio and to protect the rating.</p>
          <p>Please turn now to slide number 4 for a review of first quarter financial performance. Revenue reached over &#x20AC;15.5 billion in the first quarter, up 0.5% year-on-year despite the adverse conditions faced in most of our European markets. Excluding MTR cuts revenue growth was 1.6%. Below the revenue line, both in 2011 and 2012, we have booked several material exceptional items. In particular 2012 accounts include a non-cash impact of the reduction in the value of our indirect investment in Telecom Italia with a negative effect in net income of &#x20AC;337 million. While a year ago, we recorded a positive impact from the reduction in our stake in PT.</p>
          <p>So, to better understand the underlying performance of the company, we will focus on the P&amp;L excluding those non-recurring effects. As such, underlying OIBDA was close to &#x20AC;5.1 billion down 7.4% year-on-year while underlying net income totaled almost &#x20AC;1.3 billion. CapEx to sales was 11% higher than the year ago, though below our 2012 target due to different quarterly execution path along the year.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me highlight that the first quarter results are aligned with our internal expectations and therefore we reiterate our 2012 guidance.</p>
          <p>Slide number 5 shows the sustained ramp up in accesses growth to 7% year-on-year. The very strong performance in mobile, particularly in broadband, underpin accesses expansion to over &#x20AC;309 million in spite of the 2 million mobile disconnections in Spain in Q1.</p>
          <p>Mobile net adds reached 4.3 million in the first quarter, 1.5 times higher than a year ago. On the back of higher gross adds, churn control and a two-fold rise in net adds in Latin America. We again, posted record smartphone sales accounting for 81% of commercial activity in Europe in the first quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>Top line re-acceleration was driven by two key strategic pillars, Latin America and mobile data as shown in slide number 6. Revenues in Latin America posted high single-digit growth with a remarkable 580 basis points acceleration quarter-on-quarter. This performance more than offset the decrease in top line in Europe.</p>
          <p>On the mobile data space, the growing demand of smartphones and the strong traction of the new tier data propositions led to a 55% year-on-year increase in our mobile broadband accesses with a 17% mobile broadband penetration. As a result, data revenues rose 15% year-on-year to reach over one third of mobile service revenues. Non-SMS revenues already account for 55% of total data sales as we leverage tier pricing to monetize the strong increase in data traffic, with traffic and revenue rapidly converging.</p>
          <p>Let me now stress the outstanding performance of our main growth engine, Latin America, on slide 7. Our operations in the region keep posting growth acceleration on the back of a very strong commercial momentum, which allowed us to grow our access base by almost 11% in the first quarter with a particularly robust performance in mobile. We have led the growth in the region with 4.7 million net additions posting a new record for the first quarter and more than doubling last year's figure. We also continue to lead the mobile growth and adoption in the region with 2.3 million mobile broadband quarterly net adds. As a result and reflecting the steady expansion of mobile service revenue, up 13% year-on-year, top line growth ramped up to close to 10% if we exclude the negative impact from regulation. Please note that mobile revenues already account for close to 70% of our sales in the region.</p>
          <p>On the fixed business, it is worth to highlight the increased contribution of fixed broadband and new services already accounting for our 40% of these sales. Clearly, our unique portfolio in Latin America is a key differentiator factor and a strong growth platform going forward. 48.5% of our revenues and over 50% of our OIBDA already come from this growing region.</p>
          <p>Please turn now to slide number 9 to analyze OIBDA margin evolution. OIBDA was primarily impacted by the rise in commercial costs, which were up close to 11% year-on-year in organic terms on the strong push in volumes from the second half of 2011 and increased weight of smartphones in the mix. The higher focus on retention will drive churn reduction in the coming months benefiting also top line performance and revenue share as we keep the most valuable customers on board. Additionally, our initiatives to promote more rational markets and enhance mobile data monetization should lead to a more efficient commercial expenditure. On top of that, we will benefit from easier comparison in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Secondly, network and systems costs rose on the enhanced coverage and capacity of our networks especially in Latin America. Moreover, high inflation in some countries also drove higher growth. On the other hand, we are implementing cost cutting initiatives across regions with savings from the head count reduction in Spain already flowing in the P&amp;L, and other sling to recent redundancy programs in Brazil, Czech Republic and Ireland to come.</p>
          <p>We also continued to optimize capital allocation selling non-strategic towers in Brazil and in Spain which were partially offset by the restructuring costs booked in the quarter. We will deliver improved profitability along the year leveraging cost contention measures and the benefits of Telef&#xF3;nica Global Resources.</p>
          <p>Let me now focus on the performance of our businesses by regions starting with a more detailed review of Latin America on slide 9. Looking at revenue growth components by geographies, I'd like to highlight that we delivered top line growth acceleration across all our footprint. Even in Mexico, where we are facing operating challenges due to the drastic MTR cuts, we're gradually turning around the business coming back to positive revenue growth rates.</p>
          <p>OIBDA grew growth to 1%. We think it's commercial cost due to higher activity volumes driving the retail margin erosion. Please notice that tower sales were virtually offset by restructuring costs in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide number 10 to review the performance of our Brazilian business, mobile net additions reached a new record level in the first quarter allowing VIVO to gain market share in a highly competitive mobile market across all segments.</p>
          <p>We continue focusing on the high-end segment driven by a strong smartphone uptake, with a smartphone base more than four times higher than a year ago. At the same time, new customer propositions further stimulated customer expansion in the prepaid segment. First accesses growth was compatible with best in class quality indexes as reflected by the lowest levels of complaints in the industry across services.</p>
          <p>In parallel, VIVO is leading the sector transformation. At the end of March, VIVO has over 2,700 municipalities covered with 3G which is more than the rest of our competitors together, and allows VIVO to push strongly mobile broadband adoption. In parallel, VIVO is adopting a selective fiber deployment, a superior solution for fixed broadband which allows faster speeds than the solutions provided by our peers, and we are rapidly increasing the numbers of households connected.</p>
          <p>On slide number 11, mobile service revenues in Brazil keep growing at almost 15% year-on-year excluding MTRs, driving the contribution of the mobile business to over 60% of VIVO's revenue. It is worth to highlight that data revenues already account for 25% of mobile service revenue, reducing the company's exposure to further reductions in termination rates.</p>
          <p>In the fixed business, sales showed a margin of quarter-on-quarter improvement excluding the impact of regulation. One clear evidence of the benefits of our integrated strategy is the strengthening of our position in the corporate segment, which already represents 48% of our fixed revenues. In terms of profitability, increased commercial activity, higher weight of smartphones and restructuring costs, led to margin erosion in the quarter</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, we continue to focus on generating further efficiencies and on the savings from the 10% personnel reduction in place and the April rebranding are still to come. Synergies crystallization is clearly visible below the OIBDA line allowing for a sharp increase in free cash flow generation.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide number 12, I just want to highlight the widespread acceleration in the rest of our Latin America footprint where commercial momentum since the second half of 2011 in delivering the results we expected. In the Southern region, revenues are accelerating to reach double-digit growth as we are maximizing the benefit stemming from our integrated assets, accelerating growth while transforming the operations. As an example, let me highlight that the agreement with the Colombian government to integrate the fixed and mobile businesses opens new opportunities ahead of us.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide number 13, it is particularly noteworthy the turnaround in the Mexican operation where we are starting to see the results of our commercial efforts flowing into revenue performance. The improvement in operational KPIs makes us feel confident about the progressive consolidation of revenue growth acceleration along the year. The performance in Venezuela continues to be very strong not only in terms of revenues but also in terms of benchmark margins.</p>
          <p>And finally, the evolution of the results in Central America also reflects strong revenue acceleration, and please let me remind you that OIBDA is reflecting the start-up impact from the recent launch of operations in Costa Rica.</p>
          <p>Let me now review our performance in Europe starting on slide number 14. Telef&#xF3;nica Europe continued executing its strategy to regain momentum in key markets and to increase mobile broadband adoption among economic headwinds and strong competition. The success of our enhanced commercial propositions launched from the second half of 2011 and our increased focus on retention pushed handset upgrades up 16% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Additionally, mobile broadband customers posted a solid growth of 27% reaching close to 30% penetration over the total mobile accesses. The mobile broadband momentum and our strategy to monetize this growth engine, clearly flowed in revenues with non-SMS data revenues up 21% year-on-year. Nevertheless, optimization of usage in a challenging macro environment, lower price points and the ongoing regulation <mark type="indiscernible" /> (16:35) impacted overall service revenue performance.</p>
          <p>On the efficiency front, I'd like to highlight that our focus on cost contention led non-commercial expenses to decline 6% year-on-year, partially offsetting the significant increase in commercial costs which resulted in a 33% OIBDA margin in the quarter. In parallel, we continue working to have more rational dynamics in our markets with clear examples in Germany, the success for My Handy model and in Spain acquisition subsidies removal.</p>
          <p>If we move to Spain on page 15, I'd like to highlight that we are executing our plan to transform and turn around the business. The first step was to refresh our tariffs across services to become more competitive, stop the loss of high-value customers and drive churn reduction.</p>
          <p>New tariffs are getting a strong traction in the marketplace. 50% of our fixed broadband customers and 37% of our mobile customers in the consumer segment are already enjoying the new tariffs. Churn reduction is clearly visible, for example, in fixed broadband with a 30 basis points decline from Q1 2011 to April 2012. Moreover, early indications in mobile churn of those customers that have opted to renew mobile tariffs point out the sharp reduction in churn.</p>
          <p>Regarding ARPU, early data on the new mobile tariffs shows a limited impact with positive elasticity in the low end segments and a slightly higher year-on-year erosion in the ARPU of the higher end customers. Fixed broadband ARPU declined 9% year-on-year as we actively migrated customers to the new tariffs to further reduce churn. The first expansion of our fiber network coverage to 1.3 million households, three-fold the homes passed a year ago, and the strong traction of the offering with 177,000 houses already connected will drive further churn contention and will help us manage ARPU.</p>
          <p>In fact, in those areas where we have fiber results &#x2013; where we have fiber, results are very positive. The second step is the implementation of a new industrial model to enhance market dynamics. And that is why we have gradually reduced mobile handset subsidy since February. Some of our competitors have already announced they will follow us and therefore you should expect a more rational market going forward. The results so far show a consistent reduction in mobile number portability churn. However, gross and net additions were penalized in the quarter as we were the only player in the market lowering subsidies up to mid-April. We are setting the stage for a redefinition of the value chain in the mobile business to foster our return to profitable growth in the market.</p>
          <p>Finally, the first step is aimed at increasing efficiency beyond commercial costs and delivering the best experience to our customers, leveraging best in class networks. Top line performance continued to be impacted by a challenging trading environment with pretty stable trends in the fixed business. Weaker performance in mobile service revenue was mainly driven by further usage optimization, lower prices and our new commercial policy on SMS premium. Additionally, increased commercial efforts also impacted mobile service revenue as loyalty points are accounted as lower revenues.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, strong focus on the cost side has allowed to contain OIBDA deterioration quarter-on-quarter despite increased top line pressure. The successful execution of the new redundancy program has led to savings of over &#x20AC;55 million in the quarter, roughly 4,500 employees had joined the &#x2013; sorry, 4,400 employees have joined the first two tranches of the plan and 3,149 have already left the company with the remaining leaving before year-end. As a result of all our efficiency actions, OIBDA margin expanded sequentially.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide number 18, in the U.K., we are regaining commercial momentum in a highly competitive market. Contract mobile net adds were the highest since Q3 2010 underpinned by the strong volume upgrades around high end smartphones and 8% year-on-year increase in gross adds. As such, we have improved our relative position versus other players while also expanding our smartphone penetration to 41%.</p>
          <p>I would like to mention the recent launch of the new proposition, "On&amp;On," around clear data tariffs to further reinforce our position on mobile broadband which is centered to data revenue growth. This offer is an additional step to secure the level of market share with the right commercial initiative and lower incremental costs. I would like to highlight that unlimited data propositions launched by certain competitors have not impacted our market share of gross adds, proving the success of our rational approach.</p>
          <p>Top line continued to be under pressure, mainly impacted by usage optimization and contract renewals at lower price points though stabilizing year-on-year, growth trends as commercial efforts start flowing into revenue.</p>
          <p>Voice performance improved while SMS trends stabilized with data revenues increasing their weight to 48% of mobile service revenue. Regarding profitability, higher activity around retention and acquisition explains most of this erosion.</p>
          <p>Please notice that activity in first quarter 2011 was particularly low while we have also increased commercial efforts quarter-on-quarter. Going forward, efficiencies derived from improved contract churn and the lower volume of customers out of contract that the bulk of renewals were done in the quarter should translate into a lower year-on-year increase in commercial expenses.</p>
          <p>In Germany on slide 19, our growth story continued. We recorded a strong set of results, gaining value market share with the best-ever quarterly contract net adds at close to 300,000 on the back of consistent churn improvement and continued growth of gross adds. It is worth highlighting our partner distribution channels' activity as well as the strong business segment performance. Consequently, smartphone penetration increased five percentage points to 21% with a 95% smartphone share over total shipments. This, combined with successful monetization of data services and a better revenue mix, led to sequential acceleration of mobile service revenue growth to 10.5% in the first quarter, excluding the negative impact from MTR cuts in Q4. OIBDA posted a robust, double-digit annual growth as revenue growth flows through, which coupled with higher efficiencies, led to a margin year-on-year improvement of 2.2 percentage points to 23.4%.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide number 20 to review our operations in the Czech Republic. Commercial momentum continued in the Mobile Value segment with a strong growth in the contract base, up 6% year-on-year underpinned by better contract churn and mobile broadband growth.</p>
          <p>In the fixed business, fixed broadband accesses continued to increase with VDSL already representing 19% of the base. Revenues showed a sequential improvement for a third quarter in a row, driven by the continuous improvement of the mobile segment, as well as increased contribution from Slovakia.</p>
          <p>In parallel, profitability remains strong with a 48.5% margin, showing a limited year-on-year erosion leveraged on ongoing efficiency initiatives in the Czech Republic, sale of non-core assets and growing OIBDA in Slovakia despite higher commercial cost and different ICT project spacing.</p>
          <p>Now, to finalize the presentation, let's move to the financial side on slide 21. We have been able to execute a well-balanced, financing exercise year-to-date, relying on both the capital markets, as well as the financial institutions jointly with alternative funding sources, for an amount of up to &#x20AC;7.5 billion. And we have been able to successfully do so under quite difficult market conditions.</p>
          <p>Such refinancing allows us to say that 2012 has already been fully refinanced, taking into consideration our extension options on the preferred shares that mature in December. Moreover, given the level of financing completed we could apply resources to cope with more than 40% of the maturities for next year, 2013. This proactive management has also allowed to improve our healthy liquidity position as we continue to increase our cash position excluding Venezuela to &#x20AC;6.3 billion. More significantly we have again increased by &#x20AC;1.3 billion our undrawn committed credit lines reaching &#x20AC;11.4 billion.</p>
          <p>It is also worth highlighting that we have been able to extend &#x20AC;1.5 billion collateral lines maturities ranging from two to four years. Effective interest costs have increased year-on-year though we continue to remain at the bottom part of our guidance.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 22, we can see how we are able to reduce our debt, thanks to our asset rationalization mainly stemming from the agreement reached on Colombian restructuring and other assets disposals such as Hispasat, PT, Zon resulting in &#x20AC;1.5 billion debt reduction. Nevertheless this is offset by negative FX movements, nonrecurring financial expenses, commitments, cancellation and share repurchases.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we expect our free cash flow to enhance our financial flexibility as the impact on higher payments versus accruals on seasonality. And nonrecurring effects recorded in the first quarter should not be extrapolated for the whole year. Working capital secular seasonality will revert the consumption seen in the first quarter of this year</p>
          <p>Turning to slide number 23, we remain mindful on the importance of enhancing financial flexibility and our focus towards improving our leverage ratio by year end. We are in portfolio optimization mode and looking for selective monetization of our assets across geographies with &#x20AC;1.6 billion already achieved. We expect in excess of additional &#x20AC;1.5 billion proceeds from further asset sales already undergoing including Atento while we continue to actively analyze other divestiture options to maximize the value of our portfolio. On top of that, we allotted our shareholder remuneration to sustainable trend under current market conditions providing us flexibility.</p>
          <p>To recap, we had a very solid commercial start for 2012. Our top line has recorded a significant improvement. We have posted an outstanding performance in Latin America. At the same time, we are setting a new paradigm in the sector. Finally, we do reiterate our 2012 outlook as we will deliver a progressive improvement along the year.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention. Now we are ready to take your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Jesus Romero from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I just had a question on the Spanish mobile market. If you look at the number of customers you lost in Q1, I don't know if you could give us a detail of how many of those customers were lost in the month of March. On the math, I do with 2.5 million customers you lost on a yearly basis, that's approximately &#x20AC;500 million of revenues. I don't know if you can give us a little detail on what is that customer loss in April and whether you're seeing any improvements in the month of May so far. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for &#x2013; with your question, Jesus. Out of those 2.5 million that you were mentioning, 2 million are coming from the cleanup of the base, and out of that, 1.3 million is coming from prepaid because we have applied a different criteria, we have passed from our balance criteria to an activity criteria because it was more realistic. And on the contract side, we have been cleaning up some customers that were not effectively using one of our services and were providing a significant amount of churn when they realized that so we are actively cleaning that, and that accounts for 2 million.</p>
          <p>The other 500,000 which had the real activity of the quarter, if we focus namely on the trends of March in which we decided to take away the handset subsidy, the bulk of those are coming from that month. And as other operators have started to be aligned, this trend has significantly been improved in the month of April and in the first weeks of May.</p>
          <p>It is worth mentioning that different players are having different commercial approach. Some of them have decided, namely Vodafone have decided to eliminate subsidies as well. It looks like other players like Yoigo are going that direction. And Orange is sustaining with subsidy, although we think with a lower indemnity. So we are closely monitoring portability figures to check our productive performance with different players, and we have different tactical reactions, depending on the risk.</p>
          <p>But it is &#x2013; it was a hot quarter, we knew that. But the economical model in terms of getting churn down and retaining high-value added customers and putting the focus of our loyalty programs and subsidies effort on existing customers, which are the most valuable ones, is starting to get some traction and we are starting to have some churn indicators that looks are going into the right direction, though it is still soon. So this is a little bit of the color that I can share with you.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Achtmann from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the first one is on Spanish broadband operator in mobile. The growth has been slowing to 2.5% after &#x2013; plus 11% in the previous quarters. Is that a trend we have to assume will persist in the future as penetration has already reached 30%?</p>
          <p>Secondly on fiber. In all of your markets where you rolled out fiber, the success of the take-up is quite successful. Is there a case that you should accelerate the fiber rollout to capture more of that broadband market? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't get the first question. I think it was on managed service revenue except here in Spain on the mobile side. And there are three major &#x2013; if that's question, there are three major effects on the acceleration of the decline on mobile service revenue.</p>
          <p>The first one is that we have cut a commercial practice based on SMS premium programs with partners that was creating a significant amount of quality concerns and claims and significant amount of cost in IT and in terms of billing claims. We have cut and we have become much more selective on the SMS trade-in agreements and commercial understanding and promotions that we are doing with third parties that explains basically one-third of that drop.</p>
          <p>Then you have the loyalty programs, which are accounted as negative revenues, so to say that are netted from revenues. Those loyalty programs are increased compared with the previous quarter because that takes part of the commercial strategy of blending or making sure that we win thanks the most valuable customer that we have, and therefore, we invest on the loyalty programs to make sure that they stay with us and we accrue that. And those &#x2013; and therefore are flowing through revenues.</p>
          <p>And there are only another part, which is a lower part of effect is the new tariffs. We have been effectively migrating actively 3.3 million customers from out of a total base of residential contract customer of roughly 7-something million which is 40% of the base who have already been migrated and that creates another tension in terms of lower ARPU, but again, with a significant improvement in churn. So the overall equation will be improving sequentially around the year. So that explains that drop on the mobile service revenue.</p>
          <p>Considering the fiber on the fixed part of our business, considering the fiber deployment, so far results in terms of ARPU, churn, CSI and customer experience, basically in terms of installation, time and the learning curve in terms of the average cost of subscriber acquisition cost in terms of the investment of time in the households are improving significantly. And that explains why the take up ratio is improving so significantly.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we are trying to be very selective on the home passed criteria in order to make sure that before we passed one neighbor or one city, we have commercial traction and therefore, that their take up ratio is improved and that has, through a very geographical approach, has helped us to be much more efficient. We are pretty positive on the deployment and the result, the commercial results and therefore we'll keep with our current plan of significantly increasing our deployment and our speed of connections.</p>

          <p>Hello. Two questions, please. My first question is around the leap year effect and whether you can give us an idea of how much your revenue growth benefited in Q1? And perhaps if you could comment as to how you expect to get to the more than 1% growth for the full year given the start that we have.</p>
          <p>And my second question and I'm sure there may be more questions on KPN later, but I'm more interested about general principles. Given your commitment to the leverage target, can you rule out either changing the dividend policy or using your shares as currency in order to execute any strategic transactions? Thank you.</p>

Regarding your first question, generally speaking at Group level, we didn't see &#x2013; of course, there was a positive effect but we didn't see a relevant effect though there is different behavior per market on &#x2013; in some of them, the impact is bigger than others.

We would only say that it evidences the strong undervaluation of the European telco sector and the valuations that the strategic players are ready to attach to European telcos.</p>
          <p>With respect to the dividend, we are not envisaging any change to the dividend policy that we announced in December of last year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Have a couple of questions, first on the U.K. You've been mentioning something in the presentation on this but I would like you to elaborate a bit more on whether there's a seasonality in the spending in the first quarter that has brought forward costs and therefore could drive better margins throughout the year? And your view on whether such a high level of spending is worth and when revenues will turn around. That's my first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question is on the subsidies elimination in Spain. First thing, whether that was already included in your guidance or not, and secondly, whether you're expecting a net positive impact on EBITDA from this year or the savings that you could get from subsidies will be fully offset by increasing subscriber retention costs and maybe also the attention is turning into lower tariffs from competitors? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Luis, for your questions. I am taking the first one on the U.K. and explain more specifically on the evolution of the margin in this first quarter. First message is that in the previous year, in the first quarter of the previous year we have almost no retention costs as we have no expiration of &#x2013; almost no expiration of contracts with iPhone customers and the bulk of those happened in the &#x2013; mainly in the fourth quarter of next year, first quarter of that year. That means that we want to preserve those high valuable customers, which, by the way, I would like to stress that the customer's life value of the contract is higher in average than any other segment. So we want to preserve those and that's why we have been investing heavily in retention costs in this first quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>Whether if that's recurrent or not for the future, I mean, I would focus on the seasonality fact that most of the customers were reaching the iPhone in the first waves of the iPhones, and therefore, the bulk of those were &#x2013; have already been flowing through but you will keep going through the year, probably at a much lower base in terms of that.</p>
          <p>Let me stress the fact that thanks to that effort churn is best in class, so we do not only have the best customers in the U.K. market, but we have the lower churn customers, thanks to that effort and now we deeply think, taking your question, if that's worth the effort as well &#x2013; that in Spain with the subsidy, the answer is, yes, we deeply think it is the right thing to do to create value and to preserve the most valuable customers.</p>
          <p>On top of that, the other effort that we have been doing in the first quarter in the U.K., we have been investing a little bit more in advertising that will be phasing out somehow at the end of the year. So, basically the comparison is not fair because the first quarter of last year we have almost no retention cost and we're having a significant effort in this quarter.</p>
          <p>With respect to the subsidies in Spain, was that included in the budget if we were or not? The answer is yes, it was designed that way. We knew that the first quarter it was going to be very tough. We knew that it would take a while until others may consider to follow that path on our intensive competition in Spain. But we did think that the payback of that effort in terms of churn reduction is lower than a year. So we are positive in monitor &#x2013; we are monitoring on a weekly basis, churn evolution because thanks to the handset subsidy strategy, which by the way, we are not eliminating, we are just focusing this handset subsidy effort on our existing customers. Thanks to the loyalty programs and thanks to the new tariff refresh we think that we may be able to get much better churn figures in the next month, and in fact for us it is key to monitor the portability so we make sure that is reflected and not a heavy loss in customers. So very early stage it was planned. It was designed that way. We think it is needed at a sector level maybe in Spain with a current market circumstances. So we think this is the right direction and we really want to &#x2013; we need to monitor that on a weekly basis but we are deeply convinced this is the right direction.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Two questions please. The first one on Germany, could you describe what you mean in &#x2013; you're relieved by tier data pricing driving growth in contract ARPU in Germany? Is this the way that you design tariffs which means that new customers are naturally taking the higher levels or are, I should say willing to pay more when they're take a new tariff?</p>
          <p>And secondly on the CapEx in Latin America, can you maybe elaborate a bit on the allocation of capital? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, taking the question on the German market on the German about what do we mean by tiered data pricing, it means that generally speaking, not just in Germany, we think that we can be competitive in the markets without having an all-you-can-eat data tariff. That means that if you have the right business intelligence measure in terms of reading your customer data base, knowing what are the normal user in terms of capacity and in terms of speed of download, you can design the right tariff including bundles of SMS and voice. That's what we have done in Germany.</p>
          <p>By the way, we have done exactly the same in the U.K. and that way we think we can be competitive in the market. That requires a permanent reading on the download necessities or requirements from your customers and that's what we tried to do. The message here is that we think you can be competitive in the market without having an all-you-can-eat data tariff, which by the way, puts a significant pressure on your network and that's why we think that with the current cuts and mainly with the current information system that we have in place which we can top up our customer demand if they want &#x2013; if they require extra data capacity but without a bill shock. I think that's the right strategy and that's what we are trying to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Luigi, this is Santiago. On CapEx, you lock on one of the very few surprises, actually. We've significantly increased the amount spent on CapEx in Q1 although the seasonality effect makes all these quarterly comparisons difficult to draw big conclusions from. Our priorities are well-known, we want to cater to the data needs of the Latin Americans and in order to do that, we will expand coverage, we will participate in spectrum auctions and we will try and provide the coverage and quality which is second to none.</p>
          <p>This is especially true in the case of Brazil, where on top of mobile coverage, we are also extending, gradually but surely, the fiber deployment in a similar vein to the one that Jose Maria was mentioning before on Spain. Other than that, there is no specific geographic allocation of capital. The budget is proceeding as expected and whether or not it is enough, I think the market will have to tell us in a years' time.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah hi. A few questions I guess for Santiago. Just a question on Mexican minutes, I'm trying to get to the bottom of Mexican minutes and what's actually going on there. This business is clearly turning around. Your off-time minutes are now cheaper than your competitors and so &#x2013; but minutes are down hugely. How much of that is about accounting and presumably, minutes are actually up if you didn't take into account the accounting change of minutes to seconds.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, is there a risk about your Brazilian business given the premium prices with MTR cuts coming and a lot of prices likely to fall? Are you concerned at all about a sort of premium price overhang in your Brazilian wireless business? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Robin, I'm not sure I got well your second question. But let me try and answer a little bit of the Mexican minutes. What's going on is a change in the shape and the form of the customers that we're attracting and the customers that we are leaving behind. That may have a confusion effect until the year lapses because of the different nature of the prepaid that come and the prepaid customers that go. Not much more than I can express it and if you wouldn't mind, going again through the second question where the sound was not very good, I would appreciate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. The second question is just you're currently priced at a premium in Brazilian wireless to peers. So as mobile termination rate cuts come and mobile wireless prices comes, are you concerned at all that you're going to have a price overhang and you have to cut your prices substantially in Brazil on wireless?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I got you. Thank you for the &#x2013; for going back again. The reason we have the premium pricing in Brazil is two-fold. First, we are much better exposed to the fast growing and more valuable data traffic, and that explains partially why we have price premium. And second, we tend to cater in excess of our overall market share to the upper half of the market. Yes, because we have the better products, the better coverage and the better customers. So is that price premium going to converge? Well, I think the jury is still out.</p>
          <p>We totally have no signs. We can point to no signs of that being the case, if we are modestly correct about the market being tiered and segmented, there will be a different habitats for customers to live in and to the extent that we continue providing a good service and a quality experience, I don't see why overall pricing should converge. The lower rungs of the ladder, those occupied by aggressive pricing entry-level prepaid might be different. But it is a much more structured market than that statement would suggest.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Thank you very much. First a question on Latin America. You mentioned that there's been a lot of increase in commercial expenses and that's one reason why the margin diluted a bit. But when I look at, for instance, the press release of VIVO, and I look at, for instance, personnel costs, which are growing 8% year-on-year on an adjusted basis, it does seem that there's also a little bit of cost inflation. So maybe if you could comment on that with regards to Brazil but also in other countries in the region, are you generally seeing some cost inflation?</p>
          <p>Second, going to Germany, you &#x2013; I mean, obviously we've seen probably one of your competitors getting a new shareholder with deep pockets. Does that change in any way the way you think about your strategic position in Germany and how well you are positioned? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mathieu, it's Santiago again. On Brazilian cost increases, you are partially right, there is a bit of cost inflation going on in the region. There is no way denying it, but I don't think that's the main explanation why costs showed up in the first quarter. They are typically related to the expansion of the &#x2013; of our customer base which has &#x2013; as I think we mentioned in the presentation, record levels Brazil has had added more customers in the first quarter than it has ever had. So, the last areas of market capturing are still going on, and that has an effect on commercial expenditure.</p>
          <p>Also, I'd like to highlight the fact that because of the accesses of data products and the higher cost, unit cost of smartphones, it is only natural that when you have a big increase, which is likely happening this year, in the adoption of these devices, you'll have a unit cost increase that is not going to be permanent as smartphone adoption is increasing but it's not going to be doubling every year. So two components to that cost increase, one is in generating cost inflation in some quarters. Most of them, however, related to the strong customer growth and partially related to unit cost increase as the customers turn away from feature phones into smartphones.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of things that caught my eye, on page 23 towards the end of the presentation, you talk about opportunities under review for I guess faster deleveraging and I know you talked about portfolio management. I guess we've seen a couple of situations recently where operators are now able to sell into private equity at significant premium to current trading multiples. Is that something that you're thinking about? And can you give us the framework by which you decide what kind of assets are core and which ones you might look to selectively monetize?</p>
          <p>Secondly, I just wanted to ask a broader question about commercial costs. Is this now a sort of change in the attitude of the company which is going to last for a while? So you're going to continue to invest at this high level in commercial costs, particularly in LatAm and then look at your better revenues as a way of improving growth and profitability? Or is this time bound? Is this a period you're investing for and then you'll see the margins recover as you reduce the competitive intensity? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tim. This is Angel Vil&#xE1; taking your first question regarding slide number 23, as you have seen, even in taking into account the post-closing events related to Colombia restructuring and so on, we would still be outside or above the target leverage that we have expressed and committed to the market of 2.35%, and this has come from increased CapEx payouts, from some negative FX movement and some other effects which are explained on slide number 22. But we remain committed to this leverage ratio. We remained committed to preserve our rating. We remained committed to our shareholder remunerations. So clearly, we have to step up our efforts with respect to activities or actions regarding debt reduction. We have already achieved &#x20AC;1.6 billion. We have in progress potential transactions that would have in excess of &#x20AC;1.5 billion. We don't want to provide specific numbers but our estimate and given the progress of those would be in excess of that. And then we're assessing a variety of potential actions that we're reviewing. And we are electing the sense that we have multiple options to &#x2013; on which we can act.</p>
          <p>We can tap capital markets with potential IPOs of some of our assets and we are assessing the attractiveness of those. We are also analyzing which assets, if any, we could deem additionally to be non-core. And we can also use the lever of selectively monetizing stakes in some of our operations. So this is what we're working. We wanted to highlight it to point out that we remain committed to our leverage targets, our shareholder remuneration targets and that we will continue to activate these actions obviously subject to market conditions.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Those decisions are leaning to obviously market attractiveness. We are not looking at expanding our portfolio in other operations. We are looking at options that can increase the value of operations that we have and obviously to the return on capital that we have employed in our operations.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding your second question, I do show from the last part of last year I think we have a strong commercial push in most of our most relevant markets. And because of that you have seen commercial cost increase very much related with our commercial activity that deliver very significant access growth. Regarding the rest of the year, though we are going to keep a high level of activity, we will see positive impact because of the subsidies cut in some countries, and we will see as well positive input because the iPhone input dilution along the year.</p>
          <p>In any case, we will manage this commercial cost very much in line with our revenue growth for the rest of the year.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much. I just want to come back to Spanish mobile. Service revenues fell 18% in the quarter, and I just want to understand what was the service revenue trend before and after the change in subsidy policy?</p>
          <p>And then second question moving to Brazil, I think the EBITDA fell in the quarter adjusted for restructuring and tower sales. And just &#x2013; I mean thinking back to the large synergies that you anticipated at the time of VIVO deal and obviously the good mobile growth that you're seeing, it seems quite disappointing. You mentioned some of the reasons: customer growth, smartphone take-up and cost inflation, but I wonder if you can just talk in a bit more detail about how and when the sort of EBITDA growth trend might start to improve from here? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Taking your question about the mobile service revenue in Spain excluding MTRs, the increase year-on-year is 16.2% compared with the 12.4% in the previous quarter, in quarter &#x2013; in Q4 2011. And again three major sources of that deviation and none of them is strictly linked to handset subsidy so we have not been seeing an acceleration of that because of the handset subsidy. The SMS premium that we have been much more selective because it was costing us a significant amount of bad revenues that we were forced to correct in other quarters and claims and cost in IT and billing claims.</p>
          <p>The loyalty programs which is the one that is somehow related to handset subsidies because we are increasing the handset subsidy activity in our existing customers because we consider to have the best, the most valuable customers and therefore we are increasing the loyalty efforts the contract part of savings that we have in all those handsets, in other subsidies &#x2013; handset subsidies below revenue line.</p>
          <p>And the third one which is derived from the effect of the migration to the new tariffs, those are customer whose promotions are expiring or that we have been actively migrating and therefore they have a lower ARPU. You have also there on that part a positive increase of the leap year of roughly 0.7% in the quarter. So the net of that is the evolution, none of them is strictly directly related to the subsidies, except in the loyalty programs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is Santiago. In terms of when or if Brazilian OIBDA margin will recover, you rightly pointed out that there are a number of one-off effects and they are not going to be coming back for the remainder of the year, most of them related to personnel restructuring. I've also mentioned cost inflation.</p>
          <p>I think it's fair to expect that despite the high temperature, comparative temperature in the market in Brazil, those trends will smooth out as the year progresses, the reasons being for the one-off nature of some of these movements and also, a part of the savings are going to come from the integration of our fixed and mobile businesses which is already completed will start transpiring as the year progresses.</p>
          <p>We have no way of knowing how strong the market will continue pushing. What we have been able to record last year is a slight increment in our OIBDA margin &#x2013; I'm sorry, in our OIBDA market share and irrespective of what things have happened, we would expect that to continue being the case this year.</p>
          <p>So I think there are one-off very clear effects that are not going to come back in the coming quarters so that should be an improvement in growth rates relative to last year. And the fruits of the integration are going to be highly visible, probably in the second half.</p>

          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Funnell from Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Yeah, just follow-up questions, please. The strategy where you've got a very large gap between your level of SRC per unit and your SAC is quite unusual when we look at the history of the industry. Do you think that's a temporary phase that you're going through? And are you planning ultimately to try and lower your SRCs over time as well, perhaps once you've locked customers into these new plans. Is that something we can look forward to later in the year in terms of margin improvement?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just a more sort of question of principle rather than specifically about KPN, do you think given your performance in Germany that you need to be involved in German mobile consolidation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Taking your question, even though it's global, I think that probably you are referring to the Spanish market mainly because it's the most.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sorry. I meant Spain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I will take that. Yes. We see that as a change of paradigm, which means that we knew that it was going to be a first phase, which was going to be tough. Because when you remove subsidies, you don't know what the other companies are going to do. But you think that being the market leader you will have some effect on the market and you will try to redress the margin trends of the whole industry.</p>
          <p>So we think that retention costs was it here through the handset subsidies or in the U.K. is something that you need to have because we have very valuable customers with &#x2013; again when you do the at-present value of the chain of revenues of the different customers, we have an outstanding customer base that we need to retain and therefore, subscriber acquisition costs of the existing customers increases. At the same time, you bet on the churn reduction because you think that on top of that you apply these loyalty programs, you improve your quality indexes and you put the right incentives in the distribution chain, you can drive that down to a much better churn.</p>
          <p>Remember that at the same time, we have been totally refreshing the tariffs so that the entry levels are much lower than they were a year ago, and therefore you will also be heated by the fact that their renewals are coming at a lower ARPU but they are not churning. So the full effect, you need to have a few months to see if the churn is applying the countermeasure, the positive countermeasures we think and we are measuring that since the last &#x2013; for the last seven months since we have started with this strategy. And this early stage of month of churn indicators prove that we are going to the right direction. But still we need a few months to make sure that this is the case. Was it that to be the case, the payback of the effort is less than one year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And German consolidation, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is Angel. With respect to the second question, we are very happy with our German asset which is a core asset. It's an asset where we have invested substantially in the last years. The return on that investment is growing. The company is growing at subscriber level, revenue level, OIBDA, OIBDA margin, operating cash flow, so we are satisfied with our operation. And with respect to something non-organic on that, I said I can only reiterate that we're not going to make comments on this situation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Marsch from Berenberg. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. I just wondered if you could quantify for us how much Spanish EBITDA benefited in the quarter from the actions that you took on handset subsidies? And secondly, would you be able to give us the actual change in Spanish mobile service revenues in March year-over-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So thanks for the question. But unfortunately you're asking a very sensitive commercial information that we do not disclose. I stress what I have said before, things are going to the direction that we were planning at this stage. We started in March and that's why the figures of customers in March were affected because others followed, but later, some of the others follow later. But unfortunately I cannot be more specific because as you might imagine, this is high commercial sensitive information.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Khiroya from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Two questions if I can. So firstly, on Brazil, your Brazilian CapEx came in quite mixed with a loss of PayTV subs and slowing broadband additions. What explains the slowdown and should we expect any improvements in the rate of fixed revenue declines for the rest of the year?</p>
          <p>And second on Spain, you reduced the commercial expense by 3% in Q1, should we view this level of reduction as sustainable for the rest of 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. This is Santiago again. Thanks for the question. On Brazilian fixed, I think there are two opposing factors. One is that we continue having an erosion in both fixed lines and in single partner contribution, at the same time that we have an increase and a reasonable growth on the broadband product, including fiber which is off to a small in size but very promising development. So my expectation is that the contribution of fixed to Brazil despite the high-growth nature of the wireless asset we will stabilize and turn positive throughout the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So taking your question on Spain, the commercial cost in the first quarter. I mean, remember that the subsidy thing is just in March. It's just one month out of the three of the quarter and it has other effects. I mean, for example at the same time that we were removing subsidies, we were less active on TV campaigns, and on commercial campaigns, and therefore this as well as some one-offs in terms of commercial effort that we are going to be deciding very tactically if we need to renew or not.</p>
          <p>Having said that, and including churn as I was telling you, the payback of the effort should be less than one year and therefore we are betting that the churn improvement would be flowing through our accounts and therefore will be helping us to dulcify as well other commercial actions in a much more tactical manner. So the answer is yes, we wanted to be under into that direction but again too soon to say that the whole strategy is working and we will need to monitor that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very clear.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Lyall from UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. I have two questions, please. First on Spanish mobile, some pressure ports in distribution channels had suggested you'd have to reintroduce subsidies and increase discounts quite heavily for customers porting from Orange. Could you confirm whether you've had to maybe change strategy a bit into April? and maybe some of those savings, as Keval sort of suggested there, might disappear?</p>
          <p>And then second, just try again on the German situation, you emphasized in the presentation a lot on the financial flexibility you've got. Could you just confirm that there are no time or liquidity constraints that restrict you from reacting to AMX's move if you decide to? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking your question on the noise in the distribution chain and getting back to subsidies, the answer is that we are pretty firm on our strategy of trying to change that paradigm of the sector namely in Spain with the subsidies' strategy and therefore, devoting the bulk of our effort to our existing customers and therefore, trying to move away from incentivating churn of customers either from us or from the others.</p>
          <p>Having said that, tactically and not just through subsidies, there are other actions that we can take in order to make sure that in the portability field, we do not lose the battle in a hard way, or that we balance that situation, that doesn't have to be through subsidies, there are other actions that we can take. But again, we are very firm on this new handset strategy. We need to try to see if the churn is going to the right direction. And again, we think it is. So we are not going to be altering that for now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the second question, I can only reiterate that we have no comment to make on potential situations that may be evolving in the European telco.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Peddy from Macquarie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hello everyone. Just a couple of things, I was just intrigued to know are you doing anything different in Germany to what you're doing in the U.K. given the noticeable difference in performance?</p>
          <p>And secondly, in the U.K., you talk about usage optimization, is that something that the consumer is stimulating or is it something that you're actively stimulating so that you can actually secure your customer base? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks for the question. We know that both markets are different in terms of a significant amount of features. Was it on the distribution schemes or others? But mainly, the only or the most important differentiating factor that I would point out is that in Germany, for example, we are away from subsidizing handsets for a long, long while. We are financing them through a third party, and therefore the commercial model is different.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we have refreshed our tariff in Germany as well as we did in the U.K. We have most of the database analysis and our customer intelligence is shared in terms of our best practices around the group. So we don't see a major difference apart from the specific differences of each market.</p>
          <p>On top of that, taking the outlook bundle of the usage strategy in the U.K., we are not necessarily fostering that. Every customer decides. But we have been refreshing our tariffs and we have been launching a new tariff that includes a much-higher degree of SMS, unlimited SMS, unlimited voice and a significant amount of data capacity because we wanted to be competitive against the all-you-can-eat data offer from other players.</p>
          <p>For us, the important message is that thanks to this tariff, we have been able to prove ourselves and the market that you don't need to have an all-you-can-eat data tariff to be competitive in the market if you have the right information about the usage demand, the capacity demand of your customers. And therefore, designing the right strategy and designing the right product attracts the right customers and helps us to make a better and most efficient use of our network.</p>
          <p>So that's a little bit what I can comment to you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Lares from JB Capital. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Fabi&#xE1;n Lares from JB Capital Markets in Madrid. Two questions, please, and first one is regarding Argentina surrounding the situation that happened with Repsol, YPF recently, are you in any way, shape or form concerned following the fine that you were imposed, a possible worse relationship with the government and any other interference from the Argentine authorities? And in particular, how that can concern aspects related to repatriation of cash and possible treatment of the amount in hyper-inflation states?</p>
          <p>And then second, regarding Central America with the launch of the Costa Rican operations, while I understand that these are small, I was wondering if you could give us some kind of context of the expectations of what we should look forward to in terms of potential size of the market? And would this be a kind of operation similar in size and contribution to say, Uruguay, or something along these lines? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fabi&#xE1;n, this is Santiago. First on Argentina, I can go as far as saying that not much has changed on the telecom space in Argentina and certainly nothing has changed on our end. Whatever is happening in other sectors is certainly not for us to comment on.</p>
          <p>On the alleged fine, we are going through the review of the wording, the exact wording of that number. You may have seen that there are two very different components. One is the fine itself which is ARS6 million or roughly &#x20AC;1.5 million, the remainder of the full amount being ARS10 pro rata, per customer compensation that the regulatory authorities suggest that we do for our customers. Two comments there, one is that the interruption of service is more likely than not going to be proven not to have been a problem of Telef&#xF3;nica, but something initiated from without the company. That might have a final effect and we have &#x2013; we are cooperating with authorities on that investigation.</p>
          <p>And second and most important is that after the five to six hours service interruption, we immediately reacted, compensating our customers on the prepaid and on the postpaid or contract segments by either eroding that day from the charges, extending the lives of the top-ups or in this case, because it was Easter week, giving them for free until that Friday. So an additional four days free SMS connectivity capabilities.</p>
          <p>So we think we've done more than what is required to first sort out the problem. Second, we're optimistic that the true nature of that interruption is going to be proven not to have originated from Telef&#xF3;nica and that has an effect. And third, on the compensation, we think that we have more than done our fair share of the whole thing.</p>
          <p>On Central America, I think it's useful although the fact that the numbers are small, that doesn't mean that they are unimportant. At Costa Rica, because of its startup nature is likely to contribute negatively for a while yet. And the rest of the region, the four major Central American markets, behave in quite different ways. Certainly, we're making progress in some of those as you may have seen and the competition, especially on tariffs and new products, is accelerating. We have intention of completing the 3G coverage there where we are lagging behind so that we can provide as good a coverage as possible and as competitive a service as any of our competitors can.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Two questions, please. Firstly, do the two syndicated loans you raised this quarter both expire in 2013?</p>
          <p>And secondly, with regard to the disposals that you've got in progress, do you have interested parties for all of them, and if so, is that how you got to the estimate of just over &#x20AC;1.5 billion? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the second question is with regard to the disposals in progress, say Por Tel, <mark type="ph" /> Rumbe, (01:17:24) Atento, do you have interested parties for each of those disposals? And is that how you got to your estimate of over &#x20AC;1.5 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the value that we are still indicating in excess of &#x20AC;1.5 billion. We are not attributing value to specific assets, we don't want to disclose, but the bigger of these transactions in our estimates would be Atento and that process is progressing very positively.</p>
