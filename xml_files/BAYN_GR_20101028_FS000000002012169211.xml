          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to Bayer's Investor and Analyst Conference Call on the Third Quarter 2010 Results. Throughout today's recorded presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. The presentation will be followed by a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Alexander Rosar, Head of Investor Relations of Bayer AG. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dave. Ladies and gentlemen, it's a pleasure, a great pleasure, for me to welcome you also on behalf of my colleagues to our conference call, during which we will review our third quarter figures with you.</p>
          <p>With me on the call are Marijn Dekkers, our new CEO, and Werner Baumann, our CFO. HealthCare will be represented by Dr. J&#xF6;rg Reinhardt, CropScience by Sandra Peterson, and MaterialScience by Patrick Thomas.</p>
          <p>Mr. Dekkers will start off our conference call with a brief summary of the developments in the quarter. We assume you have all received and reviewed our newsletters, the briefing documents and the slides. So we will just run you through the main points.</p>
          <p>Before handing over to Mr. Dekkers, I'd like to draw your attention also to the Safe Harbor statement. Thank you. Marijn?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alexander. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. It's also my pleasure to welcome you for the first time as CEO of Bayer. During the last nine months, I had the opportunity to work closely together with Mr. Wenning and develop a deep understanding of Bayer. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Wenning again for the support he has given me personally and also for his excellent leadership of Bayer in the past eight and a half years.</p>
          <p>So let me now briefly review the quarter, starting with the overview. We again increased sales and underlying EBITDA in the third quarter of this year, mainly driven by MaterialScience. Emerging markets contributed 37% to group sales and continued strong business momentum. Our innovation pipeline continues to hold significant promise. We confirm our target to present the Xarelto &#x2013; Rocket AF data during the upcoming American Heart Conference.</p>
          <p>Major progress was achieved in deleveraging the balance sheet with net financial debt being reduced by &#x20AC;1.6 billion in the quarter. Based on the developments so far and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we reiterate the group's full-year financial outlook.</p>
          <p>So let me now briefly look at the key data for the quarter, and in my comments I will focus on the portfolio and currency-adjusted sales figures variation. On slide four, you see group sales of &#x20AC;8.6 billion, advanced by 16% in euros or 8% adjusted for currency gains. Underlying growth was mainly driven by higher volumes. Volumes added almost 6% and selling price increased at nearly 3% to the top-line expansion. Underlying EBITDA, at &#x20AC;4.7 billion, gained 10% due to the positive business strengths at MaterialScience and positive currency effect. Currency effect improved underlying EBITDA by &#x20AC;150 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>We increased our R&amp;D investments by 80 million in the quarter. This underscores the confidence in our new products and our new R&amp;D pipeline.</p>
          <p>The quarter was hampered by special charges totaling &#x20AC;436 million. These were related to litigation in the U.S. Of this amount, 386 million were mainly attributable to an intended settlement program at CropScience in collection with litigations concerning genetically modified rice. Special charges of 50 million were taken at HealthCare in connection with litigations concerning YAZ and Yasmin. Core earnings per share rose by 22% to &#x20AC;0.95.</p>
          <p>On slide five, you see from a regional perspective the strongest growth was achieved in the emerging economies. In Western Europe, business gained 6%, and in the United States business was up 3%. But the emerging markets accounted 37% of group sales. In these markets, we extended our sales by 17% with the strongest growth achieved in the emerging Asian market and Eastern Europe. These figures clearly demonstrate that we are well positioned in the emerging markets and that our significant investments there are really paying off.</p>
          <p>On slide six, you see gross cash flow declined by 25%. The decrease was mainly due to litigation-related provisions, not just reflected in net cash flow. Net cash flow rose by nearly 3% and more efficient working capital management also contributed to the increase.</p>
          <p>Free operating cash flow improved by 6% to almost &#x20AC;1.2 billion. This allowed us to significantly reduce financial debt. Net debt at the end of the quarter was &#x20AC;9.1 billion, down by 1.6 billion compared with the end of the second quarter. This was also helped by positive currency effect; in total, currency changes lowered net debt to &#x20AC;4 billion.</p>
          <p>Now let's look more closely at the trends in our individual businesses, starting with HealthCare on slide seven. The third-quarter performance of HealthCare was mainly impacted by three trends: lower sales in the United States as a result of generic competition for YAZ; very solid expansion of pharmaceutical sales in other countries; and further growth of consumer health. The aggregate effect of these divergent trends within HealthCare was a slight overall increase in sales, a slight shortfall in underlying EBITDA compared to the prior-year period.</p>
          <p>Pharmaceuticals achieved sales of &#x20AC;2.7 billion in the quarter. Sales in the United States fell by 19%. Outside the United States, our pharmaceutical segment business has grown by 5%. Business expanded markedly in the emerging markets. For example, in the People's Republic of China sales advanced by 31%. In Europe, sales were basically flat.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to the key pharma products. Business was <mark type="inaudible" /> expanded slightly. Sales of the YAZ family showed a significant drop of 28%, again due to sharply lower sales in the United States. However, sales of the YAZ family outside the United States increased almost 9%. Kogenate performed very positively, especially in the Americas, with sales up by nearly 7%. At plus 1%, sales of Nexavar were up slightly over the very strong prior-year quarter which benefited from the product's registration in Japan for the treatment of liver cancer in May 2009.</p>
          <p>Mirena was up almost 21%, benefiting from the selling price increases in May. Higher volumes, particularly in China, gave a significant expansion of businesses with Aspirin Cardio. Sales were up almost 13%. Levitra grew 9% and Avalox sales were slightly above the previous year.</p>
          <p>Sales in our consumer health segment rose by nearly 3% in the quarter. Contributing to this performance were the businesses of consumer care and animal health, while at medical care there was a slight drop in sales.</p>
          <p>Due to the business trends I've just described, HealthCare was not quite able to match the prior year level of underlying EBITDA. There, the figure was down by about 4%. Earnings were also diminished by the negative effect of healthcare reform. We also increased marketing expenses and invested more heavily in R&amp;D. By contrast, currency effects had a positive impact.</p>
          <p>So what does our performance so far in 2010 mean for the full year outlook for HealthCare? We continue to anticipate a slight increase in adjusted sales at HealthCare, and are still aiming for underlying EBITDA to reach at least the prior year level. This is in view of the business performance so far and the appreciation of the euro, clearly an ambitious target, but we are working hard to achieve it.</p>
          <p>Now, on expected news flow from our key pharma pipeline assets, we're well aware that what interests you most right now is how things are going with Xarelto and the pharmaceutical pipeline. So where do we stand from this? We're confident that we will be able to present the Rocket data at the American Heart Association session on November 15th. Prior to that, there will be a headline findings release as promised as soon as the data have been evaluated. This publication is now imminent. I trust you will appreciate that we can not comment on the outcome of the trial today and to preempt any speculation, this is neither a positive nor a negative statement.</p>
          <p>So what are our filing plans for Xarelto? We continue to target submission of Xarelto for regulatory approval in <mark type="inaudible" /> before the end of this year in the EU and the U.S. Additionally, we continue to target the first filing in DVT treatment in Europe for this year, so no change in timelines here.</p>
          <p>For the U.S. filing, we are waiting for the EINSTEIN-PE trial which is expected to be completed in the summer of next year. Johnson &amp; Johnson recently confirmed their filing targets in 2012 or possibly late 2011 for the treatment setting including PE.</p>
          <p>As the ATLAS TMI Study 51 in secondary prevention of ACS progresses, we are gaining more visibility on the timeline and now expect to complete this study already in the summer of 2011. Filing in the ACS secondary prevention setting is targeted for 2011.</p>
          <p>The Magellan Phase III trial, in which we have studying Xarelto for prevention of VTE in medically ill hospitalized patients, is now fully enrolled. Data are expected in early 2011 and the filing date here is as well 2011.</p>
          <p>What else is going on beyond Xarelto? We expect VEGF Trap-Eye data from the pivotal Phase III in the web AMD, the so-called VIEW program, before the end of this year and we are targeting a filing in 2011. For Riociguat, the recruitment has been very challenging in the ongoing Phase III studies. A filing for PAH and CTEPH in 2011, therefore, seems unlikely from today's perspective.</p>
          <p>So that's concludes our pipeline update in pharma; let's now move onto CropSciences. CropSciences subgroup had a solid third quarter with gratifying increases in sales and earnings. This resulted mainly from a much more favorable market environment with higher demand due in part significantly lower inventories in the distribution channels and higher commodity prices. With selling prices stable overall, sales were up by 8%.</p>
          <p>Sales of Crop Protection in North America rose by 49%, albeit against an unusually weak prior year quarter. Our sales in Latin America grew by 8% due to the recovery of the Crop Protection market. Sales of our Crop Protection products in the Asia-Pacific region rose by 5%. We registered gain for our insecticides and fungicides businesses.</p>
          <p>Only in the Europe region business was slightly down. CS sales were lower by 3% compared to the prior year quarter. The reason was this &#x2013; for this was the sharp decline for seed treatment products, particularly in France and Germany. In our herbicides business, however, we saw a positive side to the fall season particularly for serial herbicides.</p>
          <p>Sales of the biosciences business unit came in at &#x20AC;86 million, some 53% ahead of the prior year period. In an overall positive market environment, we could grow in all segments in regions. This was particularly due to higher sales in cotton, canola and vegetable seeds.</p>
          <p>Sales of the environmental science business unit declined by 3.5%. Business with products of prime consumers was weaker due mainly to unfavorable weather conditions in the United States. Underlying EBITDA of the CropSciences subgroup rose by nearly 17% in the third quarter. This was mainly because of the growth in business at crop protection and positive currency effect of certain increased expenditures for research and development at bioscience.</p>
          <p>What are the implications of the performance so far this year for the CropSciences outlook? In the currently positive market environment, we plan to grow fourth quarter adjusted sales at CropSciences compared to the prior year period. Against the background of the weak first half, we continue to anticipate that sales for the full year 2010 will come in slightly below the prior year level. We expect a substantial year-on-year decline in underlying EBITDA.</p>
          <p>So that's CropSciences. Let's now move to MaterialScience. MaterialScience once again reported a strong quarter. Sales were almost &#x20AC;2.7 billion, which was 23% above the prior year quarter and almost exactly equal to the second quarter of 2010. Underlying EBITDA improved significantly compared to both the prior year end quarter and the preceding quarter.</p>
          <p>So we met our sales target for the third quarter and in fact exceeded our EBITDA target. This growth followed from much higher demand in our main customer industry, the biggest gains in absolute terms being in construction and the automotive sector. The higher demand versus volumes in all products groups and regions and volume growth lifted sales by 13%. Higher selling prices had a 10% positive effect on sales.</p>
          <p>The remarkably improved business situation was also reflected in earnings. Third quarter underlying EBITDA of MaterialScience rose significantly to &#x20AC;409 million with higher volumes and selling prices offsetting the increase in raw material costs.</p>
          <p>As far as the outlook of MaterialScience is concerned, we remain optimistic for our business in the fourth quarter as well. In this period, which is normally weaker for seasonal reasons, we expect that sales and EBITDA before special items will be well below the strong third quarter of 2010 but significantly above the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year 2010, we anticipate sales in the region of &#x20AC;10 billion and roughly threefold growth in EBITDA before special items to more than &#x20AC;1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Overall, the materials business &#x2013; MaterialScience business has recovered impressively and more quickly than expected. This makes it likely that we can meet our original target of returning to the pre-crisis level at MaterialScience by 2012, now much earlier than planned.</p>
          <p>So let's take a look at slide 11 with the outlook for the remaining 2010. We remain optimistic for the full year 2010 and we confirm the full year guidance for the Bayer Group. We continue to target portfolio and currency adjusted sales growth of more than 5%. It remains our aim to increase EBITDA before special items to more than &#x20AC;7 billion and we continue to expect our core earnings per share will improve by more than 15%.</p>
          <p>So in summary, Bayer again increased sales in underlying EBITDA in the third quarter, mainly driven by the strong recovery of MaterialScience and positive currency effects; and we are working on addressing the current challenges, business challenges, particularly at HealthCare and CropSciences.</p>
          <p>That concludes my remarks. We are now happy to answer your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from Mr. Fabian Wenner. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon. It's Fabian Wenner from UBS. Thanks for taking one question. Marijn, I wanted you to maybe qualify your quotation on Bloomberg as the market might have misinterpreted that. It says that you're seriously looking into M&amp;A opportunities and we remember from your presentation of September that you're being cautious about releveraging the company given the A minus rating. Can you just maybe give us a few words on that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, Fabian. I'm glad you're asking that question because the comment was taken somewhat out of context, I must say. The top priority for Bayer is to drive growth from our new products and pipeline in the future. That's the top priority; innovation is what we're all about and our business model is to innovate, develop new products and as such drive growth and shareholder value.</p>
          <p>That doesn't mean that selected acquisitions are not important and we certainly have our eyes open for when good opportunities come along, but I want to emphasize that acquisition at the moment is not a priority for the Bayer Group. We do not feel with this portfolio we need to do something big, for instance, really fast, and that's what I've said before. So, yes, of course, we have over the next years financial room for acquisitions, but it's not that we are sitting here wondering what we are going to buy tomorrow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you be willing to quantify that additional spend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That additional...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The amount of money you're willing to put into bolt-on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. That's very hard to do. As you know, we still have 9 billion of debt, which is a significant amount of money, obviously. And we're also very keen on our A rating. So I don't really want to quantify what we could spend over what period of time, but as we are paying off our debt and to continuously successful work our working capital management as we're doing, we'll create more room for ourselves to be more ambitious on the acquisition front.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Richard Vosser. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Richard Vosser from J.P. Morgan. Thanks for taking my questions. Three questions, please. First question on the margin targets being taken essentially down slightly in the HealthCare. You've mentioned R&amp;D and U.S. generics, but -- and obviously the currency impact, but I just wondering if you'd give more details on what's changed since the second quarter that caused you to be concerned. Is there any underlying changes like more R&amp;D spend or &#x2013; because you knew about R&amp;D and YAZ generics at the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Second question just on the YAZ genericization and the impact on the launches of Natazia and YAZ <mark type="inaudible" />, just wondered if you'd give us an idea on how you're seeing the reaction to those products given the generics going in the market for the market leader, YAZ.</p>
          <p>And then moving to a question just on MaterialScience, you've mentioned MaterialScience, that you'd be able to reach the pre-crisis levels earlier than 2012. I just wondered if you could give us an early read on how the demand trends might be looking early into 2011 as you look from here. I understand, obviously, the visibility is not that great, but any color you can give going forward would be great. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you for those questions. So the first question you asked is on margins in HealthCare, so J&#xF6;rg Reinhardt will answer that question. J&#xF6;rg.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marijn. There is no significant change in an underlying trend here. If you have heard, we are still aiming for the original target for HealthCare. But as we stated, it will be or it is increasingly ambitious to actually achieve it, which doesn't mean that we might not achieve it at the end of the day.</p>
          <p>What you are seeing is increases in expenditures in R&amp;D and some marketing expenditures. There, we obviously are preparing for a number of launches and we did prepare for some in the U.S. for the Natazia launch and also the VS launch. But we also do significantly increase our presence, for example, in China where we believe that there is still significant growth to come in the next few years and where we have seen that we might have to intensify our investment, especially in the sales force and commercial side a little bit.</p>
          <p>Other than that, I mean, as you know we have a quite rich pipeline, especially for Xarelto. But not only for Xarelto; the expenditures in R&amp;D will continue to be at a reasonably high level. But there is no underlying or significant change in the underlying trend.</p>
          <p>With regard to the U.S., and this was your second question, yes, the genericization, well, as you've seen we have launched Natazia in June and we are about to launch or we are currently launching VS. It's a little bit early to give any, let's say, concrete feedback or impact on how these products are going to do in the U.S. But we see a very positive and very open environment in the U.S., more so than in Europe for VS, I have to say. So we are quite confident that we are able to gain back market share in the overall OC market in the U.S., but it is simply too early to quantify that to any further extent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, J&#xF6;rg. So the third question was, would we dare to give an outlook for the next few months on the business environment in MaterialScience; Patrick Thomas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marijn, yeah; hi, Richard. Visibility, as you know, is probably limited at the moment to three to four months. In talking to customers at the moment, very few of them talk beyond the end of this year, to be honest. So I turn rather to sort of major market trends and what's going on in terms of the changes, for example, in the government subsidy programs that have been running through the crisis.</p>
          <p>What's interesting in China is that the appliance industry program which in China is known as appliances to the countryside is actually being extended for another year, which means it will run through to the end of 2011. And the Eco-Point program in Japan is also being extended further. So we're seeing some signs, particularly in China, that the automotive and the appliance industry, which are the two most important for us, are being pushed hard. They're tending to cool off a bit on the construction industry.</p>
          <p>So it's a mixed picture. Looking at the programs that support growth, the fundamental drivers are still in place. The drive to improve energy efficiency, light weighting vehicles are still the main trends. So I see no reason to doubt that customers will continue in the first quarter as they are now in the final quarter of the year.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Sachin Jain. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Sachin Jain from Merrill Lynch. Three pipeline-related questions if I may. Firstly, we're obviously awaiting the AF data without kind of, I guess you wouldn't give a peak sales estimate. I am interested in your thoughts on how your peak sales potential splits AF versus non-AF indications, just percentage of each if you would be willing to discuss that.</p>
          <p>Secondly we've had Pradaxa pricing released in the market recently. I wonder if you can provide some comments on that price relative to existing Xarelto prices and how much flex you think you may have around that, dependent on whatever data you see.</p>
          <p>And then finally on Riociguat, I wonder if you could just provide some color on the extent of problems you're having in patient recruitment. How much is the delay we're looking at and do you think that can be fixed? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Regarding peak sales potential for Xarelto, I mean, you will probably understand that the current sort of time being when we don't have all data in house it's actually very difficult to make any assessment or prediction as to how the potential of Xarelto will split between the different indications. But obviously, as you very well know, the AS indication is likely to have the biggest impact on overall potential for Xarelto and that will to a large extent depend on the data which we'll hopefully get very soon and that hopefully be good.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, of course ACS is in the &#x2013; is an interesting opportunity as well and as you assert by the middle of next year we should be able to have those data. Actually when you look at 2011 it's quite a &#x2013; it's going to be a very rich year in terms of filing activity, and our regulatory folks are beefing up their capabilities at the moment to actually be able to deal with all of the necessary activity <mark type="inaudible" /> coming soon.</p>
          <p>Regarding pricing, yes, I mean, of course we saw the Pradaxa price, which was at a high end of our expectations. On the other hand, it's certainly setting an interesting precedent when you compare it to the price level in Europe and I would say that it is certainly at par or maybe even a little bit higher. So I mean, we have not obviously decided on where we are going with Xarelto, but I believe again it will depend on the competitive profile that you'll see with Xarelto that will come out soon.</p>
          <p>Regarding Riociguat, yes, we have encountered accounted significant issues with recruitment which has mainly to do with the fact that a patient that has been or are on PD5 inhibitor are excluded. This has created more headwind than what we would have expected and has apparently led to very slow recruitment rate in a number of countries.</p>
          <p>We have in the meantime adapted the protocol. We have simplified the protocol and we are optimistic that within the next four to five months we have a better assessment as to how long this study will actually take. But it's too early to give you a deadline. I would be willing to take this topic up again at the first-quarter call when we should have a better feeling as to how long the delay will really be.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Craig Maxwell. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. It's Craig Maxwell here from UniCredit. S. couple of questions; firstly, on HealthCare margins, I'm thinking slightly longer term than just next quarter, but over the next couple of years in your planning for Xarelto launch and some of the other major launches you have, I mean, are we looking at significant incremental investment in sales and promotion for the HealthCare division? So are we looking at basically quite a substantial increment there or meaningful increment?</p>
          <p>Then on the other side of the coin, on R&amp;D, you have still got significant studies ongoing but there are some very large studies that are concluding as well over this year and next. So shouldn't we expect a reduction in the absolute R&amp;D spend? If we're not going to, I'm sort of just wondering why.</p>
          <p>I guess just very quickly, you've got another difficult quarter for the diabetes monitoring franchise, so I'd really just like your outlook for that division now as that's progressing. And then lastly on Xarelto, is it safe to assume on the headline press release that we'll get information on both the primary endpoints, that's the safety and the efficacy endpoints?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you for your questions. Regarding margin in HealthCare, I believe your assessment of the situation is very accurate. On the one hand, we are going to have to invest significantly in preparation of these launches. And as you very well know, it's going to be a very competitive marketplace in the next few years, so that from that perspective, the level of investment in marketing and sales is probably going to go up a little bit.</p>
          <p>Comparatively, on the other hand, you're also right that from an R&amp;D perspective we have significant programs that come to an end. However, when you look at a product like Xarelto, it's not going to be over. We certainly know that we will have to continue to invest even after approval of that product; also in clinical trials continuously to keep news flow going.</p>
          <p>So all together, I believe that there is no intention or no opportunity for any new guidance on HealthCare margin. I believe that you may see some shifts between marketing and sales and R&amp;D going forward, but overall we would like to stick to the guidance we gave before.</p>
          <p>Regarding diabetes monitoring, yes, we had another difficult quarter, that especially in the U.S. Actually, outside of the U.S., it's a market which is still nicely developing and growing. In the U.S. we have seen continuous commoditization of the market. We see prices coming down and to some extent also volume coming down, which we are now addressing with quite aggressive program in the next six months. So I hope that we could be able to stop or maybe even convert this trend a little bit in the not too distant future. But it's something that we have right on the top of our list and we monitor very closely.</p>
          <p>Regarding Xarelto headline, it will be a very short headline, as you can probably expect. We'll see what we can finally release but it's going to be very short and concise.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question is from Michael Leuchten from Barclays. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. It's Michael from Barclays Capital, Michael Leuchten. Two big kind of questions, please; one, you were kind enough to give us the currency impact on the group level EBITDA. Could you do the same for pharmaceuticals, please? And then, the tax guidance now for the full year of less than 27%, that may suggest that the tax rate in the fourth quarter is a little bit on the higher end. Is there any reason to believe that going forward the tax rate would be trending up, or is that just an anomaly because of the one-offs in the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Michael, this is Werner Baumann speaking. First, as it comes to your question on foreign exchange, I can give you the EBITDA impact on foreign exchange for HealthCare as a segment, not pharmaceutical specifically. In the third quarter, it has been 88 million, so it's 88 million out of 150 million, Marijn Dekkers called before in his speech.</p>
          <p>Regarding tax guidance and where we are through the first three quarters, yes, as we've commented on, unusually low third quarter which is due to the regional distribution of our results. We expect that to normalize in quarter four. So &#x2013; and at the same time, we do have a structural tax ratio of 28 to 30% in our overall business, which will be somewhat lower for this year.</p>
          <p>So you can expect that we'll come in below 27%, but I can't give you any further guidance on that because, again, it also depends somewhat on the result distribution in quarter four.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Ronald K&#xF6;hler. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. It's Ronald K&#xF6;hler from MainFirst. First question is actually to Bayer CropScience. Q3 was astonishingly on the pricing side for Bayer whereas all the competitors have seen 6 to 7% price declines. Bayer posted zero price declines. On the other hand, there were &#x2013; you were quite weak actually on the volumes with plus 9% where others had between 18 and 29% volume growth. Could you a little bit elaborate on your price volume shifts and how do you see that evolving in the fourth quarter, or potentially also little bit going forward here?</p>
          <p>Second question, also CropScience; more specifically Rice litigation, you posted these special items, 386 million for a settlement? Would that cover, let's say, an almost 100% settlement or is it, let say, just the start of provisions you would expect here for Rice?</p>
          <p>And the third question is actually on currency again, hedging policy; obviously some company has used the significant dip to increase their overall hedgings and the weaknesses of the euro. Did you do the same or how is your current hedging? Is it still, let's say, 50% of next 12 months or any flavors on that would be appreciated. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks Ronald for your questions. The first question on pricing in CropSciences will be answered by Sandy Peterson. Sandy?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for your question, Ronald. I think that we're actually quite satisfied that we have been able to selectively increase pricing for some of our products around the globe, which is an indication that our innovation is working in the marketplace. Clearly, by being able to do that and really in the third quarter this year relative to the third quarter last year see that our prices are flat basically year-over-year, except for in Latin America, where we actually saw some improvement in our pricing. That, in fact, is obviously traded off with some of the volume projections that we've had.</p>
          <p>And our portfolio is clearly different than our competitors and that has also had an impact on where we are seeing the volume increase as being slightly below some of our competition. But net/net I think we're pretty pleased that we've been able to get the pricing in the marketplace for our innovations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. And then the question on the LL Rice reserve, Werner Baumann?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ronald, this is Werner Baumann speaking. Good afternoon. First on the question on the Rice litigation, through the course of the year we have expensed roughly &#x20AC;500 million on the LL Rice conflict. It's about 500 claims and 8,900 farmers which are covered with these claims. Looking at what we have provided for in quarter three, it is for our best estimate on what we would need for a settlement. I can't, however, go into any more detail regarding your question what type of coverage that would mean and I hope you understand that.</p>
          <p>The next question on hedging policy, we do hedge 100% of our book exposure and there has been no change to that policy. Recently, in general looking at our cohort exposure, the anticipated exposure on our business operations, we basically hedge 50% of our foreign exchange from time to time and currency by currency. We might go over that limit; we are hedged at a slightly higher ratio currently, always on a 12 up to 24 months rolling forward in the yen and the dollar. We do, however, not speculate so there is no erratic change on our hedging policy based on, let's say, short term opportunities.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. It's Jo Walton from Credit Suisse. I've got two questions. I wonder whether Sandra Peterson and J&#xF6;rg Reinhardt, both having taken over their divisions relatively recently, could give us their first impressions of those businesses, particularly where you feel that Bayers' strengths and weaknesses are?</p>
          <p>And secondly, I want to return to the longer term margin you've seen on pharmaceuticals. Three of your biggest growth drivers, namely Nexavar, Xarelto and VEGF Trap are partnered with significant profit shares to your partners. As you go forward and those products become a bigger part of the total, how realistic is it for you to sustain the margins for the group?</p>
          <p>And a final, again, follow-on I'm afraid, I wonder if you could give us an idea of the impact of the austerity measures on sales so far this year and what you think a full year of that impact would be next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean &#x2013; with austerity measures, you mean healthcare reforms?</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

          <p>Yes, European healthcare reform.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good, okay. So let's start with Sandy talking about her first impressions of biosciences. Sandy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for your question. So I guess I'll just give you a couple of perspectives. Obviously, these are very early fresh perspectives since I've just taken this role over officially a couple weeks ago. The first thing I would say, which I alluded to actually in my &#x2013; the answer to my last question is that Bayer continues, and in this business in particular, to have an incredibly strong pipeline of innovation. We've launched a number of products in the last couple of years and we have a number of products in the pipeline that we're planning on launching over the next few years.</p>
          <p>And so, our strength and innovation, both in the chemical side of the business but also the other side of the business where we've made decisions to focus on crops and seeds, in those areas where we focus we have been quite successful, I believe, in actually building a nice position in those categories and with the growers. So I would say that I am not surprised at all but I've been very pleased to see that we continue our tradition of having incredibly smart, capable, innovative research and development engine in this business.</p>
          <p>The place where I believe we need to continue to focus our energies and I'm very enthusiastic about doing this, is ensure that we've got the right commercial model and we're really thinking creatively on the ground and working with the growers around the globe. And so I want to make sure we get the most out of our innovation pipeline that we possibly can going forward and so that's the one area where I believe we can do more and I am looking forward to doing that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. J&#xF6;rg, your impressions of HealthCare.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jo, I mean, what I immediately saw when I came here was a very focus on a great pipeline potential that the company has. As you know, we have quite a number of late-stage efforts that develop very nicely and will, hopefully, if they all come through and they all contribute as we expect, will drive sales in this company quite significantly over the next few years. So pipeline is a strong focus. The other one is real good position in emerging markets. As you know, everybody is fighting for positions in emerging markets and as you have already also know Bayer has a good tradition, especially in China but in a number of other Asian markets as well; also in Latin America, Brazil, et cetera. So here we have a starting point that is stronger than many other companies in the field and as you know most of the growth in the pharma industry over the next five to 10 years is going to come from exactly those markets. So a strong starting point is wonderful.</p>
          <p>I've also seen quite a range of very motivated, energetic people here at Bayer that really want to do the best; and they are part of working at Bayer which is a strong asset, I believe, that the company has as well.</p>
          <p>Where I believe we can do a little bit better is our infrastructure. I believe that we have a little bit of potential overlap here in some areas of bio-healthcare, which is something that I believe will have to be addressed and will be addressed in the next 12 months.</p>
          <p>From an overall margin perspective, Jo, yes, you're right that we have a number of sales drivers that are partnered; with reasonable deals, though. And I would expect that the &#x2013; when you look at the totality of the portfolio, where you also need to keep in mind that we have a range of, let's call it, very mature products that keep on growing still, especially driven through sales in emerging markets, which are highly profitable, that the overall mix will enable us to come up with a margin that is still very attractive. And so from that perspective, I think the margin guidance that we have given so far is absolutely adequate, even going forward with a number of partnered products.</p>
          <p>Now healthcare reform was your last question. I believe that from an overall year perspective, we would expect this year to have an overall impact around 160 million, maybe a little bit more than that. When I look at the quarter, third quarter, the impact is around 50 to 60 million. Next year, the full year impact could be a little bit stronger than what I have just mentioned, but it's still a little bit too early; maybe it's going to be between 220, 250 million for next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon; it's Andreas Heine from UniCredit. The first question is again on the litigation, you had this litigation not only this year, but also in recent years there were several things. Is it that the general risk in these businesses, that is CropScience and HealthCare, is increasing or has it to do that it can be follow more closely management wise?</p>
          <p>The second question, in crop protection and the price environment, you refer that you have a different product mix, which has an impact on the price frame. As far as I can see, there seems to be the highest, strongest price pressure on fungicide. Is it that your portion and business in fungicides is less pronounced, especially in the third quarter, and that makes it different? Or is it all over the place that you have a different view on the price trend?</p>
          <p>And last but not least, on MaterialScience, polycarbonate prices came up nicely and probably they contributed also to the earnings improvement from 2Q to 3. Do you think that anything will change when the new plan of your competitor comes on stream next year, or is the market growing strong enough to absorb this capacity? Thank you for taking these questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Andreas, thank you. I'll answer the first question on the litigation and whether or not the litigation is increasing. I think these litigation cases tends to be cases as run over very many years. This whole rice incident really occurred in 2000, at a time that Accensus was still independent in CropSciences, so even before Bayer bought this business, and here we are 10 years later and it is still an actual situation.</p>
          <p>So you have to almost think in five to 10 year periods with some of these litigations rather than whether or not a couple more intense last few quarters is our long lasting cases sometimes that at some point reach a point where they come to maybe a settlement or maybe not; or a judgment in the courts.</p>
          <p>The question around the product mix in CropSciences; Sandy, can you answer that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks for the question. I would say that generally speaking it is due to a difference in our product mix. So, for example, we clearly were not directly impacted by the glyphosate price declines the way that some of our competitors were. And on this &#x2013; you asked also specifically a question related to fungicides. Our fungicides portfolio, we've been fortunate to be able to hold up our pricing in our fungicide portfolio, probably better than some of our competitors. And as you mentioned, there has been significant competition in that marketplace around the globe and in particular in some markets such as Latin America. But we've been able to sustain our pricing pretty well across the globe in that category.</p>
          <p>And then clearly our insecticide portfolio was quite strong and robust and is appreciated by most of our competitors. So I would say that it is somewhat due to a difference in product mix as well as strength in different markets around the globe that really has changes in the pricing mix. But I would also hope, as I had also said, that is because our products are more greatly appreciated in the marketplace for what they do for the grower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. And then, Patrick, MaterialScience prices, particularly polycarbonates, for the new capacity coming out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the question and I think you've seen that quarter 2 was in fact the strongest sales in our polycarbonate business in history, and certainly the price increases have been put through on a fairly regular basis this year. I think you can also see that on the 1st of July the price increase which we posted triggered some pre-buying in the second quarter, which took away some volume in the third quarter. And we did actually have some shutdowns for routine maintenance during the third quarter. So I think overall it represents very good results.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, in terms of growth dynamics, I think historically this is a market that's grown at 6 to 7%. During this year, we will see growth well above 10%, and I expect that to continue into the next year in the range of 5 to 6%. With those sort of growth rates, new capacity can be absorbed relatively easily in line with the market growth. And I think there is also some uncertainty around the timing of that new capacity coming on stream. We have announced that we will increase our capacity in Asia by over 300,000 tons by 2015. And that seems a prudent growth pattern to be following based upon the current development of the market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Jeremy Redenius from Sanford Bernstein. I have three questions, one for each business. Going back to CropScience, having seen better pricing but less volume growth in peers recently, would you be comfortable seeing that similar type of development in future quarters; that is kind of the price versus volume trade-off?</p>
          <p>Second on MaterialScience, could you comment about inventory restocking this year? Has it been contributing significantly to this year's growth?</p>
          <p>And then, third, on bio HealthCare, how far are you from Phase I trials for your next long-acting Factor 8 candidates given risks that coginate from attempts by Biogen and Novo to develop their own long-acting Factor 8 products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Crop price volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So obviously my answer to your question is we never like to trade off price and volumes and we would like, even given the focus on our innovation and our pipeline, to be able to get pricing in the marketplace for the better quality of our products and while we're doing that increase our volume significantly. So I think this quarter it's hard to say what the &#x2013; this is probab &#x2013; who knows whether it's a trend in the marketplace long-term. There are a number of things that have happened in dynamics of changes of prices in products. Some of our competitors' products becoming generic sort of clearly impacted the short term. But I &#x2013; we believe we need to have healthy margins in our business and to do that we've got to have the right pricing profile as well as continue to grow the business on a volume basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. MaterialScience, inventory restocking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jeremy, I think clearly there has been some inventory restocking effect although in our business the amount of inventory that can be held is always very restricted. And I think most of the supply chains we're feeding into are relatively lean and efficient anyway. So if you think about the car industry, there's not lot of stock hold up in that industry anyhow. So I think there is clearly some effect; you saw it in quarter three; there's obviously been a continuation in growth in quarter three. And I think the effect is largely gone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to the long-acting Factor 8 formulation, we are about to initiate a Phase I program with a new version, a new approach and we're actually looking at a range of new approaches which may lead to initiation in with one or two additional programs in the remainder of 2011 as well. So I believe we really see the need to come up to something that is developed quickly here and we will put all emphasis behind that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Florent Cespedes, Exane BNP Paribas. Thank you for taking my questions. First of all, on Betaferon, could we have an update of your view on the trend for 2011 for this product and what are your plans to remain present on the MS market?</p>
          <p>And secondly, a question on the external growth opportunity in healthcare; could you share with us in which segments do you see the best opportunities? Is it in the small drug discovery area or more on the established specialty pharma company that could complement your portfolio? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, this is J&#xF6;rg; let me take your Betaferon question. Obviously, the market is going to be impacted by the introduction of Gelenia. Also, I believe regardless to whom you talk it's still little bit early to predict exactly as to what the impact will be. What we certainly know from our, let's call it, patient population is that people are very happy with the efficacy and also the safety and tolerability profile of Betaferon, You may have seen recently publication of data that showed that after a 20 year period, we do have significant improvement in mortality for those patients on Betaferon, which of course further supports the confidence that patients have in this product.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, we have seen a high single-digit decline this year across the world, and I would not be surprised if that trend is also continued, maybe a little bit stronger even in 2011. But at least we really have to see how Gelenia will fit in the overall picture; whether it's going to actually expand the market as many people believe, which I personally share. I believe that there are still significant patients untreated that may benefit from another treatment. And to what extent it's replacing maybe second and third line products, we'll have to see as well.</p>
          <p>So overall we are determined to fight in this market. We have a good product that has shown great long-term data and is well accepted by the patients, so we will certainly not give away market share easily here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have, J&#xF6;rg, any plans to increase your presence by acquiring some products or partnerships in this area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This area is an attractive area and as you can imagine everybody out there in the field is certainly looking after attractive assets all the time and so do we. And I believe we'll simply have to see how this field is developing over time. But at the moment I can't give you anymore comment on any concrete plans there.</p>
          <p>But we will certainly continue to beef up our efforts in terms of services that we provide to patients; but we see nice growth of the product in Asia-Pacific and Latin American markets. Main impact is actually currently in the U.S. and to some extent in Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe just a follow-up on the Asia-Pacific and Lat-Am performance; do you believe it is sustainable as the new products will be launched also in these regions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean that's something that we'll have to see. As I've mentioned earlier, we have a very strong presence, especially in markets like China and also Brazil, where I believe that we can capitalize on that presence and the good name, also, the good brand name that Bayer has as a global brand. So I believe we're in a good position to defend but let's talk again in a year and let's see where we are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then Florent, I will address your question about acquisitions. We've said in the past and we're consistent that the priorities for acquisitions for Bayer would be in the area of HealthCare and/or CropSciences and then particularly on the Bayer sciences side of CropScience.</p>
          <p>And yeah, I don't want to speculate about would it then be this area of HealthCare or the other, because as you know on acquisitions a lot of that depends also on what is for sale. And in the end, you can only buy what is for sale and its very hard to predict what is going to be sale, but we keep our eyes open and we are evaluating opportunities as they became available.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Christian Faitz. Please state your name, company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Christian Faitz from Macquarie. I have a couple of questions on CropScience and one on MaterialScience. In terms of CropScience, what is your best assessment of pricing power going into the first quarter 2011? Also, in terms of how do you see channel inventories compared to last year, particularly in the U.S.? What do you believe farmers are willing to accept higher prices given the recent rally in agricultural commodities?</p>
          <p>And then also, I know from the past that your chlorphosinate products were priced at round about a 30% premium to glyphosate. Is that still the case or has the premium expanded simply because chlorphosinate didn't fall as much as glyphosate?</p>
          <p>In MaterialScience, just one simple question, what is driving the demand from construction? Is it purely insulation or are there other materials there, that polyurethanes or polycarbonates are used at present? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Pricing in CropSciences, Sandy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So thanks for your question. So I wish I had a crystal ball and could answer this question, but I'll just give you some general feeling of &#x2013; obviously, with commodity prices where they are today and if they stay at that level, we're cautiously optimistic that we'll be able to maintain pricing in the marketplace and potentially in certain cases be able to increase pricing in the marketplace going into 2011. But as you well know, it's dependent upon lots of factors, one of them being just whether commodity prices are going to stay at this level, and obviously I can't &#x2013; we can't complete this call without me mentioning the W word, which is the weather will clearly have an impact on whether the growing season is what we think it might be next year. So we're cautiously optimistic on pricing going in 2011.</p>
          <p>As it relates to your question around channel inventory, from everything we know at the moment in the U.S., in particular, channel inventories are &#x2013; look like they're at a pretty healthy level right now. So that also makes us cautiously optimistic about the beginning of the growing season of 2011.</p>
          <p>So that is &#x2013; I think I've answered your first set of questions. Your second question is around the pricing differential between gluphosinate and of glyphosate. We still do have a price premium in the marketplace because we believe the product commands a price premium in the marketplace because of it's ability to have a much broader impact on killing weeds where appropriate.</p>
          <p>So I can't specifically answer the question on a macro basis because it's market-by-market specific, but we have been able to maintain a price differential. In the U.S. earlier this year, we did make one adjustment to our pricing of gluphosinate to partly address some of the challenges with price, you know, the decrease in pricing in herbicides across the U.S. marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Okay, thank you. And then MaterialScience's growth coming out of construction for polyurethane or also out of mattresses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Christian. Yeah, you're right with the construction and to give you one example, the construction growth is being triggered by a number of new breakthroughs in PIR systems, Polyisocyanurate Foam Systems, which have good, very good fire properties. <mark type="inaudible" /> group has just managed to get approval from Future Mutual, the big insurance group, for use of 200 millimeter insulation panels for unlimited high construction, which is a major breakthrough for use of polyurethanes in tall buildings; and opens up a new segment in the market, particularly in the U.S. And as Future Mutual is the main insurer for these buildings, that will be accepted around the world.</p>
          <p>Some of the non-insulation applications driven by regulation, again in the U.S. Congress passed the Composite Wood Act, which mitigates formaldehyde emissions from forming composite wood panels. This is particularly in orientated strand board, medium density fiberboard and also in particle board. That means you have to substitute your <mark type="inaudible" /> formaldehyde resin by NDI based wood binders, and that means that unprecedented growth driver because you're replacing an existing material in a very large market.</p>
          <p>And the third area I'd probably highlight, which is beyond insulation, is in the coatings area where the increased trend toward cleaner technologies, low-VOC, low polymer content coatings in the construction industry and the steel coating industry is also picking up well. So again another substitutional effect where you're taking out traditional sulphur-based coatings and replacing them with water-borne dispersions made out of aliphatic polyurethane systems.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Cornelia Thomas from WestLB here. I've only got one question left, actually, and it's just I wanted to double-check something which I couldn't quite hear during the conference call because there was such an echo on the line.</p>
          <p>It's about your plan for filing for Xarelto; did I understand this correctly that you are planning to submit Xarelto for DVT treatment and stroke prevention in AS patients in the fourth quarter in Europe and that you will be waiting to submit these filings in the U.S. until sort of mid-2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. That is not right. The intention is to file in Europe and in the U.S. before the end of the year, and the comment made on waiting for 2011 was related to the VTE treatment, prevention treatment, waiting for the EINSTEIN-PE data that would only be available by summer of next year. But the Rocket data will be submitted in Europe and in the U.S. before the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But the filing for DVT prevention has now been postponed until mid-2011; is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Only in the U.S. because in Europe we will still file before the end of the year. The difference is that in Europe we will file without the EINSTEIN-PE data. In the U.S., J&amp;J has decided that they want to wait for those data. So that's why the U.S. filing is with the EINSTEIN-PE data by second half of next year. In Europe, we will file without these data still this year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just to confirm, was the initial plan to file for DVT prevention -- wasn't that also by the end of this year?</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen; Martin Fl&#xFC;ckiger of Helvea. Three questions, please. Firstly, on CropScience you were mentioning the W word as you call it, interestingly enough. I was wondering whether you could give us an update on your impressions on weather and particularly on disease pressure in Latin America so far into the fourth quarter. I realize it's still early days but maybe there are some interesting indications there.</p>
          <p>Then on CropScience again, I realize that it's difficult to give exact forecast for margin, for expected margins going forward, but I was just wondering whether you could specify your guidance on profitability in CropScience a little bit more and particularly whether you could indicate a margin range for 2010 for CropScience.</p>
          <p>Then finally, my third question on MaterialScience, I would be very much interested also to see what kind of momentum we saw on a sequential basis in the sales price development, if you could indicate a number there quarter on quarter. And also, with regards to the developments in the raw material price area, whether you could provide us there with a quarter-on-quarter increase rate as well as an outlook on raw material prices going into Q4 and the full year 2011, that would be very helpful. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First our meteorologist.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so I &#x2013; it's a great question. I wish I had a perspective on diseases in Latin America through the end of the year but I really don't. I mean, what I can tell you, which is clearly you already know, is that the beginning of the third quarter was a little dry but it's been raining recently. So I think we all are feeling like there's no indication that we have that weather will be a problem through the end of this year in Latin America. But early days; hard to tell.</p>
          <p>As it relates to margin, I can't give you a perspective on the 2010 where we're going to end up the year. Clearly we're going to continue to work on having healthy margins in our business, but long term our guidance has not changed. Our long-term guidance for this business remains 23% to 25% EBITDA margin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Martin's first question was to do with price momentum. Of course, it's different in each of the sections of business. In MDI, price improvement is slowly and steadily moving through and I expect that to continue as the market tightens. On TDI, we saw a cycle which was very tight in the second quarter and seasonally less tight in the third quarter and typically the prices follow that supply and demand relationship. And our poly-oil business, for the polyurethane business, we're seeing continuous price improvement. And on polycarbonates, the prices have continued to improve and will probably now stay at those sort of levels looking forward.</p>
          <p>On raw materials, just in a very macro sense, if we look at full-year 2010 we would expect to see overall raw material prices higher than 2009, and we currently expect that to be a negative value of about 0.3 billion; that's 300 million.</p>

          <p>Hi. This is Angel for Jason Zhang from BMO Capital Markets. Could you provide us some updates on Nexavar reimbursement progress in China and South Korea? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I can give you updates in &#x2013; on China. As you know, we have filed for reimbursement some time ago; we are still waiting for the approval. The decision is still pending. Of course, we are hopeful that it happen somewhen in 2011 but I can't give you an exact date. And I'm afraid on South Korea I'm currently not in a position to give you an answer but we can certainly provide that at a later point.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Andrew Benson. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Andrew Benson from Citi. Funny enough, most of my questions have been answered. The only one I've got left is -- in the MaterialSciences -- is if you can give us an idea of the supply-side growth of those four key products into 2011. You mentioned you are bringing on stream 300,000 tons of polycarbonate in Asia over the next five years. But just into 2011 what the incremental size of additions are likely to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Andrew, the polycarbonate side obviously is the Saudi Cayen facility which will come on stream sometime in the next 12 months. We get <mark type="inaudible" /> clear; that I referred to earlier.</p>
          <p>On the TDI side, we will bring on during middle of next year the TDI facility in China to 250,000 tons. It's possible there may be another plant brought on stream at a similar time in Hungary, but that again is not certain. On MDI there are no real significant plans that we can see; and on poly-oil, things are relatively tight at the moment.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>The next question is Mr. Jean De Watteville. Please state your name, company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Jean De Watteville, Nomura. Three question on CropScience, please. First, question is on the bioscience R&amp;D &#x2013; R&amp;D expense entry that impacted margin this quarter. Can you just quantify the impact and more importantly can you just quantify the budget for R&amp;D increase going forward?</p>
          <p>Second question on the litigation once again. I mean you have a provision of approximately about $700 million, which is a big amount compared to the value of the U.S. rice production. Can you just help us to understand how the compensation are calculated please, just to measure the risk. We obviously know that depending on the core decision that there is a very wide range of numbers from $3.5 million to $20,000. But on what basis are they calculated would be useful.</p>
          <p>The third question is on Crop Protection pricing again. Sorry to ask the question once again. We clearly understand the difference of mix here and the lack of glyphosate and so on, but it seems that even excluding glyphosate your pricing is better. I just want to clarify, should we understand that you have been initiated price increase as you have been the first one in taking price increases, and the reason your confidence of the success of this price strategy that your competitors are following you now; just a clarification? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, my suggestion is that the bioscience R&amp;D question and the pricing question for Crop Protection we take first and then we'll do LL Rice with Werner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks for your questions. So as you know our overall R&amp;D expenditures across the enterprise are budgeted to be about &#x20AC;737 million. In that number is a combination of things. One is there is a portfolio change from last year, which has to do with the Athenos acquisition, which represents about 23 million of that. And then in addition to that there are some slight other increases in the biosciences budget year-over-year that have impacted the business, as well as there's some currency impact. So there has been some impact from both of those things, the total net impact on our margins through &#x2013; actually through the first three quarters of this year.</p>
          <p>As it relates to the pricing question, I have absolutely on clue what my competitors are doing in the marketplace specifically. What I would just tell you is that we've been trying to hold our pricing and we have, as I said earlier, in cases where we're brining new products to the marketplace we've been successful in certain instances to actually be able to command a slightly higher price then we had in the past. And that's what as much as I can say on price right now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Jean, I'll give you my answer in two pieces. One is what we had provided for during the year reflects our best assessment of the current exposure we have and what we believe we need at this time to provide for the exposure we have.</p>
          <p>When it comes to your second part of the question on how these claims are calculated, I think first of all I'd say that of course we don't agree at all with some of the same construction but at the same time you can understand that that is a big business in the U.S. and people are very creative in creating bigger and bigger claim theories; that's what has happened during the course of the years. And different elements such as impact on commodity markets, of course the acreage affected, what the length of the effect people assume for the construction of their claim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. So I didn't get the last part of it. It's the length of the...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the length of the effects people assume...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...it is to be seen in the market. Yeah, that's what people use, among other things; but these are the things, the most important elements when they make their claim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the base of the calculation is lost revenue, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can't go into more detail on it. There are more elements than lost revenue; there are <mark type="inaudible" /> and what have you. So there's a &#x2013; quite a bunch of elements people use in order to construct their claim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, okay. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Jack Scannell from Sanford. Just following up with a brief clarification request on your comments on the impact of health reform. The question you were asked was posed in terms of austerity measures, which I think a lot of us apply to when thinking about European governments. You answered the question using the terminology of healthcare reform, which I think many of us apply to the legislation passed in the U.S. Can I just confirm the 220 or 250 million range you alluded to includes both?</p>
