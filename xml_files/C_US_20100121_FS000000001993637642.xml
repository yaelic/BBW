          <p>Thank you, operator, good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CFO, John Gerspach, will speak first. Then Eric Aboaf, our Treasurer, will take you through the investor presentation, which is available for download on our website, Citigroup.com, on the Investor Relations home page. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions.</p>
          <p>Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements. Citi's financial results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our SEC filings for a description of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ from expectations.</p>
          <p>With that said, let me turn it over John.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ilene, and good morning everyone. We're very pleased to be hosting our fixed income investor review this quarter. Last quarter, we discussed some of our key accomplishments, particularly our strong capital position, robust structural liquidity, and disciplined balance sheet management. This quarter, we are going to update you on our progress in those areas as well as provide you with increased transparency into how we are transforming our balance sheet. This morning, Eric Aboaf, our Treasurer, is going to take you through some specifics on credit fundamentals, our capital position, and liquidity profile, and then discuss our funding plan.</p>
          <p>Many of you may have joined us on Tuesday's earnings call, and there are some key points from that call that I would like to reemphasize to start us off here on slide one. 2009 was a year of dramatic progress for Citigroup. The year was capped off by a repayment of TARP and the exiting of the loss sharing agreement with the U.S. government near the end of the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>We are one of the best capitalized financial institutions in the world. Capital, liquidity, and reserves are all very strong. We have a crystal clear strategy with a demonstrated ability to execute. Our core businesses remain strong. The cost of doing business has been substantially reduced as the overall expense base is down. However, we have begun to make targeted investments in our Citicorp businesses.</p>
          <p>As a result of these steps, Citigroup had managed revenues of 91 billion for the entire year; expenses of 48 billion for the year, reflecting a reduction of 15 billion from the peak run rate of 63 billion in the fourth quarter of '07; head count reductions from 375,000 at the peak in 2008 to 265,000 at the end of '09; asset reductions down 502 billion from their 2008 peak.</p>
          <p>In Citicorp, we had record securities and banking revenues in 2009, up 11% over the prior year, an increase in deposits of 62 billion in 2009. We enter 2010 with a very strong foundation as a result of the work done in 2009 with a strong franchise and powerful operating businesses in Citicorp. Credit fundamentals appear to be stabilizing, particularly internationally, but U.S. consumer credit remains an issue. We had our second consecutive quarter of declining net credit losses, and non-accrual loans declined slightly this quarter for the first time in this cycle.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide two, as I mentioned on Tuesday, we had a few significant items which were reflected in our fourth-quarter results that you can see here. First, we booked an $8 billion pre-tax loss on debt extinguishment related to the repayment of the 20 billion of TARP trust preferred securities. Second, we recorded a 2.1 billion pre-tax loss in connection with our exiting from the loss sharing agreement with the U.S. government. Third, we had a negative CVA [Credit Value Adjustment] of 1.8 billion, consisting of two items: a $949 million charge principally in securities and banking, driven by tightening on our own credit spreads in the fourth quarter; and an $840 million pre-tax adjustment to our CVA balance, reflecting a correction to the calculation of CVA for our Fair Value Option debt.</p>
          <p>Now turning to slide three, in the fourth quarter we reported revenues of 5.4 billion. Excluding the losses related to TARP repayment and the exit from the loss sharing agreement, our revenues would have been 15.5 billion. Operating expenses were 12.3 billion, up modestly from third quarter levels, mainly due to higher repositioning charges and FX impact. Provisions for credit losses, claims, and benefits of 8.2 billion were down 10% over last quarter, reflecting lower net credit losses and lower reserve build.</p>
          <p>We reported a net loss of 7.6 billion in the fourth quarter. The loss per share was $0.33 based on average shares outstanding of 23.4 billion. End of period shares totaled 28.5 billion. Excluding the losses related to TARP repayment and the exit from the loss sharing agreement, our net loss would have been 1.4 billion or $0.06 per share.</p>
          <p>Just a few additional observations on the quarter, and then I'm going to turn it over to Eric. Outside the U.S., particularly in Asia and Latin America, we can see that economic recovery has begun to take hold. Our businesses in these two regions combined to produce 85% of our reported net income in Citicorp for the quarter. The recovery is also clearly visible in our international regional consumer banking businesses as reported revenues increased, credit losses decreased, and delinquencies improved. We also saw growth in all key business drivers.</p>
          <p>Now let me ask Eric to update you on our management strategy, credit fundamentals, important shifts in our structural liquidity, our strong funding positions, and significant capital strength. Then he and I will be happy to take your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. Let me turn to slide four and remind you of our management strategy. Our strategy continues to be to leverage Citi's historic strengths as a global bank and our strong positioning in growing segments of financial services, while at the same time shifting away from businesses that are too asset intensive or too reliant on wholesale funding.</p>
          <p>To execute this strategy, we have a group of businesses under the header of Citicorp, as we show on this chart. They are global in nature and diversified across consumer, institutional, and services revenue pools. As an example, our Transaction Services business, which provides global and regional multinational corporations with payment services and treasury solutions, continues to deliver strong earnings, as you may have seen in Tuesday's earnings review. As another example, our international consumer banking businesses, which leverage our geographic footprint in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, had a solid revenue quarter while credit costs were down 19 to 20%.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we have focused part of our organization under the header of Citi Holdings, on the right, to wind down and shed businesses that were more product driven than client driven. This includes managing some good businesses that we don't see as core to our strategy as well as derisking the balance sheet and redeploying the assets to Citicorp. To give you a sense of our progress, Citi Holdings now represents 29% of our assets compared to approximately 41% at the start of 2008.</p>
          <p>I think it's very important to reiterate what you have heard me say before. There is not a legal separation between Citicorp and Holdings, though our debt will continue to be supported by all of Citigroup's businesses.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page five, which summarizes our asset trends. A key tenet of the Citicorp/Citi Holdings strategy is to manage the balance sheet by reducing assets in Citi Holdings and redeploying them as we see growth opportunities in Citicorp. As you can see here, from the first quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of 2009, we focused on slimming down and derisking our balance sheet across all our businesses and reduced assets by over $300 billion. During 2009, we continued this asset reduction in Citi Holdings and started to make select reinvestments in our Citicorp businesses. Clearly, we are making headway.</p>
          <p>As another barometer of progress, cash and deposits at the banks decreased as a percentage of assets to 10.4% this quarter as we redeployed some cash into investment securities. Our cash position affords us the flexibility to invest in earning assets, particularly in Citicorp, and to strategically retire liabilities, a topic which I'll come back to in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Given the importance of the economic cycle on our earnings, please turn to slide six, which shows total Citigroup credit provisions. Total provisions were $8.2 billion in the fourth quarter, down 10% sequentially, driven by a 10% decline in net credit losses to $7.1 billion. Our loan loss reserve build decreased by 6% to 755 million, and we recorded a $294 million provision for policyholder benefits and claims. This is the second consecutive quarterly reduction in total credit provisions, as John noted earlier.</p>
          <p>At the bottom right, you can see that the majority of credit costs are generated by our consumer businesses, which declined by 4% to $7.4 billion in the fourth quarter. I'll discuss consumer credit trends in more detail in a minute.</p>
          <p>At the top right, you can see that corporate credit costs were $819 million in the fourth quarter, down 44% sequentially. The declining credit cost reflects continued stabilization in credit quality across most segments of our corporate loan portfolio as well as a decline in loan balances. Our corporate non-accrual loans declined by 8% to $13.5 billion in the fourth quarter, but remain at historically high levels. Consistent with the last quarter, over two-thirds of our non-accrual book is current and continues to make their contractual payments. While we are encouraged by signs of stabilization in corporate credit quality, we obviously remain vigilant in monitoring the portfolio and reserve levels.</p>
          <p>Now turning to consumer credit trends on slide seven, in keeping with our strategy to derisk the balance sheet, our consumer loan portfolio continued to decline in the fourth quarter across our businesses. End of period loans of $424 billion are down $127 billion from peak levels of early 2008. These reductions are driven in part by tightening underwriting standards, which in turn help drive down our net credit losses.</p>
          <p>As you can see at the top of the page, our net credit loss rates declined again this quarter to 5.5%. At the same time, our loan loss reserve as a percentage of end-of-period loans grew to 6.7%. The divergence in trends between these two indicators is driven in part by the impact of forbearance programs. For example, as John mentioned on our earnings call on Tuesday, the government's Home Affordable Modification Program, or HAMP, has the effect of marginally reducing our reported net credit losses and increasing our required loan loss reserves.</p>
          <p>Finally at the bottom of the page, you can see that the coincident month coverage had increased from 13.3 months last quarter to 14.1 months this quarter. As I just mentioned, the relationship between net credit losses and reserves was affected by forbearance programs. This also drives a portion of the increase in coincident coverage.</p>
          <p>Slide eight goes into the credit trends for our North American Cards businesses along the top of the page as well as our first and second mortgages on the bottom. Let me start with our Cards businesses. As John discussed on Tuesday, we have been actively working to remove high risk customers and add higher quality accounts. On a net basis, end of period accounts were down 11% in both Citi branded and retail partner cards versus prior year. We also continue to pursue other loss mitigation efforts including a broad set of forbearance programs.</p>
          <p>Recognizing the impact of these forbearance programs, we are nevertheless seeing some early positive credit trends in both Citi branded and retail partner cards. As you can see from the top two charts, quarterly managed net credit losses declined on a dollar basis for both Cards businesses sequentially. Citi branded cards had its first quarterly decline in managed net credit losses in some time, down 6% to $1.95 billion. And retail partner cards recorded a second consecutive decline, down 2%. While both portfolios experienced an expected seasonal increase in 90-plus day delinquencies in the fourth quarter, earlier bucket delinquencies improved on a dollar basis.</p>
          <p>Now let's review consumer real estate. At the bottom right of the page, our second mortgages continue to show positive trends in both net credit losses and 90-day delinquencies, reflecting the impact of the portfolio repositioning and our loss mitigation actions. On the bottom left hand side of the page, first mortgages experienced lower net credit losses in the fourth quarter, down 3%, driven primarily by HAMP modifications. We booked additional loan loss reserves to neutralize the impact of HAMP on total credit. Ninety-day delinquencies continue to grow in first mortgages, largely driven by HAMP as well as the increased backlog in foreclosures. While it is still very early to comment on the ultimate outcome of HAMP, our results to date are beginning to show promise.</p>
          <p>Slide nine summarizes our major international markets where we see improvements in consumer credit trends. Economic recovery continued in Asia this quarter, resulting in lower net credit losses and 90-day delinquencies. Net credit losses declined across all major markets, with some particular strength in Korea and India. The decline in delinquencies also reflects significant improvements in India cards.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, consumer net credit losses declined in the fourth quarter, reflecting significantly lower losses in Mexico cards. The repositioning of the Mexico card portfolio is largely complete, and we are now investing to grow this business. Ninety-day delinquencies were fairly stable.</p>
          <p>In EMEA, consumer net credit losses were flat on a dollar basis, and 90-day delinquencies showed improvement this quarter. And finally, you see international local consumer lending, which primarily includes our consumer banking operations in Western Europe. Both net credit losses and 90-day delinquencies declined in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>To summarize our derisking efforts, let me turn to slide 10. Within Citi Holdings, assets have declined 39% or $351 billion since the peak levels and now stand at 547 billion. This quarter, we saw a $70 billion reduction sequentially, which is our largest single quarterly decline. This quarter's reduction was primarily attributed to the divestiture of Nikko and Nikko Asset Management worth 25 billion, further asset sales of 15 billion, and $24 billion of paydowns and maturities plus 6 billion of net credit losses. In particular, the focus has been to reduce illiquid loans and hard-to-fund assets as a way to improve our net liquidity.</p>
          <p>As you can see from the table at the right, roughly two-thirds of the remaining assets were in local consumer lending, about half of which are in U.S. mortgages, which we've discussed. About 28% of the Citi Holdings assets were in the special asset pool, where we continue to reduce our key risk exposures across a number of asset classes.</p>
          <p>Now that we have covered credit trends and asset reductions in some depth, please turn to the liabilities side of the balance sheet on Page 11. As part of our efforts to reshape the balance sheet, we have shifted our liability structure to create a structurally sound funding base. Reading from the bottom, our funding is built on a strong base, which includes a combination of equity, long-term debt, and deposits. As you can see, these resources of stable funding are providing a larger and larger proportion of our liability structure over time.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we have systematically reduced our dependence on short-term wholesale funding including Fed funds, repo, and commercial paper. As I mentioned in our call last quarter, we reduced our commercial paper outstandings from 29 billion at the end of 2008 to 10 billion currently. Commercial paper will continue to be an important funding source for us in 2010, but closer to this $10 billion level.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 12, firm-wide deposits increased $62 billion year on year to 836 billion at the end of the quarter, and these provide a steady and low cost source of liquidity. Deposits increased steadily on a reported basis over the course of 2009, and as you can see on the bottom of the slide, on a constant FX basis our deposits grew consistently from the second quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Across the company, we have a high quality, diversified, and stable deposit base. As an example, our transaction services deposit base increased 11% year on year while our global consumer banking deposit base increased 12% year on year.</p>
          <p>From a balance sheet standpoint, our deposits are clearly one of our most valuable and lowest cost sources of funds. As the financial markets have stabilized, we now have the ability and the willingness to lower our price points, moderate balance growth, and widen our spreads and margins while still remaining competitive.</p>
          <p>Finally, as we continue to derisk the balance sheet and reduce loans, deposits as a percentage of loans increased to 150% at the end of the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking at slide 13, an important part of building our liquidity has been to issue non-TLPG [Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program] debt this quarter. We have issued approximately $26 billion in non-TLPG long-term debt starting in May as we reengaged with our investors. We focused on benchmark deals, which were done across the curve including five, tens, and 30s, with weighted average maturities of approximately ten years, and in multiple currencies with a strong international mix.</p>
          <p>Our success in these transactions demonstrates support for Citigroup from a diverse group of high quality institutional accounts. These benchmark trades were characterized each time by heavy oversubscriptions.</p>
          <p>As you know, Citi's spreads peaked in March and have tightened significantly and consistently since we issued our first non-TLPG bond of 2009 on May 15, a U.S. dollar 10-year at Treasury plus 562 basis points. The same 10-year was reopened less than a month later on June 11 at Treasury plus 437 basis points, 125 bps tighter than the original issue. And as an example of dramatically improved credit, that same bond trades today at about Treasury's plus 232. As spreads continue to improve throughout the year, we issued a spectrum of non-guaranteed bonds at consistently tighter and tighter levels.</p>
          <p>Moving over to page 14, as I mentioned last quarter, you will notice a significant shift in our funding plans for next year relative to our 2008 and 2009 issuance levels. Last year we reduced our assets, strengthened our liquidity position, and focused on long-term debt issuance. At this point, we are largely prefunded, and we'll be looking opportunistically at issuing debt this year while focusing on key investor relationships.</p>
          <p>As we increase deposits and reduce loans and holdings, we have less of a need to reissue our maturing debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis in 2010, and so our current expectation is that we will probably issue less than $15 billion of long-term debt this year.</p>
          <p>Also, back in December we announced that we would possibly issue trust preferred securities in the first quarter of 2010. In keeping with that announcement and as part of our $15 billion issuance plan this year, we expect to issue approximately $2 billion in TRUP this quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally, as I mentioned earlier, our cash position affords us the flexibility to invest in earning assets or retire liabilities. This morning we announced an offer to retire approximately $7.3 billion of generally older debt nearing maturity. This is expected to have no impact on our strong structural liquidity.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to slide 15 as we have reshaped our balance sheet to clearly strengthen our structural liquidity as measured by one of the traditional metrics. Here you see the combination of equity, long-term debt, and deposits, which together form the heart of a bank's liquidity. This combination of structural funding has risen to 73% of total assets during this eight-quarter timeframe. As I mentioned earlier, these higher levels of structural liquidity give us the increased balance sheet flexibility to invest in earning assets and take advantage of growth opportunities across our businesses.</p>
          <p>On slide 16, you can see that our strong capital ratios make us one of the most well capitalized large banks in the world. Tangible common equity and Tier 1 common are up because of our equity issuances back in December. This was partially offset by the removal of risk weighted asset benefits, which we had received from the loss sharing agreement with the U.S. government. We maintain strong Tier 1 and total capital ratios even as we repay TARP and exited the loss sharing agreement.</p>
          <p>With these high levels of capital as well as the TRUP issuances I just mentioned, we are well prepared for the impact of the accounting changes related to FAS 166 and 167. And with these strong ratios, we are very well positioned to weather any economic uncertainties while at the same time have the flexibility and the asset types to take advantage of growth opportunities around the world.</p>
          <p>Since late in the fourth quarter of 2008, our ratings have been stable. And our current ratings are A3 for Moody's, A from S&amp;P, and A+ from Fitch. We are in ongoing discussions with the rating agencies and provide them with continuous information, as you'd expect.</p>
          <p>Moving to our last slide, let me summarize four major points. First, we see some signs of credit stabilization. International credit trends continue to improve. North American credit trends are showing signs of stabilizing, albeit at elevated levels, and corporate credit shows signs of stabilizing around the world.</p>
          <p>Second, we have significantly improved our structural liquidity by increasing our deposits and reducing loans and assets. We are adequately liquid with a flexible balance sheet that we have begun to deploy for growth.</p>
          <p>Third, we will have a significantly lower proportion of wholesale funding going forward. We are largely prefunded and currently expect modest reissuance needs. We also announced a tender offer for generally older vintage debt this morning.</p>
          <p>And fourth, our capital base is one of the strongest in the industry, and this is reflected across every one of our significant capital ratios.</p>
          <p>That concludes our fixed income review. John and I will be happy to take your questions at this point.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Tom Shiftanelli with Fidelity Investments .</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I guess a couple things. First one on Citi Holdings, the 70 billion reduction in assets, that was a pretty impressive quarter obviously. The 24 billion in paydowns and maturities, is that a normal rate there, or was there something unusual in the fourth quarter on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's within the range of what we have typically seen in the last quarter, so I would not characterize that as unusual.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the 10 billion in asset sales where you actually had a pre-tax gain of 800 million in the SAP [Special Asset Pool], can you give some color on what types of things you guys were able to sell above the marks in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Tom, it's John. It actually also ranged across a wide array of some different asset classes that we have in the SAP, and so there was nothing in particular that stood out. It was pretty much a broad &#x2013; obviously the one thing we didn't sell was anything that was hold-to-maturity. But absent that, I'm pretty sure that we hit almost every one of the categories. So it really cut across some loans, some securities, and a few other odds and sods.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I guess a question on the Obama, -- the Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee. Be interested your thoughts on what kind of impact you guys think that could have on things like the repo market and thoughts on where you guys might look to reduce liabilities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're going to wait until we actually see first at least a written proposal, and then we'll actually see how it goes on from there before we begin to comment on it, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I guess the last one I'll try is on Basel III. I know you can't comment specifically, but what would you guys say would be most troubling about what's out there on Basel III right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, we're still trying to actually work our way through Basel II and where that's going. So these things are always interesting to look at, and you try to track to see how they develop over time. But we're not going to start to plan on changes to the business model based upon things that have been &#x2013; that are currently being discussed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, what we'll d, like all the other banks, is comment as far as the noted proposed rule making as we've been requested to by the U.S. agencies. So as those come due and those are public documents, you can obviously review those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And when will you need to start thinking &#x2013; I know you talked about your funding for 2010, but the TLGP [Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program] that's close to 70 billion 2011 &#x2013; 2012. When do you think you need to start thinking about prefunding some of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In large respects, we've actually done prefunding already for this year and for parts of next year as well. As we described with our continued modest growth of deposits and continued reductions in loans, we actually don't need to reissue debt, either our own debt or the TLGP debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis. And so as the industry goes through a spike in maturity, we don't see that we will necessarily have a spike in our reissuances just given how we are actively managing our balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Thank you, Tom.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of David Knutson with Bloomberg (sic) [Legal &amp; General] .</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's Legal &amp; General. The tender, was it driven primarily on an NPV study or to clear out liquidity or to clear out maturities for improved liquidity? What was behind the tender?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Really a combination of those effects; I think there are some positive economics in retiring previously issued debt. It helps as part of our general balance sheet deleveraging. And so it's really the combination of those two factors which make it an attractive action from our standpoint and as part of our broader liability management strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And was it ever part of the consideration to look at more NPV driven events or NPV driven transactions of perhaps longer duration or more subordinate securities that you'd actually earn a gain and bolster equity, or is that really not on the table now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're always actively reviewing the range of options that we have, but these were the securities that were most advantageous to retire and to achieve our current objectives.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the holding company, on Citi Holdings wind-down, the progress was really good, but I'm curious. Has it been a situation where the easier assets to sell, the more liquid assets, the more easy to value assets have been disposed or run off, and now we should expect a slower run-down rate or disposition rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, this is John. As we mentioned on the earnings call the other day, I wouldn't take the $70 billion reduction in this quarter and model that in as saying that's our goal for every quarter. This was a particularly good quarter. In the various &#x2013; certainly in the investor call deck that we used on Tuesday, we give you a pretty good listing of the assets that are in the SAP, and you can certainly see the asset composition of what's remaining in the local consumer lending businesses. So we will continue to pursue a mixture of business and portfolio divestitures, and then we will continue to take advantage of market conditions in order to continue to get rid of some of the assets in the SAP.</p>
          <p>Obviously, the more we reduce, you run up against some built-in barriers. We do have something on the order of 30 to 35 billion of hold-to-maturity assets in the SAP. So as those become an increasingly larger percentage of the Special Asset Pool composition, it's going to become increasingly difficult then to continue to match those types of percentage declines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two other quick questions, the deposit funded portion of your capital has risen up to mid-40s now. And is that the expectation to carry that at that level of deposit funding forward, or was this more of a response to the liquidity crisis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would characterize that as prudent management of our balance sheet, and don't see any reason why one would consider that as a temporary level. If you step back, deposit funding is one of our lowest cost sources of funds for the institution, and so we actually continue to expect modest deposit growth as we continue to grow our businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then lastly, you suggested that you would opportunistically issue debt into the long-term debt market with 15 billion and then 2 billion of TRUPs. Being opportunistic, is that a plus or minus 10%, or is that &#x2013; if you could give me some help in understanding what that means? Does that mean that it could be double the 15 or a fraction? That's obviously an open-ended and that's a caveat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, as we said on our call a quarter ago and I think we reiterated here, we expect to issue less than 15 billion. Within that 15 billion is the $2 billion of TRUP, and obviously there's some range within that. But those are our expectations at this point.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Brad Keoun with Bloomberg News.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, John, for the second day. Can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>How are you doing, Brad?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. I guess following up on the earlier questioner's questions about the Basel, these proposals that came out in December, I know you guys are still looking at this and it remains very much under discussion. But obviously one of the interesting things here is the explicit liquidity minimum that they're talking about. And just curious for your thoughts on how that's going to affect you. And obviously you guys have really taken steps to increase your liquidity, but curious how your current state will look compared to where ultimately that minimum shakes out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a great question, Brad. Obviously, we are still going through the voluminous document that comprises everything with Basel III. And you will see &#x2013; I guess the comments are due in April. And so I'm going to hold off commenting directly on that question until we are actually ready to issue our comment letter. But as we've indicated, one of our goals certainly now and has been for the past year is to improve the overall structural liquidity. We've indicated in each of the last two quarters that we are deliberately liquid in our balance sheet, and we want to make sure that we maintain ample liquidity because we think that that is a prudent thing to do in the current market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so -- but you don't want to comment on indications you've been getting on where ultimately these minimums might be set?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean obviously we want to wait. We were in active dialogues with all of the regulators, and we'll wait and see to have all those dialogues conclude in some sort of regulatory guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And regarding the tender, using some of the cash to pay down some of the debt with newer maturities, do you have a view of where the cash would be at the end of the first quarter? Maybe you have some other things that are maturing that will free up some cash, some assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Looking to Eric to answer...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, as you can tell, during the &#x2013; as the crisis developed, our cash balances built. We clearly did that in a deliberate way to prepare us for any further changes to the market. As the markets stabilize, there's less of a need to hold as much outright cash on the balance sheet. And so I think directionally, you'll see it over time be invested in earning assets. So I'm not going to predict exactly how much and when, but that's clearly the direction that we're taking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just a last question, you mentioned the positive economics of the tender. Could you give us a number of exactly how much this would save?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brad, we don't typically do that, but I think you can obviously do your own calculations as you just think about the amount of debt we're retiring, the coupon, and so forth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much. I really appreciate it.</p>
