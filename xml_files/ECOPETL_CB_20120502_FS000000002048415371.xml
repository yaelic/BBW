          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Ecopetrol's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. My name is <mark type="ph" /> Erin (0:07), and I'll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session toward the end of today's conference. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the call over to Alejandro Giraldo, Investor Relations, Director. Please proceed.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Ecopetrol's first quarter 2012 financial and operational results conference call. Before we begin, it is important to mention that the comments by Ecopetrol's senior management could include projections of the company's future performance. These projections do not constitute any commitment as to future results nor do they take into account risks or uncertainties that could develop. As a result, Ecopetrol assumes no responsibility in the event that future results are different than the projections on the conference call.</p>
          <p>The call will be led by Mr. Javier Guti&#xE9;rrez, CEO of Ecopetrol. Also participating will be Adriana Echeverri, CFO; H&#xE9;ctor Manosalva, Executive VP for E&amp;P; Pedro Rosales, Executive VP for Downstream; &#xC1;lvaro Casta&#xF1;eda, VP of Transportation and Logistics; and Enrique Vel&#xE1;squez, VP of Exploration.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Mr. Mr. Guti&#xE9;rrez.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alejandro. Good afternoon. Thank you all for joining us in this conference call. Initially, we will provide a summary of our key financial results, the highlights of the business segments and the milestones of internal consolidation. Then we will close our presentation with an outlook for the second quarter and finally we will have a Q&amp;A session. So let's turn to slide five to review our milestones in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>The company continued making progress in its growth strategies, reaching higher level of production and achieving solid operating and financial results. The Corporate Group achieved in the first quarter a new record in production of 743,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. As in previous periods, the rise in production came from the fields in the Llanos region, mainly Castilla and Chichimene operated by Ecopetrol and from the association contracts in Rubiales and Quifa.</p>
          <p>In line with the increases in production, the transported volume grew up to 1.2 million barrels per day of crude and products. Our sales volume grew due to the increases in the production of crude oil and natural gas. The sales prices were higher due to both the market conditions and our successful strategy of diversifying the benchmarks and the destinations for our crude. Thus, we increased the use of Brent crude as reference and the sales to the markets in Europe and the U.S. West Coast.</p>
          <p>The higher prices and the increases in production led to the net income of COP$4.3 trillion, EBITDA amounted to COP$8 trillion. With regard to exploration, the companies of the Corporate Group drilled five exploratory wells in Colombia of which three have hydrocarbon presence. Also, it is worth to mention that Ecopetrol finalized drilling the Luna 1 well, our first step to test non-conventional reservoirs. Its results are under evaluation.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we are on track. We've got modernization projects of our refineries, the expansion of our transportation infrastructure. Investments in the first quarter of 2012 total $1,107 million of which 63% were allocated to production, 15% to subsidiaries, 11% to Transportation, 6% to Exploration, 4% to Refining and Petrochemicals and the remaining 1% to Corporate segment.</p>
          <p>Moving to HSE, our initiatives are providing a consistent trend of improvement in the safety of our operations. During the first quarter of 2012, the accident frequency rate was 0.99 accidents per million working hours compared with 0.94 in the previous quarter and 1.56 in the first quarter of 2011. Thus, the initiatives implemented have been effective for developing a safer operation for employees and contractors.</p>
          <p>Now I would turn the presentation to Adriana Echeverri, who will comment on the financial results.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Guti&#xE9;rrez. Good afternoon, everyone. Let's turn to slide seven. In the first quarter of 2012, Ecopetrol had sound financial results driven by the increase in production and the higher prices of crude and products.</p>
          <p>Starting on the left side of the slide, you can see how in the first quarter total sales rose compared to the same quarter in 2011. The exports including sales to Reficar free trade zones accounted for 68% of total sales. Total cost of sales plus operating expenses grew mainly due to the rise in variable costs coming from two sources. First, from larger purchases of crude oil from the National Hydrocarbons Agency, and second from higher input, mainly naphtha diluent and gasoline to supply the local market during the maintenance of the refineries in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Fixed cost increased mainly because of higher depreciation in contracted services related to larger production and maintenance activities. Those increases were offset by the decrease in the operating expenses, due mainly to the capitalization at the end of 2011 of the acquisition of Shell's stake in Cano Sur block, operating income amounted to COP$6.9 trillion in the first quarter of 2012, equivalent to an operating margin of 45%.</p>
          <p>In the non-operating results, the loss of COP$0.5 trillion was mainly due to the adverse effect of revaluation of the Colombian peso and the impact of provisions mainly coming from the lower returns of the funds, which covers the pension liabilities. Total net income from the Group subsidiaries under the equity method amounted close to COP$444 billion as follows. Crude oil subsidiaries added COP$290 million, refining and petrochemical subsidiaries COP$119 billion, transportation subsidiaries COP$17 billion, and corporative subsidiaries COP$17 billion. Finally, net income amounted to COP$4.3 trillion, while EBITDA amounted to COP$8 trillion. EBITDA margin was 52% and net margin was 28%.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, number eight, we find an overview of the company's cash flow and balance sheet as of the end of March. The initial cash balance was COP$9.2 trillion and cash generated from operations during the quarter amounted to COP$16.5 trillion. COP$7.2 trillion of the company's total cash flow were deployed to fund operations and COP$1.3 trillion for capital expenditures. The ending balance of cash and investments was COP$17.4 trillion pesos.</p>
          <p>Regarding the balance sheet, total assets amounted to COP$93.2 trillion and total liabilities COP$46.1 trillion. The liabilities included the accrual of dividends for a total amount of COP$12.3 trillion approved by the general shareholders meeting and the higher provision for corporate tax that amounted to COP$8.4 trillion.</p>
          <p>Financial debt was equivalent to 6.3% of total assets and to 12.7% of total liabilities, while debt-to-EBITDA ratio for the last 12 months was 0.2%. During the quarter, there was no increase in financial indebtedness. Finally, the equity decreased in the first quarter, mainly as a result of the recording of the accounts payable of the dividends declared in the general shareholders meeting held on March 22.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to the main aspects of the result of the Corporate Group shown on slide nine. In line with Ecopetrol results, in the first quarter of 2012 the Corporate Group reached solid financial results. Total sales for the Corporate Group amounted to COP$18 trillion compared with COP$14.4 trillion in the same quarter of 2011. Group's net income amounted to COP$4.3 trillion and EBITDA was COP$8.7 trillion while EBITDA margin was 49%.</p>
          <p>Now let's move on to slide 10, and review the main figures of our subsidiaries. In the first quarter of the year, the highest revenue before accounting eliminations came from Reficar with COP$1.3 trillion, Hocol with COP$1.1 trillion and Equi&#xF3;n with COP$0.6 trillion. Highest net income came from Equi&#xF3;n with COP$219 billion, followed by Hocol with COP$187 billion, and Reficar with COP$117 billion. The figures with the highest EBITDA in the quarter were Hocol with COP$321 billion, Equi&#xF3;n with COP$187 billion, and Ocensa with COP$148 billion.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn the conference to Enrique Vel&#xE1;squez, who will comment about the results of our E&amp;P segment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Please let's move on to slide 12, which summarizes the highlights of the E&amp;P segment for the Corporate Group. Let's start with our production results. In the first quarter, the Corporate Group achieved a gross production of 743,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. During the quarter, production was affected due mainly to restrictions on the availability of transportation infrastructure. The production growth was led mainly by the increase in Castilla and Chichimene fields, which accounted for 152,000 barrels per day, Rubiales and Quifa for 121,000 barrels, and Nare for 17,000 barrels.</p>
          <p>Regarding exploration, the companies of the Corporate Group drilled five A3/A2 exploratory wells in Colombia, of which wells Pintado and Dorcas drilled by Hocol had hydrocarbon presence. One of the wells was dry, and the remaining two were under valuation, including Tisquirama Este-1 well. Last week, hydrocarbon presence in the well was announced.</p>
          <p>Also, as a Corporate Group eight tests were completed, of which two had evidence of hydrocarbons, the ST3A and the ST6 drilled by Hocol in the CPO 16 block. Another well is still under evaluation. This last one is our first in the positive aimed to add reserves for unconventional resources. As for the Caribbean offshore activity, during the first quarter, the rig Offshore Mischief arrived to Cartagena. This rig will be used to drill the wells Mapal&#xE9; 1 and Mapal&#xE9; 2 on block RC5 operated by our subsidiary, Equi&#xF3;n.</p>
          <p>Internationally, the appraisal well, Itauna 2, was drilled by our partner Anadarko in Brazil. Also in March, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, BOEM, of the U.S. Department of Interior officially awarded to Ecopetrol America, Inc.. blocks East Breaks-284, 285, 328 and 329, located in deep waters of the East Breaks sector in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Additionally, the awarding of the block 623 at the Keathley Canyon sector was confirmed in February. Those resolutions allow Ecopetrol to incorporate five new wells into the portfolio in the U.S. Gulf Coast as a result of the Lease Sale 218.</p>
          <p>Our 2012 drilling plans remain unchanged, that is to drill a total of 42 exploratory wells, 37 of them in Columbia, three in the U.S. Gulf Coast and two in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Finally, let's review the financial result of the Upstream segment. Net income for the segment in the first quarter was COP$4.4 trillion. Overall results were driven by higher volume sold and better sales prices linked to benchmarks of the WTI. EBITDA amounted to COP$7.6 trillion equivalent to an EBITDA margin of 77%.</p>
          <p>In summary, we continue making progress in our activities to accomplish the goals we have set for the year.</p>
          <p>Now I will turn the call over to Mr. &#xC1;lvaro Casta&#xF1;eda, who will provide an update on our midstream operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone, and please turn to slide 13. The volume of crude and products transported by pipelines in the first quarter grew to 1.2 million barrels per day, of which 74% accounted for crude. Crude and naphtha volume transported by truck reached 104,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Bicentenario pipeline, the segment between Araguaney and Banad&#xED;a reached a 52% progress as of March 31. It is worth mentioning that Ecopetrol approved two key initiatives. First, the integrity program, which will enhance the current <mark type="indiscernible" /> (17:24) in order to reach the highest industry standard. The budget for this initiative amounts to $489 million. The second initiative is a contingency program, which will review the potential consequence that might affect the communities and the environment in case of a failure in our transport infrastructure. The budget amounts to $39 million. This initiative will enhance the integrity and contingency management that is in Ecopetrol to minimize the risk that similar events as the Ca&#xF1;o Lim&#xF3;n-Cove&#xF1;as crude oil pipeline and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (18:00) product pipeline happen again.</p>
          <p>Let's review the financial results of the segment. Net income amounted to COP$88 billion in the first quarter of 2012. Although revenue rose as a result of the higher production volumes in Colombia, gross expenses increased in the country due to maintenance expenditure on the transportation infrastructure. EBITDA margin was 56% and net margin was 14%.</p>
          <p>With this, I will turn the presentation over to Pedro Rosales, who will comment on downstream results, starting with refining.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. Let's move on to slide 14. In terms of our operation, the refinery throughputs were reduced in the first quarter of 2012, mainly due to a scheduled maintenance of the bottom processing units at Barrancabaermeja refinery. During the execution of such maintenance, the production of valuable products was lower, impacting the result of refining gross margin.</p>
          <p>The higher cost of crude, which is linked to the price of our crude export market, also affected the margin. Given the high crude prices, a scheduled maintenance, and therefore lower production of valuable products, which generated the need to increase inputs, the EBITDA was affected, reaching minus COP$43 billion, which corresponds to an EBITDA margin of minus 0.8% and a net loss of COP$156 billion for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Regarding the main refining projects, the expansion and modernization of the Cartagena reported a 61% progress and the upgrading of the Barrancabaermeja refinery at 10% advanced. Finally, the master plan of utilities in Barrancabaermeja, which will update the infrastructure for the supply of steam, air, water and energy, reached 42% progress as of March 31.</p>
          <p>Now please turn to slide 15 to review the sales and marketing results. Total sales volume grew between the first quarter of 2011 and 2012 due to the rise of exports. Export growth was driven by higher availability of Magdalena Blend crude and the increase of natural gas sales to Venezuela. These increases offset the reduction in local sales primarily of natural gas due to a lower consumption from thermal power plant and a new Decree recently issued allowing other producers to sell their oil and gas royalties. During the first quarter, we continued with the strategies of diversifying markets and referencing our crude to benchmarks that generate more value to the exports.</p>
          <p>Regarding the destination of our exports, there was an increase in the market share for our crudes in the U.S. West Coast and Europe, as well as higher sales of fuel oils to Far East. These factors combined with increased demand for our heavy crude allows to improve $9 per barrel in the spread between our crude export basket price and Brent index. There were no export reference to WTI in the first quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>Lastly, the sales and marketing segment presented in the first quarter a net income of COP$41 billion lower than in the first quarter of 2011. This was the result of the higher transportation costs of crude and diluent for transporting heavy crude. EBITDA was COP$111 billion. EBITDA margin was 3% and net margin was 1.1%. There was also a significant non-operating impact due to the peso revaluation.</p>
          <p>I now will turn the presentation back to Mr. Guti&#xE9;rrez, who will comment on the milestones of the internal consolidation initiatives and the corporate social responsibility in the first quarter of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Pedro. Let's start with slide 17. I would like to start by highlighting the improvement in HSE. The accident frequency rate in the first quarter of 2012 was 0.99 accidents per million working hours compared with 0.94 in the previous quarter and 1.56 in the first quarter of 2011. Also the environmental incidents from operational causes fell to four in the first quarter of this year from 11 in the first quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Those encouraging results strengthen our commitment of a safe and reliable operation. Also, it is worth to mention the technical corporation agreements with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Petroleum Technology Alliance of Canada for identification and evaluation of opportunities to reduce greenhouse gases and increase energy efficiency.</p>
          <p>Regarding our stakeholders, we have two important highlights during the quarter. First, on March 22, we held our annual shareholder meeting with a record attendance of more than 16,000 shareholders and the approval of a dividend of COP$300 per share payable in one installment for our minority shareholders.</p>
          <p>The second highlight was the revision of some terms of the collective agreement, different than compensation and wages. This process was satisfactory for both the company and the unions. The agreement was signed in 2009 for a five-year period, and since the beginning this revision was established. Regarding science and technology our research institute was officially recognized as a research center by Colciencias, the governmental agency for science, technology and innovation.</p>
          <p>In addition, the institute was granted by the Mexican government with patents for two additives helping improve visbreaking processes in refining and petrochemical areas. As a final point, I would like to emphasize that Ecopetrol remains fully committed with the community affected by the incident in Dosquebradas of last December. The company has continued its progress in all the work streams that is in health, housing, business and government, social, legal and environmental.</p>
          <p>Finally, let's review the outlook for the second quarter of 2012. Please move on to the slide 19. During the second quarter of 2012, Ecopetrol will continue on its path to achieve all of our strategic goals for this year. Regarding exploration, Equi&#xF3;n, our subsidiary, will begin the drilling in the Caribbean Colombian offshore. We will also complete the exploratory campaign of the quarter.</p>
          <p>In production, we will continue rising our production in order to achieve the goal of 800,000 equivalent barrels per day in 2012. In transportation, we will continue achieving progress in our infrastructure projects, including the first phase of the Bicentenario Pipeline together with our partners. We also expect to consolidate the two initiatives our integrity of transport infrastructure and contingency, which are key to strengthen our infrastructure and improve the reliability of our operations.</p>
          <p>The integrity program, with a total investment of $489 million, should assure a safe and reliable operation in our transportation system through monitoring of the critical variables in the infrastructure, continuous technological screening to evaluate threats and the implementation of the strengthened integrity management system.</p>
          <p>On top of that, the contingency program intends to review the potential consequences that might affect the communities and the environment in case of any failure in our infrastructure throughout the assurance of a system of attention, the contingencies efficiently dimensioned, implemented and articulated along with other local and regional organizations and institutions. The approved budget to carry out the planned activities is $39 million.</p>
          <p>In refinery, we will continue with the progress in the modernization of the Cartagena refinery, and with the arrangements in order to meet all the requirements of environmental and social aspects to continue with the execution of the upgrading in the Barrancabermeja refinery. Additionally, we have scheduled maintenance at some units in the Barrancabermeja refinery. We also shall continue all efforts to maintain the improving trend in HSE, as well as the safety and reliability of our operations.</p>
          <p>Regarding our commercial strategy, we will increase export volumes according to the production growth. Locally, we will begin the activities to be prepared in order to comply with a sulfur content regulation for diesel of less than 50 parts per million across the country, which is mandatory starting January 1, 2013. In biofuels, we will continue with the project to produce ethanol from sugarcane through bioenergy.</p>
          <p>Now I open the session to questions from our participants.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Frank McGann from Bank of America. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Good afternoon. I was just wondering &#x2013; two questions if I could. One is on production, the trend in production during the quarter, and then maybe perhaps if you have some indication of where it is today or what it was in April, if we've seen an increase from the levels you had in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>And then the second question on the refining side. Refining, if you look back three or four years, was actually a pretty good earnings contributor. It's been much less robust clearly over the last couple of years, and the first quarter continued that trend. And we're just wondering with prices essentially in line with international prices or moving in line with international prices, when could we expect some improvement in refining? Do we need to see the completions of the upgrades, so your product mix is substantially better, or could we see some improvement over the near term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Frank, again. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:27) explain &#x2013; excuse me, Enrique is going to explain about the levels of production in April, how we are doing these days. Okay. Enrique, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Frank. Yes, as Mr. Guti&#xE9;rrez said, are planning to complete the goal, which is 1,800 by the end of the year. And basically the idea is to maintain the fuels in the production and recuperate, let's say, or increase better our production that we have in the last two months. So we expect to complete the plan. Okay, Frank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What are the current efforts, Enrique?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe you have just seen in the report, total production for the Group is 743,000 barrels, divided 626,000 from crude and 116,000 from gas, for Mcf equivalent, as I mentioned before, of 743,000 barrels of equivalent per day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if you look at the trend during the quarter and then in April, has it been basically kind of flat at that level during the three months, and then into April as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, for April, but we are planning to start climbing up in May.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Which years we will see the improvement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Frank, excuse me, but it is also important to mention that really on the first quarter we were very close to our projection. Really the difference is less than 2%, and notwithstanding that we have some troubles <mark type="ph" /> we already (34:33) mentioned in the transportation. Finally, the difference, as you can see, is really small. But it's also show,  how the positive evolution in terms of the production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And regarding the question which activities we will complete in the next month, basically if I remember that we have some, I mean, problems in the Ca&#xF1;o Limon-Cove&#xF1;as pipeline, which reduces our production in 17,400 barrels per day as well as some minor cuts in Rubiales due to the increase in water cut. So as soon as we &#x2013; and we already did. We sold these products where we'll, I mean, keep the momentum in order to complete the goal. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The situation of the first quarter is mainly generated by unscheduled turnaround of the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:52), which reduced the feed in almost 30,000 barrels per day, and therefore the production of gasoline affecting the valuable produce index.</p>
          <p>But in general, the comparison factor of our refineries that is around 75% give us a high dependence on the international margins to generate earnings. Then, as you said, the structural solution will be generated by the modernization of our refineries. That reduces the cost of the crude and increase the quantity and value of our products. Then, in the near term, we would see the results depending on the international market margin. But in the &#x2013; at the end of the project, we will show a structural efficiency of our refineries given by the increase of the conversion factor that goes from 75% to 95%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is the &#x2013; in terms of the structural change anyway, we have been implemented some initiatives to reduce the costs. And additionally, we have been developing some maintenance activities to increase the reliability, and in general the integrity of our refineries and we have been improving the available capacity of both of our refineries.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everyone. Just wanted to make two questions as well. Just following a little bit on the production again what would have been your recurring production in the first quarter if we were to eliminate the problems with transportation and this little problem in Rubiales? I mean would it be correct to assume that &#x2013; so you mentioned 17,000 barrels a day of curtailment of production due to the pipeline issue. But this was concentrated in February only. So could you please just tell us what would have been production according to plan excluding those two "non-recurring items"? And then just for us to understand, how far you are from the target of year-end?</p>
          <p>And then second question relates to the cost and expenses. We observed a reduction in cost and expenses for &#x2013; and also in the &#x2013; a little bit in the operating costs in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. And if you could also give us some color on how recurring this reduction is this? Is this any reference for cost and expenses for us to forecast going forward?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perfect. Then if I may follow-up on that quickly. Looking at future growth and the number of barrels that Ecopetrol has to prove between now and 2015 or even if we look until 2020 and the target of proving another 6 billion barrels. How comfortable the company is in the ability of proving those barrels in the short term to support the fantastic production growth that you guys have been delivering so far, and which would be the main sources of reserves addition in the very short term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paula, as you know, we plan for the year to drill more than 400 development wells. So this is one of the task that we expect to accomplish in order to achieve our production. I mean, as you know, almost 90% of production comes from primary recovery.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But if I look at &#x2013; it's not only about growing production, you also have to prove the wells to support &#x2013; even to support our forecast of production growth. So if you could perhaps comment on which are the main two or three reserves &#x2013; reserve contribution that you expect to see building into the 1.7 billion barrels of proven reserves in short term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just to understand where do you expect new proven barrels to come from? Is it mostly primary out of those 400 development wells that you're going to drill? How much do you expect additional recovery factor to contribute to proving reserves in the short term or more perhaps within this target of proving 6 billion barrels in 2020?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But &#x2013; excuse me, Enrique. But it is important to mention that you are referring to the 6 billion barrels that we are referring we are going to add during the next &#x2013; during the period of 10 years. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, perfect. But then, I know that's the reference number, but I was just trying to get a little bit more color on the short-term targets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:18). It means that we are going to add in average a number between 500 and 600 barrels per year approximately, and almost 3.3 million barrels are going to be for the development of our current field, mainly primary, secondary and tertiary recovery. And then we expect to add reserves basically from the national and international exploration considering parts of our current fields and new idea and additionally we also are expecting to add some reserves from the non-conventional resources.</p>
          <p>During the first year we are mainly adding from our current fields, but anyway we have been adding some from our new discoveries, and mainly in the short term we are expecting it to continue increasing our recovery factor. Right now we are around 18% and what we are trying is going to around 34%. It implies that &#x2013; it means in average we must increase our recovery factor at an average of 1.5 per year approximately to be able to add almost 3.3 million barrel from &#x2013; increase from recovery basically. This is the general picture, yes. For this year, we are mainly supported in the plan on recovery and also some projects for secondary recovery and also tertiary recovery. But it is important to mention that we are &#x2013; we have also revealed we are in the process of the development of Cano Sur there was a discovery that we had last year.</p>

          <p>And as Mr. Guti&#xE9;rrez said, we have 88% of fields in primary recovery but we are also undertaking EUR, <mark type="ph" /> IUR (45:55) pilots in order to administer through secondary and tertiary recovery techniques. For instance, we had a pilot for <mark type="indiscernible" /> (46:04) Tisquirama, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (46:09) chemical injection in San Francisco field as well as gas injection. And as you are aware, we are starting the in-situ combustion in Chichimene and Quifa.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Paula. More than savings, what you have to first take into account is that Ecopetrol's execution of cost and expenses has certain cyclicalities, we could say. So by the fourth quarter of every yea, you will find declining cost and expenses because the moving part of the execution takes place during that quarter. That's why when you take a look into the first quarter of next year you find a continuity on that. First quarter usually is characterized by low execution of products due to the fact that we are starting to stand in terms of reference of different selection processes and we are starting to contract delivery. So that's why we find kind of that behavior. So it's better try to compare the first quarter of one year with the first quarter of the next or the last with the last. That's the real situation that happens every year in the company.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Enough for Paula, but anyway we are open for additional explanation. Okay, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually my question is on the operational side as well. I have one question referring production and again another one on refining. I think it's pretty much actually a clarification on both Frank's and Paula's question so far.</p>
          <p>On the production side, if I understood right, the problems of that 17,000 barrels a day that you missed in production was because of the transportation issues you had with the pipeline, right? I just want to confirm that that was the main issue. It was transportation or did we had any type of, let's say, lower than expected increase in production?</p>
          <p>In addition, also on this question, if you could just tell me &#x2013; I'm not sure if you can open that, but if you could just tell me from the proper produced volumes how much came from each one of the five or six main fields Ecopetrol controls?</p>
          <p>And lastly also on the production, I understood the last part of the comments mentioning about chemical injection, the in-situ combustion. I mean, are these projects performing as expected? Because in the last guidance we understood that four or five critical fields were under some operational upgrade that were critical to increase production. And also just a final comment on production. On Chichimene you mentioned right now like 30 seconds ago that the in-situ combustion in Chichimene has already started. I understood this was target only for the end of the year. If you could update me on how this product state is going on I would be more than happy. Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Basically you have four questions, okay. One in relation with the impact of the transportation, okay. The second one is how we can split the production and the main areas that we are operating &#x2013; the main fields that we are operating. Chichimene, okay, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:41) combustion but really we are developing, okay. Okay, these three, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Actually it was like five questions in one. Let me one by one answer you, Caio. The first one, the final run, you were asking if all the differential in production came from transportation. The answer is not. I mean, the &#x2013; as you know, there were some attacks on the infrastructure in Ca&#xF1;o Limon-Cove&#xF1;as, okay? The first question. Second one is the status on the Chichimene <mark type="indiscernible" /> (51:21). Let me tell you that we are in the early structuring stages, so in &#x2013; and we are kind of working in a customized technology for the field. And your question regarding production by fields, Cartagena is almost 101,000. I'm going to give you some rough numbers, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fine. The big numbers are fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. <mark type="ph" /> Wahira (51:51) is like 60,000 barrels equivalent, Rubiales is 97,000, and others including FPI is like 22,000. Okay? La Cira-Infantas, the LCI field in Middle Mag is 20,000, Casabe in the Middle Mag is 22,000, Nare is 17,000, and Chichimene is 43,000 barrels per share. Let me clarify, is Ecopetrol's net working interest. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perfect. Thanks a lot. Yes, and it covers my question. On the downstream, it's, I couldn't totally understand &#x2013; understood the answer you guys gave to Frank McGann. I mean, it really puzzles me why the downstream segment has been delivering interesting result up until two quarters ago. My question would be, shall we expect over the next quarters in 2012 the downstream segment to deliver negative results? Or this was &#x2013; again, I understand you guys already answered that, but I couldn't understand the answer. Or shall we expect it to change only when you have the upgrades in Barrancabermeja and Cartagena done?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Caio, Pedro Rosales. Mainly the situation in this quarter was generated by a scheduled turnaround of the main plant for the processing unit in Barrancabaermeja refinery, and at the same time in Cartagena <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:35), that was an unscheduled maintenance. It's not a thing that with us we didn't consider is planned this maintenance. Its maintenance is made every five years. Then in this time we had this situation. Additionally, we took  <mark type="indiscernible" /> (54:02) with the projects we will develop new strengths on the refinery cost. We can't use crudes that have a lower cost and produce more products.</p>
          <p>In this moment, we produced more than 75% of produce that are with higher cost and fixed cost that is the crude, and with the projects we will increase up to 95%. Then we have an exceptional situation in the first quarter and we expect in the near term that we have a better result in the refining. But in the long term, additionally we have a short-term solution that is entrance of the project that give us another characteristics of the refineries. I don't know if it's clear the answer for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. No, no, now it's clear. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Chris Audi from Santander. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Let me take one question at a time. The first one going back to the topic of costs. I was just trying to understand when we look at your some of the main costs, such as maintenance, such as labor, such as other, there was a significant decrease on these costs in this fourth quarter &#x2013; sorry, in this first quarter versus the fourth quarter. So I'm just trying to understand this lower &#x2013; this new lower level that you achieved in the first quarter, is that recurring, is that sustainable or not? So that's my first question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's go to answer the first question. Adriano is taking the answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As I already explained to Paula Kovarsky, there is slight <mark type="indiscernible" /> (56:11) here in Ecopetrol. We have execution team by this last quarter every year. That's why when you compare with this figure of last quarter every year with the first quarter of next year, it will look like a decrease, which is not exactly real, but it's reflecting that the activity is higher in the last quarter as compared to the first quarter of next year. That's why it's better to compare first quarter with first quarter of next year and last quarter with last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So going forward we should rely &#x2013; when we look at these important costs, such as maintenance, such as labor, such as other, we should expect, for example, the second quarter of this year to have figures that are closer to the fourth quarter of last year, in other words higher figures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's what I'm saying. Last quarter of every year reflects an increase in activity in the expectation of cost and expenses that happens only by the last part of the year every year. So that's why what you have to do is compare the first quarter of this year with the first quarter of last year. There is of course some increase due to new activity and due to the fact that we are, for example, hiring more people for more activity, but the increases should not reach levels as last quarter or last quarter of every year &#x2013; in last year or -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So in other words, these costs in the second quarter should be higher than what we saw now in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct, which is a cycle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But not greater as it was during the last quarter of 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, understood. All right. And then the other question that I had to do with prices for your exports of oil. It seems like you were able to sell your exports of oil at a discount to Brent of around 5%, 6% in the first quarter, which was similar to the fourth quarter of last year, which equates to more or less a premium, if I did my calculations correctly, of around 8% to WTI, this during the first quarter, and 10% in the fourth quarter. My question to you is, given your commercial strategy, as we look out to the second quarter or even third quarter, do you think you'll be able to maintain this level of premium of 8% to 10% to WTI, or should be considered kind of a downward move on this premium going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Pedro Rosales. Let me try to answer your question in two parts. First is to emphasize that due to the WTI disconnection from market that was necessary to choose annual benchmarks for our crude oil sales and then the Brent is &#x2013; the markets are &#x2013; we are using for 65% of the crude oil shipment traded today and the order is with Maya. This is driven by the highest liquidity of markets that may be a feasible option for pricing our crudes. And, for example, U.S. refiners agree to trade their purchases against Brent or Maya. Then we expect that if the trend of the market continue in the same way we will expect similar margins that we had in the previous quarter, but it depends really on the strength on the market and the evolution of main &#x2013; or some factors that are, as you know, affecting that market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Understood. Thank you. And just to finish up, going back to the topic of production, can you just give us an update on the progress of the Bicentenario Pipeline. The first stage &#x2013; if I'm not incorrect &#x2013; it was supposed to start sometime in the middle of 2012. I think construction was up to &#x2013; was progressing well, 40%, 45% of it was done. Can you give us an update on how that's going? And do you still expect the first phase to begin, let's say, in July of 2012, or it might take longer than that, please?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I mentioned report I am almost sure. Right now we are expecting that the Bicentenario Pipeline would be starting its operation in the fourth quarter. We have been experience some problems with the development of the construction plan mainly in the Arauca region, notwithstanding that we have been completing the activities in the Catanzaro region. But due to the some problems with the communities and the public order, we are expecting we aren't going to be able to be in operation until the fourth quarter of this year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And with that, Mr. Guti&#xE9;rrez, you still &#x2013; despite this delay in this startup of the pipeline, you are still maintaining your production targets on an unconsolidated basis of 750,000 for 2012? Despite the fact that this pipeline extension is only starting now in the fourth quarter, you are still able to maintain that target of 750,000 on a non-consolidated basis and 800,000 on a consolidated basis for 2012?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good evening, Anish Kapadia here from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Just getting back to the production. I just wonder if you could clarify the 800,000 barrels per day target. Is that an exit rate for 2012 or an average rate for 2012? And I just wanted to know what impact the Bicentenario pipeline have on your production rate. So if it's not complete what would the maximum production be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Anish, the number &#x2013; first  of all, the number 800,000 is Corporate Group. Okay? That includes Ecopetrol, Hocol, Equi&#xF3;n, and is an average year number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What does that mean in terms of your exit rate for what you're expecting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>800,000 is for the Group. If suppose that the contribution of our affiliate is around 50,000 barrels per day, okay. In that way Ecopetrol production is around 750,000. I mentioned in the previous question, notwithstanding the delay in Bicentenario pipeline, we have been developing different strategies to be able to transport. The target is not affecting our production targets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. What I was trying to figure out was, when the Bicentenario pipeline comes on stream, what production rate should you be able to get up to at the end of the year, so what should your end of year rate be for the full Group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The capacity of some pipeline is designed for 450,000 barrels per day. But in its first step, first stage is going to have a capacity of around 125 barrels per day is going to connect with Ca&#xF1;o Lim&#xF3;n-Cove&#xF1;as pipeline. It is important to remember that our participation in the Bicentennial pipeline is 55% in that way the pipeline capacity corresponds to us is about 65,000, 70,000 barrels per day. That will be the maximum impact that we would have in case of any delay of the Bicentenario pipeline. But we are learning to develop different strategies to attack this problem.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. My second question just relates to the permitting security situation in Columbia at present seems to certainly not be getting any better at the moment. Could you just run through how you see permitting and how you see that progressing security side of things especially with the Ca&#xF1;o Lim&#xF3;n-Cove&#xF1;as pipeline and the timing permits on CPO-9?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we have been commenting, we have some problems there, but at the same time, it's very satisfactory to confer that we have been reacting in a very positive way. We have been developing some programs for the protection of the pipeline in conjunction with military forces and with different authorities. But at the same time, we have been working with local and regional authorities. We have been developing some plans to work with their communities to develop social investment. And as we have observed during the first quarter, we have had higher availability of the Ca&#xF1;o Lim&#xF3;n-Cove&#xF1;as facility. We compare the availability that we had during the second semester of 2011. That way we consider that we can be reliable in terms of how we expect the evolution of the availability of the Ca&#xF1;o Limon-Cove&#xF1;as pipeline.</p>
          <p>And we maintain very strict programs in terms of the protection and preventing activities to reduce the risk of any event &#x2013; affect the facility. In general, the new <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:09:27), we have some problems, but at the same time the government with <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:09:34), the main position have been developing a very strong program to react against different attacks that we have been experimented by the Group. And really if we compare the number <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:09:54), really we haven't had significant increase in terms of number of attacks to the infrastructure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. Could you just tell me where gross production on Rubiales is at the moment. And if you still believe that you can achieve 200,000 barrels a day gross production from Rubiales in future?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Anish, the gross production for Rubiales still is around 170,000, and we expect in the short term to achieve 180,000. Regarding your question, if we are able to reach 200,000 barrels, the answer is yes. We are working very hard in order to get the numbers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. I had three very quick questions. The very first one is for &#x2013; I think more for Adriana than anyone else. I just wanted to understand, Adriana, you made it very clear that there is seasonality effect on the results. But when I do the calculation backwards, so just looking at how much was reported and costs on a per barrel basis for the E&amp;P side of the business, you guys reported about $9 a barrel. And what I'm getting to just doing the calculation the other way around is about $7. I just wanted to understand, is there anything, I would say, offsetting costs in the E&amp;P side of the business this quarter that would not be recurring for the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, Gustavo. There was certain events that happened in the second quarter of last year, where we had first estimated an expense of COP$370 billion for Chichimene project. However, that project was dead after the discussion with our statutory auditors, reversed and capitalized. That's why you find that reversion in the fourth quarter of 2011, and then there is a reduction of that in the fourth quarter. And you find that effect no longer in the next &#x2013; or next period such as the first quarter of this year. So that's why exactly your calculations look like going up and then down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. On the second point &#x2013; Adriana, I think still another one for you. There is absolutely massive improvement in working capital in this quarter. Again the question here is, is that something that is sustainable? Can you consider that you guys have, let's say, near zero working capital requirement to operate Ecopetrol or was this, let's say, a specially quarter in that sense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the COP$8 billion increase in our working capital during this period of the first quarter was due to mainly oil prices flattening. And also what Pedro already commented regarding our new commercialization and marketing strategy. So that's why we found that for this year we already have all the money in place in order to deployed into our CapEx operations as well as current operations of the company. So we find no any longer or anymore funding needs <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:15:12). And second, we really expect that this cash flow will continue to increase if oil prices right now looking dropping at any moment this year according to our estimation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a last one. I don't know who would be best for this one. But as you heard from Paula's questions, there is some level of doubt in the market with regards to how Ecopetrol might actually bring more reserves into being. And I was just wondering, now that the SEC allows you to disclose your 2P reserves, why not disclose them? I'm actually little bit surprised that you didn't you do it in the 20F this year. Do you guys see any problem in doing that? And if not, can you tell us where your 2P reserves actually are today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We do not disclose 2P reserves, since we are SEC listed company and we are only allowed to disclose 1P reserve. And 2P reserves are considered as forward-looking statements here. They are not developed yet, for instance, the certainty of development depends on many other factors. So in our case, as you know, our 1P reserves are 99% audited and certified by independent auditors in the different firms recognized the industry. So that we are 100% sure that these reserves that we are revealing to the market are, I mean, more certain that we can really state.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But, Adriana, I was just confused. I got the impression that you said because you are SEC regulated, you couldn't disclose. Has that changed again? Because I was under the impression that you are allowed now to do so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We are -- remember that the SEC that two years ago said that you could reveal your 2P reserves, but you could, but you are not obliged to. So what we did was to make a consultation with our advisors and they said better not, since there is no standard for that revealing in fact. So what drilling companies were doing when they reveal their 2P reserves are using their own standards, since SEC has not set any up <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:17:56). So that's why we are divided based on that to be conservative and state our 1P reserves which are in our estimate and are certain audited and certified by a third party.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Nathan Piper from RBC Capital Markets. You have an expensive questioning already, so I'll keep fairly short. And first of all, I wonder if you'd be a bit more specific around your contingencies for increased production, if you don't have the Bicentennial on stream. I assume you've been trucking, and perhaps that means higher costs. But I wonder if you could give &#x2013; be a bit more specific on that. And secondly <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:18:54) and indeed unconventional potential in Colombia, when do you think you might have first commercial production from the unconventional resources in Colombia? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The first one, you are right, we are planning the additional use of trucking. But additionally we are planning to have some increases in the certain facilities or pipelines to allow us to support the increase in the capacity. But it's not only the trucking. It's the possibility to have some additional capacity in the current pipeline, mainly <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:19:46).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nathan, regarding to your second question when we expect to get production from unconventionals, as you are aware, we just finished the well. For your information, we plan to drill four wells this year and our 2020 plan there is a production that will come from unconventional. But honestly to tell you the date is very complicated. I will keep you update about progress in the unconventional point. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You have 27,000 barrels a day by 2015 or contribution from unconventionals. I guess maybe how long do you think it will actually take you to understand the commercial potential? Because clearly unconventional is very early stage in Colombia, and it takes time to work out, to drill it, and also then it takes time to work how to exploit it best. So should we safely assume that it will be towards 2015 before we'll see any meaningful production from unconventionals?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you got it. It's a good approximate date. I mean, we're looking at different areas.

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thank you. I actually have three quick questions. They are all related to some of my colleagues' questions around how to fulfill the guidance on reserves in the future. And the first one is what I understand it could be one of the greatest contribution from the Chichimene's in situ commercial pilot that you are running right now. Chichimene currently accounts for conservatively lower recovery rates under your overall reserves. Can you provide us little color on what do you effectively expect to achieve on this pilot? And when should we get these results and how should they translate into potential commercial deployment in that sense?</p>
          <p>And the second question is actually related to your exploratory campaign. Do you have any news or can you comment on the upcoming stats for appraising and declaring the commerciality of Logan and Itauna?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Pedro, let us start for the second one, okay, if you don't mind. Regarding the exploration, in Logan we are working in the design for Logan 2, which is going to be the appraisal well. So hopefully we will view Logan 2 by first or second quarter of the next year. And regarding Itauna-2, currently we are on the revaluation of the result of the well. Okay? Is it clear for you?</p>

In some cases, some of your foreigners are reported to be actively pursuing asset sales as well. Can you comment on how is Ecopetrol's position evolving towards new acquisitions, especially in light of what seems to be higher cash flow generation than it was a originally budgeted offline with the current oil prices?</p>
