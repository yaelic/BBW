          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Maximilian Sch&#xF6;berl, Director of Corporate Affairs. I would like to welcome you all to the Third Quarter Telephone Conference of BMW AG in 2008.</p>
          <p>With me today are Dr. Norbert Reithofer, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG and Dr. Friedrich Eichiner, Member of the Board of Management responsible for Corporate and Brand Development. As you all know from our invitation that Dr. Ganal is currently recuperating from an illness. In the meantime Dr. Eichiner will be responsible for the Financial Division of the BMW Group on a temporary basis, and will hold both functions until Dr. Ganal has fully recovered.</p>
          <p>Norbert Reithofer and Friedrich Eichiner will give a brief overview of the third quarter of 2008. Afterwards, we will have time for a question-and-answer session. Dr. Reithofer, the mic is yours.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, once again I would like to welcome you to our telephone conference. The international financial crisis has gained further momentum in the third quarter, and has now hit the real economy with full force. However, what is important, the BMW Group is prepared to meet these challenges head-on. The BMW group remains a strong performing Company with a solid foundation. These qualities enable us to weather effectively such stormy conditions, and continue to invest into our future. Despite the fact that this situation exceeds anything we have ever seen before, I would like to emphasize here, this is not the first challenging situation for our Company. Just think of the oil crisis in 1973, the weak market during 1992 and 1993 or the Rover sale. Times like these have made our Company what it is today.</p>
          <p>After such challenging times there is a period of renewed growth. Today, however, we have a major advantage. We have initiated specific actions early on. And these measures are set to pay off in the short and long term, making us a leaner, more efficient and more effective Company.</p>
          <p>Today, I would like to concentrate on the following; first, given the current situation, what are BMW Group's targets? Second, what actions are we taking right now? Third, which solutions do we offer in the field of individual mobility for the future that will help us ensure our long-term success and growth?</p>
          <p>First, what are our targets? In light of the tense situation on the global auto market, the business development for the year 2008 cannot be forecasted at present. But one thing is clear: Group sales will not exceed last year's record level. Two of our three premium brands, MINI and Rolls-Royce, are growing. Accordingly, we will not be able to reach the planned return on sales of 4% for the Group and an EBIT of close to 4% in the Automobile segment. We might have to increase risk provisions once more in the fourth quarter to prepare for a more long-term weakness in the market. Fact is, we will achieve a positive Group result for the business year 2008. Nevertheless, at present, we are not able to give you an exact figure.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to our long-term targets. Our goal to achieve a return on sales of 6% on Group level in 2010 remains unchanged. EBIT in the Automobile segment is set to be at least 6%, obviously based on a market up-turn. We also confirm our long-term strategic targets for the year 2012, which has been determined by our strategy Number ONE. We are talking about the return on sales of 8 to 10%, and a return on capital employed of over 26% in the Automobile segment.</p>
          <p>Our efforts to enhance efficiency and effectiveness are starting to take hold. We have an extremely attractive product portfolio for the next few years, also, with regard to a new drive systems.</p>
          <p>So where do we stand today, following the first nine months of the year? As of September, we increased sales by 1.7%. In a declining market environment, we managed to sell more than 1.1 million cars worldwide, more than any of our competitors. This shows how popular our products are, thanks to their innovative technologies and high quality.</p>
          <p>Despite the enormous additional burdens arising from the current economic situation and hesitant consumer spending, Group revenues stood at &#x20AC;40.4 billion, matching last year's high level. Adjusted for currency changes, Group revenues would have risen by 5.1%.</p>
          <p>External factors had a significant negative impact on our pre-tax profit of Group level. In the first nine months of the year, we recorded a decline by 43.3% to 1.52 billion, year-on-year. Mr. Eichiner will tell you more about the business development in the third quarter later.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to my second point, what actions are we taking right now? We are cutting costs. Between June and September, our research and development expenditure decreased 5.1% from last year, without jeopardizing our lead in innovation. We are today much more efficient. We also invested heavily in new technologies at an earlier stage.</p>
          <p>We also achieved a considerable reduction in marketing and administrative costs, adjusted for the additional expenses for employee compensation payments. This applies both to the third quarter and the first nine months of this year. In total, we improved our fixed cost position, compared with last year. In addition, we have set up specific activities to cut HR expenses. At present, we are negotiating with the employee representatives about the voluntary fringe benefits exceeding general pay. Our goal is to establish a stronger tie between employees' pay and the Company's overall performance.</p>
          <p>The following initial results have been achieved. Due to the lower operating earnings, we will reduce a profit sharing bonus for the business year 2008 from the 2007 level. In the future, calculation of these voluntary benefits will be based more strongly on performance indicators. This will add a significant contribution to our earnings, and therefore, greater entrepreneurial spirit will continue to pay off for our associates. From 2009 onwards, a new calculation model will also be applied to the Christmas bonus. Our current personnel reductions are proceeding as planned. Compared to the end of 2007, we have reduced BMW Group head count by 3,689 employees. This figure includes 1,778 Cirquent staff.</p>
          <p>As previously announced, we sold 73% of our shares in the IT consulting from Cirquent to Japan based NTT Data. The number of termination agreements concluded by the end of September stands at almost 2,700, <mark type="inaudible" /> 2,200 in Germany. Two thousand four hundred of the 2,700 employees will have left the Company by the end of the year. The previously announced personnel reduction of 3,100 permanent staff and 5,000 temporary employees will be reached by the end of the year. This sum does not include Cirquent staff.</p>
          <p>Despite the difficult situation, we remain committed to our social responsibility principles. As one of the world's most admired companies, we will continue to offer high quality training to young people. In 2009, we will hire more than 1,100 apprentices. This is a clear investment in the future. It is also our commitment in providing skilled labor for the community.</p>
          <p>We have also taken action in the production early on. Customers are buying fewer cars, and this is true for all market segments. It makes absolutely no sense to produce for stock only. Instead, we are taking quick and effective actions in this area. About 15,000 cars from the United States being reallocated to other markets with stronger profit margins. As you know, we plan to reduce our production by 25,000 units. We find it necessary to cut at least 40,000 units more from our initial production plan for 2008. Our highly flexible production network, with its flexible working-time accounts, gives us room to maneuver.</p>
          <p>All these activities show that profitability's our top priority. Earnings are more important than a mere growth in numbers. All our actions are based on careful consideration and foresight. It does not make sense to build-up stocks, which are bound to reduce our revenues later on.</p>
          <p>We also have a commitment to our dealerships and the well-being of the Company. But, there is another aspect towards improving profitability. We are reviewing all product projects again. And, we thus have decided that there will not be a series model of the Concept CS. A recent analysis has shown that first, despite the great feedback this car has achieved so far, it does not match our ambitious profitability target. Second, our three premium brands have a strong brand image all around the world. This has been proven, for instance, by the latest brand index analysis. So, for the time being, we can do without this brand-shaper, since we have many others in our portfolio.</p>
          <p>Third and most important, is that we want to focus our resources primarily on future projects and new technologies. In other words, currently our top priorities are "EfficientDynamics" and "project I".</p>
          <p>Our Financial Services business has also responded to the changing business situation. We have taken out additional provisions against residual value and credit risks in the first and second quarters of the year. And we have shifted our focus from leasing to financing. But, fact remains, customers will continue to demand leasing offers. We stand to benefit from "EfficientDynamics" in the medium term, for when these cars return, the residual values of these pre-owned cars will prove more stable than any of our competitors' cars; thanks to our technological lead. As you can see, we are taking action, and at the same time, we are setting the course for our future success.</p>
          <p>This brings me to my third point, which solutions for individual mobility to be offered to secure our future? Our priorities are clear. First, our competitive advantage in the field of efficient premium vehicles continues to pay off. In Germany, our sales volume rose by 0.6% for BMW and 7.8% for MINI, compared with the third quarter of 2007. In France, we posted an increased of 5% for BMW and 12% for MINI, despite, or maybe because of, increasingly strict carbon regulations. In China, we also grew during the third quarter by 35% for BMW and 24% for MINI.</p>
          <p>Second, we have a highly attractive model portfolio that continues to set trends while meeting our customers' ever increasing demands. On September 20, we launched the revised BMW 3 Series Sedan and the 3 Series Touring. The BMW X6 has been available for a half a year now. This car is exceeding all expectations. Demand is high, particularly in the US, in Italy, Germany and the Middle East. It underlines BMW's ability to create a new segment successfully. The new BMW 7 Series is due out in Europe this month. Initial feedback at the international media presentation in Dresden was more than positive, outstanding.</p>
          <p>And let me add a third point, we are offering new technologies and drive concepts. In 2009, two BMW Hybrid models will reach series maturity, the BMW 7 Series and the X6. At the Paris Motor show, we presented the BMW concept X1 and the MINI Crossover Concept, two cars that demonstrate how we will expand our model portfolio in the future. And at the Los Angeles Auto Show in mid-November, we are going to present the Electric MINI, with a reach 240 kilometers and a charging time of only two to two and a half hours. The initial 500 MINI E's will be delivered to the US market. However, we are currently evaluating whether the launch, whether to launch the MINI E in Europe as well. Another important step is our so-called Mega City car that will be offered with two different drive systems, an all-electric power train and a highly efficient combustion engine.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot foresee the full extent of the international financial crisis and its duration yet. However, all of us need to remain calm and not constantly fuel peoples' fears even further.</p>
          <p>There is also a lot of debate about what government should do to improve the situation. As we see it, the top priority should be taking a few crucial decisions and doing so quickly. Number one, to define realistic carbon requirements for Europe, with a timeframe that can be synchronized with product life cycles. Number two, and this applies to Germany in particular, to determine reliable conditions for a carbon based motor tax. This move could calm down the market and strengthen customer confidence. And number three, to strengthen instruments that promote research and the development of innovations on the national and European level. To this end, it will be crucial to avoid distorting competition, and to focus on technologies for sustainable individual mobility.</p>
          <p>Strategy Number ONE is our compass to the year 2020. We remain confident that we will achieve a positive Group result in 2008, despite the challenging market conditions. We are making progress in all areas concerning our strategy, and we have improved our performance on an operational level. We remain committed to our long-term targets for 2010 and 2012. And we have proved time and again, that we are a strong Company. In the current situation, we have shown once more that we have the right measures in place and that we are acting resolutely. In the long-term, this will clearly benefit the BMW Group.</p>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Norbert Reithofer. And now, Friedrich Eichiner will give you an update on the financials of the BMW Group. Dr. Eichiner, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. As Norbert Reithofer already explained, our strategy Number ONE is clearly paying off. In the course of the business year 2008, we improved our operating performance and increased our efficiency. This can be clearly seen in the reduction of our R&amp;D ratio. However, this positive business trend is being overshadowed by negative external factors. The financial crisis is increasingly affecting the real economy, and the automotive sector in particular. We are feeling the effects of this in the new car business, as customers are holding back. This applies, especially, to our major high volume markets, namely the US and Europe. And it is making itself felt in the pre-owned car business.</p>
          <p>Residual values are coming under mounting pressure, above all in Europe. In consequence, we had to increase the risk provision once more. It now amounts to over a &#x20AC;1billion. Naturally, these developments are reflected in our current performance figures.</p>
          <p>Group profit before tax, after the first nine months, was 43.3% lower year-on-year. Return on sales was 3.8%. However, I believe the following describes a more realistic picture of what we are actually capable of. This year we have increased our risk provision, by a total of &#x20AC;1.037 billion so far. Moreover, we shouldered a one-off expense for personals related measures of &#x20AC;258 million in the first three quarters. In addition, the profit earned in the same period last year included a positive one-off Rolls-Royce effect of &#x20AC;66 million. Net of these three factors, group profit before tax was not down 43%. Instead it was up nearly 8% or &#x20AC;201 million. This would correspond to a return on sales of 7% on Group level.</p>
          <p>So, we continue to be a strong performing Company. Nevertheless, we are calmly taking a number of actions in order to react sensibly to the current situation, and emerge from this crisis even stronger. Norbert Reithofer has already given you an overview of our activities. I will revisit this issue later. Now let me give you some details concerning the latest interim financial statements and our outlook.</p>
          <p>As in the first six months, the increase in the risk provision for residual values and credit defaults was the single largest negative factor in the third quarter. We mentioned back in August that we were still watching over the situation with great care, and that we would increase the provision if necessary. The situation in the USA hasn't improved significantly since then. And it has actually become even worse in Europe, above all in Germany and the UK. For this, while we increased our risk provisions by another &#x20AC;342 million in the third quarter, &#x20AC;232 million are attributable to residual value losses and &#x20AC;110 million are allocable to credit risks. This brings the total provisions accrued in the first nine months of this financial year to the &#x20AC;1.037 billion I mentioned earlier. We may have to raise provisions in the fourth quarter. This will depend on how the residual values continue to develop. We will, thus, continue to monitor the situation very closely. That was the current state of our risk provisions.</p>
          <p>As I said earlier, currency effects, raw material prices and staff cuts are additional negative factors. Also, they have not deteriorated more than expected since the first two quarters of 2008. They have become worse compared with last year. In the third quarter, expenses incurred to reduce the workforce amounted to &#x20AC;151 million. This brings us to the &#x20AC;258 million as of September, I mentioned in the opening. As often stated in the past, we estimate that foreign exchange rates have an adverse effect of &#x20AC;400 million for the full year. Negative impact of increases in raw material prices will rise to a triple-digit million euro figure by the end of the year as well. But, I would also like to mention that we see some relief due to the latest developments on the commodity markets. Therefore, the additional burden will most probably be less than the &#x20AC;400 million we originally expected.</p>
          <p>Next on my agenda are developments of the individual lines of business, starting with the Automobile segment. This is where the lion's share of the negative effects I just mentioned were felt. One hundred ten million euros of the increased risk provision were allocable to this segment in the third quarter. This is based on the loss sharing agreement with the Financial Services business. This brings the total residual value expenses in the other Automobile segment to &#x20AC;560 million as of September. Accordingly, the profit before the financial results recorded by the Automobile segment in the third quarter declined to &#x20AC;141 million, compared with &#x20AC;788 million in same period last year. The EBIT margin for the quarter was up 1.3%. Segment EBIT after the first nine months totaled &#x20AC;1.16 billion, compared to &#x20AC;2.27 billion in the same period last year. This corresponds to an EBIT margin of 3.1%.</p>
          <p>Next up is the Financial Services segment. It was marked by risk provision measures as well. This is because this segment accounts to the remaining share of residual value provisions as well as for the credit default provisions. Negative effect totaled &#x20AC;232 million in third quarter and &#x20AC;477 million as of September 2008. In addition, the financing costs were higher due to the rise in credit premiums on the capital market. Accordingly, earnings posted by Financial Services dropped from &#x20AC;191 million in third quarter of 2007 to a loss of &#x20AC;17 million in the quarter being reviewed. At &#x20AC;131 million, earnings in the first nine months of this year were significantly down on &#x20AC;563 million reported in the same period last year.</p>
          <p>As a rule, Financial Services is and will remain an integral part of our business policy. In view of the financial crisis, we'll bring the management of our new businesses in stronger alignment with <mark type="audio gap" /></p>
          <p>Let me explain some facts regarding our financing. We have &#x20AC;4.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents in marketable securities. This gives us a good liquidity position. And we were able to implement a number of transactions at the capital market successfully, even when times are difficult. For example, we issued a &#x20AC;1.35 billion euro <mark type="inaudible" /> in April. It has a term of five years and very attractive conditions. This is the largest transaction of this kind that we have ever concluded.</p>
          <p>In May, we successfully placed a &#x20AC;1.75 billion benchmark bond with a term of seven years. We are flexible enough to offset the increasingly unfavorable conditions on the bond market in recent months by expanding our private placement program. Moreover, at the end of September, we placed a &#x20AC;2.5 billion ABS transaction in September. This is the single largest transaction of its kind in the BMW Group's history.</p>
          <p>Another source of financing, the BMW bank's deposit business. This brings me to the reconciliation segment. In the third quarter, this segment's profit before tax was &#x20AC;285 million, compared with a &#x20AC;135 million loss in the same quarter last year. The strong rise was driven by the fair valuation of standalone interest rate derivatives and the sale of just under 73% of our stake in the Cirquent group, which we made as we realign our core in-house funding. Consolidation effects also had a positive impact. This concludes my remarks on the individual segments.</p>
          <p>Let us move on to the key financials at the Group level. In light of the decline in retail, Group revenue was down in the third quarter as well. It dropped by 8.6%, from &#x20AC;13.8 billion to &#x20AC;12.6 billion. After nine months, Group revenues have totaled &#x20AC;40.4 billion. This is roughly on par year-on-year. Net of currency effect, however, as of September, revenue was up 5.1%.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, the cost of sales was down 5.5% to &#x20AC;10.3 billion, despite the adverse effects of currencies, raw materials and high-risk provisions I mentioned earlier. Through September, the cost of sales had risen by 4% to &#x20AC;32.72 billion. <mark type="inaudible" />, as in the third quarter, were felt here.</p>
          <p>Research and development expenses for June to September dropped by 5.1%, year-on-year. This results in an R&amp;D ratio of 5.6%, according to German HGB in the third quarter. R&amp;D expenditure after first three quarters was 1.5% lower than in the same period last year. The R&amp;D ratio was 5.1%, compared with 5.7% a year earlier. These figures prove that we have become much more efficient in the field of research and development as well. As far as the German HGB R&amp;D ratio is concerned, we are already within the range of 5 to 5.5%, which we were aiming for in line with our strategy Number ONE. Here, we also benefit from the fact that we have done a lot of groundwork in the field of environmentally friendly drive systems in recent years. Now, this translates into a big competitive advantage. But we will continue to adhere to our maxim: continue investing in our brands, in technologies and product, and thus, in our future.</p>
          <p>Moving right on to the profit before the financial result, in the third quarter it declined by 60.2% to &#x20AC;387 million. This corresponds to a Group EBIT margin of 3.1%. After the first nine months, Group EBIT amounted to &#x20AC;1.64 billion. This was 43.6% down, year-on-year. The EBIT margin for this period was 4.1%.</p>
          <p>Compared to the third quarter of 2007, the financial result improved by &#x20AC;100 million to minus &#x20AC;108 million. As of September 2008, the financial result was a negative &#x20AC;117 million, following a negative &#x20AC;222 million in the same period last year. This was mainly due to fair valuation and a decline in the net interest expense.</p>
          <p>The BMW Group, thus, earned a profit before tax of &#x20AC;279 million in the third quarter. This represents a decline of 63.5%. And the return on sales of 2.2%. The profit before tax after the first three quarters totaled &#x20AC;1.52 billion. This was 43.3% less than a year earlier. The corresponding return on sales was, thus, 3.8%. As I mentioned earlier, we will not be able to increase this figure to the forecast 4%. This is because we still expect underlying conditions to be difficult.</p>
          <p>The tax expense amounted to &#x20AC;230 million after the first nine months. This translates into effective tax rate of 15.1%. The bottom line is that the BMW Group's net profit for the quarter dropped by 62.9% to &#x20AC;298 million. Year-to-date, this resulted in a decline of 39.7% to &#x20AC;1.29 billion. This concludes my presentation of the key financials of our income statement.</p>
          <p>I would now like to comment on a few select items from the balance sheet and cash flow statement. As of September 30, inventories totaled &#x20AC;8.88 billion compared with &#x20AC;8.53 billion at the end of the second quarter. As you can see, we have not raised our inventory levels significantly in the last few months, mainly thanks to our adjustments to production volumes.</p>
          <p>As of September 30, 2008, cash flows from Industrial Operations totaled &#x20AC;3.39 billion, and were 24.2% down, year-on-year. This was caused by the decline in earnings. In consequence, free cash flow for the first nine months was a negative &#x20AC;64 million for the time being. However, one must take into account the fact that this figure includes the one-off expenses related to the work force reduction and the increased risk provision, among other things.</p>
          <p>In view of the current risks on the financial markets, for safety reasons, we converted triple-digit million euro demand deposits into money market paper in the first quarter. Without these effects, free cash flow would have been positive. The developments of individual cash flows caused cash and cash equivalents to rise by nearly &#x20AC;1.3 billion to &#x20AC;3.65 billion. The Group's liquidity position thus remains robust.</p>
          <p>Net financial assets in industrial business amount to more than &#x20AC;5.4 billion as of September 30, 2008. This figure already includes the first tranche of our externalization of our pension obligations. For this purpose, we transferred more than &#x20AC;1 billion in securities to the newly established BMW Trust in July. This rounds-off my commentary of the last interim financial statements.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, taking stock, given the development of our earnings so far, and the global economy's uncertain situation, it is possible to reliably forecast -- it is possible [sic] (impossible) to reliably forecast the Company's profits for the year. The same applies to the fiscal 2009. It is impossible to make any stable predictions regarding retail or earnings. I am certain you would agree with me here. But there is simply too much uncertainty in the markets at this time. But one thing is for sure, we are putting our pedal to the metal in numerous areas in order to rise to our current challenges.</p>
          <p>We are leveraging our flexible structures in order to adapt production to demand. This and other measures will help us optimize our working capital, as evidenced by the inventory grant among other things. We are reducing our material and fixed costs, as can be seen from a decline in the cost of sales and selling costs. We are rolling up our sleeves to lower the personnel expense by reducing the workforce and negotiating voluntary fringe benefits that go above and beyond what has been collectively agreed. We are making our research and development work more efficient as documented by the current R&amp;D ratio. Furthermore, we are acting with foresight by increasing provisions for the residual value risks and credit defaults.</p>
          <p>But another thing is for certain as well. Taking actions to improve efficiency alone will not be enough over the long-term. This is why we are resolutely implementing performance measures resulting from our strategy Number ONE at the same time. The key words here are EfficientDynamics, project I, and tapping new fields of businesses, for example in the after-sales.</p>
          <p>Therefore, we are still aiming for return on sales of at least 6% for fiscal 2010. Of course, whether we achieve this goal will depend to a great degree on how quickly and how well the economy and the sales markets recover. However, we are optimistic because by introducing new generations of major high-volume models, we will have a decisive lever for reducing material costs starting in 2010.</p>
          <p>As regards our targets until 2012, we still believe the following: based on the flexibility we have in our production network, our competitive edge above all in the field of environmentally-friendly drive systems and the counter measures I mentioned earlier, we still expect that we will achieve an EBIT margin in the Automobile business of 8 to 10% in 2012.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good afternoon, I just have two to three questions if I may. The first one is given the high profit particularly on pre-tax basis you made in the reconciliation line, perhaps you could shed a little bit more light on that, what were the driving factors behind that? You mentioned them in general, but to have some figures on that, particularly whether you have, might have benefited from the release of provisions <mark type="inaudible" /> as we saw your other provisions being down 441 million compared to the prior year's figures for the first nine months.</p>
          <p>And the second question would be, when adjusting your Financial Services' profit results for the one-off effects of special items you faced there, they should come in currently at, or they, just by calculating them, they're now on a record level. Perhaps, and this is in times with the risk costs being particularly high and high refinancing cost. Perhaps you can give some explanation for that as well please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much Mark. The answer will be come from Fritz Eichiner.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first point Mark, is the reconciliations which really had some effects. And I'd like to mention first that we had, we sold nearly 73% of the shares of our software company Cirquent, and that has an effect in reconciliations. That is one thing. Another thing that is worthwhile mentioning is that we had an effect from <mark type="inaudible" />, of the reversal of <mark type="inaudible" /> vision, which we now really had to take out. And last but not least, we had some positive effects with some swaps, and interest, swaps that had a higher value in this particular quarter. So this was the first point.</p>
          <p>The second part's about Financial Services. In the Financial Services business, clearly as you know and we've shown in our numbers, where we're hit by the risk in the big markets and we tried to compensate. First of all, improving the cost basis, we really think, we thought so far did a good job in bringing the costs down and compensating there. On the other hand, we had a growing business still. So we think, still think, on the operational side, the business is solid and sound, and will, let's say, give us hope for the future. And those are the basic effects we had to compensate risk in this area.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have two more technical questions if I may. Firstly, on your provisions, especially in the Financial Services division, you increased your risk provisions for Financial Services by 477 million so far this year. Now my question is when I look at the balance sheet of the Financial Services business, there is total other provisions at the end of the third quarter of 480 million. So, only roughly the amount by which you increased your risk provisions. Maybe you can comment on that. And what's the effect behind this? And secondly, you had a positive tax result in the second -- in third quarter. If you can explain that, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Tim, thank you very much. The answer will be come from Fritz Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, as far as we see, residual value provisions were subtracted from the assets, right? That is one of the effects that has to be mentioned here. His second question was the tax result in quarter three, right? Well, it is, it's mainly, it has to do with the different tax rates we have around the world. So, as you are aware that our business in the, especially in the US was under pressure, and there we have a high tax rate. And we brought it down, and we reallocated volume and brought the volume into other markets. But this was basically one of the major effects we had here. And that was a reason why the tax rate went down to the expected 15% average for this year, as far as I can see it.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I've basically three questions. Dr. Reithofer you're presenting this quarter today, it's reflecting BMW in a very tough cyclical environment. But I'm wondering what indicators you're measuring that this is not a structural decline that we're seeing? Your mix is down, your net revenue per unit is falling 11%, your residual values are falling in an unprecedented way. How can you be so comfortable that this is just a glitch for one or two years and that BMW will emerge so strong? And secondly, on the cost side, you have reiterated your 6 billion target until 2012. And I think in the press conference I heard you correctly that you said if at all, you have to revise it upwards. Could you talk about the mix of those? Assuming that revenue is coming down, isn't this making your material cost savings much more harder to achieve and especially, anticipating a supply environment, which will be more challenging than ever? And thirdly, I think a quarter ago you ruled out that BMW is losing money. Do you still rule this out for the year 2009? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Joaquin Gerkin. I think we start with Norbert Reithofer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You asked me what makes me confident. First of all, I have to say I'm realist. And as a realist I have to say, we are at the moment in a rough business environment. We are. And during all the quarterly reports, nearly all the quarterly reports you listened during the last couple of weeks you could feel that, I think. So what makes me confident on the BMW side? My answer is we are on the way to do our homework. And what does it mean? We presented to you figures in London that we will reduce our research and development ratio. So, and we can report today that during the last three months, development expenditures decreased 5.1%. We said we will reduce our marketing and administrative costs. And if you deduct additional expenses for employee compensation payment, we are on the right track. In total, if I see our fixed costs position, and I compare our fixed costs position with last year, I can say, as well, we are on the right track.</p>
          <p>If I see our current situation in the US market, Mr. Eichiner will tell you that we will move more from leasing penetration to financing. We moved cars out of the United States into other markets. In the meantime, I think we all agree it's more and more difficult to move the cars from the United States to European market &#x2013; for example Italy, Spain, the UK, even Germany &#x2013; because Europe is affected in the meantime as well. So that means reshaping our business in the US is definitely the right step as well. So, I can say we are on the way. And, I can only say where can we see, to summarize it again, our operating strength. I have to say we have improved operationally in the first nine months 2008. And I have to say the unusual accumulation of a number of adverse environment factors, has overshadowed this trend, however.</p>
          <p>So, I have to say again, we are on our way. And we will be successful again as we already mentioned after the second quarter from 2010 on. Why? Because we will have new products in the markets. We will cut expenditure from a material cost point of view. And you asked me, I said during the press conference today, if we have a move away from the 6 billion, it can only be more, but not less. And that is how I see the situation that we are at the moment. Not in a nice situation, I think that we all know. But it's a good opportunity, as well, to reshape the Company. And I mean, I would like to mention as well, as you know, we have a very flexible production network. We have a lot of temps in our production network. We have so-called working-time accounts. If you see the production cuts, what we have taken in the third quarter, you can even say we are ahead of the pack to cut production.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. I've got a couple of questions, first if I may on the revised Financial Services policy. You mentioned this morning lease penetration in the US, I think, falling below 50%. Would you just be kind enough to tell us what kind of reduction that actually represents? Is it 5% or is it 15% down? And on the same subject, it is clear that your penetration in Financial Services at 48% means that even under the new policy you finance more than 50% of cars in the third quarter. So, wondered if you'd just run us through what's driving that increase? Are you actually finding less competition from third party providers? Is this a situation where you feel the captive finance subsidiary really needs to step up to the plate, and can you do that with no change in credit criteria?</p>
          <p>And if I just may come back to a point with Mr. Reithofer just now. I'm a bit confused about your production cut, actually. I thought it was tremendously impressive that you cut 36,000 down to the third quarter. But you're talking about 40,000 for the year as a whole. So, unless you're ahead of plan at the first half, it seems you've already got most of those out the way. In other words, how big's the fourth quarter production cut, please? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think we start with Norbert Reithofer and the production cut.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, we mentioned during our second quarter conference call that we have already decided to cut 25 -- first of all, let me start that we moved 15,000 units out of the United States into other market. And that we have to cut on top 25,000 units production compared to our original plans. So, and now we decided to cut on top of the 25,000 units at least additional 40,000 units. So, that means if you sum up both together, then we have already decided to cut at least 65,000 units compared to our original plan, not compared to last year. We said always compare to our original plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, understood.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The next part of the question, Fritz Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you asked about the policy within Financial Services and clear the target is as we countermeasure the actual risk we have in the leasing business. And that was a decision to make financing more attractive. Clearly, especially in the US, we see that financing is still something that is necessary in order to take a market share. And then just sell cars costs without that would be very difficult, especially in the times we are in. So, no doubt about this. Now, we try to restructure this. I can give you some numbers. So, overall, as you mentioned, we had penetration in for the three of 48% on a leasing and financing side. And now, financing went up to 26%. If you compare it with the quarter three 2007, we were at 17.6%. So, we've definitely &#x2013; Group-wide could increase financing. And the leasing penetration all around the world was stable at 27. So, that is actually the situation, if you compare quarter three '07 with quarter three '08. And the same holds true in the United States, where we really could increase the financing, the credit part. If you compare it with '07 from 7.9%, '07 up to now includes quarter three, 20.8%. So, especially in the US, this strategy really works out for us for the time being. But we have to consider on the other hand, that it's always a customer choice. We have customer, who want to have leasing, others want to have credit finance. And our target is to really correspond to the needs of our customers. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. It's Jorgen Piper from Metzler. I have two questions here. One is more or less repeating what John and Gerka asked. On the basis that the markets falls at the current rate of, let's say, between 10 and 15% next year, globally, can you exclude a loss situation for BMW? Or is it at least a possibility we have to consider? And secondly, you are standing at 103,600 employees more or less, at the end of September. So what is, what can we expect here for the next 12 to 15 months year-end 2009? Will you be around 95,000, 98,000, 100,000? What is the best guess here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much, Jorgen Piper. I think the answer will come from Norbert Reithofer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, you asked me for a more precise forecast for 2009, but I think we all know that it's going to be a difficult year for the automotive industry. That is how we see it. And accordingly, we take countermeasures in order to improve our profitability. So, I mentioned during Mr. Gerka's question that we are on our way to do our homework. And we have to do quite a homework to reshape our Company. And let me mention again, towards the 2009, basically we are expecting the business climate to be demanding. And are therefore working really urgently on measures to improve profitability, as well to look where should be the breakeven of the BMW Group.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon, Horst Schneider here from HSBC. I've got two questions, if I may. Firstly, it's on the possible cooperation with Mercedes. It has been on for a long time under discussion. I think Mercedes has confirmed only in October, but you are still talking, and cooperation could start soon. So, would be glad if you could give us an update what is actual status of the negotiations here. And the second one is more a structural question on the premium market. So, are we not entering now a situation where we see potentially here over capacities in the premium market? And are you still planning to extend your capacities in the long run, so until 2012? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the answer will come from Norbert Reithofer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start first with your questions regarding our capacity. If we are on the way to expand our capacity, we think about China, to increase our production capacity for the domestic market in China. Because we think China is a very important market already at the moment and for the future as well. And from a earnings point of view, China is very promising. That is the reason if we would like to sell more cars in China, as you know, from a import duty point of view, from a license point of view, you have to produce there. Otherwise you will not sell, let me say 70, 80 or 100,000 cars in the future. So that is my answer. And if I look into the United States of America, as we mentioned in the past, we will increase our production capacity in the US, because we think the United States are still a very promising market. We should not see strategic decisions only under the current circumstances. The current circumstances, we have to live with them, let me say at least in the year 2009. But, we launch a new product in the United States, end of 2010, as you know. So we are quite optimistic that the United States will have a good chance to be one of the first markets to upturn again. In my opinion, first the United States and then European markets, and not vice versa. And, we will not increase our production capacities in Germany. So -- and in the UK, as you know, we have done already the step to increase production capacities. And the UK is, for us, a very good production location, as well from a natural hedging point of view pound/euro, and pound/dollar.</p>
          <p>So, let me now come to Daimler, As we already confirmed, talks between the BMW and Daimler AG are also discussing joint purchasing in the fields of components. That is a matter of fact. And we look at the moment into technological possibilities, what are the right components to put in the product of the Mercedes car group and in the products of BMW. And first we have to clarify from a technical point of view, and then we can say do we have a possibility or don't we have a possibility. And if we have a solution, Mr. Zetsche and myself, we will tell you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's regarding the US capacities again. So, that means that you still expect rising penetration rates for premium cars in the US market in the long run?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I've got two questions. The first one is just on the net cash position. And I'm sorry to come back on this, but there's a couple of aspects that I don't understand and maybe others don't understand either. You show a slightly negative industrial cash flow in the quarter, and you point out that if you'd not put money into, I think you said money market deposits, it would have been actually positive overall. Could you just help us reconcile that with the numbers you give us for the industrial financial position? I think page 19 of your report you show that the cash position went down from just over 7 billion at the half-year point to about 5.5 billion. Could you just explain what drove that 1.5 billion deterioration? What part is, how does the money market deposits you mentioned get accounted for? I would have thought that they'd still be counted as cash or liquid securities. What part was the cost or the impact of taking this leasing business in and consolidating it? And what part had something to do with the exact injection into the pension fund? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And then just the second one, on CapEx it looks like CapEx is running at the same level as it did in the first nine months of last year. Should we expect Q4 to look the same as last year, about another billion of CapEx? And into 2009, looking at the business, doing your homework as you say, Dr. Reithofer, are there opportunities that you can see clear and present to reduce CapEx in 2009? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, we have to take into account that we had, have taken out part of our pension plan. So, we transferred about 1.5 billion securities to the newly established BMW Trust, as we mentioned earlier. But that is a major reasoning for the difference between the number you mentioned. Now, if you look at our cash position, and you asked about the offset I discussed already in my speech, well it's a number of around about 500 million where we put cash into money market funds. And that is exactly what I meant when I said this in my speech.</p>

          <p>Yes, hello. I'm Daniel Schwarz. First question is -- I have three questions. First question is what is your refinancing needs in 2009? Second question is could you tell us what's the year-on-year cost increase in the third quarter from higher refinancing costs? And the third question is how much lower volumes are you willing to accept in order to reduce the number of leasing contracts next year?</p>

          <p>Could you repeat the last part of your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if you want to reduce the number of leasing contracts or leasing penetration, how much volume effect are you willing to accept for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. I think we start from a volume point with Norbert Reithofer.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, from a volume point of view, okay, you can see the volume position, that means retail volume in consideration with lease penetration. But first of all, if you see the year 2009, you have to see what total volume is possible because of a declining economy. That is the real question. So, because we have to ask ourselves, we have a lot of prognosis on the table, like our colleagues in Stuttgart and in Wolfsburg and other car cities. So, we ask ourselves what is possible in the year 2009? And, we have prognosis figures for the first quarter, second quarter, third and fourth quarter next year. So, and all prognosis say that the volume position will decline in the year 2009, compared to 2008. That is the first question. And then you have to ask yourself what volume position would you like to keep, that means what market share would you like to keep? But for me, the important question, I mentioned it already during the question of Mr. Piper, is where we have to be, the breakeven of the BMW Group, because as lower the breakeven is, the better is it for the position of the Company. And these are the questions we try to answer at the moment for ourself.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Norbert Reithofer. The second part of the question, the answer comes from Mr. Eichiner.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, of our 53.1 billion financial debt as of 30th of September 2008, less than 50%, roughly a number of &#x20AC;24.5 billion is short-term, due within 12 months, and has to be refinanced. To a large degree those short-term refinancing needs can be categorized as short-forward positions. I think, for example, of customary process from banking business, bank credit lines, but also the commercial paper to which we constitute to our investment grade rating, have strong access. That reduces the financing needs that have to be implemented on top to much smaller amount. In addition, we use other funding instruments with long-term duration such as ABS, bonds, private placements, et cetera. Now, as you know, reference interest rates have been lowered 50 basis points in a concerted effort of the national banks worldwide at the beginning of October. This clearly supports funding costs of our <mark type="inaudible" /> business. On the other hand, if you look at the risk premium and the bond market measured by credit default swaps rates, you saw them rising quite steeply as a result of the financial crisis to a, to levels rarely observed, never observed in the past. So, and now we have to see how this continues in the forthcoming months.</p>
