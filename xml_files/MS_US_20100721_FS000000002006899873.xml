      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator, and good morning and thank you everyone for joining us. I'm going to make some brief opening remarks before turning the call over to Ruth.</p>
          <p>As you all know, the second quarter was a very difficult environment for the businesses we operate in. And within the quarter, the second half is more challenging than the first half. The macro environment was characterized by uncertainties regarding global growth, concerns on European sovereign credit risk, and in the United States the impact of financial regulatory reform.</p>
          <p>Volumes and client activity across businesses were light, reflecting both institutional and retail investors' lack of conviction. Notwithstanding this macro environment, we continued to make progress on the execution of our strategy. We remain committed to deliberate and disciplined execution. Specifically, in Institutional Securities, we're continuing to build our world-class client franchise. And there is evidence of clear progress, as Ruth will provide in detail in a moment.</p>
          <p>Despite the broad impact of eroding risk appetite, several franchise businesses performed well, including Investment Banking, Prime Brokerage, Cash Equity Trading, and Commodities.</p>
          <p>We continue to broaden our footprint and build on our competitive strengths and capabilities. Our increased client focus is gaining traction through the reinvigorated Senior Relationship Management effort as well as our focused and coordinated sales coverage.</p>
          <p>On May 1, we closed on our joint venture operations with MUFG [Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc.], and are now running combined Japanese securities businesses. We've already seen transactions from our partnership. Last week, for example, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation hired us to advise on a on its $3.2 billion purchase of Dimension Data, the biggest deal so far for the joint venture.</p>
          <p>In Global Wealth Management, we continue to integrate Smith Barney and make progress against a very detailed plan with the backdrop of a weak retail investor market. Retail investors have been risk averse in the current environment, with higher volatility and lower returns in the equity markets. We believe this will continue in the immediate term. We expect margins to remain subdued through the year. And while we maintain our long-term pre-tax margin target of over 20%, the exact timing will obviously reflect market conditions.</p>
          <p>In Asset Management, the sale of our retail Asset Management business to Invesco closed on June 1. Greg Fleming is building a long-term plan for this business and has made key senior hires to his management team this quarter.</p>
          <p>Obviously we will take into account the implications of the Volcker Rule as we move forward. We're investing in our control, risk, and finance functions as we build our infrastructure consistent with our desire to be a world-class financial holding company.</p>
          <p>While we've made progress this quarter, we still have significant work to do to achieve our long-term goals. In the short term, however, earnings are likely to be choppy given the market environment.</p>
          <p>Finally, with the recent hiring of Frank Barron as our new Chief Legal Officer, who starts later this summer, the new senior leadership team is in place and collectively focused on disciplined execution against our stated goals.</p>
          <p>Now I'm going to turn it over to Ruth to review our second quarter results. Ruth?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, James. For the quarter ended June 30, Morgan Stanley generated income from operating operations of 1.4 billion, with diluted earnings per share of $0.80 and an ROE of 12.2%. Our results this quarter reflect the global breadth of our franchise, early progress with our sales force build, as well as the benefit of strategic initiatives against the backdrop of very difficult markets, as James noted.</p>
          <p>In addition, results reflected the impact from the widening of credit spreads on firm issued structured notes, commonly referred to as DVA [Debt Valuation Adjustment], as well as one discrete tax benefit. Specifically, our second quarter revenues were 8 billion, down 12% sequentially. The impact from DVA was roughly 750 million or $0.27 per share.</p>
          <p>Our non-interest expenses were 6.3 billion, down 4% from last quarter on lower compensation. And the compensation ratio was 49%. Compensation expense included a charge of 361 million related to the UK government's payroll tax on 2009 discretionary bonuses. Non-compensation expenses were 2.4 billion, up 11% from last quarter, primarily due to higher legal costs and technology investment spend.</p>
          <p>The impact of the tax benefit was 345 million or $0.20 per share, reflecting the remeasurement of tax reserves based on the status of federal and state examinations. Excluding the benefit, the effective tax rate would have been 33.5%.</p>
          <p>Including discontinued operations, our diluted EPS was $1.09, and ROE was 17.4%. Discontinued operations included an after-tax gain of 514 million related to the sale of substantially all of our retail Asset Management business, including Van Kampen.</p>
          <p>Turning to our book value on page three of the supplement, book value at the end of the quarter was $29.65 per share, up 7% sequentially. This increase in addition to earnings included $0.51 per share related to an after-tax gain of approximately 717 million on the sale of the firm's non-controlling interest in its Japanese Institutional Securities business, recorded in other comprehensive income.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet data on the same page, total assets were 809 billion at June 30, slightly lower than the 820 billion at March 31. Our capital ratios continue to demonstrate the strength of our balance sheet. Although our calculations are not final, we believe our Tier 1 capital ratio under Basel I will be 16.4%, and our Tier 1 common ratio will be 9.2%.</p>
          <p>In addition, as noted in the 8-K we filed this morning, we will be directly redeeming rather than remarketing the trust preferred securities underlying the mandatory convertible equity unit with CIC. This will add 5.6 billion to Tier 1 common in August.</p>
          <p>I will now briefly review our business units. For Institutional Securities, revenues were 4.5 billion, down from the first quarter on difficult markets across sales and trading businesses, while investment banking industry volumes remain subdued. Revenues included approximately 750 million of positive DVA, as mentioned earlier. Non-interest expenses were 2.9 billion in the quarter, down 11% sequentially on lower compensation. Excluding DVA, the compensation ratio was 43.6%, up from the first quarter, and included a charge of 354 million for the UK bonus tax. The business reported a pre-tax profit of 1.6 billion.</p>
          <p>With respect to Investment Banking, revenues were 885 million, essentially unchanged from last quarter. For the first half of 2010, Morgan Stanley ranked first in global IPOs, second in announced and completed global M&amp;A, and third in global equity. Advisory revenues of 288 million decreased 12% from last quarter. We were the advisor for four of the top five M&amp;A transactions announced in the quarter, which highlights the global breadth of our franchise. These included: in the US, the $22 billion acquisition of Qwest Communications by CenturyLink: in the UK, the 13.7 billion buyout of BSkyB by News Corp. And in Russia, we were the sole advisor to Svyazinvest in its 11 billion restructuring of its subsidiary holdings.</p>
          <p>Equity underwriting revenues were 269 million, up slightly from last quarter. Significant transactions included National Grid's $5 billion rights offering and Samsung Life Insurance's 4.4 billion IPO. Fixed income underwriting revenues increased 11% sequentially to 328 million on significantly higher loan syndication fees.</p>
          <p>Overall, our Investment Banking pipelines remain healthy across regions and products. But the issue is moving transactions through the pipeline and into announcements, especially for M&amp;A.</p>
          <p>We are more positive about expected IPO activity in the back half of the year with large offerings from Asia and the US, and we are the book runner on seven of the ten largest IPOs in the US file backlog.</p>
          <p>Turning to Equity Sales and Trading, Equity Sales and Trading reported solid revenues of 1.4 billion that included DVA gains of 129 million. Cash equity revenues were up from the first quarter, reflecting both commissions and trading revenue. Prime Brokerage revenues were also higher as we continued to deepen relationships with our existing clients while selectively increasing our client base. Average client balances continued to grow, up 5% sequentially.</p>
          <p>Derivatives reported modestly lower but solid revenues against a backdrop of market uncertainty, with particular strength in the flow business.</p>
          <p>Fixed income sales and trading revenues of 2.3 billion included DVA gains of 602 million. During the quarter, we continued to execute on improving distribution and footprint within interest rate, FX, and emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Within our Interest Rate Credit and Currencies business, IRCC, revenues were affected by challenging trading conditions in May and June, and declined significantly from the first quarter. Rates in credit were adversely affected by the difficult trading environment, characterized by the absence of clear trends, while FX revenues were higher on increased client flows.</p>
          <p>In commodities, despite range-bound but choppy market conditions, revenues improved from the first quarter on an increase in structured transactions.</p>
          <p>Other sales and trading revenues of negative 101 million were primarily driven by valuation losses in our corporate lending business as credit spreads widened across various sectors. Net mark-to-market losses in the quarter were approximately 277 million.</p>
          <p>Turning to Value at Risk on pages three and six of the supplement, total average trading and non-trading VaR decreased to 164 million from 169 million in the first quarter. Average trading VaR decreased to 139 million from 143 million, primarily driven by reduced risk in emerging markets foreign exchange exposure. Average non-trading VaR increased to 67 million from 62 million, primarily driven by the inclusion of our investment in Invesco.</p>
          <p>With respect to our Global Wealth Management business, summarized on page eight of the supplement, revenues of 3.1 billion were essentially flat from last quarter, due to the impact of declining equity markets and as retail investors became increasingly cautious given macroeconomic concerns, especially post the Flash Crash in early May. Non-interest expenses were 2.9 billion and included approximately 106 million in integration costs. Excluding integration costs, expenses were relatively flat from last quarter. The compensation ratio was 64%, driven by the formulaic grid payouts. And profit before tax was 207 million, for a PBT margin of 7%.</p>
          <p>On page nine of the supplement, you can see the quarterly productivity measures for the business. Total client assets decreased 6% sequentially to 1.5 trillion on market depreciation and asset outflows. The disclosure around retail asset flows has been expanded this quarter to include the international businesses and exclude certain legacy Smith Barney middle market activities. Total retail net new assets, both US and non-US, were negative 5.5 billion, reflecting the quarter's market volatility compounded by April tax payments.</p>
          <p>The number of FAs remained relatively unchanged at 18,087, and turnover within our top two quintiles remained at historic lows. Deposits in our bank deposit program were 110 billion, of which 52 billion is held by Morgan Stanley Bank. The bank deposit program represents the majority of the 61 billion in firm-wide deposits at quarter end across Global Wealth Management and Institutional Securities.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Asset Management on page 10 of our supplement, net revenues were 410 million, down 37% from the first quarter. Core Asset Management generated revenues of 300 million, down 28% sequentially, due to negative marks on seed investments and lower performance fees.</p>
          <p>Merchant Banking revenues of 110 million declined almost entirely due to the absence of principal investment gains from consolidated MSREF [Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund] funds in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expenses for Asset Management were up 3% from last quarter on higher compensation expenses that included certain international tax equalization payments. Excluding non-controlling interest, the segment's pre-tax loss attributable to Morgan Stanley was 83 million.</p>
          <p>As summarized on page 11 of the supplement, total AUM decreased 4% to 251 billion, primarily due to the market impact on equities. Net asset flows were 1.2 billion during the quarter, and nearly 70% of our equity and fixed income strategies continued to outperform their respective benchmarks on a three, five, and ten-year basis.</p>
          <p>Finally, regarding our outlook, the global economic environment continues to be our key concern. The second quarter was one of volatility without direction, driven by a broad set of economic, political, and seemingly random events shaking investor confidence. As you know, these included the European sovereign debt crisis, US regulatory reform, global growth concerns, and finally the Flash Crash. Although the economy remains fragile, we belief fears of a double-dip recession are overstated, and that belief is based in part on the constant dialogue we are having with our global corporate clients.</p>
          <p>With liquidity levels high and valuations depressed across markets, an absence of further negative events should pave the way for a return to more historically normal client activity. However, we are not expecting a rapid rebound in client volumes or equity market pricing because of the time it will take to restore confidence across the board, and particularly with individual investors. Nevertheless, we remain cautiously optimistic because we are using this time to build our pipelines and strengthen relationships, thereby continuing to increase market share.</p>
          <p>On the regulatory front, we've been of the view that resolving regulatory reform is critical to restoring confidence and stability to the market, and are pleased that the bill was passed and will be signed by the President.</p>
          <p>As James said at the outset, we are focused on execution and believe we are well positioned for the challenges and the opportunities ahead.</p>
          <p>Thank you, and now we will take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question will come from Guy Moszkowski of Bank of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Guy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. You talked about reg reform. And I was hoping that maybe you could give us a sense for what you're seeing as the major areas of impact for Morgan Stanley, and what might be some of the key adjustments that you're looking at to your cost structure, to your business models to how you use capital based on what we know so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, I think the main point is that we're pleased that the bill is being signed because we're of the belief that clarity should help restore confidence in the market, and this is an important bill &#x2013; important step forward. And there's obviously a lot to be done as regulators engage in their studies and rulemakings.</p>
          <p>Specifically to your question, I think the two provisions that are most relevant for Morgan Stanley are derivatives and the Volcker Rule. On the Volcker provision, there's clearly a reasonable timeline for phase-in, 4 to 12 years. And our approach is to take that time and have a very thoughtful, measured approach to the portfolio.</p>
          <p>Similarly on derivatives, there's still a lot to be determined. I think the early read for us is that elements of the proposed reform should be positive. First, we don't have derivatives in our bank, as I think you know, so we should be able to move certain derivatives such as rates, FX, and risk management swaps into the bank. And then second with the move to more central clearing, I think the most important issue for clients will be they'll be getting greater transparency and liquidity, which is a positive.</p>
          <p>As we're looking at the clearinghouse and the implications, the credit at the clearinghouse clearly is important, the cost of which will be borne by the industry. And although that cost is still unclear, it's important because that's where clients will be focused. But for us, I think the benefit is there will be heightened premium on client service, the quality of research and coverage, which should benefit us. So I think it's a pretty high level to go into detail on. More than that, it's early days and we are being deliberate in our approach.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, fair enough, thanks. And now just if I can ask you a couple of questions more about the financials that you've presented; with respect to the Institutional business, the compensation to revenue ratio, if we back out the UK tax and the DVA from the numerator and the denominator, it was around 34%, and it was down from about 41 in the first quarter. What should we be thinking about as we model the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think two things. First, the firm-wide charge was 361 million. And as we have previously indicated, it was substantially borne by employees globally. As we look forward, to answer your question about accrual for the year, it's difficult to forecast and would depend on a number of factors, including financial performance, the competitive market environment, and regulatory oversight. So I think in the first quarter, it was around the 41% range, and I think you can look at the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So average the first half ex the special effects and maybe think about that as a run rate. Would that be a reasonable approach, or would that be underestimating the expense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that's fair, again with the proviso that we're always subject to the market and market environment and regulatory issues. But that's a fair approach.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just on the other expenses, the non-personnel expenses, those seemed to ratchet up quite a bit. It certainly seems like given a big chunk of that is in professional services; it's probably legal. But is that one-time costs of review given the need to review business practices and the like? Or should we be thinking that those higher levels of non-personnel expenses might persist for a while?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there are really three components to it. You've touched on one of them, which is legal. We also, as I think James noted, are investing in IT to ensure that we have the proper infrastructure and analytical tools. And then there's also &#x2013; there tends be as we've looked over the last several years, a little bit of a seasonal pattern. The second quarter is typically higher than the first quarter. But we continue to be very focused on expenses and trying to make sure that we're being disciplined in holding expenses as best we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So in terms of the legal component, should we think that it persists, or does some of that abate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that broadly, unfortunately I think the environment in which we're all operating industry-wide is one in which legal costs will likely be higher than over the most recent cycle. But that's more of a sense from what we're seeing broadly than trying to provide any level of certainty, but it seems reasonable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think fair enough, and then the final question I'll ask is just on Asset Management. It is still losing money. The outflow has abated, but we're still seeing them across the core long-term product categories. Greg Fleming has been in place for I guess a couple of quarters now. I was just wondering whether you have some direction you can give us in terms of how the strategy might be adjusted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you said, he has been only in place a couple of months, and he is doing a thorough review of the Asset Management business and is going to be articulating his strategy for the business to the board. But the objectives remain the same and are very straightforward: delivering superior performance for our clients, returning the business to strong and consistent profitability; and reigniting a best-in-class investment culture. Looking at the expense structure to ensure that we're able to deliver profitability is a key element of the overall analysis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Guy. It's James. Just to add to that, as you know, we laid out at a couple of investor meetings our long-term strategy for investment management.</p>
          <p>The first piece was the combination our various fund-to-funds businesses, which we did. The second was to exit the retail space, which we have done. The third is to build up of the long-only institutional and money market funds business, which Greg is actively working on, and the number of hires he has made in the last four weeks is support of that.</p>
          <p>The fourth is to look at the structure associated with the various hedge fund specs we have. And the fifth is to calibrate the amount of capital we want to put into our Merchant Banking activities, which we're doing over time, so there's a lot more news to come from Greg on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. We'll be looking forward it to it, appreciate it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question will be from Howard Chen of Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was hoping you could just give us a broader update on the institutional build-out. How many of the 400-plus hands on deck you hired are now in place and producing in your minds? And what's the hiring outlook from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of what was articulated last year, we've been executing upon. We're going to continue to add collectively where it makes sense. There are quite a number of people who want to be on this platform, and we are always pleased to add great talent.</p>
          <p>So I think the key element is we brought them in. It's sales; it's trading. It's around the globe. Integrating them. We've seen some success I think reflected in the market share improvements this past quarter. And it is very much integrating the new people who are coming in with the strength of the teams that we have. And with Colm Kelleher and Paul Taubman's leadership, what we're really focused on is disciplined execution, marrying the new people along with our broad team into programs like our Senior Relationship Management program, which we've talked about over time, which enables us to deliver more of the firm globally and across products to our clients.</p>
          <p>So it's really a combination of the new people with the existing team with the management disciplines that I think you're seeing reflected in some of the market share gains.</p>

          <p>Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then shifting gears to capital, you said in the past the unallocated capital is just that, rather than excess capital. With that being said, your capital levels are strong. The composition will improve with the CIC conversion this quarter. Does anything change in your view on how you think about that unallocated capital as potentially excess capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We call it unallocated capital, and now we're calling it parent capital because our view very much has been that the regulatory environment will continue to evolve. Basel II-1/2 obviously coming in. And now we have a date of end of 2011, and then Basel III at some point thereafter. The assumption has been that we will continue to build capital that will be allocated to the businesses as we have greater clarity coming out from Basel.</p>
          <p>And so that's one important element of it. We continue to view capital and the fact that we do have this excess, unallocated, parent &#x2013; whatever you want to call it, as providing the base to elegantly move into Basel II-1/2 and then beyond.</p>
          <p>And so as we're thinking about various capital management opportunities, dividends, share repurchase, et cetera, at this point, I still would say it's premature. We want to see ongoing progress in the earnings. We want to see a more durable economic recovery, but do take your point that we have built up that capital base.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Hey, Ruth, just on the trading, you gave some pretty good color on the breakdown across the different products, both equities and fixed income. It's just that the equity number really stands out I think relative to peers this quarter. So anything from a market share gain that you can point to &#x2013; anything, whether it's US, Europe, or Asia?</p>
          <p>And then I guess on the fixed income side, the same thing. I think that was more in line. But anything from a client versus product progress that you're seeing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the equity side, we do think that we had market share gains in cash equities. We were pleased with a lot of the client activity on the derivatives side. And as I noted on Prime Brokerage, we were similarly of the view that the results reflected ongoing progress that was going deeper with existing clients and selectively broadening out our client base, as we said.</p>
          <p>But from the level of activity that we've been seeing, and that is globally, it really does go, I think, to the strategy that we've delineated. And we would also say we still think it is early days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just add that in the last several months, as John Mack, Walid, myself, and other senior management have been traveling around the world, we have consistently heard a refrain from our clients that they would like to do more business with Morgan Stanley. And I think what you're seeing in terms of the results is the support that we're getting from clients and the strength of the brand and the franchise. Obviously a lot more to be done, but the rhetoric is being supported so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then maybe another one for you, James. Just on the Wealth Management business, you hinted towards it in terms of obviously retail environment pretty challenging across the board.</p>
          <p>When you guys detail the longer term goals in terms of pre-tax margins, can you give a sense? I think the end of this year, beginning of next year, you have the integration going on in converting three platforms to one Wealth Management. How much of the margin improvement can be related to what management can control, versus what's going to be more markets, flows, and interest rates going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of things. Firstly, obviously you can't control the markets. Assets get priced largely at the end of each quarter, and your fee revenues are based off asset prices. The interest rate spreads are what they are, given where interest rates are at this point in the cycle.</p>
          <p>So actually, client flows probably have the least impact on the numbers. What has the most impact are asset prices, interest rate numbers, and secondary activity driven by primary activity. So if there's a new issue calendar.</p>
          <p>What I'm focused on and what the team is focused on is making sure that we get the steps in the integration done, which we are doing. That the sales force remains stable throughout that, which it is. And that the clients see a continuous improvement in the quality of service and offering that they're getting from Morgan Stanley, which I believe they are and will increasingly do over time.</p>
          <p>So what we're controlling, I think the team is doing a very good job controlling. What we can't control, we wish the world were better. The retail investor will not disappear forever. Of that, I'm pretty sure. I've been doing this a long time. And our team is very focused on providing new, innovative products against the build-out of the banking strategy led by Cece Sutton.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Wealth Management, it seems like your targets for profit margins and net new assets could be at risk for this year and next year. Given 5 billion in outflows this quarter, client assets down, you've got a core margin of 10% versus your target of 15%.</p>
          <p>And then the FAs went down. I noticed FAs went up at some of your peers.</p>
          <p>So what's an update on the strategic plan and the execution in Wealth Management?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, as James said at the outset, it is very much market dependent. We did see, post-Flash Crash, retail step back from the market. It was actually striking, as we ended the first quarter going into the first half of the second quarter, notwithstanding the political and economic turmoil broadly, we still saw strength in retail, and it really started to change post-Flash Crash.</p>
          <p>It's going to take time to come back. And so I think it is fair to assume that some of those targets get pushed out. It's very much market dependent.</p>
          <p>To James's point that we can only control what we can control, we're continuing to execute on the integration and invest in the integration, but it will take some time, and it's market dependent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'd just add two quick things. The FA numbers were actually remarkably stable on 18,000. I think they were plus or minus &#x2013; I don't even know the exact number, but we've got it in the supplement &#x2013; plus or minus less than 100. So it's remarkably stable.</p>
          <p>The flows &#x2013; clearly, you want to have positive flows, and driving the business organically we'll get that. The impact of &#x2013; I wouldn't be overly concerned about the impact of the $5 billion of flows at about 80 basis points, so it's probably $40 million per year in revenue, or $10 million a quarter. That's not very consequential. Much more consequential is the market environment, where assets are, where the S&amp;P is, and where deposit spreads are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then one separate question, just going back to the trading. How much of your performance which exceeded peer would be due to the build-out of the traders, or good risk positioning, or were there one or two areas you'd really highlight?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think when you listen to the breadth of areas that we highlighted, from cash equities to prime brokerage commodities, FX, it really is about execution on both the sales and trading fronts. And a lot of it is continuing to drive the dialogue deep into the clients, delivering more to the clients.</p>
          <p>And so there was no silver bullet. It was basically detailed execution, which is I think what we need, and will continue to deliver.</p>
          <p>But the breadth of it does I think underscore that there was a lot of execution that people in the building were doing. Commodities, as I noted, had more focus on some of the structured transactions, which their clients were looking for. And so again, a real mix of execution, which in the aggregate, we're pleased. Helped us improve our market share some.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And last follow-up. You said the second half of the quarter was weaker than the first. What have you seen so far this quarter, and what do you expect in the trading area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So far, this quarter has been quite muted. I think that's pretty much across the board, institutional and retail investors. And hard to forecast what goes from here, but it has been quite muted.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. With respect to reg reform, going back to one of your earlier questions, I think Howard's, around the hiring that you did last fall, in anticipation of ramping up risk deployment in the trading businesses &#x2013; or capital deployment.</p>
          <p>As you now look at the legislation that I guess is being signed right now, it really promotes more of an agency business model, which on a relative basis, you've been more of. Does your thinking say last fall to now, with respect to that build-out, change at all with this legislation, or is it all consistent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We would say it's very consistent. I think our view is given that the power of this brand and the strength of the franchise globally, we were understaffed for the opportunity in sales and trading. And the strategic, real focus has been on delivering the firm more broadly to our clients. It's about client facing activity, and it's about that around the globe.</p>
          <p>And so what we really need in order to be able to deliver the firm is the breadth of the team. It's not in any way a modification of what we were talking about in the fall, but highly consistent with the way we've been looking to increase our market share. And in particular, you see it in a number of the comments in our flow business. That's our clients engaging more robustly with us.</p>
          <p>And therefore, when we look at what even is a more tepid environment, I think what has flown through is the ongoing strength of the client relationships. The client activity, delivering for the client, is enabling us to deliver some results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. And one other question just on the reform.</p>
          <p>I know it's early days, but as you think about your structure and with most of your derivatives, your swaps business being inside the broker dealer, it is fair to say that's where most of your capital is as well, right? So if you think about losing any sort of guarantee from the parent company, you would look at your positioning at the counterparty to be quite solid there, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are a lot of prongs to your question. I think the...</p>

          <p>I know.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, which is fair. It's complicated, in particular as it relates to where derivatives are going to go. Part of the difficulty in answering the question is, in particular on derivatives, much of the cost and rulemaking still will be fleshed out.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think with respect to derivatives not in the bank or in the bank, I did note that, up front, we do think that's an opportunity to move certain of the derivatives into the bank, and the rating and funding advantage that that brings. But it's still a work in progress.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that was an interesting comment. Do you actually &#x2013; for example, I guess FX is probably in a broker dealer and not in the bank. Do you actually have to move it up into the bank, or is that a choice you can make?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very much a choice. And I'm glad you actually asked it that way, because it's one that we're going to take the time to assess what makes the best sense for -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then just on the Wealth Management business, one question there, or actually just two parts quickly.</p>
          <p>The outflows, and I know they were very small. But I guess if you look at it across the industry, it seems like flows were positive. It looks like the Merrill flows were positive, and I know Schwab's were positive. What drove outflows? Is there any asset class that it came out of, where it wouldn't have moved into other products within your platform?</p>
          <p>And then the second part of that is on the advisor front, again, this may be just coming anecdotally, but it seems like there have been a lot more press releases of firms announcing hires of teams from other firms. Both you and others. And I don't know if that's just a timing thing because of when garden leaves run out. But is there any pickup in competitive hiring? I know your stats say no, but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on outflows, I think when we look at the data, it does seem that we've been seeing quite a bit of anecdotal industry-wide data about outflows, but I'll comment specifically on ours. We had outflows, but we expected some of it due to the April 15 tax season. And it certainly seemed to be exacerbated, as I said, in particular post-Flash Crash. With respect to hiring a team, we're not really seeing much more activity on that front. I mean there's some movement, as there always is, but clearly not much.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I just wanted to follow up more specifically on some of the integration targets within Global Wealth Management. When you announced the deal, when you closed it, you laid out this very specific target of achieving $1.1 billion of cost savings within the first 18 months following the close. So can you give us a little bit more specific update on where you are in achieving that specific target because it's hard to see if you're really achieving much when you just look at the numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The targets and the analytics around the costs, et cetera, remained unchanged, so we're still expecting the cost of 1.1 billion by the end of integration, and the other metrics that we had shared with you about the number of FAs ranging between 17,500 &#x2013; 18-plus, PBT margin, at steady state. 20% is still there.</p>
          <p>I think the complexity is that the market has been quite challenging. When we look at the retail reaction this quarter to market events, it's quite pronounced, and so we are pushing out the target. And as guidance it is very much market dependent because we'll need to see a couple of quarters of stability we think before we see retail investors returning in a meaningful way; and therefore pushing it out until we can start providing some confidence around that stability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But at least that one specific target, the 1.1 billion, and that target is done at the end of this year. I mean you have to have a pretty good idea where you are relative to that target. Is the recognition pro rata over the past 12 to 18 months or are you still expecting a lot &#x2013; a disproportionate amount in the second half, any insight there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The full-year 2010 spend on integration we think will be in the range of guidance provided earlier this year, 450 to 500 million. We're expecting 450 to 500 this year. And the total cost synergies will be &#x2013; the costs will be about 1.1 billion when we finish integration. It is extending the time and completing the integration that is really at issue here.</p>

      </speaker>

          <p>It's James here, Jim. Yes, the short answer is. It is a core business for us. Merchant Banking includes everything from an Asian private equity business to a global fund to real estate investing, special situations, our infrastructure funds, mezzanine debt funds. It's a very broad group of businesses.</p>
          <p>Obviously in view of the Volcker Rule, we'll be looking at the percent of capital we've put into those businesses and within each of the separate pieces of them. But frankly, what is driving I think around this is less about the regulatory reform and more about what we need to do as a firm and which parts of the business we really think we can excel in. It's more of a strategic view. Obviously, we will comply with whatever the ultimate rulemaking is around the percentage capital we can put into it.</p>

          <p>Right. But with less skin in the game, do you guys worry from a competitive standpoint that say in the real estate business, it might be tougher to attract funds? Or do you think that because some of your major competitors are in a similar footing, not all, but some, that it's manageable?</p>

          <p>Firstly, I think all the institutions that are bank holding companies will be under the same regulations. And secondly, I think it's way too premature to predict whether you can attract funds. My experience has been if you have good performance, you attract funds.</p>
