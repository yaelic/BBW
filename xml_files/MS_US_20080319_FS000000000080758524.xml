        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for joining us today.  Given this tough environment, it has been difficult to follow this sector but we will continue to provide you with the information you need to understand our results.  As you know, the market is in the midst of major de-leveraging following an extended period of ample global liquidity and low rates.</p>
          <p>The first quarter was one of the most challenging we have seen but we navigated it well, which is a testament to the strength of Morgan Stanley's client franchise.  We generated a net income of $1.6 billion, diluted earnings per share of $1.45 and a return on equity of nearly 20%.  We are pleased with these results given the macro economic turmoil and dislocations in leverage lending, commercial real estate, subprime, monolines and SIVs.  There was strength across many of our businesses including record revenues and equity derivatives, prime brokerage and interest-rate products, and significant growth in our non-US and emerging markets business.</p>
          <p>Net revenues were $8.3 billion and PBT margin was 27%.  Non-interest expenses were 6.1 billion, up 14% from the fourth quarter driven by compensation that included severance expenses of approximately $161 million related to staff reductions as we resized our business to reflect the current revenue environment.  On Page 3 of the financial supplement, you can see that total global head count decreased by 2% from the end of last year.</p>
          <p>The compensation to net revenue ratio was 49% or 47% excluding the severance charge which is in line with our guidance, last year.  Non-compensation expenses were $2 billion down 6% from the fourth quarter or 19% excluding that quarter's Coleman-Sunbeam legal accrual reversal of 360 million. The non-comp to net revenue ratio was 25%.  We are focused on improving our cost base and would expect to see improvements in this ratio going forward.</p>
          <p>Before we go into the details of the businesses, I would like to highlight several key accomplishments that not only helped our results this quarter but also are helping us build for the future. We have been clear about our expectations for the environment since the market dislocation began late last summer and we have managed our exposures accordingly.  We are maintaining our capital surplus.  We've brought leverage down and we continue to maintain a high level of the liquidity.  As you know, the CIC capital infusion came into effect this quarter helping to bolster our strong capital position.</p>
          <p>We reduced our adjusted leverage ratio from 17.6 times last quarter to 16 times.  At the same time, we increased our total liquidity by $6 billion to 124 billion including an increase in our parent company liquidity position by $8 billion to $70 billion at quarter end.  These measures put us in a solid position to take advantage of the market opportunities that will arise from the dislocations in these markets.</p>
          <p>We continue to make enhancements to our risk management organization to support our business model and growth initiatives.  Including, most recently naming Ken deRegt as our new Chief Risk Officer reporting to John Mack.  We have resized or organization to better align it with the revenue environment and while we encourage severance costs expense in the quarter, it will lead to cost benefits in both comp and non-compensation going forward.</p>
          <p>We are maintaining very tight control over expenses and we are continuing to make investments in infrastructure technology and business expenses related to increased pipeline activity.  We have continued to make leadership changes across the firm as we look to strengthen our bench of talent and Ellyn McColgan will begin in Global Wealth Management later this quarter.  We are confident she will continue building on the momentum that James Gorman has built in this business.  Now let me turn to the businesses.</p>
          <p>Starting with institutional securities detailed on page five of the supplement.  These results reflect continued strength in many businesses including areas within credit.  Because of these strong results we mitigated the impact of negative market valuations.  Revenues of $6.2 billion, although up significantly from the fourth quarter of last year, were 13% lower than last year's first quarter reflecting the ongoing challenges in structured credit and the overall market dynamic.  Our core client franchise continues to deliver very strong results across all businesses within institutional securities.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expenses of $4.1 billion increased 34% from the fourth quarter of last year.  This increase is magnified because last quarter included the reversal as I said earlier, of the Coleman-Sunbeam reserve while this quarter included severance charges.  Excluding these items, non-interest expenses increased 16% from the fourth quarter.  PBT was 2.1 billion with an ROE in its segment of 24%.</p>
          <p>In M&amp;A and underwriting, volumes dropped across all major categories, while pipelines continue to be healthy and our clients are engaged in strategic conversations.  However, market conditions may make monetizing pipelines challenging in the near term.</p>
          <p>Looking at page 6 of the supplement, investment banking revenues were 980 million, down 28% from the fourth quarter of last year largely reflecting lower volumes. Advisory revenues were 444 million, a 43% decrease from the record fourth quarter, but up 19% from the first quarter of '07.  Underwriting revenues decreased 8% to 536 million as lower equity underwriting offset higher revenues in fixed-income underwriting. Sequentially, equity underwriting revenues of 261 million were down 25% driven by lower volumes of secondary offerings and IPOs and lower activity in Asia. Fixed-income underwriting increased 17% from the fourth quarter of last year to 275 million, predominately reflecting activity with investment-grade clients.</p>
          <p>Page 6 of the supplement shows sales and trading revenues of $5.1 billion, up significantly from last quarter's negative revenues of 5.6 billion.  This quarter's results include strong results in our client franchise across equity and fixed income sales and trading.</p>
          <p>Organizationally we have changed the way we look at our fixed-income business.  We view the major business categories as the first, interest rate credit and currencies; the second commodities; and the third is the mortgage proprietary trading effort.  Total fixed-income sales and trading revenues were $2.9 billion, reflecting record results in interest rate products, strong results in commodities, and a $527 million benefit from the impact of widening credit spreads on firm-issued structured notes.  These gains were partially offset by losses in mortgage proprietary trading.</p>
          <p>The interest rate credit and currency area increased close to 300% from the fourth quarter.  This was driven by record revenues in interest rate products reflecting higher volatility and flows, significantly improved credit trading results reflecting higher customer volume, continued volatility and favorable positioning as credit spreads widened during the quarter.  Credit trading excludes leveraged lending results which are reported in other sales and trading.</p>
          <p>With an increased focus, commodities rebounded from weak performance in the second half of last year producing near record results driven by particular strength in oil and liquids.  We benefited from better positioning amid high volatility levels and strong customer flows, with strength across regions and commodity classes.  We also had strong results in new areas where we have been investing like agriculture, where we significantly increased results from last year's first quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally, mortgage proprietary trading which is now segregated and managed separately, significantly reduced its losses versus last quarter but still reflects the challenges of the current market environment.  Reflecting our strong client franchise, our equity business produced record results this quarter with broad-based gains across regions and products.  The combination of high volatility, strong customer flow and excellent positioning within our trading businesses drove the record quarter.  Revenues of $3.3 billion were 35% higher than last quarter reflecting record derivatives in prime brokerage, and particularly strong result in quantitative strategies.  This quarter's results also benefited from a $321 million gain on firm-issued structured notes.</p>
          <p>Turning to other sales and trading was a negative $1.1 billion driven primarily by write-downs in our lending business and to a lesser extent the U.S. banks liquidity portfolio that we reclassified from available-for-sale last quarter.  Our lending business includes both relationship and leveraged lending. We've been very clear that leveraged lending was one of our biggest concerns because the markets remain severely dislocated and virtually shut down during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Similar to the third quarter last year, liquidity disappeared from the market and as a result we have taken additional write-downs on our lending business of 2.1 billion gross or $910 million debt of hedges with 50% of the gross write-down attributable to our leverage acquisition finance pipeline and closed deals.  While we employ a variety of hedging strategies including macro hedges on various parts of this portfolio, market liquidity was pronounced and the valuations reflect that.</p>
          <p>On page seven of the financial supplement you can see that our total non-investment-grade loans commitments decreased from 30.9 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of last year to $26 billion this quarter.  Specifically within the $26 billion is the total leveraged acquisition finance portfolio of both pipeline commitments and closed hung (13:05/14:40 CS audio) deals of 15.9 billion.  This is down from 20 billion last quarter as you can see in the footnote.</p>
          <p>Now at this stage I would like to give you key updates on our marks and exposures hit hardest by the credit cycle.  In CMBS, Commercial Whole Loans we continue to get observable market prices from executed trades.  We have 23.5 billion on our balance sheet, down from 31.5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter and 11.6 billion in net exposure down from 17.5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter.  This repositioning was done across all regions without incurring any significant net losses or write-downs.  Our residual exposures remain geographically well-diversified.</p>
          <p>At the end of the first quarter, non-subprime residential mortgages which include RMBS bonds, residential Alt-A loans and European mortgage loans were $14.5 billion on our balance sheet, down from 16.5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter.  Total net exposure was 8.7 billion, down from 10.9 billion last quarter.  Included in that net 8.7 billion, Alt-A net exposure of 4.6 billion was reduced from 5.3 billion at year-end through executed trades and corresponding marks calibrated to those trades.  The total write-downs here were $600 million.</p>
          <p>RMBS bonds and European mortgage loans that make up the remaining net exposure in the non-subprime residential category were reduced without incurring any significant net losses or write-downs. You can see on page 15 of the financial supplement that our direct U.S. subprime net exposure at the end of the first quarter remained at 1.8 billion, the same level as at year-end.  However, we reduced our Super Senior Mezzanine net exposure by 1.1 billion through dispositions and additional write-downs of $700 million.  We also wrote down our residuals by $300 million.  Our hedges performed well resulting in an overall P&amp;L of zero for this position.</p>
          <p>Our aggregate direct exposure to monolines at the end of the first quarter was 4.7 billion, up from 3.7 billion at year-end.  This increase in net exposure reflects the current environment and our continued support for selected municipal client transactions.  The net exposure includes 1.3 billion of ABS wrap bonds held by our subsidiary banks, 2.6 billion of insurance municipal bond securities and net counterparty exposure to monolines of $800 million consistent with year-end.  During the quarter, we took a credit valuation adjustment, a write-down of approximately $600 million reflecting the widening of credit spreads experienced by the monolines.  So while we expect the industry to see further markdowns as the credit cycle unwinds, we understand our exposures well and we continue to work to reduce them.</p>
          <p>Turning to capital and liquidity there are three key tenets that I want to emphasize.  The first is we are maintaining a strong capital position.  The second is we are maintaining very high levels of liquidity and finally we are maintaining a balance sheet with judicious leverage ratios and capacities.</p>
          <p>Page four of the supplement highlights our current capital position.  At the end of last year while our regulatory capital was always in a surplus position our period end internal economic capital model calculation showed a shortfall which we disclosed and addressed.  During the first quarter, we earned a 20% return on equity, received a benefit from the CIC investment and we suspended our share buyback program temporarily.  So we are very well-capitalized and clearly have excess capital.  Despite stronger results this quarter, we are still placing a significant emphasis on our capital and liquidity to ensure we have enough dry powder to continue investing in our businesses and to take advantage of opportunities.</p>
          <p>Since last summer when I said we expected the credit market dislocations to continue for some time, we took the following actions to strengthen our liquidity position.  We raised a significant amount of liquidity in the capital markets through the issuance of long-term debt and structured notes at every opportunity at reasonable levels.  We actively managed down positions requiring significant cash funding such as event loans and commercial real estate loans from the peak in the third quarter.  This freed up a sizable amount of liquidity.  In the trading business we focused on reallocating balance sheet to liquid assets with significant two-way customer flows.  In the lending business we used our U.S. bank platforms where we have abundant liquidity in excess to additional liquidity to finance longer-term assets.  And lastly we strengthened our liquidity position and reduced our refinancing risk by using some of the incremental liquidity to pay down commercial paper from an average of $25 billion last year to our current outstanding of just under 17 for this quarter end.</p>
          <p>So as for the liquidity numbers let me first explain that we hold liquidity in three groupings.  We hold liquidity at the parent company level for the repayment of debt as it comes due along with the consolidated liquidity needs of the firm.  We hold liquidity in our bank subsidiaries which support much of our lending activity and we hold liquidity in our non-bank subsidiaries for example our U.K. and Asian broker-dealers for sales and trading activities.  You can find the most recent information on these on page 75 of our 10-K. Total liquidity for all three groups is $124 billion at quarter end and averaged $123 billion for the quarter, up from the average of 85 billion in 2007, an increase of 45%.  Parent company liquidity averaged $71 billion, up from a $49 billion average last year.  Bank and non-bank subsidiaries have averaged 52 up from $36 billion last year.  So far in the second quarter, our liquidity continues to be very strong.  Average total liquidity has been $125 billion and average parent company liquidity has been $77 billion.</p>
          <p>As you know we aggressively reduced our balance sheet last quarter.  Our discipline in maintaining an appropriate-sized balance sheet in today's environment along with our strong capital position has brought our gross leverage ratio down to 27.4 times from 32.6 and our adjusted leverage ratio down to 16 from 17.6.  This combination of our strong capital, high liquidity and reduced leverage positions us to take advantage of near-term market opportunities.</p>
          <p>Total average trading and non-trading VaR increased to $103 million from 98 million last quarter primarily driven by increased volatility levels.  Average trading value at risk increased to 97 million from 89 million.  While position levels remained essentially the same the increase in trading value at risk came from emerging markets, foreign exchange, spread widening in the mortgage markets and the reclassification of our subsidiary bank liquidity portfolios into the trading portfolio.  These were formally captured in non-trading VaR.</p>
          <p>Risk management remains a top focus and we have fortified a strong risk culture.  In addition to bringing back Ken deRegt as Chief Risk Officer reporting to John Mack, we made several changes to our risk management organization mainly adding increased market knowledge and trading expertise to compliment our risk models and scenario analysis.  We continue to balance opportunistic risk-taking with risk reduction in residential and commercial mortgages and leveraged finance.</p>
          <p>Now turning to page eight of the supplement in our global wealth management business, revenues of 1.6 billion declined 10% from last quarter reflecting a lack of new issues affecting the investment banking revenues, a general market slowdown during the quarter which drove down commissions and principal trading results.  Non-interest expenses decreased 4% from last quarter as an increase in compensation costs that included a severance charge was offset by a decrease in non-compensation expenses which include certain sub-advisory fees now being reported as a reduction in net revenues due to contract modifications.  PBT of $254 million decreased 33% from last quarter and the PBT margin decreased to 16%.  Over half of the decrease was driven by lower revenues.  The balance was the result of severance expenses incurred in the quarter, seasonally higher benefit expenses partially offset by lower non-comp expenses.  ROE for the business was a healthy 42%.  On page nine, you can see the productivity metrics.</p>
          <p>Net new assets of 11.4 billion represented our eighth consecutive quarter of positive client inflows.  Assets of the $1 million plus household segment decreased 6% from last quarter to 491 billion primarily due to market movements and is 71% of our total client base.  Total client assets decreased 5% from last quarter largely reflecting market levels.</p>
          <p>Average FA production decreased to 761,000 as a result of lower revenues reflecting in part the absence of new issues and an increase in the average number of FAs versus last quarter.  FA head count was essentially flat with the end of last quarter.  Average assets per FA of 85 million were down in line with market depreciation partially offset by the increase in net new assets.  While bank deposits however grew to $33.4 billion as clients moved more of their assets to cash in response to the volatile markets.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to our asset management business which has been delivering strong results in recent quarters.  There's no doubt our asset management business was negatively impacted by the turmoil in the market this quarter especially in comparison to the strong results we delivered last year.  But this shouldn't overshadow the good progress we've made executing our multi-year growth plan.  We've grown assets under management 27% from two years ago.  We are successfully building out our private equity infrastructure and alternative businesses with assets in alternative strategies up more than 147% from two years ago.  We've also continued the expansion of our international footprint by hiring local sales teams, opening local offices, and enhancing our alliances.</p>
          <p>As you can see on Page 10 of the supplement our asset management business reported a pre-tax loss of $161 million.  Our revenues this quarter were down significantly from the strong numbers we reported in 2007 driven almost entirely by the current challenging market environment.  The sharpest declines were the two principle transaction lines trading and investments.</p>
          <p>The trading line includes 187 million in losses from securities issued by structured investment vehicles, SIVs, held by asset management.  Total SIV exposure in our money funds is now 3.6 billion down from 8.2 billion at the end of last quarter.  The bulk of this decrease came from securities maturing.  The remainder came from asset sales and approximately $200 million was taken onto our balance sheet, Exposures relating to SIVs on our balance sheet was $588 million at the end of the quarter. 100% of the remaining SIVs in our money funds are sponsored by commercial banks that have provided public support for their SIV programs or have brought them onto their balance sheets.  We anticipate that maturing securities and our active management will continue to reduce positions through the second quarter.</p>
          <p>The investments line includes gains and losses from our merchant banking business which includes the real estate, private equity, and infrastructure businesses, as well as any gains and losses in our core asset management businesses which we define as traditional equities and fixed income funds and alternatives.  Merchant banking investment revenue declined $395 million primarily driven by real estate losses in the first quarter versus gains in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Core asset management investments reflected a net loss in the quarter, down 142 million from gains posted in the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Losses in the first quarter were primarily from equity and alternatives products seed investments in those markets that saw the sharpest declines.  Asset management fees decreased 14%, largely driven by lower performance fees in our alternatives business and lower core management fees primarily driven by equity market declines.  Non-interest expense of 704 million were down 27% from last quarter driven by lower compensation related to deferred compensation plans, as well as decreases in professional services and marketing costs.</p>
          <p>On Page 11 of the supplement you can see the flow data where we continue to show positive flows in our non-U.S., U.S. institutional, and Americas intermediary channels. We had strong inflows in our alternative products distributed through the non-U.S. and U.S. institutional channels.</p>
          <p>As James Gorman told you in January, we have yet to turn the corner in net positive flows in our retail mutual funds space.  This will continue to be a major focus of the management team going forward and we have recently made some key management changes in this business including naming a CEO of Van Kampen, who will also have interim responsibility for Morgan Stanley's retail funds.</p>
          <p>In terms of new offerings we launched an additional 15 new products this quarter, nine in alternatives, four in equity and two in fixed income.  We have significantly expanded our product offerings over the past few years and the new products we've launched since 2006 contributed $3.2 billion of inflows in the quarter which includes flows in new merchant banking products.</p>
          <p>On Page 3 of the supplement you can see the regional revenue disclosure at the firm-wide level.  This quarter 54% of our revenues are international with 39% from Europe, the Middle East and Africa and 15% from Asia and 46% has come from the America's.  International expansion remains one of our most promising opportunities and we are aggressively pursuing new markets where wealth is developing rapidly and there are opportunities for us to bring global capabilities to a local level.</p>
          <p>As a wrap up, a few words on the outlook. There are two key issues underpinning the current crisis in the markets.  One is deleveraging.  This is liability driven, focused on the provision of liquidity but is forcing portfolio liquidation and price deterioration.  The other is de-risking, the reluctance to extend risk capital.  The former is being addressed in market actions; the second will take some time to resolve itself.  As a result, markets remain challenged with distribution models still frozen in some cases.  Pressure will remain until markets begin to heal and the increasing level of uncertainty is taken out of the system.  We have been consistent in our views on the markets, that it will take some time, at least several more quarters, before credit markets and liquidity return to normal levels of activity.  We still believe that the structured and securitization markets will remain challenged if not impaired for an extended period.</p>
          <p>Away from these markets however, there continue to be opportunities in other areas within fixed income including interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity products, and within emerging markets.  The commodities business continues to build upon its leading market presence as we saw in agricultural this quarter and we see more opportunities in moving upstream and extending &#x2013; expanding our global footprint.  Emerging markets remains a top area of investment in focus with growth prospects particularly in Asia and Latin America.  The investment banking pipeline continues to be healthy and many of our clients are engaged in strategic conversations.  The current market environment may delay monetizing the pipeline, however.</p>
          <p>Volatility in the equity markets and trading volumes remain high which places the strength of our flow businesses, a key operating strength of our franchise.  This creates opportunities for our clients and for us in our cash derivatives and prime brokerage businesses.  Real estate and private equity investment revenues will be under pressure near term.  However, this market presents and will present many investment opportunities. Although there has been a slowdown in revenues, the retail investor has remained engaged thus far.  We believe that our more productive sales force, increased deposits, and growing international businesses will lessen the impact if retail investors pull back because of the difficult markets.</p>
          <p>Although we acknowledge the bearish view in the macro environment, there are several positives that are worth noting.  Valuations have declined and buyers will re-enter the market at some point.  Corporate fundamentals are still in good shape with robust cash levels and relatively low leverage.  From a technical perspective sentiment has been particularly bearish.  However, there has been some evidence of non-credit players buying into the credit asset class.  The financial community has been vigilant in recognizing asset impairment and this is a necessary step for financials to move towards reparation.  The delevering process is clearly underway and this ultimately should result in a less volatile market driven more by fundamentals.  There is a litany of alternative policy proposals on the table as rate cuts alone are not enough and we are seeing aggressive central bank actions.  So we do not see near term cyclical challenges changing our view of long-term secular growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>We continue to focus on leveraging Morgan Stanley's global scale, franchise and integration across all our businesses.  We are optimistic on the breadth and scope of our client franchise. With our strong capital base and liquidity and our ability to continue investing in the opportunities that are presenting, we will grow our share of the markets.  Thank you.  Now we'll be happy to take questions.</p>

          <p>Good morning.  I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit more color on the subprime analysis on Page 15.  You alluded in the press release to a $1.2 billion charge; I think that you broke it down a little bit more in your comments, and I'd just like to try and relate your comments and the comment about the 1.2 billion specifically to the items in the table on 15.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  Well as you know the financial supplement, that schedule presents all of our U.S. subprime net exposure.  So we are continually managing down our net exposure in the areas where we incurred our greatest losses in 2007.  That's through a combination of dispositions and write-downs.  So you see a decline in the net exposure if you look it at our Super Senior, the CDO Mezz line and the ABS bond positions it was a $2 billion decline there, right?</p>
          <p>However, within that coordinated subprime position we are supporting client business.  The combination of those two result in the aggregate net exposure remaining constant at 1.8 billion but within the prop trading element which is part of that you do see the reduction in Super Senior CDO Mezz where we did take the write-downs and residuals.</p>
          <p>So just to clarify that, so when we spoke about mortgage proprietary trading loss of 1.2 billion, where do you see those, right?  Well, you see the write-downs within the subprime which I've disclosed and then we took additional write-downs in our Alt-A positions which were about 600 million.</p>

          <p>And then the reduction in the CDS hedge sort of short from 5.1 to 3.3 over the course of the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  The reduction on that really is we reduce that as we reduce the positions itself obviously as a function of dispositions either write-downs or sales.  We're looking for further opportunities in the space to the position.  The message I want to give about that infamous trade is it we've actually got in a situation now where were managing it very efficiently and the shorts are of working against it, Guy.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  It sounds like the toxic waste cleanup is considering a pace and that's the key.  And to that you said that organizationally you had broken out the mortgage prop trading group.  Is that something that is going to be an ongoing business?  Or essentially is that a workout group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's really at the moment our priority is to work out those positions and that's the way I would look at that activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Fair enough.  Are you seeing asset growth in the institutional business that is at all material as a result of seizure of collateral from prime brokerage or repo clients?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned deleveraging several times during the call including right at the outset. And clearly, you as a firm did, although not all of your competitors did, at least not on a gross leverage basis.  And it sounds like listening to some of the other conference calls the last couple of days, essentially the Fed's creation of their new facility has taken some of the pressure to deleverage quickly off.  Would you agree with that?  Or do you not really feel that that makes a difference?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it has taken some of the pressure off but we are looking specifically at Morgan Stanley and how we want to manage our balance sheet and how liquid we want to keep it.  And so I think what the Fed has done has been incredibly proactive and helpful for the markets but it doesn't get away from the way we are looking at our business and how we want sail close to shore and manage for opportunities.  That's the way I'm looking at it.  And I did hear some of those comments as well but it doesn't change the three tenets that we've given you for this environment, Guy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's entirely fair.  And then if I can just ask a last one.  You talked about deleveraging and then you also talked about derisking which would seem to be a more tenacious problem.  Is the derisking something that would be closer to resolution you think, if there were more fiscal policy-type adjustments as opposed to what we have seen, which has principally been on the monetary front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's going to take a number of proposals to do that.  What you really need is the confidence of people to extend risk capital again and that is going to take some time.  However we get there is going to be subject to a lot of these proposals we're looking at.  The first part of that I do believe, which is balance sheet disclosure, is largely done.  I think a second part of that is raising of capital through various methods and then there are other proposals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then the final question I'd like to ask you is on book value.  This is just accounting but it didn't really go up anywhere near your earnings and obviously you didn't buy back shares so I'm just curious?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's it.  We got the dividend.  We didn't buy back shares and that's the main thing but we can rationalize that for you later.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  I have a couple of questions in terms of you guys have been great and consistent about giving a protracted outlook on difficult markets. But in terms of the events that have happened over the last couple of weeks, does that change your near-term outlook for any type of asset dispositions, and particularly with the Fannie/Freddie announcement this morning, does that accelerate any type of near-term asset disposition plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think that accelerates anything, Meredith; the way I would look at it is we've been very consistent from August onward in our view in these markets and the proposals and stories that can unfold.  Obviously the acceleration of events last week accelerated much quicker than we ever thought they would.  But we've been looking at situations of maintaining capital, having a liquid balance sheet, maintaining liquidity and so on.  So we may get opportunities to do things quicker but I think our strategy itself has been well thought out and formulated.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Goldfish I don't know about because it's part of a separate company.  Secondly, Saxon we have as you know a small, well, goodwill at the operating level which is consolidated at firm level where it's not deemed to be material.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Roger Freeman with Lehman Brothers.  Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Good morning. I just wanted to come back to a couple of questions that Guy had.  Can you just help me reconcile again on the $1.2 billion of mortgage related writedowns?  How much in there is subprime?  It is 700 of gross, but on a net basis was that, what is the number there?  And then &#x2013; because the other pieces you talked about were the 600 of Alt-A and then there is 600 related to counterparty exposure.  Can you just tie up all of that please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Looks it's specifically related to subprime itself within the 1.2.  If you look at the numbers we have, 500 was a writedown on Mezz, the CDO Mezz; 400 was a writedown &#x2013; in fact, there was 400 was a write down on the residuals, right, the bonds.  And the Alt-A we wrote down 600 and then we had some hedges offsetting those.  That's how you get the 1.2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The hedges look &#x2013; they all offset, right?  Because the net is a zero change on the P&amp;L for the quarter, right?  Specifically related to subprime?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Specifically related to the positions which are reflected on the schedule.  But let me explain, when we gave the schedule although &#x2013; when we gave that we had to show all our direct subprime exposures including what was on trading desk.  The great bulk of that was what was happening in the mortgage proprietary trading area.  That's why you are getting the skew on the numbers, right?  So if you think about it, strip out the Alt-A, which is not on the schedule itself but it's part of the 1.2 billion, so what you're saying is the net of that is the number that relates to subprime.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then the 600 relates to counterparty writedown.  That's separate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We also need to support selected client positions on the schedule, and secondly what you have is you have dispositions in there as well.  Now within the dispositions by the way, anecdotally on some of the positions we unwound, we actually had small write-offs which is why you get some noise on the movement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then I guess just also on the delivering, is it fair to assume that you're looking in this environment right now continuing to delever the balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I think it's fair to say we want to maintain a liquid balance sheet and be prudent which is what we are being.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it.  Okay.  And inside of prime brokers, can you talk to any tightening of margin requirements that you've been putting through to clients?  Has that been material?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I think we've been doing is optimizing pricing power within our prime brokerage business.  Our balances were relatively unchanged from last quarter but our revenues were up.  And really that's what's been happening.  I think we manage that business very well.  We keep a very clear eye on our free capital within the area.  So that's really all I want to say about prime brokerage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  In fixed income sales and trading obviously very, very strong quarter.  You talked on the call about both favorable positioning and strong client flows.  How would you characterize that sequential delta if you had to skew it to flows versus business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is the $60,000 question and having grown up in fixed income we've had debates about that forever.  The way I've always answered that question is we take positions based on the edge we have which is our client franchise, right? I think what you should look at is this is clearly a monetization of our client franchise.  Some days positions may be more, other days it may be the throughput.  But there's no doubt the bid offer has been increased.  But I think to actually try and do some percentage split between the two doesn't make sense.  We are trading, clearly, with information &#x2013; with open information based on our client flows.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Was the swing in commodities from the negative last quarter to the pretty strong positive this quarter a pretty meaningful piece of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  I think what I said to you last quarter, Roger, was that if you remember we had poor trading right? We eliminated the poor trading.  We had very strong client flows coming through and structured positions and better trading this quarter and, in fact, the investment coming through from new businesses that we invested in, such as agriculture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Last question.  I know this doesn't get a lot of focus right now in terms of wealth management but looking at your clients by size, the over $10 million category, assets declined the most.  I was wondering if there is anything you can speak to in terms of just market trends there, what some of your high net worth clients are...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think there is a market trend. I think it's a reaction to the market.  If you look about the strength of our wealth management business, our retail business, it's really fueled by capital markets activities to a large extent.  The capital markets have been subdued this quarter.  So that's the way I look at it.  I think the underlying core trend of our business and our strategic push on one million to 10 million, 10 million and above clients is very intact. So I really wouldn't read anything into this other than this is a good, ongoing good trend for that business after an exceptionally good fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Do you view these &#x2013; any of the municipal issues as significant issues for the wealth management business in terms of the auction rates and any repurchasing you might have to make there?</p>

          <p>Hi, Glenn.  How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, thanks.  First question is, so if you look at the leverage came down, and you got a lot of attention to that in derisking but the assets are up.  And obviously you got the equity infusion so I just wanted &#x2013; you also mentioned about near-term opportunities, so I get all the moving parts.  But in terms of overall size of balance sheet my gut was it sounded like that could actually go up as you see cheap opportunities in dislocated markets and then just overall controlling the net leverage number. Is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's a fair point.  But let's just clarify one thing.  The balance sheet went up by I think 40 billion which is a blip on the balance sheet our size.  Right?  We do have a liquid balance sheet and you're absolutely right, we're sailing close to shore.  But there is a world where we could opportunistically put up the balance sheet if the opportunities really present themselves on a risk adjusted basis and make sense.  But that is not our intention.  Our intention, as I think as I said before was to really sail close to shore and really opportunistically on a risk-adjusted return basis make investments in our balance sheet or liquidities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay no, that's totally helpful.  On the commercial real estate front, pretty meaningful reduction, no impact in terms of marks, just kind of curious on what kind of things were sold during the quarter and then of course, how you're hedging, I'm assuming through the CMBX, I'm not sure how else you can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we have a number of hedges.  We have a variety of hedges and it's not just a CMBX hedge.  Remember last quarter when we looked at our commercial mortgage, it was more skewed internationally.  I think at that stage we were approximately, don't shoot me, 70% or so international, 65%.  Once again, our hedges were in the US, what's happened is we've managed to reduce some of our international exposure which has performed well through dispositions and so on.  Our international exposure is down 48% on a much reduced amount and we feel better they're symmetrically in line with the hedges.  So we flagged this at the end of the fourth quarter as our number two issue that we wanted to manage.  It was obvious at that stage we'd managed it down from the third quarter and it's clear we've aggressively managed it down this quarter so I feel reasonably comfortable about that position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay it is what it is, that's good.  On the other expense line it was up a lot but let's just take it a higher level, you mentioned the cost ratios in the beginning and then thoughts on how it improved going forward.  In this revenue environment, I'm assuming that's it's more on the cost line that the revenue line but if you could just elaborate on what kind of things you're talking about and how meaningful that could be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I'm undertaking a thorough review, we are ripping out costs as we go forward and obviously we've dealt with comp to a large extent but on the non-comp side, we're aggressively looking at those situations and I think you're going to have to assume that I'm going to be doing things about it.  Sorry to be opaque.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really, I would love to think that was the case but no we just managed to get dispositions done, some sales done for various reasons but as I said I think the management of that position now is &#x2013; I don't want to shock people, we now actually have positive convexity on that position today as we have an ability to manage it back up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then on the leveraged lending, the commitments were down 5 billion on non-investment grade.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it doesn't look like anything was funded.  So you just roll forward what happened between the last quarter and this period end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, what actually happened was if you look at it, we reduced our commitments to 4.5 billion which is down from 12.2, 900 million of the deals withdrawn, 6.8 billion were closed.  Of the deals closed roughly 3 billion were reduced through syndication activity and commitment decreases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful.  Also, in wealth management on the banks we appear up to $33 billion now, how much is left there that you can bring into the bank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know; all of that is a function of the markets but fear will bring more cash but I think that was our target, it's an optimal target.  I think we've probably from a scale point of view given normalized markets we're there or there abouts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay so that's just inflow from client, there's no transfer from money funds taking place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on the auction rate securities can you quantify what's being held, how much your clients actually hold in those securities, rough numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Roughly it's 20 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Bill Tanona with Goldman Sachs, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Bill. How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, the European results looking at the revenues, they were down pretty sharply on a sequential basis, I know they've been largely outperforming but just wanted to know what ultimately was driving that type of decline.  Was it any type of write-offs there, or was that just a -- ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know what schedule you're looking at Bill because actually our European results were pretty big.  Specifically --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry the Asian results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, Asian results, sorry I thought you said European, excuse me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I did, I mistakenly said Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just think that the market has been subdued. Banking was a big factor last quarter for us and you've just seen activity levels down, but we don't think it's a trend, in fact if anything we continue to throw more resource into Asia. We've appointed a new CEO of our Asian business, Owen Thomas, and it's a major focus area for us.  I don't think there's any trend there; I think it's just a blip from a change from one quarter to another.  Banking really is the main driver.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so it wasn't anything -- none of the write-downs that you guys had reported were in that segment this quarter, it was all client driven.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then moving over to the IB pipeline, you more or less hinted that this environment was pretty tough in terms of deals getting executed but I don't recall you giving any type of pipeline disclosures.  Do you have those available?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The overall investment banking pipeline seems to be down about 35% from this time last year right, but we're obviously increasing market share in that, so our pipeline itself remains healthy so &#x2013; and strategics are coming in. But I think it's very early at this stage of the year to know how that's going to play out but we don't feel uncomfortable about our investment banking pipeline, Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then lastly, going back to the deposit program, there's obviously a lot of concerns in the marketplace as people kind of build these businesses out, particularly in this environment with housing prices going down.  Can you give us a sense as to what you're adding to the portfolio there on the loan side as you're building out that deposit base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean in GWM?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The retail business, we just do high-end mortgage business on a very heavily LTD basis.  We have no issues there at all and just continue as part of our affluent management program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thanks</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not huge is the answer, Bill.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hecht with Banc of America, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Colm, how are you doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Michael, well, and you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Pretty good, thanks.  Questions, there's been some talk and focus on the repo finance markets and I think obviously the Fed's new facility kind of takes some of the risk there off the table but can you just talk a little about any risks or challenges you guys are seeing in the repo area, and then maybe give us some color on the duration of your repo maturities today?  It seems like when I look at your balance sheet over the last two, three years, you've guys have been reducing your reliance on repo and much lower than a lot of your peers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well that's fair.  If you just talk about liquidity first, we've spoken about our liquidity itself.  But one of the tenets of our liquidity is to look at the term nature of our financing books so we have extended like the others.  The average tether on that financing is 34 days.  The collateral is very liquid, right, and so on. So away from that -- that's Morgan Stanley -- in terms of the market, market for collateral seems to be normalizing. The Fed has clearly helped, right, but it was something that was well within our stress scenarios.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, no that's great.  I'm sorry if I missed this but did you give an update on where your level 3 assets stood at the end of the quarter versus last quarter, I think they were like 74 billion or 7% of total assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I did not but you want one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you like to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm very comfortable too; we're still at 7%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Still at 7%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So with assets up, the absolute number would just be up a little bit, that's the way the math works.  Okay and then -- ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, you're not going to shoot me for 40 billion on a trillion dollar plus balance sheet are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, no, no, no and then any big shifts in terms of the components of the change?  Is it just more kind of shift from level two to level three because of spread widening during the period or -- ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'm still going through that process at the moment but I would suspect that what you've got in a market like this is, with lack of observability of prices you will have more of that drift and you'll probably have more of your hedges as a result of that being reflected in your level three.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, no.  That's fair enough.  Can we come back to the results in equities which seemed pretty strong and it seemed like from your remarks, it was across the board, PB record, quant strategy had a good quarter but any other color there? And you said prime brokers was a record, how about the balances, were the balances up quarter-over-quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Balances were flat, Michael and we obviously had some pricing power as indeed the whole industry did.  What I will say about equity, actually there is no single story across all our business lines in equity or major business lines in equity, we had very strong quarters so and that's more of that investment paying off as far as investing in the likes of derivatives clearly in our Delta One cash customer businesses we had increased activities, we had better bid-offer and again that's the strength of our franchise, a really strong customer franchise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's great and then the comp ratio this quarter, 49% but more like 47% --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excluding severance which despite the revenue declines year-over-year you're lower than the 48% a year ago.  How should we think about that and I know the outlook will depend on how revenues come in, but just any thinking about how we should think about comp ratio this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think at the moment, it's the old story; we are looking to give our best return we can to our shareholders, we're looking to preserve the enterprise value but a major dynamic this year will be the competitive pressures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  Okay and then I guess head count down about 2%.  Any thoughts on where we can expect that to trend the rest of the year, obviously lots of -- ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're looking &#x2013; a lot of it is depending on what's going to happen to the markets and the degree of reparation within the markets particularly on certain parts of these distribution models.  So we will be focused intently on this and we are looking very much as I said to you at allocation of resources and as soon as we get more clarity I think we'll be able to give you more clarity on where we're going.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's fair enough.  Last question just on the asset management business.  The results are there obviously impacted by the marks that you saw but if I look at the core fee traction, core fees or just the asset managers' fees down 14% quarter-over-quarter, your assets fell about 3%.  There's definitely a mix shift towards money funds going on so I guess that's part of it, but it still seemed a little bit outsized.  Is that just mix of incentive fees versus core fees that are both reported within that bucket?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's two, it's one the market and the move to money markets. Two is the performance fees clearly, right, which we're not benefiting from, from the investments we made.  But these things are short-term cyclical.  We expect, as I said, we feel very comfortable about the underlying trend of our asset management business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there seasonality this quarter, Q1 versus Q4 that the incentive fees would typically be heavier in Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not particularly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When we think about the operating environment, looking back at the last quarter and then looking forward, in the first quarter there were great trading volumes across a whole bunch of different products and asset classes.  How should we think of the potential for that to continue going forward against the backdrop of what seems to be a slowing economy and not a whole lot of investment banking activity levels?  It would seem some of those fundamental underlyers would suggest some of the trading activity level we've seen may not be normally sustainable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think there are a few dynamics at work.  One is we've clearly had liquidity come into the system which will help.  Two is you may not get the same degree of trading volume but you are getting increasing participants in the market, particularly in terms of equification of new markets and so on.  And then finally I suspect that there will be some reduction in competitors. We will have a gap-to-leader makeup that we can make in some these markets, or where we are a leader, we can extend those.  So I'm not unduly concerned about that to be honest.  I think the secular trends are towards growth of capital markets, increased activity and so on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you talk a little bit about risk appetites that you're seeing in some international markets relative to domestic?  I'm used to seeing what's going on domestically where people are awfully risk averse.  To what extent is that spreading through other parts of the globe do you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think within the credit markets it's pretty much a global phenomenon right?  I think away from that we're seeing good risk appetite in liquid products and the equity markets still seem to be pretty vibrant.  So I think that's the way I would characterize it.</p>
        </plist>
