          <p>Good afternoon. Thank you for &#x2013; thank you all for coming here. And we have quite a few people in the room. And I would like to announce that we have put out our financial results for first quarter of 2011 today. And we have quite a representative management team to discuss those financial results and answer any of your questions about financials, operational situation in the company. And we have &#x2013; the team is led by Mr. Leonid Fedun, who is member of the LUKOIL Management Board and Vice President of LUKOIL and in charge of strategy. It's also &#x2013; we have Mr. Igor Kozyrev, who is the Chief Accountant in the company and knows what happens in the financial &#x2013; in the financials; and Sergei Epifanov, who is &#x2013; he is Deputy and myself, Andrey Gaidamaka, I'm Deputy to Mr. Fedun.</p>
          <p>We'll be taking all the questions after the presentation. We will be taking questions first from the room, but also we'll have questions coming from through telephone line. And I just would like to make an announcement for people that are dialing in that if you have a question please press star, one to inform the operator that you wish to speak.</p>
          <p>I also would like to thank Morgan Stanley for helping us to put together such a representative event and it has not been easy. And I would like to personally thank the team of Morgan Stanley [Mitra Gayev] and Alina Nesterova that has &#x2013; have made it possible. So, with this, I hope that we will be able to answer all of your questions during this Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>With this, I'll pass the floor to Mr. Leonid Fedun. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Translator: Thank you for coming here to meet us. We're traditionally presenting our quarterly report. This quarter was very busy, a lot of interesting developments, both in our country and on the international markets. So, quite obvious &#x2013; it's quite obvious that just one quarter does not give us &#x2013; that doesn't give us a clear picture of the entire performance of the company, but we can talk about trends, about the macro economic and political situation in the country and we can have a look at positive developments and changes in the company and to see where we're going.</p>
          <p>Well, first of all, we'll have a disclaimer, which is quite usual for such presentation, now financial results. Financial highlights, we're showing net income of $3.5 billion, which is the best quarterly profit after 2008 and the second best in the history of our company's operations. If you look at net profit per BOE, it's $17.9 per barrel of oil equivalent which is 78% year-on-year increase, and this is better than many other majors. We don't get the $2 billion subsidies that the Rosneft does.</p>
          <p>Our company is still confident and we look forward to very good progress due to &#x2013; not least due to high oil prices. The macro economic situation as it was in this quarter, all the price factors were favorable for us. For our operations &#x2013; over 36% increase in export oil prices. The diesel price has gone up in the Russian Federation. The only question is, the only problem is with net backing on gasoline, which now the government is trying to keep gasoline prices down. Export tariffs have gone up by more than 30% and mineral extraction tax has gone down by 45%. We've increased our oil production by 14%, sorry our hydrocarbon production went down by 4%. This is due to a number of factors that I will go into later. We increased our internal domestic sales which provide often better net backs than exports.</p>
          <p>And the overall financial results, you can see them on this slide, you may have seen them already and we can talk about &#x2013; we can say that practically virtually all our financial results are signs of success. In fact in keeping with the market developments, the next slide shows our sales breakdown. Traditionally, we get our main revenues from petrochemical sales and our refinery products on the net backs of our higher added value products. Exports of course are higher than selling crude oil, and there will be a new oil export tax and the Program 66 and this will afford us &#x2013; give us a chance to get a better profit from oil export &#x2013; crude export.</p>
          <p>Unlike our colleagues, we are trying to reduce export of heavy oil, fuel oil and increase export of such products as diesel in keeping with Euro standards 4 and 5. We took &#x2013; LUKOIL took advantage of the deficit of gas, gasoline on the Russian market, you know that the Russian Federation government launched a program similar to programs in Germany, Spain and France and in the USA of car recycling. Therefore, car sales went up by almost 70% and the car industry &#x2013; car building industry in Russia is growing faster if last year about 1.5 million cars were sold this year, it's more like &#x2013; it looks more like 3 million. And in this situation, the oil refineries, most oil refineries in our country were not ready to actually change accordingly. We are the only company who were prepared to increase the production of high-octane gasoline and due to the increase of production of high value-added products at our refinery in north.</p>
          <p>You can see on this slide that compared to fourth quarter of last year, our operating costs have not gone up. There was just a small increase of 7.5%, and this although despite high oil prices, we're very strictly monitoring our cost, our operating cost and maintain harsh financial discipline, which ensures better financial for our company than higher than the market expectations. And therefore, we are ahead of some other state-owned companies.</p>
          <p>So, you can see our main operating expenses here, and you can see that lifting costs &#x2013; we are keeping lifting cost at the same levels despite ruble appreciation in fact over the last few months, the ruble appreciated by almost 12% despite that our lifting costs have not increased. One of the ways we could optimize and cut lifting cost is our program to increase our energy efficiency. This program is based on getting access to the most efficient energy electric power generators and also thanks to our own power generation because energy costs are growing and that the special government program to encourage greater energy efficiencies.</p>
          <p>Next year, we intend to increase the utilization of associated gas to 95%. Our main method of associated gas utilization is to actually channel it via along with natural gas to our end consumers. Over 300,000 kilowatts of power is currently produced are actually at our oil fields, which enables us to reduce the share of power &#x2013; electric power costs in our total cost.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A and transportation expenses are shown on this slide, you can see that compared to previous quarter, there's an 18% reduction in the fourth quarter normally SG&amp;A go up because annual bonuses are paid out to our employees and our subsidiaries' employees.</p>
          <p>On the whole, the transportation monopoly tariffs are going up and some of them like Transneft tariffs are going even, going up faster than inflation and general inflation. But as far as the tanker transportation, it's still &#x2013; the situation is still very favorable.</p>
          <p>The slide which shows you the net profit, the income reconciliation compared year-on-year with Q1 of last year. I would like to draw your particular attention to the recalculation extraction tax initiative, which is US$240 million, that is a special presentation we have for heavy oil instructions in Timan-Pechora area and until recently the Ministry of Finance did not expect any filing of documents from us for this particular tax break because there was certain accounting lines that needed to be completed in accordance with our legislation in the year 2010. We have completed this work and we have received tax back, US$240 million, recalculation of the extraction tax incentive. So, it is now shown US$240 million as I said. So, this is the receivables, and which allows us to reduce the tax payable in 2011. And from now on we will be able to regularly increase the construction of heavy oil at the same time getting a tax break, a relevant tax break.</p>
          <p>Cash flow reconciliation shown on slide 13, I think the large amount of questions would be raised by $1.7 billion, which is the advance for certain purchases. We had acquisitions of subsidiaries and non-controlling interest. We had $800,000 spent previously for the purchase of petrol stations from <mark type="indiscernible" /> we have a similar target. Right now, we are not able to disclose the only information, there is some confidentiality closes, but as soon as the deal is complete if we are very lucky or if we are lucky, we shall disclose it. And if it doesn't take place, obviously the money will be put back or spent on other acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Moving on to CapEx breakdown, page 14, I would like to draw your attention to an increase in CapEx for exploration and production and drilling in Russia 37.5% compared to Q1 of last year. I'll explain why it's happening, it is an increase of the volumes of the complex drilling, horizontal drilling and additional methods of the increase of the well, EOR. At the same time, we are reducing our investments in international refining compared to last year. The volume of investments in international refining and marketing has gone down by 17.6%.</p>
          <p>A few words about the situation with production, of course, every company is very unhappy with a decrease in production. But in this case, it was planned although it did not happen as we expected, it is to do with the decrease in production in West Siberia. The overall decreasing production in West Siberia fields in the Russian Federation is between 5% and 6%, depending on the field.</p>
          <p>We had a period in 2007/2008 of fairly a rapid drop to do with the more intensive extraction methods, including very powerful pumps. And at the same time given that the water cut decrease is important. So, we had a special program in West Siberia, and we hope that by year 2013, we shall have 1%, 1.5% drop in production, which is optimal for this phase of development of the field of its maturity. And it will be compensated by both the international production, but also an increase in the amount and other regions.</p>
          <p>At the same time, the key factor, which is the stabilization of the output, is the use of new methods of drilling, for example horizontal drilling and as we can see a difference of the output in the wells with horizontal drilling versus ordinary drilling, only last year we started to use more complex drilling systems, which our colleagues from abroad have been using for quite some time now.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we have certain reserves for the future. At the same time, LUKOIL has the highest ratio of horizontal drilling, 25% of the new funds. Our competitors have actually the figures manyfold lower than us. And once operations are over, whilst the figures for the horizontal drilling until recently were not satisfactory not to our complete satisfaction nevertheless I think we have already quite some experience of multi-fracing, horizontal drilling and our developers, our oil engineers, oil experts have been tasked to use as much as they can. Of course, we cannot use fracturing, multi-fracturing everywhere. Nevertheless, we believe that it is extremely important and essential.</p>
          <p>If you look at the next slide, we shall see the main techniques of stabilization and intensification of production as you can see the share of, for example, drilling is going up. At the same time, we have additional tools, methods, to do with the creation of the drilling of multiple completion for example completion with expanding factors and the balance, all sorts of a new progressive method which in total overall will increase the total volume of recoverable reserves from the existing and mature fields and the same time create an opportunity to stabilize of lifting costs and reduce the water cuts.</p>
          <p>A lot of work has been done by our geologists recently, I would like to show you several projects, which we have already rolled out. It is for example the EOR. Before we introduced the new technologies, we had to run them in &#x2013; we've drilled more than 600 trial wells, only after that we were able to commercially use it. Of course, we don't need to do it every time 600 wells, we have a lot of experience already. Tevlinsko-Russkinskoye field, two fractions per well allowed us to increase the output by the factor of 10, the same could be said about other fields. Urievskoye field is quite mature and Kechimovskoye field which until recently was considered to be unprofitable, we used special methods of drilling &#x2013; underbalance drilling, which we allowed us to increase by the fraction of 4 to 5, almost 5 times the output of the well. You can see that it leads to &#x2013; of the total amount of proven reserve per well to go up quite by a considerable amount.</p>
          <p>Right now, we are finalizing new strategic blueprint for our brownfields and greenfields so that we can use them. The experience of in commercial use not just in incremental areas, but in a day-to-day work, not a single field now is considered without a complex alternative method of complex multiple finishing options and for us, it is very important. Multiple completions is something that we are looking at both in Western Siberia and new fields. For Tevlinsko-Russkinskoye field, the original plan was to reduce by the factor of three.</p>
          <p>And at the same time, the output of the oil wells, which is &#x2013; which are operated by our contractors will be considerably higher and then we allowed for in our original plan. Another negative factor which had to play and affected the output, the production was the error in assessing our capabilities in Yuzhnaya Khylchuya field. I must say that we are not the only ones here, we are not passing the blame on, but ConocoPhillips have made some limitations in the past. So, companies are not invaluable, but the geology of this field is a lot more complex than we have, we are banking on and some of the reserves which were, was also proven reserves would be a very complex, very &#x2013; the penetration permeability was very difficult in some of the reserves had to be discounted or written off.</p>
          <p>So, we can see that the payment per recovery were a lot lower and the recovery rate was not as had been hoped. We lost 2 million barrels in production compared to 2009 for our plans. We are now facing situation which you can see, we believe it's stabilized, and for 2011, we don't think it will happen until at least '13 by which time it should go up, its growth will be based on the coming on stream of our Western Siberia field.</p>
          <p>At the same time in order to stabilize the situation in Nenetsky Autonomous District in Timan-Pechora, we have been extremely active, very proactive in gaining access to the latest fields in this region, Trebs and Titov. Our Trebs and Titov, our share is 250 million barrels, we bought it for less than $0.70 per barrel.</p>
          <p>What is very important to note is that the whole of the infrastructure which has been created in this region, the pipeline, the power supply, our industrial basis and most importantly, the export terminal will already give the revenue which will be in excess of the revenue from the use of this field, the tariff for example, the existing Transneft tariff had the oil been from Timan &#x2013; from Trebs and Titov was to be exported by the southern route to Primorsk would have been $9 per barrel.</p>
          <p>We, with our partners, have signed an agreement by which these tariffs will be by 30% less, we have a monopoly, but at the same time, we shall be fully utilizing our terminal and have additional process, additional revenues as the terminal owners. Another strategic initiative, which is being rolled out and touching wood will be rolled out by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>As our agreement &#x2013; strategic agreement with Rosneft, presently we have decided, we have identified several areas of common interest. For example, Timan-Pechora area where there is a whole range of field such as Naryanmarneftegaz and a number of others &#x2013; number of others which were also going to develop jointly and Rosneft is particularly interested in our participation because as I said we are able to give access to the whole infrastructure package, we have experience, we have export capabilities in the region, which will increase by 30% the NPV of Rosneft projects, and so we work hand in hand with Rosneft and we are very excited about it, very happy about it. If they're likely that will have an agreement with other companies, foreign companies, and partners who operate in Timan-Pechora which will allow us to expose our oils using the Northern routes, which will again utilize our infrastructure, utilization rates will be high.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we are looking at the major projects for example, increasing our presence in the Caspian Sea. We have Caspian Oil company joint companies on the shelf of the Azov and Black Sea, all offshore, and at the same time, we are analyzing projects for the offshore areas, which has been passed over to the state by Rosneft.</p>
          <p>So, we have enormous reserves there and is very profitable. If we can deem it interesting, LUKOIL has very good experience of drilling offshore, it's the only Russian company with such wealth of experience, and it gives us an opportunity to move in the right direction, move forward.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we are maintaining our in-house proprietary, exploratory drilling in <mark type="indiscernible" /> recently last year, we discovered the field, and it's a very promising area, it's the second test drill in order to evaluate the reserves and decide what to do. We only discussed this morning at the Board of Directors Meeting, we had also discussed the Western Africa programs as well, so this year we shall see where we are, the potential is enormous. We also need to be lucky, you need to be a slightly little lucky when you're a geologist. So, we hope that we shall give good news both to our shareholders and our investors and then rejoice at the Board level as well.</p>
          <p>Our main financials, we have a very robust financial position as you can see page 26, we have a very comfortable debt burden leveraging compared to other companies. So, given the existence of other projects, we can roll them out successfully and without necessarily having more debt on our books. Here you can also see our position compared to our competitors to our peers in the industry. We are happy with the good results and it's proved that the development of the &#x2013; which we chose was correct.</p>
          <p>And finally page 24, our strategic objective, creation of value by increasing recovery rates. In the Russian, from 19% today up to 40% target given the use of modern technologies of development and drilling of the field, which create considerable prospect for faster development of our company, I'd like to draw your attention to the following.</p>
          <p>There is nothing extraordinary, there is nothing exceptional, average recovery rates in Norway for example is 50% in the USA. It is 45%. So, we plan to roll out the work that the European and the company, European and the American companies have already done in the past.</p>
          <p>So, we have this reserve, we have this upside and in the very near future LUKOIL will come back to as a pack of leaders both for &#x2013; in terms of its production and in terms of its financial results. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. [Foreign Language]</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Indeed, it's a very good question. One of the most difficult problems for Russian industry is that, we &#x2013; companies have not had any incentive to increase recover &#x2013; oil recovery rate.</p>
          <p>This is because the level of taxation on the existing oil fields is very, very high about 70% of total revenues. Currently, we are &#x2013; we're talking to the Russian government, including the Head of the Russian government Mr. Putin, trying to show, to demonstrate that without using modern methods, the traditional area of currently is about 16 hectares per well, in the U.S., it's about four or even two and there are huge associated gas reserves and the system of gas reinjection does not only result in higher oil production, oil flow rate, but also to actually eliminating a certain heavy oil fraction, but until recently, this kind of reinjection was impossible due to a tax that was only recently canceled and abolished.</p>
          <p>So, there were no incentives to do anything like this and I have absolutely no doubt that by 2015, the Russian government will have to have reviewed the current taxation system because they will be facing considerable and steady decrease of oil production because the oil flow rate &#x2013; at &#x2013; the average oil flow rate has been decreasing by 5% to 6% per year, that's on according to the energy ministry's figures to meet the demand, there will be a need by 2020, there will be a need for &#x2013; to launch, to develop new oil fields producing about 2 billion barrels per year.</p>
          <p>But once again, we did not and until recently, we had no incentives to increase oil recovery rate. And so, we need a different system of taxation as a system of additional revenue tax. And I'm sure that by 2015 we will have it in place, but until then we will increase horizontal drilling volume fracturing in order to increase oil recovery rate.</p>
          <p>And we believe that this is the most efficient way that will enable us to increase the oil recovery rate by probably 10%, 15% and our company is the only one that uses multiple fracturing &#x2013; multiple hydrofracturing at our ordinary oil fields enabling us to increase the flow rate by a factor of 10 and increases the EOR by about 30% at our existing fields.</p>

          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Translator: By 2015, the government, the Russian government will see quite clearly that there is no hope to stabilize oil production at the level of 550 million per year, that these hopes are unrealistic and because for Russia to have a status of number one oil producer in the world, it's a very important ambition and also oil exports account for about 50% of budget revenues in Russia. So, it's not a question of &#x2013; it's not a question of whether they want to or not it's just as they will have to.</p>

          <p>I would not like to sort of to open up to disclose all the confidential information, but we have been talking to our international advisors, consultants and to the government, to the Energy Ministry and part of the decisions that have already been made are very positive like tax breaks for new field developments about $30 additional per barrel at our new oil fields at Korchagin, for example. And same kind of tax breaks that only until recently only Rosneft enjoyed. And there will be also some benefits for brownfield.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much for your presentation. I would like to ask two questions, if I may. First, your framework agreement with Rosneft. So far, Rosneft was introducing international companies to all its offshore fields, and these agreements were such that international partner would always pay for exploration, drilling and would get a part of the license. Do you have any concept of how your agreements will be built, on similar conditions or some kind of parity agreements because you have inherited Rosneft?</p>
          <p>A West Africa question, number two question. Lukoil until recently was paying very high attention to international projects. And one of the few companies &#x2013; Russian companies which was developing successfully IR in Central Asian projects speaks for itself, but we'd like to appreciate the projects. When you understand what resources you are base &#x2013; you are banking on or you are hoping to access in West Africa, could you tell us how Lukoil is reviewing its international?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to answer your second question, I forgot the number one, West Africa, I understand that, yesterday literally yesterday our vessel Olympia docked in Dzata-2, and [GNPC] has started drilling.</p>
          <p>I am very scared of frightening you with the figures that exist, but use the analogy that the, Jubilee oil fields, other discoveries that were made recently there a billion, billion reserves. If we discover something the reserves would be similar, but let's wait and see. We had bad experience in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> for example, we were hoping for it to be an enormous field, but it was just a geological fracture, nothing else.</p>
          <p>Let's see that that too was sand, maybe it's not the center of the field, maybe it's on the border of the field. But West Africa itself, I looked at it today is a unique area, totally unique. It's a mixture, cocktail of <mark type="indiscernible" /> virtually all lithographic structures, geological structures that exist in nature are collected in a very short area of time.</p>
          <p>You can't remember when it happened, it was billions of years ago of course, but when Brazil, it was split from Africa, there was one continent then it drifted away some of the fields moved off, mitigated over the globe with Brazil and the other state in Africa. So, Petrobras will be &#x2013; the benefit, the bounty that Petrobras is enjoying actually exist in East Africa &#x2013; West Africa as well.</p>
          <p>But it's not pre-salt reservoirs; it's reservoirs above the salt with deposits. And so far, the success of deep sea drilling which started with Tullow Oil and/or Jubilee is maintained, every field heralds &#x2013; every drill, every well drilled herald a new field.</p>
          <p>I don't want to be, to over promise and under deliver, I don't want to be too optimistic. There are huge reserves, but in principal change the program, but exploration and the forecast for company's reserve in each case. Right now, we have two blocks, two units. What was your first question? Rosneft, agreements with Rosneft on par. So, far we have signed the framework agreement, which covered several assets.</p>
          <p>Number one over the regions where we work jointly is a joint activity in the Caspian. We are working on a 50-50 basis there. What I said earlier in Timan-Pechora would be a model repeated. For example, Trebs and Titov Bashneft agreement similar to that. See, they wouldn't be able to develop the fields without it, they cannot create an infrastructure that will kill them on the spot literally.</p>
          <p>As far as our offshore fields, it's a completely different thing, it's quite complex. Rosneft obviously being the owners of the license. Well, one thing we as the partners, contractors and the members of the parties to the contract want something else. Of course we are holding negotiations, but will only enter the project if we're convinced that it is the best alternative for using the investments and the experience that we have to-date. And this is how we intend to it, this is how we're going to view it.</p>

          <p>Sanford Bernstein, given your plans for horizontal drilling, I wondered if you could say, how many rigs you currently have capable of horizontal drilling? Whether you would look to increase that number and how long you would think it might take to do so? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Yes, you all have the presentation, the PowerPoint presentation, pages 17 and 16, the volumes are high. But let's say, we have horizontal wells with 100, between 100 and 300 meter deviation, of course increase the output, there are also other wells with one kilometer deviation. It depends on the structure of the field, it depends on the model, which one is more effective.</p>
          <p>And what's really important is that for the first time ever, we are using the multi-stage fracturing using unconventional resources in the north &#x2013; something that was used in North America. So far, our first test show in the three fields are extremely encouraging, very encouraging indeed. And we believe that the fields which have the opportunity for multi-stage fracturing, namely we have a very low reservoir of permeability, very tight reservoirs are going to be benefiting from it because we have this experience in Western Siberia and in the Caspian.</p>
          <p>I said that 25% of all the wells are using the hydrofracturing, the overall number of wells about 300 when we're talking about horizontal wells.</p>

          <p>We are very grateful to the government, because the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Mr. Lavrov's visit, quite recent visit to Iraq will be his first visit after the certain event has helped us to address certain issues to do with the land access, with electricity power supply, and the arrival of a big boss as they say in the orient or in the east has magically assisted in ironing out lots of difficulties. So, we don't see any political obstacles for 2015 deadline. I think we will stick to it and we shall deliver on time as originally planned.</p>

          <p>Hello, Barry Neal from Reuters. I have a question just about your operations in the Middle East. I know for example you're operating in Egypt, I don't know about &#x2013; whether you have much involvement in any other countries that have experienced political turmoil recently. I'm just wondering if that presents any problems for you, whether you might have any concerns for contracts in Egypt or elsewhere if there is a change of government or whether you might foresee any other difficulties if there is change of regime? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. We do indeed have two projects in Egypt, but they are very small scaled and not expected from the point of view of revenue or cash flow <mark type="indiscernible" /> so that won't be a big problem. If we're talking about the East in general or Middle East, on Friday, <mark type="indiscernible" /> has come back from Uzbekistan. He had a very productive meeting with Mr. Karimov, the President and we reported to him about our capabilities, our project, in Turkmenistan we have &#x2013; as geologists were very optimistic here.</p>
          <p>We believe we could be a major gas producer in this region. We also have very good prices for Central Asian gas and what's really important that we have a new export route to China. As you know China is building new pipeline and the government of the Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan have signed a new contract with Chinese government on very favorable prices for our projects in Uzbekistan.</p>
          <p>And have a high upside, we are optimistic about the volume of production 16 billion, 19 billion in this region at a very good price. It's a lot more interesting than Egypt, although Egypt is a very good project of course.</p>
