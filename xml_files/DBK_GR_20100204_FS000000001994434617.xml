          <p>Welcome to Frankfurt. Welcome to the Deutsche Bank's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2009 Analyst Conference. Many of you will be familiar with the format of today. First, we will have a presentation and some remarks from Josef Ackermann then Stefan Krause will follow. And then we'll go first to questions from those of you who are attending here in the room. And then I'm going to ask Maria, the dial-in hostess, for questions from &#x2013; there are number of people who are dialing in and following this call via the webcast.</p>
          <p>Before we get started, one very important request, please turn mobile phones and BlackBerrys off. Not mute, but off. You may not hear it, but even if it's on mute, it can interfere with the webcast. So thank you very much for your cooperation on that.</p>
          <p>Secondly, if we don't get to your question, if questions exceed the time that we have available, please accept my apologies in advance. Come back to IR and we will get an answer for you as soon as we can and follow up with you.</p>
          <p>That's as far as I would like to go with opening remarks. I'd now like to turn it over to the CEO, Josef Ackermann to make some remarks about 2009. Jo?</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning and good afternoon wherever you are. Let me first say a few words about the financials of 2009. And then of course, some words about the management agenda just to keep you informed about what we said at the Investors Day. And then also talk a little bit about the regulatory changes, how I see it. Everybody has probably a little bit &#x2013; a different view, but coming back from Davos, I have some interesting and constructive discussions up there.</p>
          <p>First the 2009, I think before and I read some of your comments. And to be honest, this is a year of concession. And I think that's a most important part to understand. We have one-offs on both sides and actually the net result of all these one-offs is a charge of 3.5 billion pre-tax. Now we can talk about the goodies or we can talk about the bad things. But important is that if these one-offs are behind us we should be roughly 3.5 billion better by this at normalized level pre-tax. And I think that is for me, the key message I want to give.</p>
          <p>So you have seen the pre &#x2013; income before income taxes and net income and the ROE. I think what is important that we've been able to further strengthen our capital. We are now at 12.6% and a core Tier 1 at 8.7. That's why we think we have to do more to strengthen the capital this year, by not raising dividends too much. To be honest, this is also a little bit what regulators are expecting from all of us.</p>
          <p>Actually regulators are expecting two things: No bonus and no dividend. And this was clearly, even more so politicians, that was clearly communicated to all of us in Davos. So I don't want to provoke any negative reaction. We did pay bonus and we did pay and we are increasing a dividend. But all in a way hopefully that people can live with it, without provoking a backlash which is too big and too negative for the industry for many years to come. In that sense, therefore we also further reduced our leverage to now below 23.</p>
          <p>Here you see the net revenues. We still have here some impairments and markdowns of about 1.5 billion, but the revenues are at 28 billion. So back to a level which most of us actually would have conceded not realistic when the crisis started. I remember we talked about this going back to '04, '05, now we are back to '06 and not very far away from '07. And net income above '05 not quite '06, '07, but shows that with these one-offs I mentioned we are getting close again to a more normalized level.</p>
          <p>Assets, these are the U.S. GAAP pro forma assets to 891 billion and leverage ratio as a consequence 23. Capital ratio is now up to 12.6, core 8.7 and risk-weighted assets 273. And I think whatever we talk about going forward, it is just important to understand and I've said that many times, there's always a management response to some of the calculations you are making more on a trend assumption. And I think that is proven here again.</p>
          <p>Tier 1 capital is up from 28 billion at the beginning of 2008, to a bit more than 34 billion. I don't have to go into the different phases again, you have seen that at the Investors Day. But I just want to talk about how realistic some of these numbers are which we have presented to you in December.</p>
          <p>Now CB&amp;S, we have the 3.5 billion pre-tax number, which of course includes among others the payroll tax in the U.K. and some of the other market allowance and things, which we are going to talk about.</p>
          <p>Key metrics you see the massive reductions in assets, in risk-weighted assets, and actually most importantly for me the value-at-risk number at a constant input, which is down 57%. So, what we promised to you a year ago that we are going to lower the risk appetite and you had many questions whether we will be able to compensate for the lower risk, at the lower Prop Trading revenues in other parts, we have been able to demonstrate that. And the dedicated Prop Trading is now down to a very low level, actually it's below 2% of the Group's revenues and even that is somewhat doubtful how you define Prop Trading.</p>
          <p>So the Obama Plan, which is somewhat &#x2013; some papers highlighted as a big threat is certainly not a threat on a corporate level. I see more difficulties there in how much of this business is being transferred from a regulated sector to an unregulated one. And what does it mean in terms of efficiency and liquidity in some of these markets? So, that's a broader, broader impact I am talking about, but the corporate impact on Deutsche Bank is very small. And by the way, it was clear in Davos from Larry Summers and others it will affect U.S. banks globally, it will affect foreign banks only in United States, so that's in addition a correction of what I just said, or a reduction of the impact.</p>
          <p>Now revenue growth, and that is key that we were capable of growing in areas where we have some more flow businesses again and we could offset the reductions in revenues in the flow businesses, and I think that is a very key message.</p>
          <p>Maybe one word to CB&amp;S, which is important, you remember at the Investor Day and this was the biggest and the most maybe intelligent question: The slowdown that you have seen in the fourth quarter, is that a trend or was it a transitional temporary slowdown? We argued at the time that this is a more a transitional slowdown; so a temporary phenomenon and not a trend. Now, up to today, I can confirm that our view was right because we had very strong sales and trading results in January.</p>
          <p>It was so good that it doesn't move on now... GTB, also here gaining market share but as we explained to you many times, we are paying a price for low interest rates here, and this is true for the bank as a whole. Now, it's very often you hear from academics that banks have make a lot of money, because of the low interest rates and the maturity transformation. This has never been our attitude. We have always had a very disciplined treasury, and we don't have these big mismatches.</p>
          <p>Now does that mean that we are not making as much money as we could? Yes, but we don't like the risk, the interest rate risk and we never did that. So in that sense our impact on GTB and retail from that philosophy is somewhat bigger than probably anticipated. That's why we see of course a lot of upside potential if interest rates will start to normalize and of course recovery of the International Traders' Fund.</p>
          <p>Asset and Wealth Management, rightly you alluded to a lot of challenges here. It was an industry phenomenon, but we did certainly not outperform. We have done a lot in terms of restructuring; you see the comp and benefits down 30%, non-comp 30%, FTE 25% in Asset Management. We have good net new money growth in 2009 and that's why we are confident that the way back to a profitable path is not temporary, but will continue into 2010, just based on the new cost structure, which we have. For PWM, of course the same is true. We had some exceptional items as you will see, also some restructuring charges and severance payments in &#x2013; also out of the Sal. Oppenheim acquisition.</p>
          <p>Now, on the retail, retail has suffered in two ways. One is, the investment products have just not picked up. There was very slow demand for investment products and also a big problem with the provisions. But here again, we started to restructure pretty soon in the process we had almost 250 million of severance; we would &#x2013; which will lead to 100 million savings already in the year 2010. So no more or no big number of severance and savings of 100 million. That alone of course gives quite a swing. We have seen stabilizing provision for credit losses and we clearly see our hope that investment product revenues are coming back when markets continue to stabilize.</p>
          <p>Performance Culture, we talked about a billion and you will hear more about that. We are &#x2013; have started in 2009, have reduced head count by roughly 3,000, and we have now and that's most important much more put an emphasis on cost discipline and efficiency again, and in the front offices about employee productivity. So we are looking at the coverage people and the productivity of coverage people as one example. And of course we have the efficiency aspiration infrastructure of &#x20AC;1 billion by 2011.</p>
          <p>Now, what is affecting us in terms of regulatory risk? First, compensation. We have fully complied with the G20 but also BaFin and FSP and FSA recommendations, we have talked to them, we have presented that, and actually they felt that we are more advanced now than most banks they have seen. So in that sense, I think we have done a lot. We have the &#x2013; increased the fixed element shift in pay mix. Now this will cost us 700 million in 2010, but it has been clearly communicated that the increased fixed salaries will be offset in the variable. So we are not going to pay more in terms of fixed salaries in addition to the same bonus as this year. So it will clearly go against the fixed income. So the overall compensation will stay. We then have of course, much more deferrals in it and clawbacks and the same is true for the Executive Board as well. So as I said, in full compliance with all the different guidelines and requests.</p>
          <p>Capital, we said at the Investors Day, that we have no plan to raise capital without adding cash flows. We still stick to that, of course. We have now a buffer of 7 billion in absolute terms above our 10% target.</p>
          <p>Now, a lot here is being discussed and I will just show on the next page a few of the things. The first is of course the trading book. The trading book so far is in line with our expectations. There is some worsening in the securitization side, but nothing is of course decided and of course we are talking not only us, with all the other banks are now talking to the regulators and showing the results of our impact study.</p>
          <p>I cannot say what the final outcome will be, but we are also preparing ourselves for reducing legacy assets so that we will again have a management response to whatever happens here. At the same time it is absolutely crucial that we have the same coordinated implementation on a global scale. It's impossible that for instance, the U.S. banks would not adopt the trading book &#x2013; the requirements and the Europeans would, I think that's fully understood by the Europeans politicians and regulators as well. This is irrespective of Basel II, nothing to do with Basel II, but just the same level playing field for the trading book treatment.</p>
          <p>On the Basel III, a lot is being discussed. You are familiar with that. We now have the impact studies on the corporate level. We're also doing on behalf of the IMF but others are doing the same impact study on a macro level to see what that means in terms of impact on the real economy or on different markets. We will have the study available probably beginning of March, we will clearly immediately provide that to the Basel committee and the regulators and we will see what kind of discussion. There are two issues. One is, how much, and the second is when? And so far, I would assume that we are very constructive on all sides in terms of how much, because everybody is aware of the implication on the real economy in a very fragile economic environment and secondly, everybody is aware of that we need a sufficient length of grandfathering to implement it. Some markets really foreshadow that of course as soon as the numbers are known.</p>
          <p>I am always asked about numbers, the number is irrelevant and the number is a result of all the others. The question is what kind of deduction? What kind of nature of capital? What kind of add-ons? What kind of capital buffers? They are more important than at the end whether it's 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or whatever percent, but having fully recognized that we need more capital in the system, I think we have done everything to adapt to that as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>
          <p>The other thing is "Living Wills" resolution regime; many points being discussed. I don't think that is imminent, but has to do with the corporate structure and of course it has to do with the reducing interconnectivity in the system. We are constructively and actively engaged in many of these dialogues and I don't think that would be a major impact on us going forward. It may be time consuming, it may be challenging, but I think we could deal with that.</p>
          <p>The taxation issue, based on what we know now, the U.K. tax is a one-off. We will have other tranche in the &#x2013; on the deferred payments. Based on the current proposal, most banks, especially the U.S. capped banks have not been allowed to do anything.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, IFRS gives us more flexibility so we have taken what we were allowed to take and I think that's &#x2013; it's a very good move. And if there is no law at the end, of course we get it back, but this is right now an unlikely scenario. The U.S. tax, different views on that. That would be especially in addition to the FDIC fees, something for their bailout and rescue packages and that would have an impact that would be longer-term.</p>
          <p>And of course, we would also hear or see how we can respond to some of these challenges. It would not be dramatic, but it would not be good. That's why we are &#x2013; the bank is more proposing some sort of a fund, maybe in the G20 or maybe on a European base, which gives clarity, because the cacophony of all these different measures now, scope of activities, taxation and many other things, is bad and this certainly doesn't increase the stability in our system. And I think everybody &#x2013; the political side, regulatory and practitioners are aware of that and are working on that and I must say, in a very constructive way. So much to the regulatory, the way we see it and again, the summary.</p>
          <p>So, I stop here and Stefan Krause will continue with more details.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, also good afternoon, good evening or good morning wherever you are. Ladies and gentlemen, obviously it's a much nicer pleasure this year to show these results as we had recession last year. I am sure you can all feel with us and I'm actually going to start with the same chart that Jo ended, basically summarizing it that we achieved more with less; more profits, lower leverage and that resulted in extremely good capital ratios that I don't think I need to repeat.</p>
          <p>If we go through the revenues, so the revenues were 28 billion for the year and 5.5 billion for the quarter. We had &#x2013; in the fourth quarter we had specific items. We had monoline provisions of 210 million which were additional monoline reserves we decided to take. We had a property impairment of 75 million on an impairment assessment we did on our Cosmos &#x2013; Cosmopolitan property and we had fair value losses on that which is always a small number for Deutsche Bank of only &#x20AC;29 million.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2009, the underlying revenues before markdowns are very close to the 2007 record levels. In the full year, we had 1.5 billion legacy impact driven by about &#x20AC;925 million of markdowns. Remember this was the number that last year was over 7 billion and we had this one total significant property impairment of 575 million over the year. That composes the number we show here on the slide. The decrease as of the third quarter was largely driven by a slowdown that we have reported of sales and trading revenues, which as you know affected all our major peers and which I will return in a moment.</p>
          <p>Provisions for credit losses increased slightly to &#x20AC;560 million in the fourth quarter. The impact from our IAS 39 reclassified assets was 311 million. 80%, by the way, of these IAS 39 provisions were driven by solely four names. And also partly driven by accelerating some of the restructuring exercises that we decided to do in the year '09 that were originally anticipated to be done and show their respective results in the year 2010. Our provisioning ratio for the IAS 39 portfolio is therefore around 360 basis points.</p>
          <p>Let's recap our Investor Day statements on IAS 39 reclassifications again. Over 1,000 assets are in this portfolio, of which only 30 are not performing. That's why we are not so concerned about the development and why it's so difficult to predict loan loss provisions on this portfolio because it's, one, it's relationship &#x2013; it's case-by-case driven. In the core portfolio, excluding IAS 39, loan loss provisions remained relatively modest; with provisioning ratio in Q4 actually was only 44 basis points. For the full year, provision for credit losses was &#x20AC;2.6 billion, therefore &#x20AC;1.3 billion related to our IAS 39 reclassified assets.</p>
          <p>In the PBC loan book, very little movement in delinquency rate as you can see here in the chart versus the third quarter. About 70% of our PBC loan book is mortgages where we saw some stabilization of delinquencies in the fourth quarter, including also, by the way, a first stabilization in Spain. Delinquencies in our small corporate book also appear to have stabilized, as you can see.</p>
          <p>In consumer finance, delinquency trends levels remain elevated. However, we did see first improvements in the third quarter. These improvements reflect targeted management efforts. For example, intensified collection efforts was done in Italy and the introduction of obviously stricter application rules in India that we implemented or started to implement at the end of 2008. This showed their results in the year 2009.</p>
          <p>In terms of the non-interest expenses, as I show here in the chart, we were at 4.2 billion for the fourth quarter 2009 and at 20.1 billion for the full year. Fourth-quarter comp expenses obviously decreased. As you know, we discussed and implemented our new comp plan for the years 2009. And then obviously subsequent took the decisions for the comp plan 2010 and subsequent, which I'll describe to you in a moment as we complied with G20 and obviously regulator requirements.</p>
          <p>We had step up positive true up effect for the first nine months of 400 million related to this compensation plan, which was then counterbalanced by severance payments of 154 million and the impact, as you know, that we have discussed and described of the U.K. payroll tax which happens in this line item of &#x20AC;225 million.</p>
          <p>Our full-year 2009 comp ratio is 40 versus 44 and 43, respectively in 2006 and 2007. But, and I think that's a fair comparison we should be doing, adjusting for the U.K. payroll tax and adjusting for the extraordinary severance that we had in the last year, a more even comparison shows that comp ratio at 37%.</p>
          <p>General and administrative expenses, we had non-recurrence of the <mark type="inaudible" /> charge in the third quarter. And fourth quarter savings offset this year's expenses with a &#x2013; in terms of our full-year general and administrative expenses, they include about 600 million of specific items, predominantly litigation or settlement expenses, versus approximately only 230 million we had in the year 2008. So, on an adjusted basis, on a comparative year-on-year basis, our general and administrative expenses are down by 4%.</p>
          <p>Other non-comp expenses benefited obviously in the first quarter from the Scudder intangible write back of 291 million that I am already alluding to. This position also obviously includes always the policy holder benefits and claims from our Abbey business of over 150 million that, as you know, is an offset to revenues.</p>
          <p>Move on now to our compensation plan. Here we show the main structure is approximately 2 billion of compensation-related expenses was deferred and approximately 30 million of shares will be granted in February 2010. We have complied with all the requirements as you see in our key features. We have deferred compensation as required. We have done the changes I think Jo alluded to these components. And obviously we have a very extensive clawback option that was important for us as well.</p>
          <p>Our income before income taxes was 756 million in the fourth quarter and 5.2 billion for the year. Pre-tax return on equity for the full year per target definition on our reported basis was 15% and that despite a rise in average equity of 2.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Our net income of 1.3 billion reflects a tax benefit of 790 million that relates to recognition of deferred taxes in the U.S., which obviously reflected the improved income projections which are based on the extremely strong performance we showed in the year '09 in the United States. So compensating with obviously the usual tax rates, the tax credit of 554 million in the fourth quarter was recorded.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2009, we have therefore an ETR of only 5%. And I will remind you also that next to obviously the effect we had in the fourth quarter, we had a third quarter effect that was quite significant as well. We had a positive outcome of tax audit settlements, which was partly offset by at that time some revaluation of deferred tax positions, which resulted in a net benefit of 369 million in that quarter. So that's why our overall tax rate obviously for the year resulted as low as it is. Our mid-term guidance looking at our tax planning for our ETR remains unchanged between 30 to 35%.</p>
          <p>Our Tier 1 ratio, as Jo said, was 12.6% and actually, that's an all time record since the introduction of the Basel standards for the bank. We also recorded our best ever core Tier 1 ratio, which excludes the hybrids, which has improved to 8.7%.</p>
          <p>Tier 1 capital at year-end was at 34.4 billion. Since the beginning therefore of 2008, that means over eight quarters, total Tier 1 capital has risen by 6.1 billion. At &#x2013; for the 31st of December of 2009, we have a capital base in excess as Jo already mentioned of 7 billion to our target of 10% Tier 1 ratio.</p>
          <p>And during the quarter, we continued also to reduce our risk-weighted assets to the number shown here in the chart of &#x20AC;273 billion, which was mainly driven by lower market risk, risk-weighted assets through a lower regulatory capital. Our VaR multiplier was reduced and as you saw in some of the numbers we've presented, a reduced value at risk. Further risk reductions that outweighted FX headwinds contributed to about 3 billion. Versus end of the first quarter of 2009, risk-weighted assets have been therefore reduced by, I think, the impressive amount of 43 billion.</p>
          <p>Dividend, as Jo said, is at &#x20AC;0.75, which costs us about approximately 50 basis points in our Tier 1 ratio. Jo has alluded to potential capital demand from ongoing regulatory discussions I know that's a matter of core interest but I will not repeat the statement. We would as you know, anticipate to close two acquisitions relatively early in 2010: Sal. Oppenheim, which we expect to be an impact of about 85 basis points assuming that we do a contribution in-kind capital increase, which is still in debate; and our acquisition of ABN AMRO, which is now expected to close actually on the 1st of April. Obviously, both of the transactions will increase our risk-weighted assets.</p>
          <p>On the next page, we show our success in leverage reduction. According to our target level definition, our leverage for the 31st of December is at 23 times, below our target of 25 times. In the fourth quarter, total assets decreased due to the lower positive market values from derivatives.</p>
          <p>On the IFRS basis, we are down 10% in the quarter and we are down 32% versus previous year end. And on a U.S. GAAP basis we are down 3% in the quarter and we are down 13% over 12 months. Obviously, and I always make this cautionary statement, FX rate movements help us; the weakness of the dollar did help us in terms of achieving this level &#x2013; below our target level. Obviously, as the U.S. dollar strengthens again, we will see counter effects affecting our leverage ratio.</p>
          <p>Let me now go into the segment results very quickly. Obviously, a topic that we see out of your reports and concerns that because you see our revenues decline, predominantly driven by sales and trading, whilst here at CB&amp;S, if you look at the P&amp;L again, we have a positive impact from the expenses. But let's not forget that this is obviously the segment that carries the largest part of the U.K. payroll tax of 225 million, which is booked in CB&amp;S.</p>
          <p>Let me therefore go into the sales and trading numbers. Sales and trading revenues for the full year were at 12.5 billion. Adjusted for markdowns, this year's performance is one of the three best-ever performances the Bank has had in its history.</p>
          <p>The fourth quarter included the already-mentioned markdowns of 0.2 billion that I referred to at the beginning. In the fourth quarter, Jo mentioned that we saw a significant drop in client activity from mid-November. Phone calls to clients showed us that everybody was protecting the good results in the year 2009, the willingness to take further risk was very low and margins, the same in the fourth quarter, continued to normalize and started to come down. But, therefore we also saw much lower volatility. That this was not a trend, that this was really a reaction to risk aversion towards the year end, as Jo has alluded to, we have seen at the beginning of this year.</p>
          <p>In 2009, our business model has been successfully recalibrated as we promised to you, that the highly-structured instruments have been significantly reduced and revenues are now predominantly flow-driven, considerably less prop trading. As we said, we closed credit prop trading. On equity prop, we reduced notional capital by 90%. 5% of sales and trading revenues, which means less than 2% of Group revenues are prop trading. We have, by the way, also to that further discussion I'll mention later on we have no in-house hedge fund or private equity businesses. Thus, we expect minimal impact from the Group &#x2013; on Group revenues on the Volcker proposals and we're therefore, I must honestly say, surprised by some of your EPS potential dilution that we observed in the market regarding this proposal. We are totally confident that we can completely <mark type="inaudible" /> diminishing group revenues with other client revenues, because as I told you, they are not material.</p>
          <p>Performance in January, as I said, has picked up significantly. We see very strong January revenues, while revenues in our Global Finance and FX business have continued to be very healthy, but have come down versus last year, as expected. Our activity in credit trading and equity derivatives has been extremely strong in the business mix and therefore obviously our business mix has improved. But again, caution, we cannot derive this quarter, so even the year's performance just from one month's trend.</p>
          <p>If we go to the topic of sales and trading debt and other products, we just &#x2013; let me do two quick statements on our monolines, we strengthened reserves of Tier 2 monolines at year-end adjusted to make sure that we are protected. As you know, we use a different system. We have the system audited again by the BaFin. We had discussions with the BaFin. And I think we reached an agreement that our reserve positions are satisfactory. As a result, total remaining exposure on all non-investment-grade monolines has come down by approximately a third versus the 30th of September 2009, to about 1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>I show here on the chart the key features on our sales and trading debt and other positions. I'm sure we'll be able to discuss some of the business development here. We will show you and we could show based on the disclosed numbers that actually our decrease in sales and trading in the fourth quarter was significantly lower than some of our competitors was. Even if you are &#x2013; do some cleanups for some third-quarter special effects Deutsche Bank had, we still have had a much lower decrease in this quarter than most of our competitors.</p>
          <p>Sales and trading equity, definitely a success story for the Bank. Also in the fourth quarter, we also saw the slowdown. For the year, we have had significant double-digit increase in this business and again, what is really positive is that we have gone away from prop trading in this business and are showing substantial increase in client activity. Certainly, one of the areas in our business where the crisis has helped us to gain market position.</p>
          <p>On Origination Advisory, the Origination revenues were 379 million for the quarter. Advisory revenues were at 105 million. In the fourth quarter of 2008, Origination included write-backs of 757 million relating to Huntsman and BCE deals, which were cancelled or left at a point.</p>
          <p>Overall, we've narrowed the gap to the top five positions versus previous year, so despite the fact of having depressed fee pools here, we are gaining market share and we are able to stabilize or improve our competitive positions. We, by the way for 2010, do not expect M&amp;A activity to soar as obviously some uncertainty remains about economic development. However, we believe that the needs of recapitalization, both in industrials and in banking will certainly help us to drive Origination volumes up and our pipeline in ECM continues to be very, very strong.</p>
          <p>On the Global Transaction Bank, I think Jo has talked about the performance that we had saw a decrease, driven by lower risk-based funding credit. I have to mention here that obviously this is the business that has been most positively impacted by the change in our funding. The pace in our funding was &#x2013; had a benefit of about 160 million. Still we see a very good return on equity, 60% return on equity for the quarter obviously justifies our continued investment in our GTB franchise.</p>
          <p>If I go to the next page, at the beginning of 2010, we expect obviously further pressure on GTB and that's a note of caution to you who make your assets on a year-on-year comparison sending from the interest rate environment, because on a year-on-year comparison, as we saw the year 2009 come, lower interest had impacted stronger the second half of the year than it did the first half of year. We are now in the same interest rate environment in the first half of the year that we were in the second half of year last year just to take that into account when you look into your estimates.</p>
          <p>On Asset and Wealth Management, we had a net benefit of 232 million from specific items. I've already talked to you about the intangible write-back on Scudder, which is &#x20AC;291 million, which is related to the fact that we had a value &#x2013; market value increase in our portfolios there. We have some specific charters here. Of course, all of the charters associated with the acquisition of Sal. Oppenheim will be charged and have been charged to this &#x2013; to Asset and Wealth Management P&amp;L and as well we've had some substantial severance as we have reacted to the lowering of market volumes also in restructuring this business.</p>
          <p>Asset Management, adjusted for specific items, Asset Management delivered approximately 190 million in pre-tax profit for the second half of the year, driven by performance fees. An interesting observation, we really were able to realize performance fees in the three of our stable businesses that can get them. Our cost structure has been here very significantly adapted to the new environment. There's been a lot of work done. And we are very confident to benefit from this operating leverage we have created as we move on. Jo already said &#x2013; described some of the savings in previous speeches of 350 million that we have had that will obviously benefit us already in the year 2010.</p>
          <p>We have therefore a much healthier level of underlying performance. We have also discontinued some or reduced some non-profitable business.</p>
          <p>Net new money was nine billion for the quarter and the year. So we have clearly seen here also a turnaround after the outflows at the beginning of the year. Outflows were recorded though predominantly in low-margin products such as money market funds, while inflows could largely be seen into high-margin products, which is also promising for the future development of this business. By the way, also here, inflows in January confirm the positive trend.</p>
          <p>PWM digested about 55 million in severance as a result of efficiency measures during 2009. Run-rate savings will be approximately 40 million for 2010, of which a portion already has been realized in 2009. The first quarter performance was slightly impacted by the seven million I've described already of the Sal. Oppenheim related costs that get assessed to PWM.</p>
          <p>In the &#x2013; our PBC business, while in the revenues we saw quite an interesting and differing development. While credit products interesting enough throughout the crisis have continued to deliver very strong results helping us also to cover our fixed expenses, customer activity in our investment products did remain somewhat subdued. However, also here we have seen a change in the first quarter of 2010. We have seen a pretty strong product pipeline. The fourth quarter included one-off gains from a deferred dividend at Deutsche <mark type="inaudible" /> of about 97 million.</p>
          <p>Adjusted for first quarter 2009 provision for credit loss release, provisions had favorable developed and stabilized during the year as I showed you on the delinquency charts. PBC, our profit here was impacted by 250 million of direct and infrastructure severance payments that obviously will not reoccur in 2010, and that hopefully will yield the benefits already in this year.</p>
          <p>Here if I show you Private and Business Clients, we show the income before income taxes and I show this severance number in the quarter and if you add up the light bars you will have it for the year.</p>
          <p>Here we show the net, PCAM net money flows by quarter. As we show here, in the fourth quarter we had a nine billion net money inflows. So as you see, driven by market value deterioration in the mid of the chart here as shown towards the fourth quarter of 2008 you see now a recovery not only for market that is, but also because we're able to acquire additional customers.</p>
          <p>So, let me sum up with this last chart that you by now should be very familiar with. You've seen it a couple of times. Deutsche Bank is a very different bank compared to 12 months ago. Again, I think we're very proud that we increased our profitability, we reduced risk and leverage, we improved significantly our capital base and cash now, we can only say, I don't get tired to say, we do have now a significant capital buffer to prepare for some of the challenges ahead. Our recommended dividend increase should show on the one hand, some status of confidence, but on the other hand, we have to take into account that capital is the priority.</p>
          <p>So, thank you very much for your attention. And I think we welcome now your questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />, Thank you very much. I am Peter <mark type="inaudible" /> from <mark type="inaudible" /> Research. I have three small questions. I was surprised regarding the low dividend you're willing to pay or you propose and the public was more &#x2013; the arguments that you fear some regulatory changes and you have to increase your capital ratios. The recent U.K. fear, of that the regulators are not pleased with bonus payments and dividend payments when you shall increase your capital, I can understand well.</p>
          <p>My first question is what I can't really understand why you decided for a satisfying bonus for your staff and yet not for a satisfying dividend for your shareholders and especially that what I think the regulators will not love &#x2013; you decided to pay the U.K. payroll tax for your bankers <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
          <p>And second question is regarding your Tier 1 figure, your target, you gave to us is 10%, you're now well above &#x2013; you need some capital for the acquisitions you have done. And you told us in the past that you'll need more capital if you want to make a bigger acquisition, so if right now is that higher capital for a bigger acquisition and/or you are really afraid for the regulatory requirements coming in the next years? Then I think you have to increase your Tier 1 target, if 10% is not enough. Or, third alternative, it's a lot of fantasy in the coming years for higher dividends and share buyback programs for your investors. So, what alternative is closest to your strategy there on the high Tier 1 ratio?</p>
          <p>And last question is I missed an outlook for your net income in 2010. I did understand that you did not want to give one last year, but I don't understand it for the current year and therefore my concrete question is do you think you can exceed the five billion net income from last year in the current year and maybe you can give an explanation why? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. A lot of questions, all around the sector uncertainty. I don't know more than, or not much more than you do probably. I'm just saying, we wanted to optimize between shareholders, people and regulators and that is the best optimization we could find. Now you can go further in one or the other. Maybe we're too modest on the dividend side because capital will not be increased as much as we think capital requirements, or we may have been too generous in the bonus tax in the U.K. I'm saying we're in a competitive environment.</p>
          <p>What we did is &#x2013; now you can play around with the bonus tax first. I don't think many banks are doing that and everything we hear and a lot of benchmarking and talked to a lot of people is they are all doing it same way as we do. Of course, you could have said Alistair Darling told me very clearly pay no bonus, no tax. Well, to be honest, I think it's not in the interest of shareholders that our franchise is being destroyed in the U.K. Now would it be the impact, I don't want to run the risk. So we felt we have to do something to keep the franchise intact and that is another optimization. We've lowered the bonus pool somewhat but not as much as &#x2013; to zero. So we do have to pay payroll taxes then.</p>
          <p>And in addition, we socialized it; it cannot all go to the U.K. employees. Secondly, those who are saying we are lowering the U.K. alone and then going around and saying, forget it, in a year from now we'll care of you, it's not the way we run our business. We are straightforward, honest to you and to our people.</p>
          <p>And to be honest, we couldn't pay no bonus without jeopardizing the franchise and I think no one else can do that. If you do that, then the question is does it all go to the shareholders and it should not, the answer is no. Should it all go to the U.K. employees? The answer in my view is no. We are one bank, one team. So we said it's a burden sharing between shareholders and people and it's a burden sharing on a global scale. That is the way we did it and I would be surprised if not every major bank is doing it the same way, by the way.</p>
          <p>The dividend, it is not that important from a capital point of view. I mean the 50% more costs us about 160 million capital. It is more to signaling theory. If you say we can pay that much more, you may provoke a regulatory response which you don't like and not only for us but for the industry. It was absolutely clear that regulators, central bank <mark type="inaudible" /> from Axel Weber to Trichet, to <mark type="inaudible" />, to many others, they don't want us to pay now high dividends this year. You can say who cares. You are accountable to the owners and not to the regulators, that's why we did something and we understood that message.</p>
          <p>But going much further than that in my view would have been very negative and we are in a very sensitive situation right now. I mean if I say we is not Deutsche Bank, it's all of us around the table. That's why we felt you have to find the right optimum. By the way, I just got the first media reports from very critical journalists in the U.K. who said, okay, you're right. They pulled it off again. So a little bit dividend, little bit bonus, a little bit tax, and a little bit capital. So that's the optimization that we are in. Is that something for the future? No, probably not.</p>
          <p>As soon as we know and have clarity about the capital impact, we will know what it means and if you know, and I don't think that the bonus tax will be repeated. So, in that sense, we will come back to a dividend policy which pleases our shareholders, as we always stated. You remember, I always said that with the payout ratio being increased every year and we went up to 4.50, which was I think about 40% or so or close to 40% and now we are back to below 10. That is not something we want to do, that's something which we found wise to do in the current regulatory climate. That's why we did it and I don't think we have any other chance.</p>
          <p>Now the 10% &#x2013; we said 10%, 10% is a high number, you heard other bankers are saying 8%, 6%, the whole question in my view is irrelevant because it depends so much how you define risk-weighted assets and how you define capital. You have read, I know many of you have done these reports, every country has a specific item. U.K. gets very nervous about pension liabilities and the U.K. banks, French banks are getting more nervous on minorities, some others more on DPAs and let's see what the impact will be and the global solution. But I think, though, as we always do, to be a little bit ahead of the pack in doing as we think is sufficient is the right thing to do. If you are too far, then we will correct it. But if you are not far enough, we will have to go further and it will be over time, but it is always our strategy to meet the requirements not at the end of phasing in, but relatively fast. So that is the best we can do on the knowledge we have.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's obviously a good question. Well, we have never given forward-looking statements on that. We said that we started January very well and let's see how we see a lot of good things happening in our industry. We also see the risks, I mean sovereign risk, asset inflation, the carry trades, which couldn't be unwound, the default rates going up, many other things. So we are aware of that. Do we think that we have a specific problem to one item? No. But do we think that the cumulative effect of all of that could be challenging? The answer is absolutely yes, as for everyone else. But we have de-risked so much and learned the lesson that I think we are much better off now than we were three years ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're welcome. I think you had a question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ahmed at Cheuvreux. I have one follow-up question on capital and another one on your comp ratio. I mean, it's &#x2013; as you already said, I mean it's pretty impossible to determine what the adequate capital level will be, but where you are at the moment? How do you think about deploying or redeploying capital out of earnings that you gain now in January, February, March going into the second quarter? Do you actually have some scope for &#x2013; do you feel comfortable enough to redeploy some capital into your business, also with a view to your signaling comfortable leverage ratio now?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on comp ratio. How much scope do you see for &#x2013; in an environment where revenues for an investment bank might be structurally under pressure to structurally decrease comp ratios? I know this discussion about, you have to retain talent, but do you think there's a chance also from corporate governance pressure increasing to structurally drive down comp ratios for your business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> I'll take the second. I asked in Davos, we had a small session behind closed doors, I asked the following question. If we meet again in three years from now, we would think now which of the three scenarios you think is the most likely one? First one, we do nothing in terms of compensation. I'm not talking about the structure we all comply with the structure, I'm talking about quantum. We do nothing and in three years from now we are all back to normal and the economy is fine again and everybody is happy to pay high bonuses.</p>
          <p>Second one, we do something proactively to change it. And the third one, we do nothing, but there will be a regulatory political backlash indirectly via more capital, more taxation or directly in terms of influencing the compensation level. The majority of that group of my &#x2013; our peers felt that scenario three is the most likely one. I then said if this is the case, we better do something in scenario two and we initiated now on behalf of the IEF a working group which talks about that.</p>
          <p>Now, this is easier said than done but my view is the more we see capital, the more we see incremental taxation, the more likely and the more necessary it is, also for the benefit of shareholders that we do something on the compensation level. So, I cannot imagine that we pay the same compensation level going forward if the other things are changing so drastically as I expect them. And that is something we have to &#x2013; in the sense of self-regulation, start working on it, and there is, I have to say, broad support for that among the key banks in the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the redeploying capital to our business, we are and we will continue to deploy capital to our business, but under the new paradigm, which means much less risk and obviously better discipline in not allowing balance sheets to grow up too much. We have supported acquisitions in the PICM world, as you know, we would have supported also an acquisition for the investment bank as well, so we are willing to grow our business. I think the Bank is back to growth mode, but again what we have learnt that our old business model is not the one that should reoccur. We do it with tighter discipline, a focus on return on these assets, a focus on return on this capital deployed and we will have our business divisions competing for capital in terms of their returns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I have to make one point very clear because some may say this is a different story than we heard before, because I always said no acquisition in investment banking, which we don't need. Now, what Stefan Krause is alluding to are very specific, I mean like the commodity and all the newspapers, something and very specific bolt-on small acquisition somewhere to complement our activities in investment, but not an investment bank in anyway, that we don't need, definitely.</p>

          <p>Philipp Zieschang from UBS. Three questions, please. The first one is when can we expect more news with respect to your one billion in infrastructure savings and what charges should we expect in order to realize these? The second one is coming back a bit on the comp ratios, you've mentioned that it's &#x2013; underlying, it's 37% this year. Could you comment whether you think this is the new base and could you also share your view about the comp to &#x2013; and non-comp ratios within your 65% target for next year? And thirdly, there is concern about the market with respect to the capitalization of your U.S. holding company. Obviously, you've activated additional deferred tax assets which could have driven the negative Tier 1 ratio up even further. Could you share in which way you are under pressure and probably bridge the gap between what you say is a solid capitalization of your operating entities versus the negative one on the holding? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start on the first, on the first billion of efficiency gains that we want to show. We have &#x2013; we will be ready to announce it and we are willing to do a separate session on that. As you know, we have hired McKinsey, who has expansive experience in terms of this cost-cutting exercise. They will use the same process and approach that they've used at other large tax companies, one of them I am familiar with, obviously. We've also hired a person that's going to be in the lead, I am sure you read in the newspapers, he comes with a vast experience in these type of cost reductions. The team is already working on it. We have formulated already a substantial amount of measures. Once we're complete, I commit to you that we will give you some more details on the program and on the achievement of the program. Just give us a little bit of time to finalize that.</p>
          <p>Our comp ratio, 37%, is that the new base? We definitely believe here that based on this structure, based on the changes and based on the structure of our new compensation system, the answer is yes, that that's the direction I think comp is going. But, also a caveat is, we have to observe the competitive environment. We cannot put our franchise at risk and therefore, I think that's nothing we can commit to in an empty-room type commitment. We have to see how the development is and see what happens to that.</p>
          <p>The U.S., our Taunus subsidiary in the U.S., correctly, it is in a situation that it would need under subsidiarization requirements to be to show capital. We have alerted all of you that at the end, it's a reallocation of capital that we would have to do intra-Group. It's not an additional capital we need on a Group to be very specific. Are there some, let's say, inefficiencies, because obviously currently, we see our capital, our allocation to be optimal? Yes, of course.</p>
          <p>There might be some inefficiencies, but I think we can manage them not to be significant or material as far as we see. Let's not forget that despite the fact that revenue, tax revenue is very controlled and you need to show profits in the right geographic locations, you don't necessarily need to show assets in the right locations. So, there is some flexibility in managing that, as well. We understand we will have some time to adjust and adopt, we have already started the brain work on how we can deal with that in the United States, if it were to come &#x2013; to come true. It doesn't really change significantly anything in terms of <mark type="inaudible" />. Actually, what it does is it would hedge our capital a little bit better because we would have more U.S. dollar capital associated to our U.S.-based assets which in itself, obviously, would then reduce some of the volatilities we have to report on some of the ratios to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess on the compensation most important question will be, do people really understand that now increasing the fixed part means that this will be compensated by reducing the variable part? And we said that over and over in our internal messages, not that someone thinks, well, it's fine, I have 10%, 20% more now and I am expecting the same bonus, I mean, based on the same performance in a year from now. That is not the case. The total compensation based on same performance has to be the same. There's just a shift between fixed and variable.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> to give you, sorry, I have to speak through the microphone, that I will give you some more details, soon. We hired McKinsey again, we hired a responsible for it and I think in a few weeks, we will be able to describe exactly our path to the 1 billion.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> Capital Markets. Two questions, please. The first would be on the debt sales and trading. You said Mr. Krause, in the November conference call that the margins in debt sales and trading are 10 to 60% above the pre-crisis levels and that you expected them to stay there. Nevertheless, I read a lot about lower margins and margin declines in your Q4 release, so can you update us on the situation there, and whether you still believe that the margins will stay at the higher level.</p>
          <p>The second question would be on the intangibles relating to Scudder, which you're writing back. I was a bit surprised to see that because Scudder never approached me as a very successful acquisition for you and I think the numbers in 2009 don't really give me lot of sense that Scudder turned around in 2009. So, why did you write back the intangibles? Maybe you can explain what the numbers behind that is and how Scudder performed in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me talk about the margin evolution. What to &#x2013; just to harmonize these two statements we have done. Throughout the year 2009, we have &#x2013; at the beginning we saw increasing, incredibly high margins. Sometimes 100% than they were before, sometimes even more than they were. Throughout the year 2009, these margins have come down and that's what we have reported. Nevertheless, they did stay above pre-crisis levels and nevertheless, we believe that they will stay above pre-crisis levels. Why do we believe that? It's obviously much more consciousness about balance sheet, much more consciousness at our &#x2013; in the entire competitive environment. There's much more pressure on capital, there is much more pressure on correctly risk pricing. So therefore, at the end, you could say there is less competitors out there as well. So, that's why we believe that if they are coming down and if they have come down throughout the year 2009, the level at which they will come down and level to will be still better than in the pre-crisis years.</p>
          <p>On the Scudder intangible write-backs, all I can say, it's accounting some part of it. We look at &#x2013; we have impaired this asset, as you know, in the year before by a larger amount than the amounts we recover &#x2013; recovered in the year 2009. And I think, this kind of volatility, obviously, this volatility you see related on the fact that we mark to market and what has occurred here is you saw the value of these funds increased and therefore, the value of these intangibles increased. We've, as I told you, this business we've really looked at, we've restructured, we have adjusted the cost base. I must really say, in asset management, there was a lot done to improve the situation and therefore obviously, our tests showed that we can write back to that.</p>

          <p>Stefan Scharff at SRC Research. I have two questions. The first question is about the loan book. You shrunk the loan book about &#x20AC;10 billion last year and there is still PBC mortgages of about 25% of it and there is German SME business about 20% of it. Can you give us a little bit more detail about the development of your loan book as we have seen interest income come down 14% after loan loss provisions in 2009 if you want to build up the loan book again or it will be on this level also in 2010? And the second question is about Hugo B&#xE4;nziger, he is not here today, your Chief Risk Manager. I miss him because he was here the last years, is there a special reason, or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Actually, I'd say your last question was quite interesting question to ask. We looked into the records of the Bank and usually, this is a meeting hold by CEO and CFO traditionally. He wants to come back to that tradition and on specific topics we invited them, our other partners from the Board to be here and assist us here. Obviously, last year, the big topic was risk and that was what we were expecting lots of questions from you and obviously we didn't expect this to be the big issue anymore after &#x2013; also, our good results in the fourth quarter. I think we are looking forward. I think most of the risks are behind us and therefore, we just thought that Hugo's time is better invested in continuing to monitor our risks in the Bank and actively working on it.</p>
          <p>The second question that you asked is on the loan book. Well, we have seen a slowdown on the loan book, but it was not in &#x2013; especially, I will say, not in our German lending which has &#x2013; we have increased since the beginning of the crisis and which has remained very stable throughout the year of 2009. So, our loan book obviously has components in there that relates, for example, to our reclassified assets that relate to other portfolios, and those portfolios partially also &#x2013; in these numbers we are partially &#x2013; obviously, portfolios that we have reduced in the effort to leverage the Bank.</p>
          <p>We have shown you the decomposition of the loan book on that I think by now, some famous charts that shows you the different bucket and what we've said has happened is that obviously, as we have de-risked the Bank, those loans, we have been able either to restructure or to sell or reduce accordingly. So actually, nothing really exciting happening in the loan book. We will continue, as Jo said, to invest. We will continue to keep our loans up. Our loan activity in Germany continues to support the Mittelstand. We have additionally announced an additional measure to support the Mittelstand in Germany. And again, we can say we will take any good credit.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Matt Clark, KBW. A couple of questions, please. Firstly, on the compensation in the fourth quarter, it looks like you have been deferring more than you would have previously under the old regime. What sort of benefit did that give to the fourth-quarter compensation figure? And was it more than the burden of the U.K. tax provision? Second question, you mentioned commodities performed well. Could you just comment whether this is now &#x2013; what the order of magnitude is? Is this now a billion dollar business for you in revenue terms? And then thirdly, on the Cosmopolitan Resort, can you give us a carrying value for your investment and also tell us what that kind of carrying value is compared to your cumulative investment? So, an idea of the valuation of that holding? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll start with your comp question. The question is whether we are deferring more. Yes, basically, <mark type="inaudible" /> the new structure of our compensation system. We needed to bring it in compliance and the compliance assumes that we have to defer, <mark type="inaudible" /> without disclosing obviously any details about our compensation numbers. I hope for your understanding because this is sensitive competitive information.</p>
          <p>The Cosmo, let me talk about the Cosmo &#x2013; before I answer your commodities question, the project Cosmo is continuing to develop very well. The Cosmo project, it's on time, on budget as we speak. We actually, and this project has benefited from the crisis because construction materials and construction costs has assumed we could re-bid all our vendor contracts and had some substantial savings that helped us to avoid what usually happens in these multi-billion projects that you have large cost overruns. So we are very confident that we will not have the cost overrun on this project as it's basically also completed to a large extent.</p>
          <p>In the impairment analysis, we did twice in the year 2009, at the beginning and at the end. Obviously, the weakening of the economy has had its impact in Las Vegas, interesting enough, not in terms of hotel occupancy rates, but in terms of average room prices, which led to the <mark type="inaudible" /> impairment. We did one at the beginning of the first quarter and the second, at the beginning &#x2013; at the end of Q4 for a minor amount. We therefore believe that this asset is now very well valued and fairly valued within our book and has a lot of upside potential, let's not forget. This is for a period of time will be the last new hotel/casino/resort for a while in Las Vegas and I'm sure you're all familiar with the dynamics in Las Vegas that the last and newest ones is the one that always will have the most guests coming.</p>
          <p>Commodities revenues, it's one of the areas in the restructuring that we &#x2013; in the change of our investment bank that we've been looking at. Our original targets <mark type="inaudible" /> were organic growth, yeah. As Jo said, eventually, bolt-on acquisitions in case the right opportunity shows up, but again we stick to our plan based on organic growth and the revenues were, I would say so much above 500 million and therefore &#x2013; in 2009 &#x2013; and we expect to grow that as we move on.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good. Can I just follow up? When you say above 500 million, is that dollars or euros? And then secondly, are you able to give a figure for the Cosmo carrying value, I mean ballparked? It doesn't need to be to the nearest million?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. First of all, could you put into context very well beginning with last year's very good start in sales and trading revenues, is it for example in the plus/minus 10% range Anshu Jain indicated as its target for 2009? The second question is, when looking at new money in the Asset and Wealth Management business, I was quite surprised that mostly all of it came from the U.S. What is the reason for this, or are these only some larger names? And the third question I have is on the cost development in the Asset and Wealth Management division, where there is a sharp increase from Q3 to Q4. Could you elaborate a little bit on this, the sharp increase after adjusting for this goodwill?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. Your first question is from Derek De Vries, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Derek from Bank of America. I have two questions. First, Mr. Ackermann kicked off by saying if you take the pre-tax profit there of about 3.5 billion, maybe there's exceptionals in there, I was hoping you could give us some more detail on that so we can understand how you get to an underlying pre-tax of 8.7 billion for the year?</p>
          <p>And second, I was wondering if you could provide some details on the stable funding ratio proposed by Basel III, just ballpark understanding. It's a consultation paper and there is going to be a quantitative impact study and all those other caveats you like to throw back at us. Just ballpark, where are you on stable funding ratio, and if it's below the 100%, just any sense as to &#x2013; as you start to manage to a stable funding ratio, if you think it has any impact on profitability or if you're kind of there or thereabouts? Those are my two questions. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me start with the first one. We had positive one-offs of about 1.6 billion that impacted our profit favorable that we counted in this number and then we had total negative impacts of about 5 billion that countered this number. I think we've mentioned some of them. We talked just about the Cosmo impairment. We had, obviously, based on some legacy assets, some charge-offs like &#x2013; you heard about <mark type="inaudible" />. We talked about the fair value gains, which are limited though. We had the Huntsman settlement in the year, we have the U.K. payroll tax as non-recurring item. We have severance costs as non-recurring items.</p>
          <p>On the positive ones obviously, we had the MTM's relating to Postbank. We had the Scudder intangible and obviously we had some in relation to our REU program, some hedging gains. That give you about the number of ex-ex that's between the positive which are one-offs that increased our profit by 1.5 to 1.6 billion and then the negatives that are one-off that we don't see reoccurring to swing that &#x2013; so the 3.5 billion net that it gives you on &#x2013; a good view on how the true underlying profitability over the year was and it also gives us the confidence towards our 10 billion target for the businesses that that can be achieved.</p>
          <p>Let's not forget that rightfully so, you will say that we had higher margins in the investment bank and they will come down, on the one hand. But we still have depressed volumes across some of the areas of our investment bank and on the other hand, let's not forget that all our stable businesses hedged to battle the storm in '09. So if we assume recovery there, I think it's very plausible why we do believe in the 10 billion number.</p>
          <p>And again on the stable funding ratio, again, I can only say what you already took ahead as &#x2013; with the rules are, the proposal are preliminary and are not final yet and therefore, any impact of this number is difficult for us to make. Let me also say that we strongly believe that we continue to have the best liquidity management and funding in place and that was certainly one of the backbones and strengths to helping Deutsche Bank survive in the crisis, so we are not concerned. But I have to pass on, we have not done calculations as this is not final.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just one word, I mean, it goes without saying, but the 3.5 billion are of course non-bonus corrected. Maybe there will be something else in addition.</p>

        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, two questions. The first, I think the increase in dividend signals that you don't have any intention to accelerate the Deutsche Postbank deal which some people thought you might do. Could you just give your perspectives on when is the appropriate time for that and do you obviously &#x2013; and you can take advantage of maybe the changes in the German market? And then secondly, at Davos, Mr. Ackermann was talking about the economic impact of reforms. Which the three of four current proposals, which do you think most damage economic reform and therefore are highly likely to be watered down in any consultation process? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the first one I think we said many, many times that we are in no hurry, that we keep the strategic optionality which we have and that it is in the interest of shareholders to wait and do the necessary streamlining, restructuring before we move and nothing has changed in that. I mean, the same to some extent in the <mark type="inaudible" /> case, I just would like to say we have every interest &#x2013; if you do a somewhat linear calculation on what certain acquisitions mean for capital, you always should ask yourself what might be the management response? Would they keep everything in place? Would they reduce certain assets? Would they reduce loan books? Would they sell loan books or other businesses? So in that sense, we want to work on that so that the impact for the shareholder is the best possible one and I think that is in -hopefully, in very politically correct terms, what we are going to do.</p>
          <p>In terms of economic reform, well the biggest problem would of course be absolute uncertainty about further initiatives. So, if you have taxation, special regulatory changes in one country or in another country, that could add up to a cumulative impact which is very negative. I think the -secondly, but that's more a hypothesis we are working on with other banks, including, I think, your bank. What does the trading book treatment mean for the securitization market? If you have more skin in the game and if you have more capital to allocate to securitization activities, does that impair this badly-needed revival of the securitization market? And that would be, from an economic point of view, the biggest &#x2013; the biggest concern. Of course, the third one is a more obvious one, namely the capital requirements which could put a lot of additional credit costs and would make it more difficult to finance the global economy. But the first two, in my view, are the most urgent ones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The first one is on the option to pay for Sal. Oppenheim and the new shares. Now that I look at your Tier 1 ratio, which is well above your minimum, is there the option not to basically have any new shares issued? And the second question is you as the Chairman of the IIF, how do you &#x2013; what was really the three key points that came out of Davos, and where do we see a consensus building in terms of the way that banks want to go forward and what are the next trigger points where we see banks finding a way to respond to what the regulator is asking for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start with the second one. We will respond anyhow to the reforms because otherwise we're out of business. So, that's another thing we don't have a lot of flexibility .</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, I know what you mean. Well, I think first of all, the spirit is very constructive, the first thing. We first knew, you know, before we had a lot of dialogue and debates via the media and lot of misunderstandings. So in that sense, I think everybody understands that things are still pretty fragile and that we should not overdo it.</p>
          <p>Secondly, there is a clear understanding that there are two issues, which I just alluded to; the securitization and of course, the lending market, which have a particularly important element in it for the real economy. The &#x2013; in terms of subsidiarization and resolution "Living Wills", I think people feel that we are still pretty far away from a response to that &#x2013; even a solution to that. The key is absolute compensation and two things are expected from us: That we come up with some self-regulation in compensation and the second one is that we come up with some creative ideas on the liabilities side in terms of the resolution regime including some contingent capital issues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you just allude a little bit on the compensation side? Did it go further than what has been announced by FSA and some other regulators?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, so far, nothing has been announced. I mean we are &#x2013; the big misunderstanding is that people are talking about structural changes but the cap rate driver is not interested whether you get a million which is deferred or whether there's a potential clawback in the next three or four years in case your company makes a loss. What they want to hear is the quantum, and the quantum is absolutely open. It's full competition, to some extent, rightly so.</p>
          <p>But the question is are we provoking a regulatory or legal backlash if you don't move on that front and I would say most of the banks being present in &#x2013; not all of them were actively involved but those who were actively involved felt that we should be aware of that regulatory or legal risk and we should start thinking about some sort of moderation or some sort of restraint. Now, how that will work? It's very difficult to say. I mean, easy answer is let's have a cap. Now, a cap is a bit too simple, probably. Others are saying let's have a payout ratio but, to be honest, if you have a bad year, in order to maintain your franchise, you may have to pay more than the 37% comp ratio. So, in that sense, that will probably be not an acceptable solution.</p>
          <p>So, whoever has more brilliant ideas are highly welcome to speak up in the weeks to come, but we are now working on some sort of a responses to that and it is absolutely necessary to come up with some proactive step, because otherwise, we risk &#x2013; we run the risk of having a complete change of culture in our industry. And maybe it doesn't happen directly, as I said, but indirectly by just asking for more capital or asking for more taxes, or asking for &#x2013; but the burden would then lead to a lower profitability and, as a result, to lower compensation, and that is the key; we should do everything to prevent that from happening.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, hi, I had two quick questions first &#x2013; firstly, back on Basel III, the talk of increased risk-weighted assets to counterparty credit risk, can you give us the figure for your counterparty credit risk and how they weigh and maybe some preliminary thoughts on how much that could increase by?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on sovereign risk, Mr. Ackermann mentioned that as one of the factors still out there. Can you tell us concretely what you're doing to reduce your sovereign risk exposure, maybe give us a feel for by how much you've reduced that over the last few months? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the first question, I mean the impact studies just started and I don't want to give you any indication here, but that is really not the big problem. The big problem is more in the short term now on the trading book and there, the securitization is just a key issue, and you have to differentiate between new business going forward, which, based on what we know, would not be a big problem, and then of course, the legacy assets. So, I think you will see a lot of reduction in the legacy assets in 2010 in order to be free to grow your business in 2011. That is what is key right now. The sovereign risk, well of course, we have started a long time ago to look into that. We are very comfortable with the exposures we have and I think we also have played a very positive role in not speculating against some of the sovereign risk.</p>

          <p>I wish you all a safe journey home, those of us &#x2013; those of you who have attended in the room, and we very much hope to be seeing all of you during the year and keeping you updated on our progress. Thank you very much, indeed.</p>
