        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Darlene and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining American Tower's conference call regarding our fourth quarter and full year 2009 financial results. Please note that we've posted a brief presentation to accompany this morning's call on our website which is www.americantower.com. And if you haven't done so already you may want to download this presentation as we will refer to it at various times throughout our prepared remarks.</p>
          <p>The agenda for this morning's call will be as follows. First I will provide an introduction and highlight certain key metrics from our fourth quarter and full year 2009 financial results. Following this Tom Bartlett, our Chief Financial Officer will go over our financial results in more detail and provide color on our 2010 outlook. And finally, Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer will then give closing remarks including his current thoughts on key business strengths. As always after these remarks we will open up the call for your questions.</p>
          <p>Before I begin I'd like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include statements regarding our 2010 outlook, our stock repurchase program, our pending acquisition in India, credit market conditions, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical in facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's press release and those set forth in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 and other filings with the SEC. We want you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update this information contained in the call to reflect subsequently occurring events or circumstances. And with that I will begin the call and highlight some of our results.</p>
          <p>Please turn to Slide Four of the presentation for a summary of our fourth quarter results as well as our full year 2009 results compared against the year-ago period. With regards to our fourth quarter results we reported total revenues of approximately 448 million reflecting growth of 9.7% from the year-ago period. Tom will provide additional color on the core growth of our Rental and Management business excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and straight line accounting. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was 308 million, which is a 10.1% increase from the year-ago period. Our operating income for the quarter increased 15.5% to over 176 million. And income from continuing operations was approximately 64 million or $0.16 for both basic and diluted common share.</p>
          <p>And now I'd like to turn this call over to Tom.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Michael and good morning everyone. I'm again pleased to report that American Tower continued its track record of consistently delivering strong revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth during the fourth quarter of 2009. Please turn to Slide Five to review some of the highlights.</p>
          <p>Our reported Rental and Management segment revenue growth was 10.4%. Our core growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and straight line lease accounting, was 10.2% relative to the fourth quarter of 2008. In the U.S. our growth was supported by an overall increase in leasing demand from customers such as Clearwire, as they ramped up spending to deploy the first 4G data network in the U.S. and three of the four national carriers, who continue to invest in their networks to prepare for and meet growing data demand. In addition, our International businesses delivered another solid quarter, with revenue attributable to our operations in Mexico, Brazil, and India, now accounting for over 17% of our tower revenues.</p>
          <p>During the quarter foreign currency translation became the tailwind for our results as the Mexican peso and Brazilian real both strengthened against the U.S. dollar relative to the fourth quarter of 2008. I'd also like to highlight that we had just under $3 million of net non-recurring revenue items in the quarter. In addition, we remained focused and disciplined while evaluating opportunities to selectively deploy our capital.</p>
          <p>We believe these investments will not only drive core growth in our portfolio but also enhance our return on invested capital. Investment highlights during the quarter include the construction of over 350 towers across our portfolio, the construction of ten in building DAS networks and the acquisition of over 500 towers in India and the United States. So overall we are very pleased with our strong finish to 2009.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide Six, you can see from the chart on the upper left-hand side of the page that while our reported adjusted EBITDA growth was 10.1%, our core growth versus the fourth quarter of 2008, would have been 10.6% on a currency neutral basis and excluding the impacts of straight line lease accounting. The majority of our core growth has been supported by our legacy sites, which continued to generate solid levels of new business. As you know, we are also pursuing investments in new sites in the U.S. and abroad to augment our organic growth and to provide a strong foundation for growth. We are pleased to report that, even including the costs relative to the 3,500 sites, we added to the portfolio since the beginning of the year, our adjusted EBITDA margin held steady and at industry leading levels.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide Seven, we delivered approximately 24% and 25% recurring free cash flow and recurring free cash flow per share growth respectively in the quarter versus the year-ago period. This growth was primarily driven by the following: our strong adjusted EBITDA core growth, lower capital expenditures, which were primarily the result of the completion of an international site redevelopment project, which was winding down in the fourth quarter of 2008, and slightly lower cash taxes and interest expense. We believe that the investments we have made and will continue to make in our legacy and expansion markets is well as in our stock repurchase program will continue to drive future recurring free cash flow and recurring free cash flow per share growth.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide Eight, I'd like to briefly review three key highlights from our full year 2009 results. First, our core growth in both tower revenue and adjusted EBITDA were approximately 10%, which is in line with our 2009 outlook. Second, in a year with challenging global macro economic trends, our business model showed resilience and delivered consistent growth. And finally, as we look to drive further shareholder value, we believe recurring free cash flow per share growth is a solid indicator of value creation which we expect to be generated by the following sources: our focus on driving core growth and adjusted EBITDA from our legacy as well as expansion markets, our capital allocation strategy which focuses on reinvesting in our core business through CapEx as well as through selective acquisitions, and our balance sheet which we anticipate will provide us with access to attractive financing, enabling us to return our excess cash to our shareholders through our repurchase program, and minimizing our exposure to cash taxes both in the U.S. as well as abroad. Looking to the future, while we are pleased with our recurring cash flow growth in 2009, we do expect it to moderate to the mid-teens in 2010 as our recurring capital expenditures are expected to remain at levels comparable to 2009.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide Nine, our investments in 2009 remained consistent with our stated capital allocation strategy. We generated approximately $840,000 million of cash from operations and redeployed nearly all of it into either our existing sites, new sites, or our stock repurchase program. Our 2009 capital expenditures of $250 million included discretionary capital spending of 179 million of which 49 million was for land purchases and $127 million was for the construction of over 1000 new sites. In addition, we spent $296 million to acquire over 2500 new sites, with $215 million of our remaining cash flow used to fund our stock repurchase program.</p>
          <p>Our discretionary investments in 2009 specifically focused on pursuing portfolio growth opportunities, and I'm pleased to report that we were successful in Brazil and India where we've increased the size of our portfolios to over 1,600 and 2,600 sites respectively. We expect that we will continue to focus on expanding our U.S. and existing international markets while potentially pursuing new markets where our communication site leasing expertise provides our customers with a strong value proposition.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 10 and before we get to our outlook for 2010, I'd like to highlight the areas we intend to focus on for the year. Our first priority is to drive strong top line sustainable revenue growth. To achieve this, our primary focus will be organic revenue growth which we believe produces the highest incremental returns on our invested capital for our shareholders. We will also seek to augment our organic growth with selective asset acquisitions. This includes the transaction we announced this morning whereby our Indian subsidiary has agreed to acquire approximately 4,500 sites from Essar to further strengthen our presence in India.</p>
          <p>In addition, operational excellence will continue to be a focus for our organization, our teams our continually using Six Sigma methodologies to drive efficiencies in our processes to ultimately achieve cost savings. Meanwhile we will also seek to invest in our infrastructure in 2010 to ensure that we can scale to support our growth. Finally, we will continue to capitalize on our balance sheet to opportunistically raise additional funds to finance our future expansion plans or our stock repurchase program. All of our objectives are focused on driving long term value creation for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 11, we're introducing our outlook for 2010. We expect our Rental and Management segment to produce about $140 million to $170 million of incremental revenue in 2010 which reflects a stronger site leasing environment than 2009. The full year contribution of the new sites added in 2009 as well as approximately 1,200 to 1,600 new sites which we expect to construct during 2010 as well as our contractual lease escalations. Additionally, we completed a lease extension as of the beginning of 2010 with one of our major U.S. customers which will result in an overall increase in straight line revenue for the year of about $14 million compared to 2009.</p>
          <p>In addition, our outlook reflects stronger currencies in Mexico, Brazil, and India relative to their 2009 average levels. These positive impacts to growth are expected to be partially offset by a slightly higher than historical level of churn in 2010 from analog TV broadcasters in the U.S. and the impact of a wind down of a customer take-or-pay agreement in the United States. Please note that until we close our acquisition in India we'll not include the impact of these new sites in our outlook.</p>
          <p>Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations straight line lease accounting and the material one item from 2009 from which was the result of a broadcast customer termination fee we discussed last quarter, we expect core growth for Rental and Management segment revenue to be approximately eight to 9% in 2010. Furthermore, our 2010 core revenue growth rate would be approximately 2% higher excluding the impacts of the broadcast analog churn and our take-or-pay agreement.</p>
          <p>Turning to adjusted EBITDA we expect to generate about 80 million to $110 million of incremental adjusted EBITDA in 2010 which reflects a lower adjusted EBITDA conversion ratio than 2009. This is primarily attributable to costs and related pass-through revenue related to the 3,500 new sites we added to our Rental and Management segment portfolio in 2009 as well as the construction of 1,200 to 1,600 new sites in 2010. Excluding the pass-through revenue and corresponding costs our 2010 outlook conversion ratio would be approximately 10% higher.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we are making selective investments in SG&amp;A which we believe will better support our growth and expansion initiatives. We expect core growth for adjusted EBITDA to be approximately six to 8% in 2010. Finally, cash provided by operating activities is expected to increase $110 million to $140 million in 2010 which reflects the expected increase in adjusted EBITDA as well as a benefit from our lower borrowing costs related to our recent investment grade issuance.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 12 I'd like to highlight some of our capital plans for 2010. With our cash on hand plus our outlook for cash generated from operating activities we will have access to over $1 billion of internally generated funds available for investment. Our first priority is to redeploy this cash back into our business and to that extent we anticipate that we will utilize approximately 300 to $350 million in capital projects. Our outlook for CapEx reflects comparable levels of redevelopment, capital improvements, and corporate capital expenditures versus 2009.</p>
          <p>We are forecasting $50 million for land purchases and 165 to $205 million for other discretionary projects including the construction of 1,200 to 1,600 new sites. Consequently over two-thirds of our 2010 capital program is success-based. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy we will also seek to add new tower assets to our portfolio via acquisitions. If we are unable to find transactions that meet our long term risk adjusted hurdle rates we will return the capital to shareholders through our stock repurchase program.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 13 and in conclusion we are focused on driving growth in our core business by investing in our existing sites as well as new tower assets. We successfully re-invested approximately $550 million in 2009 and will have access to nearly $1 billion in internally generated capital to seek out additional opportunities in 2010. We will continue to pursue expansion opportunities where we can replicate our site leasing best practices to drive strong value creation for our customers.</p>
          <p>Finally our balance sheet further strengthens our foundation for growth. We believe we have the capacity within our stated leverage targets to pursue meaningful transactions that will drive long term growth and return on invested capital and recurring free cash flow per share which should in turn drive long term shareholder value.</p>
          <p>With that I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tom and good morning to everyone on the call. As you just heard we had a strong finish to 2009. With double digit growth in both fourth quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA. That performance is a real tribute to our dedicated employees in the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, and India. It is also a tribute to our customers who keep advancing the reach and capabilities of increasingly robust wireless service.</p>
          <p>Among our currently four served markets our U.S. customers are driving most aggressively for providing ubiquitous and affordable wireless broadband data services. We believe that this will be a multi-year endeavor and so will underpin sustained demand for tower space in the United States for some time to come. Market research that we have commissioned indicates that domestic smartphone penetration doubled between year end 2007 and 2009 and that it will double again between year end 2009 and 2011.</p>
          <p>And at the same time smartphone data usage per unit is also increasing substantially. The research shows that basic smartphones consume about five times the data capacity of the average handset. However advanced smartphones such as the iPhone and the Droid consume upwards of 30 times the data capacity of the average handset in a month. As the deployment of these superphones become more widespread, data demands on wireless networks will increase steadily over time.</p>
          <p>U.S. wireless carriers are stepping up to the challenge of delivering much higher mobile bandwidth to many more of their customers. For the carriers as an industry, facing this challenge and investing in the network is an imperative. Our projections are that the U.S. wireless industry will sustain relatively stable annual voice revenues in the 120 to $125 billion annual range over the next few years. Voice revenues, therefore, will continue to deliver sizable operating cash flows to carriers that they can reinvest in their businesses, but it also means that essentially all wireless carrier industry revenue growth during this time will come from wireless data services.</p>
          <p>Both Verizon Wireless and AT&amp;T Mobility recently reported that their fourth quarter wireless data revenues were up more than 26%. Both also indicated that their wireless capital expenditures would increase in 2010 due to elevated demand for smartphones and higher data usage. In addition, T-Mobile U.S.A. continues to invest in its 3G network build out, and it's partnering closely with Google to bring attractive broadband handsets to its customer base.</p>
          <p>From a tower industry perspective, it's important to note that for the next two to three years a substantial amount of the additional super phone and data service demand from Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile subscribers must be met with 3G technology and spectrum, since 4G LTE handsets and widely deployed network base stations won't be in place until then. As a result, we expect these major carriers to conduct substantial cell site equipment augmentation and cell splitting of their 3G networks, while also laying the groundwork for 4G coverage over the next few years.</p>
          <p>Another positive development for the Tower industry has been Sprint Nextel's strategic decision to introduce 4G earlier to its customer base through its investment in Clearwire. Sprint Nextel recently announced an additional $1 billion investment in that venture, making a significant contribution to Clearwire's fully funded business plan to reach 120 million covered POPs. Additionally Sprint Nextel also stated recently that it was increasing its 2010 capital investment in its own iDEN and CDMA 3G networks by as much as 25% over 2009. In sum, we believe that the major U.S. wireless carriers collective drive toward expanding broadband data services will result in 2010 commenced new business on our existing towers to be at or above the levels we experienced in 2009.</p>
          <p>Also in 2009 our U.S. customers contributed 85% of our company's total revenue and also delivered the bulk of our $840 million plus of cash from operations. We expect, as Tom said, to generate nearly $1 billion in cash from operations in 2010 and our primary objective for this cash is to reinvest it into our business at attractive rates of return for the benefit of our shareholders. So our investments in new tower construction, acquired portfolios of towers, and new market entries will add to our new organic growth in our existing towers and to the escalation on existing contracts during the year that particular investment's made.</p>
          <p>But even more important is the long term future effect of organic growth and escalation on the new assets. This is why in addition to our efforts in our flagship U.S. market we are actively seeking attractive investments in high growth markets such as Brazil and India. Given that these types of markets are at earlier stages in wireless penetration and especially in the adoption of broadband data we believe that they will provide both strong growth in the short term and additional meaningful growth for an extended period into the future.</p>
          <p>Simply put, when we evaluate international investments we consider both the magnitude and the likely duration of enhanced revenue growth opportunities for our company. We are very pleased therefore to announce our pending acquisition of the Essar Tower business in India. We view this transaction as strategic for our India market bringing American Tower to approximately 7,000 sites.</p>
          <p>The Essar portfolio further strengthens our position in the eastern portion of the country and has enabled us to achieve the scale for long term success in the India tower market. The portfolio comes with 1.8 tenants on average per tower and is well positioned for further lease up. The transaction requires government approvals in India which we hope to obtain within the next two to three months. And now before turning to your questions I'll leave you with a few course beliefs held by our management team as we plan and execute our strategy for 2010 and beyond.</p>
          <p>First, we believe U.S. consumers strongly desire mobile broadband service and are increasingly using wireless devices for entertainment in addition to communications. Second, U.S. wireless carriers depend on broadband mobile data for growth and they have the conviction and the means to make the necessary investments to get there. Third, American Tower's existing U.S. focused business with its high operating margins, manageable and stable interest costs, and relatively low maintenance and redevelopment CapEx will generate very strong cash from operations. Fourth, our solid balance sheet and access to investment grade credit markets provide for further funding to expand the asset base in the U.S. and abroad. And finally, our management skills, operational excellence, and systems, we believe are extendable to high growth international markets that meet our rigorous investment criteria.</p>
          <p>So in closing we're looking forward to a great year and we're counting down the 39 days until Gold Medal mogul skier Hannah Kearney throws out the first pitch at Fenway and the Red Sox chalk up their first win of the season against the soon-to-be former World Champion Yankees.</p>
          <p>Operator, Tom and I are ready for questions at this time.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Brett Zuckman with Deutsche Bank</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you talk about what you're seeing in the market? Jim, you were alluding to the strong growth in wireless broadband traffic and the way that's influencing the demand environment right now. I was wondering is it changing anyway your relationship with your customers and the things they're asking for from you and some of the things I'm thinking about are the time frames that they need to get onto the tower?  Are you seeing an increasing interest in doing augmentations versus full new sites? Is there a stronger interest in towers that already have fiber backhaul going for example?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Brett. Generally, I think the drive to broadband is deepening our business relationship with most, if not all of our customers on a couple dimensions. One is you're correct speed to deployment is important. That's something we've been focusing on for years at American Tower. That's what we've really dedicated our Six Sigma effort to is cycle time reductions both for new tower builds, new cell sites on existing towers, and even to augmentations on existing cell sites on our towers. So that's someplace where I think our investments have paid off and helped us with customers.</p>
          <p>On a second dimension, customers, some cases will want us to do more. We're beginning to expand the footprint of what we do for some of our customers including looking into although not entering yet, helping bring or encouraging others to bring fiber to our particular sites. So that's a second dimension where customers would like a broader relationship with us. We're doing things as we've talked about like share generators and other activities to help with that. So I do think that it's helpful. Augmentation versus new cell sites, Brett, don't necessarily depend on speed it really depends on what the engineering decision is on the RF design, and so again, we need to be good at both and we think we are quite strong on cycle time and delivery performance on those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How is the mix this year? Do you think it's going to be a little bit more augmentation oriented just based on some of the big projects like the 4G deployment at Verizon and some of the 3G augmentations we're seeing other carriers? I think the mix has historically been 20 or 30% of business was from augmentations. Is still that the right way to think about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think so. I think so, Brett. I mean given how we ended the quarter and how we're, this is Tom, by the way; how we're beginning in 2010. I think we see continued trends, but we're also encouraged by the new demand for Build-to-Suits. And we saw I think a strong pick up in even Build-to-Suits at the end of, starting in the third quarter going into 2010 and we see a strong Build-to-Suit market for us in 2010, which we think will position us well for future quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Just a question about the Essar deal, the 430 million is that the all in including the liabilities you're assuming?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The way the transaction is working we have $430 million for the shares, and the balance sheet will have some debt and some cash on it. So the answer is yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it seems like the cash and the liabilities are sort of netting out to fairly neutral?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the price is, it's nearly 100,000? That's about 50% more than I think some of your recent deals. Can you give a little color on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I can speak to that one, Brett, and maybe we'll move to the next question. But as regards to the price, the towers come with 1.8 customers per site as I indicated. Essar did an excellent job of building and running this portfolio, frankly, and we like the quality of the assets, where they're placed and especially the book of business already on them. So that operating cash flow from the existing customer base justifies that price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for indulging the multiple questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple questions. First maybe on domestic M&amp;A you guys, I think a lot of your peers would point to you and say AMT historically has been known for the home run deals where you've made your mark. SpectraSite sort of most frequently pointed to versus more recently a deal like the Cincinnati Bell deal, you know, high quality asset in towers but the size would make it, in baseball terms, more of a double or a triple. I'm just wondering is this where the opportunity is?</p>
          <p>And I would think just from talking to some of the others in the industry it seems like you run into a lot more competition at this level as opposed to maybe the middle segment, where there's four or five operators, where you'd run into probably a less competitive process. Just wondering thinking about sort of the puts and takes there because it does seem like the strategy has shifted in the U.S. a little bit. And then second just a quick question on the ground lease activity. Just what prevents you from being sort of a larger player in this market in 2010?  Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Jason, it's Jim. I'll start off and then Tom can follow up on both of those questions. First of all on domestic M&amp;A we've consistently participated in essentially every asset trade over the last few years since SpectraSite. Some have been big and some small. Some of the small ones we've won were not sizable enough to report on individually, but we have over the years acquired small tranches of towers from third party or private equity backed owners. None have risen to the size of Cincinnati Bell though. So that was one that was worth pointing out and announcing.</p>
          <p>And, frankly, we've used the same approach ever since SpectraSite on these smaller portfolios and recently we've been able to come out the winner in a couple of the key transactions that we've been involved with. A couple reasons for that, one is we had a durable balance sheet. We've had access to capital all through this time, and not only that, we've been able to reduce our cost of capital which reduces our weighted average cost of capital that we use to assess what we're willing to pay for assets. So I think it's just another outcome of a steady strategy over time in up and down capital markets where we can act when others perhaps can't. And we can be competitive in those time frames.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Jim just to follow up on that. When you think about access to capital differences and what your cost of capital is, is there a certain metric that that translates into like that equates to one or two term premium that you can pay relative to the others?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not necessarily. We look at ever tower transaction in great detail almost site by site as far as what's the existing customer, what's the credit worthiness of that customer, et cetera. Then we apply at the end of the day what we think our cost to capital is to those cash flows that will be generated in the future under our management and therefore, there's no real rule of thumb.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Jason, this is Tom. I might just add if you take a look at 2009, we acquired about 2,500 sites about 275 of them were in the United States. That's more than all we acquired in 2008 across all of our markets, and I do think that while the double and singles aren't the home runs, I think we can be very good in those, very aggressive in those. I think our cost of capital does give us a bit of an advantage in terms of some of those markets. I think a market like the investment in Cincinnati Bell, even while we've had that and we've only had that for six, eight weeks, the lease up activity in that asset has far exceeded what we actually thought it was going to be. So we like those doubles and triples and clearly they're not the home runs, but they're easy to absorb and they're easy to integrate into our business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the ground lease question, Jason, we are again disciplined when it comes to investing in ground just like we're disciplined when it comes to investing in towers like we've just been talking about. So the same kind of analytical process and rigor goes to the ground lease negotiation which is a one-at-a-time individual negotiation that we have a pretty capable team doing with individual land owners across the country. And if we can't hit our hurdle rate there we just don't do the transaction. So we could buy more but we'd have to relax our standards and we're not willing to do that.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi Investments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Was just wondering if you could give us an update on the NOLs and how you're thinking about the timing for a possible conversion to a real estate investment trust structure. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sure, Mike. I mean there's pretty much along the same lines as I think we communicated on the last call. You know we've got $1.5 billion worth of NOLs. We expect them &#x2013; continue to expect them to expire end of 2012 timeframe. I'm hopeful that we use the NOLs more quickly but kind of given current course and speed that's what our kind of our forecasts look like over the next couple of years. And we continue to evaluate the process of moving to a REIT. I think as you well know our assets fit right squarely in the middle of what would qualify as a REIT. We have certain parts of our business that would be excluded, some the services type of activity in the United States.</p>
          <p>And with the International businesses we're looking at kind of net asset values and how we might allocate capital in some of those areas to be able to hit some of those triggers. But this is a year that Jim and I are focused on getting through all of the homework if you will, on both the tax side as well as all the capital market elements to it. And we are really looking at this as merely being a tax election. We want this to be a minimal impact on our overall business. So we want to make sure that we have ample cash to be able to re-invest in our business and to be able to achieve the kind of growth expectations that we have, ourselves for our business. And there's nothing that we see right now that wouldn't allow us to be able to have access to that cash, to be able to continue grow &#x2013; expectations. So we're right kind of in the middle of it. And as I said, I think we would expect to be more completed with the homework by the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Jim, I was just wondering if you could give us an update on some of the strategic projects, sort of the longer term strategic projects that you're working on like DAS and on battery backup for the cell site.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Mike. And in fact this relates to Essar indirectly also, in that those that have been covering us for a few years may recall that I came out probably two years now and suggested to the investor base that not only do we have a great U.S. based business here at American Tower but that we were also wanting to sort of turbo charge that business over the next three to five years with three or four new areas of business, whether it be geographic or product line, that each might generate say on the order of $50 million of EBITDA a year. So we wanted to complement the growth core engine of the U.S., Mexico, and Brazil businesses we had with some projects, if you will, Mike. So that's kind of what you're referring to.</p>
          <p>Domestically we've chosen a path to be distributing antenna systems on a wider scale to complement our existing sites with generators and some other equipment. And, again, we're just now scratching the surface on do we participate in getting back to fiber loops and such. So on that front, we've built another 20 or so indoor DAS systems recently. It's still about 1% of our revenue.</p>
          <p>We did complete our first outdoor DAS system in the fourth quarter, and we have a customer up and running on that. There's 350, 400 nodes in the pipeline that we've got under contract in addition to that project. So we're off and running. We'd like to get that to the $50 million of EBITDA a year level. So you combine indoor and outdoor DAS, could it some day be three or 4%, maybe 5% of our revenue five years from now? We hope it could, but we're just, we're still at that one to 2% level, Mike, at this point.</p>
          <p>When you look at India then, we've gone from 1% of our revenue in 2009 coming from that country, to pre-Essar we would have predicted probably 3%. This year a full year of Essar and our run rate business in India would be six to 7% of revenue. So now we're starting to get there. Those are the kind of programs that we're running and that's the status of at least those two, Mike.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Morning, guys.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Ric.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple questions for you. First on the guidance side what are your assumptions as far as how the year will be loaded? Is it front end, rear end, level loaded?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's interesting, Ric. If I go back and take a look at the last several years, it generally runs interestingly enough without capital as being spent at the carriers, and it's generally 45% in the front end and about 55% in the back end. And taking a look at our plans for the year, it's consistent with that, similar to 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And then, Jim, you mentioned a little bit on the Essar there being a full year, maybe six, 7%. What are the thoughts as far as why not putting Essar in the guidance right now? Any concern on the closing as far as timing or approval?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we don't like to get ahead of government approvals in any market that we do transactions, Ric. So that's the first thing. Second thing, of course, the impact on 2010 will depend on the date of that closing. And so if it's April, May, June, it's going to have a big difference on the numbers. So we'd like to just get the transaction completed and closed and go ahead and use that appropriate date to forecast the rest of the year. And we'll include it in that earnings call guidance that we update you all with, whether it's in May, hopefully or if it has to be a little bit later, it will be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then there was no tower cash flow, or gross margin guidance this time. Is that kind of getting at the wanting to keep things together until you get the Essar deal closed or just wondering is that something you're not going to guide to anymore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that, Ric, you take a look at those types of even Services, there were a couple of items there that we didn't feel that were necessary, I think, to include. I think there are going to be, if asked, they're comparable to 2009, so that there are no surprises with those. They just didn't seem that meaningful, candidly, going forward to replace given the comparability that they are in 2010 going to be with 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Last one the quick staccato questions here. Target leverage you mentioned $1 billion potential before capital raise as far as investing and growing your business between CapEx and other items. As you think about your leverage. Where are you at as far as the target leverage and your thoughts about how high you would go up to as you look at potential deals out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, our stated leverage is three to five. And for 2009 we were in the 3.3 to 3.4. I think at the end of 2009, we ended up even a little bit below that. I think with the kind of the cash that we've been talking about here in the script and on the slides, it upticks a little bit to 3.5 to 3.6 kind of a range, so even with the activity that's included with the billion dollars of cash available to re-invest in the business, we're still well south of four. So, you know, we'll continue to look at as I mentioned before with future acquisitions out in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>But, we've been at this kind of level for the last couple of years. I think it would take a pretty meaningful transaction to get north of four. More transformational if you will. So we feel very good in terms of where we are. And our cost to capital is and our cost of borrowing it in 2010 is expected to be below where it was in 2009. So I think it's all being beneficial to our shareholders.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I'm wondering if you could give us a little more color on the Essar deal. Particularly, how many of the sites are currently under construction? And for those sites, do you already have anchor tenants for them? Or are they built to spec?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think of the 44 to 50 sites about 90% are fully up and running maybe 10ish% of the construction there, James. And what was the second half of your question about Essar?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, absolutely. Everything that we're buying has a tenant contract or one or more tenants already on the site.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the share buy-back program. Obviously you guys did a couple hundred million in '09, what's the outlook for 2010? And then secondly, you noted, I think Tom noted that non-U.S. revenues kind of grew to about 17% of the business, over the longer term how should we think about the contribution of international markets as a percent of total revs? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sure Jonathan, let me start off and Tom can follow up. The share repurchase we don't guide to because it's a consequence frankly in any given year of our deal pipeline. What we've got that we can announce and have to fund like Essar today and what we've got in front of that in the pipeline as far as prospects their size, magnitude, and probability of closure. So we don't guide to share repurchase because it's essentially a derivative of the deal pipeline that we close on and the one that we anticipate. And then secondly as far as international scope over time we're really comfortable with attaining 25 to 30% of our revenues being outside the U.S. again over a two to four to five-year timeframe.</p>
