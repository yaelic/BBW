          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Conference Call of Intesa Sanpaolo for the Presentation of 2009 First Quarter Results, hosted by Corrado Passera.  My name is Phil and I will be your coordinator for today's conference.  For the duration of the call you will be on listen only. However, at the end of the call, you will have the opportunity to ask questions.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  I am now handing you over to Mr. Corrado Passera to begin today's conference call.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Phil , and thank you to everybody for joining us this afternoon.  Let me just make one brief comment before we start with the presentation and the comment is the following.  Our first quarter results, both operational and net, are a bit above our budget targets, that's the reason why we feel more confident than &#x2013; even more confident than two months ago about our 2009 results.</p>
          <p>In this light, we confirm our commitment to strengthen the four, three or four main strengths of ours.  I am referring to high liquidity, low leverage, low risk profile and let me add also low level of complexity.  These are concepts, then we will see through the pages what kind of very practical actions we have taken to invest in these four directions because these are the lessons from the crisis and we strongly believe that these lessons from the crisis will become the key factor for success in the next phase of sustainable growth. And since we are well positioned on each of the four, we back to point number one, we are more confident than before on our results.</p>
          <p>So let's move to the presentation, Page Number Three, the summary of the summary.  First quarter 2009 net income at 1.1 billion, that means 644 million after adjusting this figure for the main non-recurring items.  The main non-recurring items is the detaxation of intangibles and &#x2013; but also if we take that away, the first quarter results are fully in line with the 2009 outlook we disclosed on the occasion of the 2008 results. And then the point I made before that it will be liquidity solidity low risk profile and sustainable profitability are and will remain top priorities for the group.</p>
          <p>Let's start with liquidity. It is and will remain a priority and as we said on other occasions, we are ready to pay some cost for the excess liquidity because it's worth paying.  Left top of the page, the structural balance between direct customer deposits and direct loans to customers is confirmed on the other two graphs on the bottom part of the page.</p>
          <p>On the left, the amount of eligible assets with Central Banks have increased.  It's now &#x20AC;58 billion worth of eligible assets.  Actually if we add the assets, we can use also in Central-Eastern Europe, this figure gets close to 70 billion.  On the right hand side, bottom of the page, we have the 29 billion that are the amount of deadlines we have during the year and that's our total funding maturities during the 2009 year.</p>
          <p>We decided as we said last time to give priority to this funding exercise.  We are very close now to completing this exercise because long-term funding is one of the most difficult exercise if you don't have a retail network capable as we have to raise this kind of money.  The last point on liquidity is the net interbank position, positive.  We said that we don't want to use the interbank market to fund structurally our activity and we confirm this decision.</p>
          <p>That was liquidity and now let's look at solidity.  Our capital ratios have improved marginally, but improved in the first quarter.  Our Core Tier 1 ratio before the benefit from the Tremonti bonds is now at 6.4%. That will become 7.4% after the Tremonti bonds. Tier I at 7.2, that would be 8.2, total capital ratio is 10.5%, that will become 11.5%.  In this respect, the yellow cloud has to be kept into consideration, because we have the reserves, we call them reserves in terms of liquidity and capital gain, that are the non-core assets that we are ready to use, to dispose, to use as capital management actions that will be used in the future to further strengthen our position in terms of capital ratios.</p>
          <p>The two notes on the page say that in this figure, we have not taken into account the effect of the planned dividend we are going to pay, we want to pay on 2009 results.  We will make an estimate of the rate of these dividends on the occasion of the second quarter results, but our desire and commitment is to go in this direction.  The rest is the note about the Tremonti bonds which we already discussed last time.</p>
          <p>Leverage, leverage is the other face of solidity and in this respect, we want to confirm our very low leverage policy.  If we take the super ratio, that means the tangible net shareholder equity over tangible total assets, that at the end is, in our opinion, one of the best ratios to quantify the actual solidity and level of leverage.  We see that Intesa Sanpaolo confirms its top position amongst the 13 peers in Europe.</p>
          <p>Low risk profile, low risk profile has to be looked in many respects, the business portfolio, the presence in Central and Eastern Europe and then we will go very much in depth into the provision policies. As far as our business portfolio, we confirm the importance and the structural strength of our Banca dei Territori division, where we see that like all other retail operations are hit in the short-term by the markdown reductions but it is still and will remain a structure of strength of the group. Very strong performance by our Corporate and Investment Banking division and Public Finance, but we will discuss them later.  All the other divisions of the group are in line with our targets. And our position on the Italian market is well known, so I will not elaborate on it.</p>
          <p>In terms of low risk profile, it's very important to see how the substandard and doubtful loans flows have gone and then the cost of credit.  The last quarter of 2008 has been obviously a very heavy quarter in this respect.  We wanted to wait for the first quarter in order to understand whether the trend was just in one direction or not. Actually the flow of new substandard and doubtful loans in the first quarter of the year has been significantly lower than in the previous quarter.  We would like to see the next quarters, but certainly this is an interesting piece of information and in fact, the cost of credit on an annualized basis is now down toward peak of the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of the components of our substandard and doubtful loans, we don't see for the time being a strong contagion effect, as we call it, amongst the different industries and sectors. And we see that the problems are still mainly concentrated in those sectors that are structurally more exposed to the economic cycle, mainly construction, distribution <mark type="inaudible" /> metals, services and agriculture that is an important but certainly not the majority of our group loan book.</p>
          <p>One more point in terms of risk profile.  Our presence in Central and Eastern Europe, a lot of figures in order for you to evaluate our presence in this part of the world.  There are only two figures &#x2013; I want to attract your attention on the two rounded figures on Page Nine that say that the total weight of the customer loans in this region of the world is 7.2% of the total loan portfolio of the group and the only country that is certainly a country with some level of risk represented in around of 0.1% of our loan portfolio.</p>
          <p>Inside the following page, Page Number 10, is another set of figures on our presence in Central and Eastern Europe. You will find here all the details and we can discuss them later, if some of you is interested, but the two figures we pointed are the performing loans coverage that is a very comfortable figure, 1.4%, and the doubtful loan coverage higher than 70%.  The two notes at the bottom of the page say that all total foreign currency retail loans account for 1.3% of group loans and these loans are lower than the amount of direct customer deposits in foreign currency.</p>
          <p>The last point I made in the first part of the presentation is about sustainable profitability.  Sustainable profitability comes obviously from revenues and costs. What I want to emphasize is the strong improvement in operating margin this quarter versus the previous quarter, almost 43% improvement and a net income back to a positive figure, 1.1, versus the 1.2 loss of quarter, the first quarter.  We like the 4%, let me use the word like, the reduction of only 4% in net interest income. That's a bit better than the guidance we gave and the total effect, the reasons why we have maintained the reduction, kept the reduction lower than 5%, is the combination of the spread defense, let's say, the markup defense we have been able to keep on our loans.  They said they are the very selective loan growth we're having and the hedging facilities we had adopted in the previous month.</p>
          <p>We will give you more detail in terms of the effect of hedging, but what I can anticipate here is that the full effect of our hedging facilities will be reached only in the second quarter, as we said two months ago.  And the effect on our figures will probably double from the second quarter of 2009.  The two graphs that you have on this page are the trend in markups and markdowns.  Obviously, the markdown is much stronger and it's also the effect of the very conservative funding policy we want to have, but I already commented on this point before, while on the mark-up side for sure we have been reasonably good in improving them and there is still some work to be done.  These trends in the revenue, in interest rate coupled with a very sizable cost reduction, almost 4%, have made our operating improvement quite satisfactory.</p>
          <p>Cost, I have some details from Page 12, we already knew that since the trend in the revenues, we have to increase to improve our efficiency and to increase the cost synergies.  On the left hand side, the red line is the target we had in the business plan in terms of cost reduction, as you know, but it's obvious we have gone much further than what we had in mind at the beginning.  On the right hand side, the red line is the amount of cost synergies we have already achieved. This is around one billion and about 500 million are still to be achieved and will be achieved during the rest of the current year.</p>
          <p>Cost, I mean, the need as to the cost/income ratio we are not number one. Also, even if we will do our best to improve our position in the ranking, the two Spanish friends are still better than us and that's a challenge that we accept.</p>
          <p>Page 15, some more detail on the first quarter result. 1.1 billion net income, 644 million net income adjusted, a 14% reduction in operating costs, a 42% improvement in operating margin.  A 76-business-point annualized cost of credit that is an improvement of 25 basis points.  Quality of our asset portfolio confirmed the total of the net doubtful loans and loans is at 1.1% and we have, as you know, a reserve on performing loans very significant in around of &#x20AC;2.4 billion.  The improvement in the operating performance has improved our Core Tier I by 25 basis points.  Then we used 15 basis points for the intangible detaxation I mentioned before and so as we saw before, the net improvement in our Core Tier I is about 10 basis points.</p>
          <p>Page 16, page 16 is a very synthetic summary of our figures on the asset and liability side.  Loans to customers year-on-year almost 8% at the end of the period, almost 7% growth in terms of average volumes.  Direct customer deposits up almost 11% and that's a strength of our group for sure.  Indirect customer deposits down, partially because of performance effect and certainly partially because of some crisis in the &#x2013; some difficulties in the assets under management area.  But we will see later that we have not lost any financial assets of our customers.  They simply moved from one place to another place, but always, in other words, together with us.</p>
          <p>Page 17, the detail of our P&amp;L.  Let's go very rapidly through it and then we will analyze line by line.  Net interest income in line with what we expected.  Net fee and commission better than expected because a reduction of 2.4 given our policy to concentrate the network placement capability on our own bonds is a very good result.  Back to profit in terms of trading and we will see the details afterwards.  So at the end, we had a growth in operating income in around of 4%.</p>
          <p>Operating cost very much down on all the three lines, personnel expenses, other administrative expenses, partially seasonal, partially because we are now starting benefiting from the reduction to one single IT system into and the write-downs at the end of last year are now a source of cost reductions and the same thing goes with amortizations and depreciation.  Operating margin higher than the previous quarter by 42.9%.  Net provision for risk and charges is conservative and we will comment on it later. Net adjustment on loans, we'll have a number of pages with all the details later but certainly in the low part of the brackets we discussed with all of you two months ago and so the income before tax from minus two to 1 billion and more or less the same at the end &#x2013; on the bottom line.</p>
          <p>Page 18, it's only &#x2013;  it's a page where you find all the details that make the comparison between the fourth quarter last year and the first quarter this year in terms of adjusted net income.  We want you to be perfectly aware of the items we consider recurring or non-recurring and these are the details that make the comparison between the two, net income at 82% improvement this quarter versus the previous one.</p>
          <p>If we compare Page 19, the first quarter results with the same period of last year, we had the 4% reduction in interest income we discussed before.  We have the strong reduction in net fee and commission, we will elaborate on later, but that is in line with the trend in the assets under &#x2013; asset management area of activity.  Profit on trading, higher than last year and the rest more or less in line with what we forecasted.  Total operating income down 11%, a strong reaction in terms of cost, operating margin inevitably lower than last year, but it was really another world, 19%.  Obviously, then we have the impact of higher but lower than expected net adjustment to loans and we get to the 1 billion that represents a reduction of 47% on income before tax and going down to the bottom line, the reduction gets to 38.5%.</p>
          <p>Page Number 20 is the same kind of page we had two pages ago and you find that there are no recurring items that are needed to make the two figures comparable.  And if we compare the first quarter this year with the first quarter last year, the reduction in the net income adjusted is in around of 48%.</p>
          <p>Page 21, net interest income year-on-year figure, minus 4%.  This is almost totally due to the reduction in markdown that is totally connected and almost automatically connected with market yields.  This effect has been, as I said, before partially compensated by a selective increase in volumes and the hedging, these policies and decisions we have taken.  On the left hand side, you also have the trend in volumes in the different segments of our customer portfolio.</p>
          <p>If we look at the quarterly analysis and if we compare the first quarter with the previous quarter, we have one element that justifies part of the difference between the number of working days that has an impact in around of 40 million.  The second note says that we have reduced our net interbank position to an almost balanced one while it was in around of 5 billion at the end of December.  The repricing action have been taken and will be taken also in the future, while the last point is important, the first quarter net 2009 average customer loans is more or less stable versus the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Page 22 is the analysis for identifying the components of the net interest income and the comparisons between first quarter 2009 and first quarter 2008 on the left hand side and the last quarter of 2008 on the right hand side.  If we look, for example, on the left hand side, we see that the operating impact was in around of 200 million.  This 200 million is the combination of a 141 million effect on volumes and the 343 million on spreads and this 343 million of spreads is the combination of a higher than that effect on markups and a positive effect on the &#x2013; sorry, on the markdowns and the positive effect on the markups.</p>
          <p>The hedging actions we have taken have had a total impact of 170 million.  This is the figure we can concentrate a bit on, because we expect this figure to be in around of 300 million from quarter two on and that's an important component.  The rest has to do with the amount of money we had on the interbank market and in the Treasury, but you have all the details.</p>
          <p>Page 23, commissions.  Commissions are down, as I said mainly, for assets under management and assets under administration products.  What is very important to take into consideration is the note we have on the right hand side that says that during the first quarter of this year, we have dedicated our retail network almost totally to the placement of Intesa Sanpaulo bonds, that by definition do not earn up-front fees, but it was very important to make sure that our long-term funding needs were met very much in advance during the year.  Certainly this has had an impact in terms of commissions, but it's a price that was worth paying.</p>
          <p>Page 24 is a page I referred to a few minutes ago.  If we take retail customers, we see that the during these last few quarters, their financial assets have been placed in different ways with the bank, less assets under management, less assets under administration also because of performance reasons, but higher direct customer deposits.</p>
          <p>The net effect of these three trends is still a positive figure for the bank. That means that overall, the amount of financial assets kept with the bank by retail customers have increased by &#x20AC;600 million.  The amount of money that is waiting for the market to change mood.  And the amount of money on which we will have to work to increase our assets under management, as you see, is very significant, even if we take only the retail customers and we take only the assets under administration they have with us is more than 350 billion.  That becomes more than 500 billion if we take &#x2013; add the direct deposits to this figure.  So it's an interesting potential for the future growth in terms of commissions with this segment of our customers.</p>
          <p>Page 25, trading profits.  Back to a solid positive result in first quarter 2009 and the details of these results are described on Page 26.  The 107 million coming from 104 million from customer activities, direct customers' activities, a bit less, but more or less the same amount from the capital market activity mainly performed by Banca IMI.</p>
          <p>The proprietary trading and Treasury in the round of breakeven a bit less, a 19 million loss, but not far from breakeven, while the structured credit products account for 79 million worth of loss.  You will remember that we had a provision of 180 million in the last quarter of 2008, but 79 is a figure in line with our expectation and budget expectations.  Page 27, some details about the structured credit product portfolio.  We have now 2.785 billion of assets that can be included in this portfolio.  We are confident that what we have in our budget target can be met by the 2009 actual results.</p>
          <p>Page 28, cost reduction is a strength of ours, very, not very excellent too much but certainly excellent cost reduction despite the fact that we keep investing on growth-related activities, mainly the opening of new branches and training expenses.  We do not have yet the effect of all the cost synergies we have in our plans and as I said at the beginning of the presentation, we still have 500 that will be realized during the current year.</p>
          <p>We had another negative effect that we compensated for was the introduction of the intra-group VAT, which is a strange idea that in Italy we decided to have &#x2013; to increase the tax burden on banks, but such is life and we reacted to it.  And the quarterly analysis shows that between this quarter versus the previous quarter has a decrease of 14% and as I said before, part of it is structural that has to do with staff reduction and write-offs of IT assets and part of it is seasonal as usual.</p>
          <p>Page 29, cost of credit down after peaking in quarter number four &#x2013; fourth quarter 2008.  On the net provision for risk and charges, we believe that the provisions we have accounted for in this first quarter of year are conservative, but we thought it was the right figure to put and the rest has now -has reached 733 million, that as I said before in the lower part of the brackets we indicated two months ago.</p>
          <p>Page 30 is the amount, the total amount of non-performing loans, gross on the left hand side and net on the right hand side.  Still we are in an area of weight on total loans.  That is well under control.  Page 31, the same figures are given division by division and I am ready to go more in-depth, if some of you is interested.  The most important page probably is Page Number 32 because it's analyzing the quality of the credit portfolio.  We have to look at the new flow of substandard and the doubtful loans.  You see that the net flow of the new substandard on the left side last quarter was better than the previous one and the only division that has increased the amount of new substandard gross is the international subsidiary division, but was well in our plans, while all the other divisions were lower figures.</p>
          <p>Page 33 has to do with the low risk profile of the group and is the description of our portfolio both in terms of business areas.  On the left hand side, you'll see it's a well diversified kind of portfolio where the residential mortgages have features that make this portfolio very sound.  On the right hand side, you have the breakdown by kind of borrowers and industries.  You will see that there is no industry that accounts for 10% and the portfolio is absolutely well diversified.</p>
          <p>Page 34, we have already given these figures before, are our capital ratios.  Page 35 is the summary of the divisional figures.  All the divisions have positive EVA and that is very important.  All the divisions are in line with their budget targets, two of them, as I said before, the corporate investment banking division and the public finance, are well ahead of their budget targets.</p>
          <p>Page 36, Banca dei Territori, it's a division where we have completed the organizational structuring of the division in the last few months and in the first two months of the year, we definitely positioned the 8,000 people belonging to the management structures or in the field of this division.  That certainly had some effect.  But we wanted to further strengthen and complete the organizational &#x2013; the organization of this division.  More or less everything in line with what we expected, a very strong reaction in terms of cost.  But more or less, I think that we have already discussed before.  Eurizon Capital is our asset management company reacting well in terms of cost, obviously suffering from the trend on its own market.</p>
          <p>Page 38.  Corporate and Investment Banking, very strong increase both in terms of revenues and very, very effective effort in terms of efficiency.  The operating margin, very much higher than -</p>
          <p>almost three times the margin that we had in the last quarter of 2008, excellent cost income in around of 27%.  A very sound division, it's mainly focused on commercial banking and the most value-added kind of investment banking services.</p>
          <p>Page 39, our public finance operations, as I said, well ahead of its budget targets.  Both the operating margin and the net income almost twice big as the one of the first quarter 2008.  International subsidiary banks shows a good growth in operating margin, 5.3%.  Given the situation and given the reduction in the growth of volumes we had to impose, it's a good figure.  If we exclude the exchange rate impact, the actual growth of operating margin would be 10%.  Net adjustments are obviously much higher than last year, but absolutely in line with our budget expectations.</p>
          <p>Page 41, Banca Fideuram, good reaction.  This company of ours has confirmed its leadership position on the market, shows positive net inflows of financial assets despite the situation and the competition on the market, very good reaction in terms of cost, also in this division of our group.</p>
          <p>Last page, Page 42, I will not go through the main point and the main strength of our group, but that we believe that we are managing our bank through the crisis.  The crisis is certainly not over, but we feel we are quite well equipped to take advantage of such an adverse situation.  So thank you very much for staying with us for all the presentation and we are now ready for answering any question you might be interested in.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  The first question comes through from the line of Alberto Cordara of RBS.  Your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I have a few questions.  The first one is on NPAs.  We saw that there is a rise in Eastern Europe, but that these are relatively stable in Italy.  So I just wonder whether you saw that in Q1?  There is obviously a sharp reduction in the number &#x2013; in the flows.  What's going to happen in Q2 if you have a preliminary indication about the trend?  It might be too early to ask you this question, but I think it's important to know your opinion on this.</p>
          <p>Also, we understand that as other Italian banks, that you are awarding a grace period to those clients of yours that are holding mortgages and that are experiencing difficulties.  I wonder whether you can give us guidelines of the percentage of your mortgage book in Italy?  This is actually under these conditions and what do you expect it to be maybe in one year time?</p>
          <p>Another question is regarding the Tremonti bonds.  I am not clear here, I mean, there are other Italian banks that are making out the interest just straight against equities, but if I read the slide that you report on Tremonti bonds, I have the impression that you're going to report the charge in the P&amp;L, correct me if I am wrong?</p>
          <p>And then another question is, we saw a very strong effect on the net interest income in your Corporate and Investment Banking Division.  Now the question here is, at other competitors of yours, there was actually a reclassification from trading to net interest income.  I wonder if you had the same effect or not and if yes, if you can quantify what is the effect?</p>
          <p>And finally, if you can give us an idea, you mentioned that your interbank position is positive, but I think there was, anyhow, a sharp reaction versus the numbers that we saw at the end of the year, if you can give us an idea of your policies on fees going forward?</p>
          <p>And the very last question is, if you can give us the number for the goodwill and the intangible that you currently have?  I am not very clear also about this detaxation, how exactly did it work?  Because you have a positive impact on the P&amp;L, but as far as I understand, you had a negative impact on Core Tier I, which raises the question on so why you decided to go forward with this strategy or with detaxation?  Thank you very much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will go through the not short list of questions that have been asked.  The trend in the flow of new non-performing loans in the first quarter are at Page 32.  Hard to make any estimates on the second quarter.  What I'm sure about is that the attention we have and the focus we have placed on this part of the management of our branches is reducing the new flow of, let's say, loans with some problems.  What I feel week after week in looking at the figures of the past due, the risk under observation, the substandard is that the attention of our people in the field is becoming very effective and I'm confident that this will create a positive effect on our portfolio of non-performing loans.  But it's really too early to make an estimate on the second quarter.</p>
          <p>You mentioned the grace period we grant to mortgage borrowers.  This has been the case in the last two, three years when the interest rates reached a very high level.  That's not very much the case anymore, because interest rates are going down and the number of households that ask for this kind of grace period is now becoming very, very low.  I remember that in the year, let's say, 2006, 2007, in the round of 25,000 borrowers were asked for this possibility that is a very tiny non-relevant percentage of our mortgage portfolio.</p>
          <p>Tremonti bonds, we planned, I mean, we have in mind and I think we cannot avoid it is to charge interest to our P&amp;L.  Then if there is any possibility to do otherwise, we will take into consideration.  But we plan to charge the interest of these bonds to our P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>As far as the net interest income of the Corporate and Investment Banking Division, there is no effect from trading.  So, the effect you mentioned, and that is certainly true for a number of competitors of ours, is not at all present in our accounts.  Interbank position, we decided that given the amount of eligible assets and given the almost completion of the long-term funding we had done in the first months of the year, there was no need to keep a large interbank, given the interest in the market yield.  So there was no need to keep the 7 billion worth of position on the interbank market and we are in the around of 1.5 billion and we will probably remain in the area of between zero and 2 billion also in the next time.</p>
          <p>Goodwill detaxation.  Goodwill detaxation, you mentioned the effect on the Core Tier I and this effect, it is the reason why we have decided to postpone the intangible detaxation to the first quarter of this year.  We wanted to be sure that we could afford it and it seems we can afford it, because as you saw, our capital ratios could certainly afford this cost. We decided to take advantage of something that is certainly in the interest of the bank where there was a deadline we did not want to miss.  But we waited for the first quarter figures before deciding whether or not to take advantage of this fiscal low.  And again, the cost in terms of Core Tier I was more than affordable and so we decided to do it.</p>

On the first answer that you gave me, I think it would be interesting to know how the percentage of your mortgage book that is given by this client.  Because you're right in saying that in the past it was not relevant, but I think in the current economic framework, I mean, we understand from other banks that this is going to grow in the course of the year because of-?</p>

We are really talking not even a statistically relevant figure.  Certainly we don't have the feeling that the number of households asking for this grace period to change and since the number of months, this number has been so non-relevant that we don't have the statistics with us, but we will find this figure and we will let you know.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much.  I have one question actually and that goes back to the balance sheet.  I had a question of how you will go about to use your balance sheet in order to achieve the goal of showing a net profit broadly in line with the previous year?  I notice here that the amount of trading assets increased significantly compared to where they were sort of mid last year, also to be fair, the trading liabilities increased.  But I just wanted to ask, looking at the trading assets, does this include, does it relate to this increase to you, for example, buying bonds, taking advantage of the volatility with the interest rates or the falling interest rates?  That was my question.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I understood correctly your question, we don't have any, any effective increase in trading activity, simply the reduction in interbank position and the flow we had in customer deposits has created an amount of money that is invested in government bonds and that's the reason why we have more than &#x2013; we have significantly increased also the eligible assets.  But we are not increasing and we don't want to increase the trading portfolio strictly since others.  We have an excess of liquidity that we are investing in low risk government bonds.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon.  I have a few questions as well.  First of all on your guidance, just a clarification.  You mentioned that you expect the net income in line with the one of 2008.  Should we take it that that is indicating the 2.5 billion net, which obviously has one-off positive and negative, in which case also that means that I am sure you will be taking for this quarter, your net income of 1.1 and therefore, have a 1.4 billion to be done in the following quarters as your indicative guidance at this stage?</p>
          <p>And I would like also to mention that you don't expect at this stage win that any further one-off in the following quarters.  Does that mean also as part of your indication that your 75 basis point provisions cost of credit is something that you see as a run rate for the rest of the year?  You seem to be making quite some balanced but slightly positive comments on your asset quality development and indeed, the floor seems to be going down.  So that's quite important.  My understanding from the past was that perhaps the guidance might have been a little bit higher than that, but your view there would be great.</p>
          <p>With regard to net interest income in the Corporate and Investment Banking Division, which is very strong, thank your spreads, is that because also Investment Banking and Treasury is where you have the benefits of the hedges, should we consider that as included there as well?  And as a last question, what was the reason for not accruing the dividend in this quarter?  Just to clarify, because I am concerned that some people may interpret that as you not being sure whether you will be paying a dividend, but if you do, how come none that was accrued this quarter?  Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the first question, in Italian we say, we are giving you a hand, don't take our arm.  We said that we feel more confident about 2009, but we will certainly not make any quantitative forecast.  For sure, we said that we wanted to make a robust net income and 1.1 billion after the first quarter makes us reasonably confident that the bottom line will not be far from what we had last year, but we cannot go much further than that.</p>
          <p>The 76 basis points, as I said, we cannot &#x2013; we do not know, because nobody knows how long the crisis or the winter would be.  For sure, we expected some more in the first quarter.  So we've been positively surprised.  But we will have to wait for the, at least for the second quarter before taking such a difficult commitment.  Net interest income in the Corporate and Investment Banking division is not at all affected by any hedging decisions or facilities.  All the effect belongs by definition to the Banca dei Territori division, because we are talking about the structural deposit base of that division.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so, sorry for interrupting you.  So then the really strong, very good net interest income in Corporate and Investment Banking, we can consider that as very much sustainable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is sustainable.</p>

          <p>Fantastic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are talking about good solid loans to mid and large corporate with whom the discussion about markups is easier than in some cases than with good SMEs, that in the field find sometimes small banks that do not charge for the real cost of the funding and of the equity.  The decision not to make a specific figure in terms of accrual on dividends but making it very clear, because I mentioned it very openly, is because we feel it's safer to wait for the second quarter in order to make a figure.  We will certainly have a figure.  We want to get back to dividend payment.  The first quarter had a significant non-recurring item and so we decided to wait for the second to make it clear that we want to get back to a dividend and we want to, let's say, to satisfy our shareholders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very clear.  It's just that the dividend is such a sensitive issue that I really wanted you to double confirm that again.  One last question if I can, what was the reason for the large growth on your mid and large corporate versus what is the retail in terms of the strength?  Which areas are actually driving that stronger volume growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mid and large corporate are proving obviously to be stronger structurally than most SMEs and most &#x2013; a large number of mid and large corporate have not interrupted investment plans because of the crisis.  A very large number of them are very successful companies that are managing through the crisis and are not blocked by the crisis.  So in general, we are talking about a stronger segment of the Italian economy.</p>
          <p>At the same time, another effect that might have been, might have affected this figure is that the number of international banks that have gone through troubles have reduced their activity outside their own country and some very good banks, I'm sorry, some very good companies borrowing from international banks, have now turned to other banks for example, to ourselves.  So these two effects certainly helped with the trend you're mentioning.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, sir.  My question relates to the lending volumes, which are actually going down quarter-on-quarter, especially in the Banca dei Territori.  So I would like to know if there's any no retiring effect, any one-off effect to explain that or if you plan to continue to leveraging in letting?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Some of those volumes decrease comes from the fact that the leasing activity has been moved to the Corporate division and some of those loans have been moved.  The newest loans have been moved to the corporate center for a number of reasons.  So don't look at those volumes decrease as a trend or at least a policy by us.  At the same time in &#x2013; especially in March, because that has not been the case in January and February.  In the month of March, the volumes with SMEs in particular have gone down more than what we expected, but we realize it was only a, let's say, a change, because already in April, something positive happened.  But I would strongly suggest to consider lending volumes at the Banca dei Territori more or less stable given the perimeter changes I mentioned before.</p>

          <p>Good morning, I mean, Good afternoon, Mr. Passera.  I have just one question.  It is on assets disposal.  You have written in the press release you have kind of 9 billion of assets to be sold with kind of 5 billion goodwill attached.  Without entering too much into details,  because I know you don't particular like to comment these, I just wanted to understand, maybe to have a flavor, if you feel more confident about the potential disposal today of some of these assets by the end of the year or eventually if the situation, as you said, has remained exactly as you said it was three or maybe six months ago?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We keep mentioning those assets, because nobody has told them.  So they are there and they remain a non-core asset and they will be used for capital management actions.  The decisions we have taken not to press, not to push these divestments is because it would be wrong for a bank like ours, a group that does not need or at least does not need urgently those inflows to push those assets on a buyer's market like the one that we are having.</p>
          <p>We are more and more confirmed by &#x2013; because of a number of reasons and because of a number of evidence that most of those assets will be used and will be &#x2013; I am not using the word disposed, because in some cases, it's listing.  Some others is creating joint ventures.  But the amount of capital gains and the amount of especially of impact on our capital ratios is more than confirmed by what we see also in the last weeks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, Mr. Passera and colleagues.  The first question is on net interest income.  From Page 21, you already commented on your loan growth.  I would like to know if you can give us an idea how much of the repricing are you implementing and has already been already been implemented, especially with borrowers which are easier to reprice such as the mid corporate and the large corporate, which is where most of the loan growth year-on-year has happened?  So that is the first part of the question.</p>
          <p>And the other one was on the hedging strategy.  I am trying to understand, I mean, you write on Slide 22 that the hedging benefit was &#x20AC;170 million and then already from Q2, we should have &#x20AC;300 million.  Is this a number which we are likely to see second quarter, third quarter? And is this based also on interest rates at ECB are 1% or in the event that ECB rates are going to go to below 1%, so maybe 75 bips if the situation gets worse, we are going to see even a higher positive effect?</p>
          <p>And then I am going to ask something I don't usually ask to you, I mean, it's not really very relevant to your franchise in terms of weight.  But I would like to know your opinion on how the situation is evolving in Hungary and in Serbia, two very small countries for you.  You circled Ukraine, which we will all know about, but just to have a feeling of what you are seeing in the ground in these two countries, having in mind that the weight for you is not so relevant?</p>
          <p>And finally if I may, a bit of a psychological strategic question.  You started the presentation stressing point for you liquidity, low level of complexity, strong capital.  So it means that you believe there is a chance, a very high chance that the crisis is going to hit more &#x2013; although probably not saying the worst is behind us, but maybe we are out of the emergency room.  We're not going to die, but there will be people which will be hit.</p>
          <p>So that leads me to a question of strategy.  This is probably the best occasion ever for stronger bank &#x2013; at least ever for people in this working life, I don't know, but for strong banks to leverage on the franchise and make some acquisition.  How are you going to go about it?  I have in mind your Eastern European network, which is not small and not big.  How will you be looking at these?  Would you be contemplating, for instance, maybe swapping assets, since you've got also a lot to dispose of and there is at the moment a buyer market.  But would it be a possibility to talk with banks which are in trouble in certain franchises and consider swapping some operations or maybe something else?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the first question on the net interest income re-pricing effort, very difficult to answer.  But what I can tell you is that the re-pricing is very difficult, but obviously on the short-term lending, because of availability of liquidity on that side is much easier on the long-term one.  And given the demand for credit &#x2013; for investment is certainly not growing, but we expect it to come back in the next month.  We expect to have quite a good effect for further repricing in the next month.</p>
          <p>So I am not saying that the exercise has been completed, because there is room and we have identified thousands of customer cases where there is room for growth.  But I expect quite a potential for a step upward in terms of net interest income as soon as the demand for medium and long-term credit comes back.  Hedging benefit, the 300 we mentioned are the millions we expect at this present level of market interest rates and they will certainly last at least for the next three, four quarters.  If the ECB rates go down, the advantage will be higher.</p>
          <p>The question about Hungary and Serbia.  Hungary is an important company bank for us.  Serbia is smaller, but still a significant one.  In both cases, we have decided to be much more prudent in terms of growth of volumes, in terms of we have launched, especially in Hungary, a restructuring exercise that will bring the break-even down.  None of those two cases are emergency cases for us.  And we &#x2013; especially Serbia, don't forget that Serbia accounts for a very limited amount of our loans.  But in all these countries, Serbia is 0.5, just to give you a...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, and I was more referring to Hungary, sorry, rather than Serbia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hungary, we are working on and successfully, I would say, because we had a report this morning on a step downward in terms of cost that will make the situation stronger.  Our bank also in this very difficult period of time has had a net income, a positive net income also in the first quarter of 2009, about 15 million, if I remember correctly.</p>
          <p>The last question, I will try to answer.  I strongly believe that the current crisis, the crisis that is hitting the world, both from a financial and an economic point of view in the last months, it is teaching the industry and the world that together with sustainable profitability, in order to have sustainable profitability, the level of risk, the level of leverage, the level of solidity has to be different from the past.  And those banks that will be consistent enough to be on these performance indicators that maybe are a bit more difficult to evaluate than just quarterly profits will, in the medium term, will have an advantage.</p>
          <p>Companies that are in good shape, and I agree with you, might look at the world as a shopping mall.  But here, the last strength, as I mentioned before, comes on the stage and that's complexity.  I believe that the most important lesson that the crisis has taught the world is that complexity is a net destroyer of value and when I say complexity, I mean the diversification, geographical diversification, business diversification size, obviously size is a value, is an advantage up to a certain level, but after a certain level, it becomes a liability.</p>
          <p>So this is the one to prepare the answer.  We would be very much non-interested in very transformational deals, because the level of complexity of a bank like ours that is already more than 100,000 people in 14 countries would become too high.  We are not interested certainly in big deals anyhow.  Within each of the divisions of the group, if we find ways to swap activities or to buy very targeted and very focused businesses that reinforce our own activities in areas where we know the business and where we have the strength and the market share to compete, there, we might be interested.  But this is probably not yet the right time and waiting for the winter not to pass, maybe, but for spring to appear beyond the hills maybe is better.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you very much.  Just one very last technical question.  In the event that non-performing loans goes above what you think, how &#x2013; can you remind me how it works with your generic provision?  You have &#x20AC;2.5 billion of generic reserves.  But the Spanish bank had a very, very high coverage ratio and they've been reducing their coverage level by using generic reserves.  In Italy and in your Group, how does it work?  I mean, because we've never been in this situation for many, many years.  So what are the limits for the procedures to use the generic reserves without hitting your P&amp;L, if there is a possibility there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If the reserve and should the real need arise, we can use it.  But we don't expect this need to happen and we have decided &#x2013; we decided and we confirmed that in the last few quarters that we want to keep the level we have at least for the time being, because we believe it's a strength of ours to have this reserve of last resort, if I can use the word.  But obviously it's money we can use should the need arise.  Again, we don't expect it to use and maybe even and we expect it to keep it at this level for the rest of the crisis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.  I have a question more on the fiscal item on which you already elaborated, but if you can, going back for a while, can you confirm that looking forward, you should not benefit any longer from additional one-off positive fiscal item?  And secondly, taking into account or, let's say, excluding such an item, what would be your tax rate guidance for the current year?  Because we've seen other banks were coming up with higher tax rate compared to previous expectations.</p>
          <p>Next question on this item, if I remember well, we were talking about a 60% haircut imposed by Bank of Italy in calculating the impact of such, of the benefit of such a fiscal asset through the Tier I.  So, if I understood properly, you said something different, that you have a negative impact from the use of this fiscal benefit?</p>
          <p>Then getting back to my second question, some of your competitors along with first quarter results had said that net interest income is likely to bottom down in second quarter and whereas commission, on the other hand, may have already bottomed down in the first quarter.  Do you share this view or you are even a bit more optimistic, thanks to the hedging impact that would be fully in effect in second quarter?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, as far as the first question, no more additional fiscal item.  Yes, I confirm that with the present fiscal regulation that there is no more to take, but maybe the fiscal authorities will be creative.  In any case, we don't expect anything else and we don't plan for any other one-off fiscal item.</p>
          <p>Tax rate, without taking into consideration the non-recurring item we mentioned before, something between 32 and 34, difficult to make a better estimate.  I confirm that the intangible, the taxation had a negative impact in the sense that the net impact on the usable equity for the ratios have decreased by 500 million.  And, if this is the question, yes, we will confirm that we pay them around of 15 basis -- the cost in terms of Core Tier I is around 15 basis points.</p>
          <p>Forecast in terms of net interest income, without the hedging facilities, almost certainly the second quarter would be in the bottom.  In our case, this trend is certainly partially compensated by the hedging, but it is reasonable to believe that the second quarter would have been or might be the bottom of the trend on the net interest income.</p>

          <p>We are completing the medium term funding and that has certainly no commission connected to it.  We will have more bank insurance.  We might have some but very limited front fee income.  And then it will depend on when the commissions coming from Corporate and Investment Banking Division that to a certain extent, there is not a linear kind of trend.</p>

          <p>Yes, good afternoon, Mr. Passera.  Actually, you answered all of my questions.  I just have a technical one left on the coverage ratio, because if I look to the history of your coverage ratio, I see coverage of non-performing loans and gross doubtful loans down since the beginning of the first quarter of '08.  Actually, some of your competitors say that this is due to lower coverage that new non-performing loans would require right now because of a different treatment of the collateral in their system.  This is quite odd for me because it appears a little bit counterintuitive.  Along with the worsening of the market scenario, I would have expected actually an increase in coverage ratio, so if you could expand on this, it would be great.  Thanks.</p>

          <p>Your observation is absolutely right, but there are changes and I have the answer, because we went through a report this morning here in the board.  We have had a number of positions moving to substandard because the qualities from a formal point of view were such.  But the amount of collateral and the amount of guarantees that are embedded in those positions are such that it would be not reasonable to add a too large provision.  So there are cases and in our case, we had half a dozen of them where the position became soterincla, that means a doubtful loan.  But the quality of the guarantors and the quality of the guarantees are such that the coverage on those specific positions has been very low and they have pushed down about one decimal point the average coverage on our portfolio.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So you are actually saying that it's kind of a mix effect only?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In our case, yes.  Obviously, I can talk also &#x2013; only of our case.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much to all of you and there is nothing else I want to add.  Certainly we are managing through the crisis.  We want to bring our bank through the crisis and get back out of this crisis stronger than before.  Thank you again.</p>
