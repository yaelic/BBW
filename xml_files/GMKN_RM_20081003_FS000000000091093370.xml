        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Norilsk Nickel's first half 2008 financial results. My name is Ulyana Denga, and I'm with Investor Relations at Norilsk Nickel.</p>
          <p>With me today are Mr. Oleg Lobanov, Deputy CEO and Chief Financial Officer; and <mark type="inaudible" /> who is responsible for strategy in our company. I'm sure you have all seen the press release and the financial statements, which we released today on our website, which is www.nornik.ru.</p>
          <p>Oleg Lobanov will now provide you with the details of the Group's financial performance in the first half of 2008 and after that we will have a Q&amp;A session.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for taking part in the conference call. Today, I will provide you with an update on our financial performance and key developments in the six months ended 30, June 2008.</p>
          <p>The Group reporting currency is in the US dollar which is common practice for global mining companies. Each of the group subsidiaries reports in its functional currency which is the Russian ruble for the company and dollars foreign subsidiaries. Those subsidiaries operating with a significant degree of autonomy, such as Stillwater Mining Company and the Norilsk Nickel International use different functional currencies.</p>
          <p>Our auditors issued a review report on these results which was unqualified. Because of the changes in the structure as a Group, it was difficult to make year-on-year comparison between first half 2008 and the same period in 2007. In the first half 2008 statements, Norilsk consolidated the results of four new operating subsidiaries, including OGK-3, Norilsk Nickel Africa, Norilsk Nickel Australia and Norilsk Nickel Finland.</p>
          <p>In the results for the comparable period of 2007, we consolidated operating results of Cawse and Harjavalta for the full month since the acquisition on the 1 March, 2007. That is LionOre were acquired in the end of June 2007 whereas the outstanding controlling stake in OGK-3 in August 2007. Before that date, we accounted for our investment in OGK-3 as an investment in our associates.</p>
          <p>After the acquisition of LionOre, the management of the Group and then independent third-party conducted an extensive feasibility review of the Activox Refinery Project of Tati Nickel, there are no subsidiaries in Tati Nickel in Botswana. Compared to the study conducted by the previous owners, our review highlighted a substantial project cost escalation. The major contributing factors to the substantial cost escalations were as follows: first of all, an increase of construction and equipment costs worldwide, and second, project management costs.</p>
          <p>In addition, short-term energy capacity constraints experienced in Southern Africa have been assessed as the risk factors that would adversely affect the production time and the overall economics of the Activox Refinery Project.</p>
          <p>Taking into consideration the major escalation of cost, the Group made a decision to postpone the project indefinitely. As a result, the Group recognized US$765 million impairment loss on mineral rights reported as part of property, plant, and equipment, and a US$325 million goodwill impairment on the acquisition of LionOre.</p>
          <p>Following the postponement of the Activox Refinery Project, Group management reviewed the estimate of its impairment of tangible and intangible assets as of 30 June, 2008. As a result, construction-in-progress of US$155 million was impaired and the provision of US$150 million for probable cash outflows, associated with cost of obligations under certain <mark type="inaudible" /> contract was also recognized.</p>
          <p>You can find these the most under other net operating expense slide in footnote 18. The Group also performed goodwill impairment testing of OGK-3 as of 31st December, 2007. As a result, an impairment charge of US$754 million was recognized for goodwill in our full-year 2007 financial statements.</p>
          <p>In the period between 15th January, 2008 and 14th February, 2008, OGK-3 acquired 2,010 million ordinary shares for a cash consideration of US$332 million, increasing the Group's ownership in the company to 68%. As a result of this transaction, the Group recognized a decrease in net assets attributable to minority interest of US$252 million and an increase in goodwill in the amount of US$80 million.</p>
          <p>Now, let me go through the figures in detail. I would like to start with revenues. Period-on-period, total revenue which consists of metal and other sales increased by US$425 million or 5% from US$7,886 million in first half 2007 to US$8,311 million in first half 2008.</p>
          <p>In first half 2008, revenues from metal sales totaled US$7,210 million, which represented a 6% decrease compared to first half 2007. The main factor is 25 decrease in nickel sales due to a 38% decrease in average nickel prices compared to the first half 2007. This decrease was partially offset by the positive price trends for the other metals produced by the Group such as copper, platinum, palladium and gold.</p>
          <p>The second compensating factor was reporting full operating results for LionOre and its subsidiaries, Harjavalta Nickel Oy and Cawse Proprietary Limited in the first half 2008 compared to reporting the four month results for Harjavalta Nickel and Cawse Proprietary Limited in first half 2007.</p>
          <p>Revenue from non-mining operations increased by US$860 million or 357% and amounted to US$1,101 million in first half 2008 compared to US$241 million in first half 2007 mainly due to the consolidation of OGK-3 into the Group financial results from 7 August 2007.</p>
          <p>Gross profit of non-mining operations increased by US$12 million and amounted to US$38 million.</p>
          <p>The cost of metal sales increased by 46% from US$1,831 million in first half 2007 to US$2,677 million in first half 2008.</p>
          <p>Our cash operating cost increased by 21% and amounted to US$2,257 million in first half 2008 against US$1,861 million in first half 2007.</p>
          <p>The key reasons for the US$780 million or 35 year-on-year growth in total cash operating costs before revenue from sales of by-products in first half 2008 were: First of all, the almost US$300 million effect of consolidating cash operating costs of all Norilsk Nickel International subsidiaries for the whole of first half 2008, compared to consolidating only Harjavalta Nickel Oy and Cawse results from 1 March 2007 in first half 2007.</p>
          <p>Second, absolute increase in cash operating costs by US$354 million, and the last one, translation effect of US$127 million in the reporting currency. Sales of by-products in first half 2008 increased by US$384 million or 98% and totaled US$774 million mainly due to an increase in selling prices for by-products and the consolidation of Norilsk Nickel International operations.</p>
          <p>The cost of other sales increased by US$848 million or 394%, mainly due to the consolidation of OGK-3 results starting from 7 August 2007, the date when the Group obtained a control over OGK-3.</p>
          <p>In first half 2008, selling and distribution expenses decreased by US$11 million or 3% to US$320 million versus US$331 million in first half 2007. The decrease was mainly due to a significant decrease in custom duties expense that is in line with the development of export revenue generated by the Russian subsidiaries of the Group, which form the basis for calculation of custom duties. Some increase in other lines of selling expenses is due to consolidation of OGK-3 and Norilsk Nickel International results in first half 2008.</p>
          <p>In first half 2008, general and administrative expenses increased by US$152 million or 45% to US$492 million compared to US$340 million in the first half 2007. Main drivers of this increase are consolidation of OGK-3 as well as subsidiaries in first half 2008 and a general increase in labor cost.</p>
          <p>During first half 2008, other net operating expenses increased by US$242 million to US$407 million, compared to US$165 million in first half 2007. The main reason for the increase was the recognition of an impairment provision of US$162 million and the change in provision for onerous contracts of US$150 million, both associated with ongoing reassessment of impairment provision of BMR plant. This increase was partially compensated by significant decrease of donation expenses by US$65 million or 63% to US$38 million in first half 2008 compared to 103 million in first half 2007.</p>
          <p>During first half 2008, finance cost increased by US$171 million to 20 -- to US$224 million as compared to US$53 million financing costs in first half 2007. The increase of finance cost was mainly due to new borrowings made by the Group in June and second half of 2007, proceeds of which were used to acquire OGK-3 and LionOre.</p>
          <p>Profit for the period decreased from US$4,015 million in first half 2007 to US$2,682 million in first half 2008 as a result of the lower prices for metals, inflationary growth of costs, consolidating the results of OGK-3, LionOre and its subsidiary, Harjavalta Nickel Oy and Cawse Proprietary. You can find more detailed information in our press release.</p>
          <p>Thank you for the attention. And we are ready to answer your questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Robert Edwards from Renaissance Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon. Thanks for the call. What I'd like to -- you to maybe give us some color on, is the precise allocation of capital expenditures for the first half of the year by the major projects and/or regions and what you expect for the full year on the same basis? That's my first question. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. This is Oleg Lobanov. Our key investment priorities in 2008 are the following. So we continue the development of the Skalisty Mine in Polar division. We re-conducted the expansion of the capacity of Nadezhda flash smelter in Polar division.</p>
          <p>The continued development of Severny-Glubokiy mine at Kola Mining Company. We continue the expansion of all the major mining projects at Polar division. We are finalizing creation for our cargo carriers, not requiring ice breaker systems. So we are introducing in to use three more vessels and the last one will devote into use in February next year.</p>
          <p>We upgrade our Talnakh and Norilsk concentrators. And we initiate the construction of gas and condensate passing system from Pelyatka ground deposit to Dudinka port <mark type="inaudible" />.  In total we expect our CapEx program around $2 billion this year. In our foreign operation, the main project is increase of capacity of Nkomati mine in South Africa. So, that's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's the total group figure of $3 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it does.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a second question. You recently made the announcement that your subsidiary companies are going to be buying potentially up to 16 odd million shares in the Norilsk Nickel, and also prior to that you had announced you were going to buy 7.9 million shares, that's around $250 a share at current exchange rate. So, both given current market circumstances, could you just take us through the rationale for both, and whether you're actually going to go through with this buyback in it's full entirety, probably before year end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is again Oleg Lobanov. The rationale for this transaction was as follows: in the Q2, the company centralized treasury policy, and responsibility of the headquarter treasury is to consolidate and create the cash plan or budget of free cash on account of the coal subsidiaries in the group. And in early September of this year, the treasury issued the recommendations for several companies purchasing significant cash balances on their accounts, taking into consideration the changing &#x2013; for the changes in the financial market situation to be cautious in placing free cash balances, paying a special attention to the investment rating, credit rating and risk aspects of these financial institutions.</p>
          <p>And we've issued the criteria of choice of these financial institutions and directed this to our subsidiaries. After receiving our instructions, our subsidiary companies have chosen several financial institutions and their Board of Directors approved the decision to place free cash balances of these financial institutions using <mark type="inaudible" /> management.</p>
          <p>After that &#x2013; so this transaction was performed, and the disclosure in our financial statements was related to the Rosbank as a interparty transaction, and other financial institutions were not disclosed because there is no requirements to do that. That's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just to continue on a &#x2013; I mean, for the original buyback which was announced back in August, I mean, you still intend to buyback 7.9 million shares at $250 a share, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Rob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our initial buyback is independent from this transaction and is not under discussion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the current price is $105, right? Okay. I don't have any more questions, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Mikhail Stiskin from Troika Dialog.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Mikhail Stiskin from Troika Dialog. Thanks for this opportunity. I have a few questions. First, can you give us some guidance on the cost escalation in the labor segment at the core Russian operations and international operations of Norilsk Nickel for this year?</p>
          <p>Second, kind of give us some &#x2013; kind of give us your view on the nickel market right now and the supply/demand balance. And it's actually where you see our nickel price in the next three to six months considering the worsening fundamentals of the commodity markets, overall.</p>
          <p>And third question, considering two buyback programs that you have recently launched, are there any plans to cut your dividends for nine months, considering the amount of cash you are going to return to your shareholders via buybacks? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Oleg Lobanov. I will answer the first question. The salary increase escalation factor in our Russian assets, as we discussed already in our 2007 financial statements, is mainly impacted by the decision made in the first half 2007 to perform one more salary increase by 40%, starting from 1st of July, 2007. And this actually impacted our 2007 financial statements providing the salary cost growth slightly above 20%, because this was only six months of 2007 were impacted.</p>
          <p>In 2008, we will have a whole 12 months of this decision being effective, that's why we will have another 20% of salary expense growth 2008 to 2007. And talking about six months financial statement which impacted especially construction because we compare first six months of 2008 that were impacted by this decision with first six months of 2007 that were not impacted by this decision. So, in general, we have approximately 20% salary expenses growth, from 20 to 22 in different divisions. But this is not exactly the salary growth rate total in Russia, this is slightly lower because of our special decisions.</p>
          <p>Talking about other cost items, I would say that expected inflation rate in Russia for this year is around 15%. Talking about our international subsidiaries, the lowest figures is for Finland. It's around 2%. And in South Africa, Botswana and Australia the figures are close to 10. And for the second question is, <mark type="inaudible" /> will provide an answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The third question related to market development, and I'll read on that. Taking into account the current <mark type="inaudible" /> situation, it would be hard to forecast how the markets will be developing in the short-run. There we see anyway strong fundamentals for the medium term because the situation though bad in Europe and the US, still much better in Russia, and we expect that particularly China and India will drive our growth in this industry for the years to come, particularly starting in a couple of years ahead.</p>
          <p>As far as the current situation and when nickel is as low as $16,000 per ton and in the course of this quarter, the first quarter, the drop was about 30%. So definitely, very hard to forecast that it will recover soon, so we expect that the pricing will be at this level for a short run.</p>
          <p>In terms of balancing supply and demand under this environment, we see clearly that very substantial decline in production previously generated by marginal producers, and this definitely creates a big opportunity for producers like Norilsk Nickel which find themselves on the lower part of a cost curve. And we believe that Norilsk Nickel is probably the best company positioned to benefit from the future growth in price.</p>
          <p>But sales, again, I can just reiterate that under these current circumstances when we see markets crashing and overall <mark type="inaudible" /> globally, and we <mark type="inaudible" /> strong influence from previously huge speculative markets on nickel prices. We believe that the current situation will continue for sometime.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Talking about interim dividends, the Board of Directors of the company has not <mark type="inaudible" /> discussed this issue. And as the management of the company, we believe that announced program of buyback of about $2 billion should be enough reward for our shareholders. And we do not recommend to the Board to consider the interim dividends for nine months returns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Dmitriy Kolomytsyn from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. It's Dmitriy Kolomytsyn from Morgan Stanley, yes. Just to confirm, you just said that since you guys are buying back shares, you're not going to pay dividend for nine months or you're not planning to recommend or you haven't recommended just because you're buying back shares?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We <mark type="inaudible" /> to pay interim dividends but the final decision will be by the Board of Directors subject to approval by the shareholders' meeting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when is it going to happen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This issue is not on the agenda.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, got you. Then the other question that I have; I know that you're probably one of the best positioned -- one of the companies that's best positioned in terms of a short-term debt, you have about 1.3 billion of short-term debt on your books right now. Any plans to pay it back or refinance it or maybe you have sort of maybe certain constraints in terms of refinancing this debt, can you shed some light here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually the amount that you've mentioned, it's only a short-term portion of our total debt portfolio. And we are going to pay back syndication of our &#x2013; so we have a problem of refinancing our debt portfolio. We expect some refinancing by <mark type="inaudible" /> amount of 400 million but this is refinancing, this is not increase of our total debt portfolio. In general, we do not expect in forthcoming six months any significant movement in our debt structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just got a follow-up on the cash flow statement. If I look at the investing activities, there's a 2.5, what $2.4 billion purchase of other financial assets and 4.2, $6 billion proceeds from the sale of other financial assets. Could you just give me some kind of breakdown as to what constitutes those financial assets apart from OGK-3?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is a movement of our deposits and loans. So, this is not a very straightforward explanation from this slide. But actually this is purely financing activities result in relation to these financial institutions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And just a follow-up question; you gave production guidance in July when you released the first self-production numbers, are you still on track to meet those production targets for this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We planned to provide updated production figures as a result of our nine months production activities and down -- for the year 2008 by the end of October. And today, we discussed our financial statements for six months. And so as you've mentioned, we've already published our six months production results. So, we are not going to provide any additional information about production for nine months. So...</p>

One question follow-up on transfer of cash from your subsidiaries under management of &#x2013; as managers you announced there someday &#x2013; could you just clarify, well actually this forms for the transferred under management? And what's the inception date for asset managers, for managing this portfolio? Was it before September 28, when you announced about the decision or to place after the announcement? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Just one quick clarification that I would like to make here. So if you are saying that your buyback progress is still effective and if I read your press release dated August 22, you were planning to buyback 7.9 million shares at the price of approximately $250. So if I would like to participate in the buyback, I go buy shares now, submit my application and I can participate in the buyback on a prorata basis. Is that a correct statement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. It's Ulyana Denga. Sure, you can participate right now it's a tender over last &#x2013; since the 29 of September till the 28 of October. That is for local shareholders and even on the 28 of October you still can tender your shares, if your application form is completed fully and absolutely right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Great. And just one final question that I have. Do you think you could provide us with some CapEx guidance, for let's say '09, 2010, or as far as you can go? And what are you &#x2013; well, I mean just CapEx guidance as far as you can go maybe?</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, not because our strategy program for this year &#x2013; this year is under serious revision. And when it will be approved by the Board, it will be published and discussed in some ways. At the moment, we are not ready to discuss these figures.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you. In the press release there is some unit cost issue that LionOre was in -- well, the international operations weren't in there. Could you take us through what's happening with the cost at Lake Johnson and also Tati Nickel? And what's happening in fact with -- just in -- an overall brief on the operations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as far as our Australian operation particularly Cawse, you know that Cawse operation was suspended due to the gas explosion accident back in spring this year. And frankly, the management of Norilsk Nickel International along with the management of the headquarter company is considering the possibility of re-launching Cawse in the short run.</p>
          <p>We feel -- we can see in the operation at our other Australian assets including Lake Johnston and Black Swan and Silver Swan. So it is going as usual. As far as the Tati Nickel, we don't have any specific changes in our operation at Tati Nickel. And as it was previously mentioned we consider expansion of Tati producing capacity from existing 5 million to 12 million tons per annum. But it will take place next year. As far as -- and we also have another melting plant in concentration at Tati and, you know that we also considering the Dense Media Separation plant.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. I just have one question. Do you plan to buy back any of your outstanding euro bonds sometime in the future?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>No. We will wait till their maturity and then we will, I think, pay them back. At the moment, we do not consider euro bond market as attractive one.</p>
