          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Canadian Natural Resources 2011 Fourth Quarter and Yearend Results Conference Call.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Corey Bieber, Vice President Finance and Investor Relations for Canadian Natural Resources. Please go ahead, Mr. Bieber.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for attending this conference where we will discuss our fourth quarter and annual 2011 results, which was included in our press release issued earlier today.</p>
          <p>Participating with me today are Allan Markin, our Chairman; Steve Laut, our President; Doug Proll, our Chief Financial Officer; and Lyle Stevens, our Senior Vice President of Exploitation.</p>
          <p>Before I start, I would like to refer you to the comments regarding forward-looking information contained in our press release, and also note that all dollar amounts are in Canadian dollars, and production and reserves are both expressed as before royalties, unless otherwise stated. I'll make some initial comments before I turn the call over to the other participants.</p>
          <p>I believe the fourth quarter of 2011 was very strong from both an operational and financial perspective with record quarterly crude oil drilling, total crude oil and NGL production, total BOE production, and of course, record quarterly cash flow.</p>
          <p>During 2011, we also replaced almost four times of our production on a 2T basis and exit with a very impressive 21.4-year proved reserve life index, or 33.3-year proved and probable reserve life index.</p>
          <p>I believe that as you hear Allan, Steve, Lyle and Doug talk about the company's prospects, diverse asset base and strong balance sheet, you will agree the company is well positioned to continue its strong track record of probable growth.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn it over to Allan to get his thoughts on the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Corey. Good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>We are delivering. We ended the year strong, achieving record quarterly cash flow from operations of C$2.16 billion, driven by quarterly production of over 657,000 barrels per day, a record.</p>
          <p>In 2011, we economically grew our diverse asset base, increasing gross proved plus probable crude oil, bitumen, SCO and NGL reserves by 10%, and increasing gross proven plus probable natural gas reserves by 6%, resulting in total company gross proved plus probable reserves of 7.5 billion BOEs. Our total proved plus probable reserve replacement ratio was 390%.</p>
          <p>Our dedicated team delivered strong results from our North American crude oil E&amp;P operations in 2011. Our light oil and primary heavy oil operations executed record drilling programs and achieved 10% and 11% average annual production growth, respectively.</p>
          <p>At Pelican Lake, response to the polymer flood continued to be positive, increasing gross proved crude oil reserves by 15%. And we focused on maximizing oil recoveries through effective well configuration and injection techniques.</p>
          <p>Thermal in situ operations achieved 9% production growth as a result of optimizing steaming techniques and low-cost pad developments at Primrose. We continue to advance the development of our high quality SAGD projects to an active strat well program and through construction on Kirby South Phase 1.</p>
          <p>In 2011, we were selective in our approach in developing our natural gas assets, and focused primarily on liquids-rich plays in northeast British Columbia and northwest Alberta. At Septimus, our unconventional Montney shale gas play, we continued to see results that exceeded expectations. And in the fourth quarter, we completed a tie-in to a deep cut facility to increase liquid recoveries.</p>
          <p>Internationally, we continue to optimize operations in the North Sea and sanctioned an in-fill drilling program at Espoir in offshore Africa, targeted to begin in late 2012.</p>
          <p>We are committed to creating value. We are confident in Canadian Natural's ability to generate significant shareholder value in 2012 through our oil-weighted growth. We will and are continuing to deliver strong operational discipline.</p>
          <p>Over to our president, Steve Laut.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Al, and good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>As both Corey and Al said, the fourth quarter was a strong quarter for Canadian National. Cash flow was up 30% over Q4 2010, with strong production performance driven largely by a very strong oil growth across the company and a solid return of Horizon production in Q4.</p>
          <p>In Q4, Canadian National continued to execute our strategy based on effective and efficient operations and <mark type="ph" /> monopolizing (5:12) capital allocation to ensure we maximize our return on capital, generate significant free cash flow, maintain our strong balance sheet through the price cycles, and transition our asset base to a more sustainable, long-term asset base, and provide the ability to increase dividends on a consistent basis.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural is one of the few companies in our peer group that has a strong, well-balanced and diverse asset base, with significant upside in each component of our business. Our asset base combined with our effective business practices and people are Canadian Natural's competitive advantage. We have on a consistent basis been able to effectively allocate capital. As a result, we generate significant free cash flow and maximize return on capital over the long run and throughout the commodity price cycles.</p>
          <p>Today, with strong oil prices and low gas prices, Canadian Natural continues to allocate capital disproportionally to oil projects. In 2012, we'll deliver significant production growth. Light oil and NGLs in Canada will grow by 17%. Primary heavy oil will grow by 16%, and thermal in situ heavy oil will grow by 10%. And although we stumbled out of the gate, we expect solid horizon production for the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>In addition, we're investing significantly in the future production and value growth in a disciplined, cost effective manner, which also provides us a high level of capital flexibility. Our thermal in situ program will see production increase from 100,000 barrels a day to 480,000 barrels a day of low-cost, high-value heavy oil production.</p>
          <p>At Pelican Lake, our leading-edge polymer flood continues to generate significant value for shareholders as we develop the polymer flood across the pool. And at Horizon, our expansion plans to take production from 110,000 barrels a day to 206,000 barrels a day and ultimately 500,000 barrels a day of light sweet, 34-degree API crude are unfolding as expected.</p>
          <p>We also have a vast natural gas assets, which when gas prices strengthen, will provide the opportunity to unlock significant value for shareholders.</p>
          <p>As we are heavily weighted oil company, I'll briefly comment on the oil markets and the volatility we have seen recently before discussing the status of our operations across the company. Let me start first with the Brent WTI differential, which has been very wide, and as is widely known, due to logistical constraints at Cushing, caused in large part by the increasing Bakken production.</p>
          <p>In our view, this is a short-term situation. We expect when the Seaway reversal comes effective June of this year, this differential to narrow substantially and then return to more typical differentials in early 2013, as Seaway has expanded to 400,000 barrels a day. The return of more typical Brent/WTI spreads will lift all oil prices, light and heavy.</p>
          <p>On the heavy oil side, we have seen significant heavy oil differentials &#x2013; seen heavy oil differentials widen significantly. This, in our view, is a short-term situation caused by planned and unplanned refinery outages. There's greater than 350,000 barrels a day of planned and unplanned refinery outages in Tatou, Canada and the West Coast in April and May, which run largely a heavy oil slate. The loss of demand for this period is the key reason why heavy oil differentials have widened.</p>
          <p>Considering Canada produces about 1.7 million barrels a day of heavy oil, with 350,000 barrels a day out of service in the short term, it's pretty easy to see why heavy oil differentials have widened significantly. It is also clear that they will return to previous levels once these refineries come back on.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we see the expansion of heavy oil refinery capacity of approximately 300,000 barrels a d ay in PADD II between the end of 2012 and mid-2013. That will help offset incremental heavy oil supply in 2012 and 2013. In summary, we expect to see significant improvement in our oil net backs in the second quarter of 2012 and beyond.</p>
          <p>I will now walk you through each of our assets, starting with Horizon, which accounts for just under 17% of our production, but has of late and rightly so garnered lots of attention. Let me first give you a brief description on the events that have happened in the first quarter and update you as where we are today, talked about concerns regarding our operations reliability, and finally, update you on the ongoing expansion of Horizon.</p>
          <p>Firstly, January production was less than expected and was down from the expectations for two reasons. Ore preparation plant or OPP issues, and a leak in the blow-down line in primary upgrading.</p>
          <p>As you know, we're scheduled to complete commissioning of the third OPP in early December, and then start up the third OPP. Given the rest of the completion with Christmas approaching, startup of the third OPP was deferred until after New Year's. Confirming our decision to defer startup, the January startup did not go as smooth as expected. This delay in the third OPP startup also extended the maintenance on both OPP1 and OPP2, which caused some downtime and production shortfalls in January.</p>
          <p>We also had a minor leak in a blow-down line in late January that required a controlled shutdown in primary upgrading. The shutdown lasted three days to complete the repair. And absent the January OPP issues, we have been running at roughly 117,000 barrels a day in January. So all things being equal, this type of shutdown would have caused production to come in just under 110,000 barrels a day for January, and as part of our budget downtime we anticipate for the year.</p>
          <p>The current shutdown occurred as we were bringing the primary operating plant back up after repairing the blow-down line. In this case, we pulled in a slug of water from the <mark type="ph" /> deal bit (11:07) tanks that resulted in damage to the fractionator trees. Taking a slug of water into the fractionating tower should not happen. Unfortunately, taking water into the fractionator is not uncommon in the oil sands as the <mark type="ph" /> fuel (11:20) bit can contain the water.</p>
          <p>Our process and procedures are designed to prevent water from entering the fractionator, and if water does make it to the fractionator, to minimize any damage. In this case, we believe the damage to the fractionator was minimal and that we would like to be shut down for a short time to repair trays in the fractionator that likely have been dislodged from their supports. This belief was based on a fractionator performance after the event and gamma scans completed after the incident.</p>
          <p>At one point, we contemplated running to the 2013 turnaround and not taking a shutdown. However, it would have more expensive to replace poison hydrotreated catalysts caused by poor fractionator performance, and it was unlikely the catalysts would make it to the 2013 turnaround anyway.</p>
          <p>As such, the decision was made on February 2 to take what was believed to be a relatively short shutdown to repair some trades in the fractionator. Once we cooled down the fractionator and were able to assess the damage, it became clear that the damage was significantly more severe than anticipated. At that time, we issued a press release outlining time to complete repairs.</p>
          <p>The fractionator is designed for phase 2 rates of 250,000 barrels a day. As a result, the performance impairment was less than expected for this type of damage, as we're running at just under half the design rates. The repair to the fractionator is on track, and we've made significant progress on our repairs, and we are tracking to our original expectations to be back on stream somewhere between the middle and the end of March, returning to full production rates at that time. The cost to repair the fractionator is roughly $35 million.</p>
          <p>As you expect, this incident has caused us to review and reevaluate the reliability of our operation going forward. On investigation of the incident, it became evident that although our levels of operating discipline have increased significantly in the past year and our procedures are appropriate and effective, there was a gap in our critical start-up guidelines.</p>
          <p>Probably most significantly was the allowance or the ability within our guidelines to conduct critical start-up activities on the night shift. In this case, at 1:30 AM, when operation, supervision and leadership as well as technical process engineering expertise is thin and tired. Clearly, this is a gap that is easy to close and has been closed, with restrictions with critical start-up activities to occur only on day shift, and as a fresh team of operations supervision and engineer expertise can be mobilized.</p>
          <p>As a result of this gap, operations personnel missed steps in the start-up procedure that should not have been missed and would have prevented the damage caused by the water pulled from the dil-bit tanks. In other words, while pulling water from the dil-bit tanks is not uncommon, I believe that had we closed this small gap in our guidelines, which is now closed, and has become a requirement, this instance would have been prevented.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we believe we're in good shape, and there will be a continued emphasis and increased emphasis on operations discipline. However, to increase our confidence and to cover all the bases, we have brought in an independent third party to do a critical view of our operations, our asset integrity, reliability and our operations discipline. This is a relatively new approach but has been used in refineries, chemical plants and the aviation industry. The goal is to essentially identify any potential issues, hazards or gaps before they occur.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we expect Horizon reliability to be enhanced significantly with the commencement of full operations at the third OPP. This will provide us with the ability to ensure we always have two fully running OPPs.</p>
          <p>Historically, the OPPs, due to the brute force work undertaking the OPP, have given us the most issues with reliability, as we have limited intermediate dil-bit tankage available to maintain steady and consistent feed to the upgrader.</p>
          <p>Historically, we've been slowing down the feed to the upgrader or in some cases putting upgrade into circulation until the dil-bit tank's levels having increased, and then increased upgrader rates. To carry this further, continued rate changes at startups are hard on the upgrading equipment, which in itself creates reliability issues on the upgrader.</p>
          <p>With the third OPP, we expect to be able to keep the dil-bit tanks full, and thereby keep the upgrader running at steady, consistent rates going forward. We anticipate the third OPP will be ready to go once we start it back up. However it is a new plant and did not get much run time before this outage. So it's likely there will be a few tanks left to work out, once we start up.</p>
          <p>You'll have noticed that we are taking a very conservative view on Horizon production guidance for 2012. To put our production guidance in perspective, depending on whether we start up this mid or late March, we'll be required to deliver on average from April through the rest of the year between 97,000 barrels a day and 103,000 barrels a day to achieve the low end of guidance.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, with only two OPPs, we averaged 103,000 barrels a day. To achieve the high end of guidance, and again, depending on startup in mid or late March, we'll need to average 110,000 barrels a day to 116,000 barrels a day to achieve the high end of guidance. In January, absent OPP issues, we were running 117,000 barrels a day. Therefore, our revised guidance is conservative, and we should have no issues achieving the guidance range.</p>
          <p>Turning to Horizon expansion, our plan is to expand from 110,000 barrels a day to 250,000 barrels a day and then ultimately 500,000 barrels a day of light sweet 34-degree API crude with no declines for 40 years. As you know, we've broken the expansion into five parts with 46 different pieces to ensure cost control and capital flexibility. The expansion to 250,000 barrels a day will add significant value for shareholders, not only in increased production, but will result in a significant reduction in operating costs and increase plant reliability, a key and often overlooked component of expansion economics.</p>
          <p>Currently, with the exception of the OPPs, we have a single train operation. With the expansion, we will have in most cases a two-train operation providing increased operations flexibility and significantly enhanced reliability, as we'll be able to swing from train to train to perform maintenance, thereby reducing impacts to production.</p>
          <p>The expansion will also have a significant impact on operating cost. With the exception of the mining cost and natural gas cost, our operating costs are largely fixed with the biggest component being labor. Mining costs were roughly C$8.50 a barrel at the current time, and with expansion, we should see some small efficiency gains. Natural gas costs are roughly C$2.50 a barrel assuming a C$3.50 Mcf gas price.</p>
          <p>Therefore, expansion economics look very favorable as operating costs for the entire productions team are reduced significantly. And in a $5 gas world, we expect operating cost to be in the $22 to $28 a barrel range. This reduction in operating costs plus increased reliability, which not only provides more stable revenue but in itself reduces operating costs on a permanent basis, make a significant contribution to the return on capital for Horizon expansions.</p>
          <p>Briefly, our expansion projects are on track. We're running slightly under our cost expectations overall, and we're close to schedule but somewhat behind as we take extra time to get better cost control, a strategy we'll continue to utilize going forward. Hopefully, we'll be able to achieve the same type of success going forward as we've achieved to-date.</p>
          <p>Also of note has been our ability to secure lump-sum contracts with three significant components of expansion, froth treatment, gas/oil hydrotreating and the hydrogen plant, much more than what's anticipated for Phase II, III expansion. And for reference, in Phase I, the plants that were constructed under lump-sum contracts have the best performance from a cost and execution perspective.</p>
          <p>Okay, that's enough on Horizon. Although the current outage is significant for Horizon, it's only 17% of our overall production, and the most recent event has caused us to miss less than 2% of our annual production, but has certainly got much more than 2% of the air time this morning.</p>
          <p>So turning to gas, as you know, our outlook for gas pricing has been bearish for years, and that has not change. We expect gas prices to be low for the next 5 to 10 years. Therefore, it's <mark type="ph" /> unfortunate (19:45) that we are able to leverage our dominant land base and infrastructure to maintain our position as the most effective and efficient producer, and allows our operations to be cash flow positive, even at $2 gas prices.</p>
          <p>Currently, we have roughly 10 million a day shut in due to cost gas price. As you know, our operating costs vary from field to field and average C$1.10 to C$1.15 an Mcf, which gives us the ability to cash flow positive, even at these severely depressed gas prices.</p>
          <p>If gas prices dropped below $2 for a long period of time, and that is a realistic possibility, we'd likely shut in another 22 million cubic feet a day. If they fall below C$1.75 and stay there, another 28 million cubic feet a day will be shut in, a reflection of the strength of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:27) assets and Canadian Natural's effective and efficient operations.</p>
          <p>In light of the recent gas prices, we've taken out roughly $170 million from the remaining $550 million of capital allocated to gas for Q2 through Q4 of 2012, down to $380 million. Of the $380 million, $160 million is allocated to our liquids-rich Septimus development, with just under 90 million barrels of liquids. The remaining capital is allocated for some strategic drilling and land, but largely for turnarounds and to progress required gas well abandonments. This capital reduction will result in gas exit rates being reduced by roughly 39 million cubic feet a day and 1,000 barrels of NGLs. Average rates for the year are down 20 million and 460 barrels a day of NGLs.</p>
          <p>Gas guidance for the year is now 1,247 million cubic feet a day to 1,297 million cubic feet a day, the capital reallocated to debt and potentially increased oil activity later in the year.</p>
          <p>The Septimus expansion remains on track. The plant will be expanded from 60 million to 130 cubic feet a day, with liquids production increasing from 5,200 barrels a day to 10,000 barrels a day. Drilling is meeting expectations, and costs were on track.</p>
          <p>Although low gas prices are challenging for our gas assets, they make returns on our thermal heavy oil assets even greater. Canadian Natural has a dominant land position in the high quality fairway for thermal in situ development. These lands have 78 billion barrels in place, and we expect to recover 8.5 billion barrels from our vast thermal heavy oil resources. Canadian Natural is executing a disciplined, stepwise plan to unlock the huge value of this asset base by bringing on 40,000 barrels to 60,000 barrels a day every two to three years, taking production facility capacity to 480,000 barrels a day of 100% working interest production.</p>
          <p>So far in 2012, we're on track to achieve our targeted production growth of 10% or 107,000 barrels a day at the midpoint of guidance, as additional Primrose development comes on stream. The 2012 Primrose development where we're developing five pads at Primrose East, so we're at 20,000 barrels a day in 2012 and ramp-up to 30,000 barrels a day in 2013, at a cost of just under $13,000 a flowing barrel.</p>
          <p>At Primrose South, we're developing three pads, and we'll have 15,000 barrels a day in 2012, and ramp-up to 20,000 barrels a day in 2013, for a cost of $13,000 a flowing barrel. Primrose pad adds are some of the lowest-cost production capacity additions in the industry, as are Canadian Natural's operating costs, which are targeted coming in under $9 a barrel in 2012, even lower than our benchmark operating cost in 2011, making Canadian Natural's thermal in situ heavy oil production very profitable, if not the most profitable in Canada.</p>
          <p>At Kirby, we remain on track. The Kirby South development is on an overall basis 33% complete and 3% ahead of schedule, with construction 23% complete. All major equipment has been ordered, and we've committed over C$685 million or 58% of the total budget.</p>
          <p>Overall drilling completions is 31% complete with the rig now on the third pad. And most importantly, we are seeing no reservoir surprises and have been able to place the SAGD wells where we want them. Kirby South is currently at 40,000 barrels a day of SAGD production with facility room to grow to 45,000 barrels a day, at a cost of C$32,000 for flowing barrel. First steam is scheduled for November 2013.</p>
          <p>The overall Kirby development will see Kirby South capacity increase to 60,000 barrels a day and Kirby North development to 80,000 barrels a day in two phases, for a total capacity of 140,000 barrels a day.</p>
          <p>At Kirby North, the EBM engineering was completed in Q4, and we are progressing EDS engineering now. The regulatory process remains on schedule with the applications submitted in Q4 2011. We're constructing the main access road, clearing the main plant site, and stockpiling gravel in Q1. First steam is in Kirby North is targeted for early 2016.</p>
          <p>At Grouse, the regulatory application for 40,000 barrels a day of capacity has been submitted this quarter, and Grouse EBM engineering will be completed and EDS engineering kicked off this year. Grouse first steam is targeted for late 2017.</p>
          <p>Turning to primary heavy oil, Canadian Natural has a dominant land and infrastructure position with over 8,000 drilling locations in inventory. As a result, our operations are very effective and efficient, and we are the low-cost producer with over 110,000 barrels a day of primary heavy oil production. We are the largest primary heavy oil producer in Canada. As you know, primary heavy oil generates the highest returns on capital in our portfolio.</p>
          <p>In 2012, heavy oil production will grow by 16% year-over-year with the drilling of 808 wells and a capital program of C$990 million. With Canadian Natural's large inventory of wells, we expect to continue to grow production in the 8% per year range for the next three to four years.</p>
          <p>At our world-class Pelican Lake oil pool, Canadian Natural's leading edge polymer flood has been very successful and has significantly increased oil recoveries. And as Lyle will point out, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:50) increased propellant reserves at Pelican Lake by 15% at year-end. We believe the Pelican Lake Polymer flood will ultimately recover 536 million barrels of additional oil.</p>
          <p>As you know in 2011, we deferred our drilling program, which was scheduled to start up in September 2011, until &#x2013; at the earliest, at the break at 2012. To confirm the learnings we achieved in 2011 and ensure we have the right drilling configuration and optimized execution of polymer flood conversions to maximize capital efficiency going forward.</p>
          <p>I'm happy to say that we're seeing a response in the polymer flood in the southern portion of pool as we expected, and we'll proceed with the planned 2012 program.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural's light oil and NGL growth in Canada has become significant, running at roughly 65,000 barrels a day as we begin to reap the benefits of leveraging technology through water flooding, EOR and horizontal multi-fracs over our large light-oil assets in Canada. We're on track to grow our light oil and NGL production at a target rate of 17% in 2012. Significant production growth.</p>
          <p>2012 capital program will be C$550 million to continue the development of our large <mark type="ph" /> global (26:58) assets, and we target allocating roughly this amount over the next five years and deliver production growth in the 4% to 9% post-2012.</p>
          <p>Turning to our international operations, our strategy is to maintain our existing operations and convert undeveloped resources as slots become available on our platforms, progress the "Big E" exploration in South Africa, monitor acquisition opportunities, and generate free cash flow. And planning for the abandonment of the Murchison platform is also progressing on schedule.</p>
          <p>In the North Sea, production increased slightly as we came off maintenance which offset natural declines in Q4. In Q1, we're on track with required workovers and maintenance as well as subsea work at Lyell, injection wells in Ninian and production wells at Tiffany.</p>
          <p>As you know, Canadian Natural has curtailed much of the volume-adding investments that was in our long-range plans due to the tax changes in U.K. As expected, production declined in the North Sea.</p>
          <p>In addition, in December 2011, a severe storm in the North Sea took out 5 of 10 anchors on the Banff FPSO, causing damage to the FPSO and damaging the subsea umbilicals. This difficult operational situation was handled safely and effectively by our teams in Aberdeen.</p>
          <p>The Banff FPSO has been safely moved to dry dock. The repairs are expected to take roughly 18 months. We'll lose roughly 3,500 barrels a day for 2012 from Banff and Kyle, and as reflected in our production guidance numbers. We have insurance to cover the cost repairs and business interruption insurance to cover the lost revenue.</p>
          <p>In offshore West Africa, as expected, production is declining as we maximize the usage of our existing slot before we begin our infill drilling programs at Baobab and Espoir. The Espoir infill drilling program is scheduled to begin in late 2012 when a tender-assisted drilling rig becomes available, with production increases ramping up in 2013 and expected production increases of 6,550 barrels a day at the completion of the drilling program. With a total cost of C$143 million, C$75 million of which will be spent in 2012, for an overall cost of C$24,000 per flowing barrel a day.</p>
          <p>There is a potential risk however the schedule may get deferred as the rig may get held up, completing work for another operator. We're working to confirm this schedule and potentially make arrangements for alternate rigs if need be.</p>
          <p>We're also making slow but sure progress in tying up all the regulatory requirements before drilling our South Africa exploration well. This series of very large prospects is ready &#x2013; is at the ready-to-drill stage, and has potential for billion-barrel structures, with our best estimate in place of 3 billion barrels. We own this block 100%, which is in deep water with challenging sea conditions. We will in 2012 begin the process of selecting a partner to drill a first exploration well in South Africa, likely in 2013 at the earliest.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'll turn it over to Lyle, who will update on our very strong reserve position at 2011 year end.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Steve. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
          <p>To start our reserves discussion, I'd like to point out that as in previous years, 100% of our reserves are externally evaluated and reviewed by independent, qualified reserves evaluators. Our 2011 reserves disclosure is presented in accordance with Canadian recording requirements using forecast prices and escalated costs. The Canadian standards also require we disclose you our reserves on a gross basis before royalties and on a net basis after royalties.</p>
          <p>Moving on to our results. In 2011, we had another strong year of reserves growth, replacing 249% of our production on a proved basis and 185% to crude oil, bitumen and NGLs, and 140% for natural gas. On a crude proved plus probable basis, we replaced 390% of our production, 189% for crude oil, bitumen and NGLs, and 173% for natural gas.</p>
          <p>Total corporate proved reserves increased by 7% or 326 million BOEs to 4.8 billion BOEs. This consists of 4.4 Tcf of gross proved natural gas reserves and 4.1 billion barrels of gross proved liquids reserves, which includes crude oil, bitumen, SCO and NGL.</p>
          <p>On a proved plus probable basis, total reserves increased by 9% or 636 million BOEs to 7.5 billion BOEs. This is comprised of 6.1 Tcf of gross natural gas reserves and 6.5 billion barrels of liquids reserves.</p>
          <p>The largest increases in reserves were in SCO at Horizon, in Pelican Lake heavy crude oil, and in primary heavy crude oil.</p>
          <p>On the Horizon mining side, crude plus probable synthetic crude oil reserves increased 467 million barrels, a 16% increase. This is the result of the continued delineation of the north pit, and the identification and delineation of an adjacent pit.</p>
          <p>At Pelican Lake, on a crude plus probable basis, heavy crude oil reserves increased by 40 million barrels, an 11% increase, primarily as a result of positive technical revisions due to continued strong response from polymer flooding and de-risking of the process in other regions of the pool.</p>
          <p>In primary heavy crude oil, proved plus probable reserves increased by 32 million barrels, a 15% increase from 2010. This was largely driven by the excellent results of our record heavy oil drilling program. We still have good reserves growth in both natural gas and NGLs as a result of acquisitions, coupled with our modest natural gas capital program.</p>
          <p>On a proved plus probable basis, natural gas increased by 334 Bcf, a 6% increase. Natural gas liquids increased by 51 million barrels, a 61% increase, which was the result of our drilling program though it's focused almost entirely on liquids-rich plays, the strong performance of our Montney project at Septimus, and acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Crude oil, bitumen, SCO and NGLs now account for 85% of our proved preserves and 87% on a proved plus probable basis. Our reserve life index for the company is now 21.4 years using proved reserves and 33.3 years using proved plus probable reserves. Even if Horizon is excluded, we still have long reserve life indices, which reflects the strength of our asset base. It's 14.5 years using proved reserves and 22.3 years using proved plus probable reserves.</p>
          <p>In summary, these excellent results reflect the strength, balance and depth that we have in our asset base.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn the call back to Steve.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Thanks, Al.</p>
          <p>As you can see, Canadian Natural's assets are strong and are delivering value with strong reserve replacements and F&amp;D costs. In summary, Canadian Natural targets cash flow of C$8.2 billion to C$8.6 billion at the strip, with a capital program of C$7 billion generating significant free cash flow between C$1.2 billion and C$1.6 billion in 2012.</p>
          <p>Our production growth is very solid at 10% Q4 2011 over Q4 2012. Very impressive when you consider this growth is organic and 53% of our capital program does not deliver production in 2012.</p>
          <p>Considering the volatility in the global economy today, it's important to point out that we have significant flexibility to reduce our capital program by up to C$3 billion or 42% if a significant event were to occur.</p>
          <p>In summary, we preserve our strong balance sheet, which in 2012 becomes stronger, with debt reduction over C$1 billion and debt-to-book shrinking to 22% at the midpoint of guidance.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural is in a very strong position. With our effective capital allocation strategy, our balanced assets, which contain significant upside, we are delivering strong, oil-weighted production growth, investing significantly in future production growth, yet retaining capital flexibility, paying down debt, and generating significant free cash flow of between C$1.2 billion and C$1.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural will allocate the free cash flow in 2012 to opportunistic acquisitions, if they're available, add value and able to compete for capital. We have increased dividends consecutively for the last 12 years, and as Doug will discuss, we increased our dividend 17% in 2012, and we anticipate this to continue going forward. As well, we'll continue to pay down debt, and lastly, buy back shares.</p>
          <p>In closing, it's clear that Canadian Natural is in great shape. Our management, business philosophies and practices work. We have a strong, well-balanced and diverse asset base with vast opportunities. Our strategy is balanced, effective and proven, and we have control over capital allocation, and are nimble enough to capture opportunities.</p>
          <p>Our strong assets combined with our great teams of people and our culture, which is focused on execution excellence, effective operations and cost control, allows Canadian Natural to build an even stronger, more sustainable asset base, which will generate even more significant free cash flow in the future.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over Doug to discuss our prudent financial management.</p>

      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve, and good morning.</p>
          <p>2011 was another financial success for Canadian Natural. Cash flow from operations was C$6.5 billion or C$5.98 per share, which covered our capital expenditure programs of C$6.4 billion. Net income was C$2.6 billion, and adjusted net income amounted to C$2.5 billion.</p>
          <p>We exited 2011 with C$8.6 billion of long-term debt, compared to C$8.5 billion at December 31, 2011. We retired $400 million of U.S. dollar debt securities in July and then issued $500 million of three-year notes at 1.45% and $500 million of 10-year notes at 3.45% in November. These two issuances were largely precautionary and recognized a very uncertain financial and economic environment.</p>
          <p>At December 31, 2011, we had $3.8 billion of undrawn bank facilities. Our balance sheet metrics strengthened, where debt-to-book capitalization is 27% and debt to EBITDA is 1.1 times.</p>
          <p>Our commodity hedging program was enhanced over the last few months to include Brent collars on 100,000 barrels per day for the remainder of 2012, with a floor of $80 and a ceiling of approximately $135. In addition, we have put options at WTI $80 for 100,000 per day for the remainder of the year. We remain unhedged in our natural gas production.</p>
          <p>The combination of strong balance sheet metrics, available liquid resources, and strong commodity hedging program positions Canadian Natural to execute its business plan for 2012 and plan for the exploitation and development of our diverse asset base.</p>
          <p>In addition to our long-standing adherence to maintaining a strong balance sheet, we have also adhered to a proactive dividend policy. Commencing in 2001, Canadian Natural has implemented a program of consecutive annual increases in our dividend payments to our shareholders. For 2012, we have increased the quarterly dividend to C$10.50 per common share or approximately 17%. This is the 12th consecutive year of increases and represents a 21% compound annual growth rate since the inception of the program.</p>
          <p>And lastly, we closed the books on the Horizon coker fire incident. The company has finalized the business interruption, insurance and property damage insurance claims with the insurers for combined proceeds of C$726 million.</p>
          <p>Thank you, and I will return you to Corey for some closing comments.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from George Toriola from UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Thanks. This question is for Steve. Just based on the performance of Horizon, what gives you the confidence that will see reliable operations going forward? That's the first part of my question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, George. That is a very good question.</p>
          <p>Obviously, we've taken a hard look at ourselves and our operations going forward. I think we have a lot of confidence going forward because we've obviously seen operations discipline increase significantly. I'd be concerned or would have less confidence if we didn't understand what had happened and why it happened, and if we didn't understand how we could fix it.</p>
          <p>And even &#x2013; that is in place. Obviously we know what happened, we know how to fix it, we know the discipline is there. And probably gives us the confidence going forward is we know we have the people in place, and the supervision and the leadership to get us to that &#x2013; a sustained level of operations excellence and deliver production going forward.</p>
          <p>So obviously, we lowered our production guidance here going forward from April on, just to give ourself more room and to be more confident in delivering. And in a way, to take a little bit of a heat off of the operations personnel at Horizon, who are very keen to get back to high levels of production. So that's what gives us that confidence.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And I guess the other part of my question is what is your targeted level of reliability? And if you can link the reliability &#x2013; percentage reliability to your operating costs.</p>
          <p>So supposing, just as an example, if you're operating at 80% reliability, what will be the operating costs? Or maybe just another way to look at that is how much of your operating costs do you really think is variable? I'm just trying to get a little sense between reliability and your operating costs here. And if you can answer that targeted level of reliability please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so targeted level of reliability, we believe the plant can do roughly between 117,000 and 123,000 barrels a day. And we target for about 97% to 96% reliability overall. So that would take you in sort of that 113,000, 114,000 barrels a day production.</p>
          <p>Now, obviously we built in for taking some downtime. And that assumes we have three OPPs going. So that's our reliability.</p>
          <p>On operating costs, I mentioned in the call that our operating costs are mostly fixed. What's variable is natural gas pricing, which is about C$2.50 a barrel. And mining costs &#x2013; obviously, you don't mine unless you're producing &#x2013; at about C$8.50 a barrel. That's the variable cost.</p>
          <p>So you take the average, it's about C$11 a barrel. You have about C$36 a barrel operating costs, on average. And say that's where we're going to be in 2012 going forward. So you take off C$11, you're down to about C$25 a barrel.</p>
          <p>If we have 80% reliability, although it's probably a coarse way of doing it and probably overestimates the operating costs, you could just ratio the 80% reliability to a 97% or 95% reliability range to get your operating cost. So operating cost will go up on that C$25 portion &#x2013; ratio of the production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Greg Pardy of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, good morning. Steve, maybe just to -- can you continue on with Horizon? Could you remind me what you think your all-in OpEx will be post the expansion? And also, when you double capacity, how much of an increase do you think you're going to see in your head count?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So we're going to take capacity to 250,000 barrels a day, and labor will increase, because obviously you need more miners. But that's why I say variable costs for mining. That's where most of your &#x2013; more trucks and shovels.</p>
          <p>As far as technical staff, it doesn't change much. You will need a few operators. But our efficiency on a sort of barrel production per person on staff will almost double as we get to 250,000 barrels. So labor does not have to increase that much, as we go to 250,000 barrels a day, because it is a fixed plants for the most part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I thought you'd throw out some numbers. I didn't quite jot them down. Like what &#x2013; given the numbers you've just given George, when you double this, what do you think a realistic number is for OpEx, taking to account not only the expansion but as well as just labor inflation, everything else going on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we think at today's rates and assuming a C$5 gas price &#x2013; obviously we're a lot lower than that today &#x2013; we would be in that C$22 to C$28 a barrel range for expansion. Probably somewhere right in the middle is where we're likely going to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, C$22 to C$28, all in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah. That does good things for the economics.</p>
          <p>One that's -- just a nit then. Just with Kirby South, looks like the capital there went from C$350 million to C$480 million. Just curious what I'm missing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually Kirby &#x2013; I'm not sure what you're referring to. But the Kirby capital has been unchanged. Maybe by some Kirby North. But Kirby South capital all-in will be about C$1.2 billion to bring on the 40,000 barrels a day. That number has not changed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. And the last question is &#x2013; and this question does come up to returns and things like that. But also your point around the transition to a longer-term sustaining asset base, with that comment, are you really speaking to the expansions you're doing at Horizon? Or are there additional pieces of the company that are going to move into place as you grow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So let me just go back on Kirby, before we talk about the transition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The difference in capital, Greg, is strat wells for future drilling.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[indiscernible (46:21) that's what throws you off.</p>
          <p>Okay, so the transition -- obviously part of it is Horizon. Part of <mark type="ph" /> it's at thermal (46:27) expansions at Kirby, Primrose, Grouse, Birch Mountain. If that helps.</p>
          <p>Also we are, as you know, in our light oil properties, implementing more and more EOR and water flood projects, which also gives you a longer reserve life and more stable production base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the last question from me then. What's your natural decline rate in nat gas? And then what would it be in oil ex synthetic, oil and liquids ex synthetic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So gas declines all in, with our drilling that we got going on right now, it'd probably be about 19%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would say before probably back in 2007, it was closer to 25%. So you see the transition to gas asset base. Our light oil asset base without the synthetic is probably about 15%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>So is that 10 million that has a free cash flow breakeven well above $2? Is that why that's shut in?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's shut in. Most of that is higher operating costs, and a lot of it is what little gas we have going to third-party plants. That is, on sort of not a fixed rate &#x2013; a take or pay contract. So we can shut it in any time we want.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the reduction in the natural gas spending of C$170 million from what you've said before, my understanding was that before you were already then just drilling on liquids-rich plays, and then unconventional plays. So the reduction of C$170 million, where exactly is that being cut from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is being cutting from all our plays except Septimus. So in northwest Alberta, in our liquids-rich plays, we are cutting out drilling as well. So it's in that C$170 million. We're drilling a few strategic wells to delineate plays and to preserve some land, but almost all our drilling on all wells except Septimus <mark type="indiscernible" /> (49:05)</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you're cutting on liquids-rich plays, I thought those economics were still pretty good. What is the situation there? Is that just the transportation or the &#x2013; what is it that makes those liquids-rich plays there uneconomic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends on the degree of liquid rich. So we're obviously in Septimus, we're making 90 barrels a million. That goes easily at C$2 of gas price. But as you get down into the 20 or 30 barrel a million plays that we have in some of the Northwest areas, the return on capital is just not that good. So we'll preserve that for when prices increase. And we'll take that capital and either pay down debt or potentially increase heavy oil drilling later in the year, which gives us a better return on capital, which as you know, is our whole strategy of maximizing capital return.</p>
