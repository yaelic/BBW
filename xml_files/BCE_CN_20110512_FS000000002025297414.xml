          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the BCE's First Quarter 2011 Results Conference Call.  I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Thane Fotopoulos.  Please go ahead, Mr. Fotopoulos.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dawn, and good morning to everyone on the call. Our call today, as you all know, will focus on BCE's Q1 results that were just issued earlier this morning, and as usual, I'm joined here today with our CEO, George Cope and our CFO, Siim Vanaselja. The release, along with our Q&amp;A supplementary financial information package and slide presentation, are all available on BCE's website.</p>
          <p>Then following a review of the slide presentation by George and Siim, we'll move to Q&amp;A and answer as many of your questions as time permits. Because we are holding our Annual General Shareholders' Meeting this morning, which begins at around 9:30, we're going to end this call earlier than usual, just before 9:00 am. So, please be aware of that.</p>
          <p>However, before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's remarks will contain certain forward-looking statements with respect to such items as revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EPS, free cash flow and capital intensity. Several assumptions were made by us in preparing these forward-looking statements, and there are risks that our actual results will differ materially from those contained or contemplated rather by our forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>For additional information on such assumptions and risks, please consult BCE's 2010 Annual MD&amp;A as updated in BCE's Q1 2011 MD&amp;A and BCE's press release dated May 12, 2011, announcing its financial results for the first quarter of 2011. All of these are filed with the Canadian Securities Commission and with the SEC and are also available on our website.</p>
          <p>Any forward-looking statements made by BCE represent our expectations as of May 12, 2011 and accordingly, are subject to change after such date. Except as may be required by Canadian securities laws, we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, and I am making this cautionary statement on behalf of both George and Siim, whose remarks today will contain forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>So, with that behind us, George, I'll hand it over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, Thane. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. I am on &#x2013; or going to start on with slide four, headline would be Continued Progress. And let me start there and say that we had we believe from management's perspective, an excellent first quarter driving towards all of our five strategic imperatives. I think the highlights of the quarter being the early completion of the CTV acquisition and very strong first quarter for wireless, consistent with last year's postpaid net adds.</p>
          <p>The continual roll-out of the Fibe TV footprint and the continual imperative on cost management helping to drive our EBITDA growth to 6.4% EBITDA growth year-over-year, and our best EBITDA results in over eight years.</p>
          <p>Turning to page five, wireless had another strong quarter. We continue to grow the business and meet our expectations in terms of market share with our focus, as I said on the call last quarter, continuing to be in the postpaid market where clearly the profits are, the ARPU are and the EBITDA growth is. 81,000 postpaid net adds, continuing to achieve our target of market share that's representative of the position we believe we should have in the marketplace, considering we see the acceleration of smartphone penetration enabling us to drive ARPU growth year-over-year of 3.2% and growth in our data revenue of 38%.</p>
          <p>You will, of course, note that our COA has increased year-over-year and that's really driven by the mix of postpaid customers taking more and more smartphones. You'll note also we have aligned our method of calculating COA to align with others in the industry and COM to make it easier for the analyst community to compare those numbers.</p>
          <p>So, our focus continues on postpaid and moving the right direction and, particularly, Siim will talk about the financial performance, which we're very pleased with on wireless.</p>
          <p>Turning to the next slide, as everyone knows one of the important parts of driving the turnaround Bell Mobility over the last couple of years has been the investment we've made in HSPA+ and the leadership there that we've pursued with the new network.</p>
          <p>This morning, we are announcing that we will have LTE available in certain markets in 2011. It's also worth noting that the rural footprint expansion of LTE will be contingent on 700 megahertz availability. And again, all of this build out in '11 and as we go forward into '12 will be accommodated within our capital budget this year and within our 16% capital intensity as we go forward also into 2012. So, look for us to launch certain markets for LTE this year.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide seven, continual improvement in our NAS loss line trajectory. I think that's been one of the continual discussions we've had with the analyst community, can we continue to see that benefit, and we have again with the NAS losses coming in at 59,000 in the first quarter this year, versus 100,000 in the first quarter last year. So, again, continuing to see the benefits of the other services in the home we're offering, competitive attention on the business side is always there. It was nice to see a positive growth there, part of that helped by wholesale net adds. And most importantly, it's the best wireline voice performance we've had in more than six years, with the decline in voice revenue of just 3.5% in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to Bell TV, strong quarter on revenue growth of 7.5%, ARPU growth of 4.4%. We continue to ramp up Bell Fibe TV, interesting for us early on that 30% of the customers taking Fibe TV are bringing all three products with them to Bell. The footprint is now just over 800,000 households and we're on track for our targeted number at the end of the year of 2 million households.</p>
          <p>In terms of the growth in net adds, we've clearly seen increased competition for the satellite business in Western Canada and in the Atlantic territory, with the growth of IPTV that we've seen in the competitive intensity in those markets. And so, what we thought we would do here is also to make sure the Street understands that in Ontario and Qu&#xE9;bec we had net adds of 12,000 in the first quarter, driven principally by the early growth we're seeing at Fibe TV.</p>
          <p>Wholesale net adds were flat year-over-year. We continue to benefit, though, from the, we think, the execution of Telus in the TV business in West, and that's clearly important that it was flat for us year-over-year. And so, the intensity on the competitive side in the West and Atlantic is really what drove the 8% net whereas Ontario and Quebec 12, represents some of the early growth we're seeing in Fibe TV. Obviously, the financials on TV were excellent and continued to drive significant revenue growth for the organization.</p>
          <p>Turning to the next slide. On the wireline data side, residential wireline data, we had a very strong quarter, internet ARPU up 2.3%, net adds up year-over-year, principally driven by Fibe Internet and the pull through of Fibe TV. So we're continuing to see a reduction in churn on the internet side. Really happy with that part of the business from a residential side.</p>
          <p>On the business market side, not the same results. Business data product revenue, so product revenue, we have that in part of our data numbers as well, was much lower year-over-year, principally due to the xwave acquisition, which we have in last year's numbers. There was a soft quarter in terms of hardware sales there, and also $17 million less revenue year-over-year on the business side, that was one time for us in the Olympics last year. So overall, the business side continues to be softer than we would like and on a consolidated basis, we're pleased with the data growth on the consumer side.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 10, as everyone knows, we did close the transaction a quarter earlier, we've rebranded it Bell Media. We've introduced a number of new services. Most importantly, when we announced the acquisition, we said it would be financially accretive this year, and you can see here that we're expecting an adjusted EPS of $0.07 per share for the first nine months of ownership of the asset this year. And, I think, most important from a value perspective for our shareholders is the acquisition price which was announced at 9.6 times latest 12 month EBITDA. At the time now of closing, it's actually moved into 8.2 times trailing EBITDA and that's because of the strong performance that we continue to see in the new Bell Media assets.</p>
          <p>Also for our shareholders, we are in the midst, at the moment, of renegotiating new rates for TSN and RDS, from our customers being, obviously, the distributors of our product. And this is the first rate increase that's been done in 10 years. And at the moment, our product is priced below that of our competitors in that space. So, we think that also over time will be a potential upside of the acquisition.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 11.  Early on, we have launched some new Mobile TV services. We continue to believe and are really excited, particularly, with the size of the screens now with the tablets, that this area of the growth is going to continue to be important. Bell Media is offering packages on commercial terms to all Canadian wireless providers now, and it has access to TSN, you can see BNN, CTV News, and it's over to those companies to decide if they want to distribute those packages or not.</p>
          <p>We have launched them at Bell Wireless, and we think it's a really unique method of pricing, because it ensures that the consumer, that they know how much they're using. In other words, data is a really tough thing for a consumer to understand how many hours of TV they're watching. It's not intuitive. So, we've priced video as a separate product in our portfolio, Mobile Sports for $5 a month, for ten hours. Mobile TV and the Variety and News, and you can see here you can do the combined at different prices.</p>
          <p>We're seeing great growth early on in this, we're adding over 2,000 customers to Mobile TV on a weekly basis. And we're really excited about this as we go forward, as a differentiator in the market or a great value offer for Bell Media to the other wireless competitors.</p>
          <p>So, in quarterly, strong wireless order for the company certainly in the competitive environment we're in, and most importantly, achieving that 40% margin and EBITDA growth, which Siim will talk about. Wireline trends, the right direction on NAS erosion and some positive numbers on Internet and revenue in TV and Fibe TV growing out and really, obviously, excited about that opportunity given the numbers we're seeing in Western Canada. And so, the faster we get that footprint out the happier we'll be, quite frankly.</p>
          <p>Cost management continued to drive EBITDA growth, investment in broadband everyone continues to see and the CTV acquisition allows us to continue to execute our 4-screen strategy in the marketplace and, as everyone knows, provides us access to content to compete with our other competitors in the marketplace who we buy of our content from today or would have, without the acquisition of CTV.</p>
          <p>And then just to summarize, obviously, we're very optimistic about the outlook for the company with the increase today in the EBITDA EPS guidance as a result of the CTV acquisition. We've announced an increase in our dividend earlier than we had anticipated and, really, the reasons are the early close of the CTV acquisition. The acquisition price, maybe, is the best way to show how positive we are, at 8.2 times earnings EBITDA versus 9.6.</p>
          <p>We've just completed our strongest quarter in eight years on the back of, we believe, excellent wireless growth and ILEC cost reductions. We've increased EBITDA and EPS guidance today and the increase, we believe, is absolutely important that we remain consistent with our capital market strategy and this new dividend and the payout is expected to stay below the midpoint of our payout ratio and ensures that BCE does not go below our payout ratio if we hit the high end of our guidance. So, we're really pleased to announce this increase for our shareholders and it couldn't be a better day, given that it's our Annual Meeting.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to Siim. Thanks, everyone.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, George, and good morning everyone. So, we began the year with all our business segments well-structured and well-positioned for growth. And I'd say our first quarter results show that we're off to a good strong start in 2011. As George said, Bell's operating performance was highlighted by industry-leading wireless postpaid subscriber acquisitions, growing market traction towards Bell's Fibe Internet and Fibe TV, continued improvements in NAS line losses and higher ARPU across all our consumer product lines.</p>
          <p>As you see on slide 15, all of this contributed to good service revenue growth, significantly higher EBITDA growth, year-over-year margin improvement and pretty attractive growth in adjusted EPS. Service revenue growth at Bell this quarter was 1.8% that was driven, largely, by strong wireless and TV revenue growth of 9.2% and 7.5%, respectively.</p>
          <p>Higher residential Internet revenues also contributed to the year-over-year improvement. Overall, top-line growth, less moderated a bit by software business revenues in the first quarter. Our EBITDA grew 6.4% and margins improved two percentage points year-over-year, really, representing our best performance in eight years. And this was driven by standout wireless EBITDA growth of 12.2%, even with higher smartphone activations and customer upgrades, as well as the realization of meaningful Wireline cost savings.</p>
          <p>CapEx accelerated this quarter on broadband fiber deployments and network conditioning in support of IPTV. We also increased investments in client care support systems and self-serve tools, as well as network capacity to accommodate increasing wireline and wireless data consumption. Adjusted EPS, which is before severance and acquisition costs and net of gains on investments, increased a $0.11 per share versus last year and that mainly reflects the benefit of higher year-over-year EBITDA.</p>
          <p>We generated free cash flow of $265 million for the quarter, which was on track with our plan, but $295 million lower year-over-year. And that's, essentially, as a result of the mandated customer rebate payments this quarter from Bell CRTC deferral account balance. And lastly, as anticipated, the changeover to IFRS has had little impact on our P&amp;L or our key operating metrics for 2011. So, with that overview, let me turn to each of our segments, beginning with Wireless on page 16.</p>
          <p>Wireless revenues grew 9.2%, reflecting the positive flow-through of postpaid acquisitions last year, as well as continued strong data revenue growth of 38%. Smartphones represented 55% of postpaid growth activations this quarter, and that contributed to Wireless ARPU growth of 3.2%, representing a fifth consecutive quarter of improved ARPU. This was achieved even as voice ARPU continues to be affected by competitive pricing pressures.</p>
          <p>Wireless product revenues were also higher in the quarter, up 15.1%, reflecting higher year-over-year smartphone sales and upgrades. Wireless EBITDA was the highlight in the quarter, growing 12.2%, and yielding a revenue flow-through to EBITDA of 54%. And this improved flow through resulted in margin improvement of 1.3 percentage points, bringing our margin to 40.3%, and after spending $28 million more in the quarter on customer retention. So, I think a good strong start for wireless.</p>
          <p>Turning to Wireline, our residential services unit maintained good performance trends, with higher year-over-year TV and Internet revenue driving top-line growth of 0.5%. That mainly reflects customer upgrades to higher-priced TV programming packages, growth in Fibe Internet customers and the impact of price increases.</p>
          <p>We delivered our best Wireline voice performance in more than six years, as our local voice and long-distance revenue erosion improved to 3.5% from an average quarterly rate of 7% in 2010. This reflects 41% fewer NAS line losses year-over-year, more win-backs and increased home phone bundle penetration. Also, higher revenues from increased local long-distance minutes contributed to the improvement.</p>
          <p>Our Business Markets unit reported lower revenues this quarter, given last year's upside from the Olympics as well as lower customer spending on hardware and connectivity. Business NAS net additions, however, were positive in the quarter, and that's hopefully a good sign going forward. Wireline EBITDA grew a healthy 4% and margin expanded to 39.1%, benefiting from strong TV and Internet performance, slowing voice erosion and $90 million of reductions in operating expenses. Those cost savings were realized from the year-over-year decline in Olympic-related expenses as well as lower labor cost, the elimination of capital taxes and productivity initiatives in field operations and call centers.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 18, adjusted EPS increased 18%, to $0.72 per share. That strong growth came primarily from three areas: first, mostly from higher EBITDA, second, from lower net pension financing costs and third, from some tax upside as a results of a $0.02, 2% reduction in the statutory tax rate that came into effect for 2011, as well as the earlier than expected resolution of one uncertain tax position this quarter.</p>
          <p>So, in terms of where we are on tax recoveries, we had $0.03 of recoveries per share this quarter, compared to $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2010. Our effective tax rate of 25.5% this quarter is in line with the guidance that we provided to you for the full year. I would say, though, that given the uneven timing of tax recoveries, the effective rate will no doubt vary from quarter-to-quarter through the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>Higher year-over-year depreciation expense reflected increased asset base and a shift in asset mix to slightly higher depreciation rates, and that, together with higher interest expense, did moderate adjusted EPS growth a little bit in the quarter. On slide 19 you have the details of our free cash flow generation, which amounted to $265 million. This is in line with our plan and reflects $226 million paid to customers in the quarter and satisfaction of our deferral accounts balance with the CRTC.</p>
          <p>I can say that that obligation is now fully met. Capital spending in the quarter was $74 million higher year-over-year reflecting accelerated fibre investments and network conditioning to expand our IPTV footprint, as well as increased investment in customer service and network capacity. We do expect CapEx spending to continue ramping up during the course of the year, but remaining within our 16% capital intensity guidance for the full year.</p>
          <p>Our use of working capital increased this quarter due to the timing of supplier payables and the buildup of inventory, and that's normal for the first quarter. During the quarter, our investment-grade credit ratings were reconfirmed by all the rating agencies and we took advantage of good market conditions to raise $1 billion of seven year medium-term notes. That increased our cash balance to $2.1 billion at the end of March in anticipation of the financing for the closing of the CTV acquisition on April 1st. So, our balance sheet and liquidity position remain very strong.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, the financial performance of both Bell Wireless and Bell Wireline are tracking to the guidance target that we provided back in February. Now, with the completion of the CTV acquisition, which will be consolidated in our financial results beginning in the second quarter under the new segment Bell Media, we're revising upward our 2011 financial guidance for revenues, EBITDA and adjusted EPS.</p>
          <p>We're also pleased to report that at closing, the transaction purchase price represented an even more attractive standalone valuation of 8.2 times proportionate LTM EBITDA, compared to the 9.6 times multiple that we announced last September. Our increased revenue guidance to the 9% to 11% growth range reflects the inclusion of CTV for Q2 through Q4. CTV is benefiting from a strengthening TV and digital advertising market this year and higher subscription revenues.</p>
          <p>Consequently, we're increasing our EBITDA guidance to the 8% to 10% growth range and consistent with this increased EBITDA, for 2011 we're now expecting adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.95 to $3.05 per share, representing year-over-year growth of 6% to 9%. As George said, CTV is expected to contribute approximately $0.07 of earnings accretion per share for the nine month period April 1st to December 31st, and that supports today's announced $0.10 dividend increase.</p>
          <p>Our free cash flow guidance remains at $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion for 2011, as it takes into account the seasonality of working capital and capital spending at CTV as well as acquisition and integration costs that will &#x2013; we will be absorbing this year. So accordingly, we are also maintaining a projected year-end cash balance of $400 million to $500 million.</p>
          <p>With respect to capital expenditures, while CTV operates, I'd say, at a lower level of capital intensity relative to Bell, our overall capital intensity guidance of around 16% of revenues continues to be appropriate. And lastly, before we move to the Q&amp;A, for your reference on slides 21 and 22, I've provided a summary of Bell Media's financial contribution to Bell for 2011, as well as our updated key financial assumptions that underpin our 2011 guidance targets.</p>
          <p>So, with that, I will turn it back to Thane, and we'll move to the Q&amp;A session.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Siim. So, before we start the Q&amp;A period I'd please ask given our time constraints that you please limit yourself to one short question and no follow-up so we can get as many people as possible. So, Dawn, with that, please explain the polling instructions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.  It's good to see both your Wireless margin and postpaid net adds up above expectations. I was wondering if you could provide us with an update on your strategy for Wireless? I believe you'd previously mentioned that your focus this year would increasingly shift from acquisition to retention, but you've still got the highest share of postpaid gain amongst the three national players in Q1.</p>
          <p>So, I was wondering can we expect to see more balanced share in terms of subscribers for the rest of the year and, correspondingly, are we at the inflection point for margin and can we expect to see year-over-year improvement in your wireless margin going forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in terms of the market and the market share, clearly our focus is on postpaid. That's where the value is, that's what all of our distribution channels are focused, that's where we converted. When we acquired Virgin, we converted their focus from a prepaid organization to a postpaid organization and with the <mark type="inaudible" /> (17:03) smartphones, we think that lends itself to a fairly positive ARPU outlook going forward, particularly, as our mix of postpaid clients converting to smartphones continues to grow. So, that's the positive.</p>
          <p>The acquisition of The Source, we think, has been very important in the branding of the company in the HSPA, all driving the market share position we have and have benefited from. It's impossible on a call to forecast market shares, other than to say, as you know, our target and our goal was to make sure we were taking ourselves from a couple of years ago in the low 20s to under 20, to make sure we are capturing over 33% of the postpaid market. And we continue to achieve that goal, and that's our strategy and we're going to continue on that, to execute on that basis.</p>
          <p>In terms of, you are right, we've increased our expenditures on retention, we'll continue to do that as we have the room to make that investment. There is a payback on that, clearly, because as we migrate people to smartphones we see an increase in ARPU, we've talked about that in other quarters.</p>
          <p>And so, we're obviously doing that and the margins on Wireless really are reflected in our consolidated numbers for the year in our guidance and that's as far as I'll go there; other than to say one thing. Obviously, we're pleased in this quarter to get the margin back to the 40%, which we had talked about in the fourth quarter that the investment we believe we are making in subscribers would show some benefits this year, and hopefully the investment community would agree with us, that we saw that benefit with quarterly growth up 12%, yet the same net adds postpaid as we had last year, when most people credited last year's postpaid net adds to the Olympics and there was no Olympics this year.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to &#x2013; just some of your assumptions for your revenue growth in EBITDA. When I look at your previous guidance and your new guidance on EBITDA, it seems that you have not really materially changed your view on the rest of the year for Bell Canada. But there seems to be just a slight implicit lower revenue assumption for Bell Canada on the revenue side for the rest of the year.  Is, am I &#x2013; my math is right or is this due to IFRS or have you really I mean, slightly reduced the Bell Canada revenue assumption for Q2 to Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>No, I can clearly state that the business plans that we put in place for Bell Wireline and Wireless continues to be our business plan. The guidance that we provided in February with respect to Bell is still the numbers that we're tracking to. There's been absolutely no change in our expectations for any sort of reduction in revenues or deterioration in Bell Wireless or Bell Wireline. I'd say, if anything, we're performing through the first quarter at least on track, if not slightly ahead. And all that we've done in updating our guidance, the Bell Media numbers period April 1st to December 31st and included those in our numbers.</p>
          <p>There are a couple of IFRS adjustments that are going through and, if you like, we can take you through some of those offline if you're getting confused with some year-over-year numbers.</p>

          <p>The other thing I'll just mention, it's George. And this would obviously be in Siim's area. Remember, it's not just adding Bell Media, you have to do, if you go to Page 21 and the analysts will, obviously, do this, the intersegment eliminations are important to do. Because if you just add one number to the other and don't do the eliminations, it would look like one of the two divisions. So, maybe that's part of it, but clearly, our Bell revenue numbers and guidance are exactly what they were last time we had the call.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. My question is on Wireline margins. And obviously, cost-cutting activity continues to remain a tailwind, but as we think about the mix shift towards more data and TV, which are lower margin, and a greater commercial push with IPTV through the remainder of the year, how do we think about the Wireline margin trajectory for the next couple of quarters in 2011? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what I would say, the analysts, all you have our outlook on EBITDA and revenue, and so, the margin mix obviously is a balance of the two. The focus in the Wireline business are two things, it's clearly to make the investment in the Fibe TV and our imperatives, yet continue to drive costs out of the business to protect those margins. And it is also important to remember that we are a positive EBITDA business in our TV business because of the revenue growth we continue to see in our satellite TV business.</p>
          <p>So, I'm not going to give a specific guidance on that, but there's not a concern we have of a significant margin erosion in our outlook. But I think it's better reflected in just taking the models that the folks on the phone have on Wireless and Wireline and comparing that to what our annual guidance would be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would just add that I think in February we talked about the visibility that we had in the Wireline business to cost reductions of about $200 million. As we said today, in the first quarter we've delivered on $90 million of those. That included a good reduction in employee head count in our customer operations, as we became more efficient in those operations.  Clearly, we still have visibility into at least the balance of that $200 million by way of reduced support group costs through across the IT network, field services groups and in corporate. We've consolidated a number of the operations between Bell Mobility and Bell Residential on the customer support side and we're generating savings from that.</p>
          <p>And then, on the corporate side, we're going to benefit from the Ontario sales tax harmonization, a reduction in public utility tax rates and in Qu&#xE9;bec, the capital tax abolishment. We're benefiting from a stronger Canadian dollar on our U.S. purchases. So, on the Wireline side, I think we're very much on track to deliver on our charges.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much. My question was on Wireline growth and CapEx, your residential Wireline growth went positive this quarter and, as we look West, we see the potential to increase that even further as IPTV rolls out. So, given that, do you think it still will make sense beyond this year to try to manage Bell to within 16% CapEx to sales, or is there an opportunity here to accelerate growth by stepping up the spending a bit?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Glen, it's George. I did make some reference to 12 on the call and I want, obviously, watch for not giving guidance for 2012. But, the capital markets model and the business model we've outlined for the company, we don't think changes as we go forward and we tend to benchmark ourselves, Glen, also against everyone else on the globe in terms of what their capital intensity is, and we're still a little higher than other places around the world, also executing IPTV and so, we're going to push ourselves to try to keep it within the model and verify that obviously, as we get into next year.</p>

The best, what we've basically done just everyone understands, the industry &#x2013; two of our major competitors moved the residual payments that were paid to distribution channels into retention dollars a number of years ago in their disclosure. We kept those residual payments in our COA and it created, I think for the analysts, confusion every quarter. So, we've moved our residual payments into our retention line item to be consistent with the other two competitors to make that a complete apples-to-apples on COA and retention dollars for everyone. But really nothing has changed internally, that's why we did it.  And I guess on our last year's...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. Two quick ones. Just following up on Peter's question, I guess in the context of the $0.07 of accretion from CTV, but the bands on the guidance only go up by about $0.05, the context being that it's acquisition and integration costs that caused the differential, correct?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's interest expense at the BCE level that goes up a bit.  And then, slightly higher depreciation, which I mentioned on the call, on Bell assets from a shift mix in depreciable assets to slightly higher depreciation rates, so that offset some of that $0.07 accretion.</p>

          <p>...CTV assets. We presume that besides top-line gains you'd add trends like cost controls on programming spend was a key factor. Can you talk to the key drivers of this improved performance in recent months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean the performance has been, as Siim had mentioned, the top-line revenue growth we're seeing in the advertising, increased subscription revenues from our specialty. And the cost management that, frankly, the management team had put in place before the acquisition to reflect some of the economic challenges that that business would have seen 24 months ago. Those are some of the drivers and as we go forward, obviously, this isn't a focused synergy transaction, but there are some synergies that we'll be able to execute on as we go forward into 2012.</p>
          <p>So we're, as you say, we're really pleased with the exit multiple and we're really, obviously, very pleased as we look forward to the &#x2013; not just the financial performance this gives us, but the access it's already given us to, we think, have significant differentiation in the mobile market, in the mobile TV space.  And again, we will &#x2013; we're obviously open for business to sell those &#x2013; those services to <mark type="ph" /> people (40:14) compete with us in wireless but our customers for us in the media side.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I've got a just one larger bigger picture question and it has to do with return of capital of shareholders. You've had solid free cash flow in the quarter, you've got CTV closed, it's a better deal than you originally thought, from what I hear.</p>
          <p>How does that change towards the Board's perspective with regards to dividend policy, in terms of being opportunistic? It's &#x2013; I remember you increased the dividend mid-year a couple of years ago and said that was a one-time event. I'm wondering whether there is a view to formalizing that policy, like one of your peers did.</p>
          <p>And second of all, maybe this is more for Siim, is where do you stand with regards to share buybacks and timing? CTV is coming in better than expected, you've got spectrum auctions coming up, would you be prepared to lever up in order to prepare for spectrum auctions or do you really want to get that leverage down well below the targeted range in view that spectrum auctions could prove expensive? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to go back, I'm not going to comment on any of our competitors, sticking to our strategy is. We have a capital market strategy that we hope couldn't be more transparent for the investment community. The increase in the dividends that we've seen and the good fortune we're in today for our shareholders to increase a dividend is driven simply through that payout ratio. And if you look back over the last two years, these dividend increases have always come on the support of an increase in our EPS outlook. And so, once again we're increasing our outlook, and therefore, we will be below the midpoint of our payout ratio and that's why we're seeing the dividend increase.</p>
          <p>So, we do have a very clear capital markets policy. The timing, which I said even in January, we didn't anticipate, of course, we didn't anticipate a transaction closing a quarter earlier. The financials, as you can see in CTV, are clearly better than we anticipated, given what we announced the multiple acquisition of and what it's come in at. And those are things we've reflected and I think that's consistent with what we've done in the last two and a half years. It's really been results &#x2013; earnings results that have allowed us to stay in the ratio.</p>
          <p>So, I think, Peter, look for that to continue. On the buyback, there is a capital market strategy there, we're going to stay within our debt ratios and we'll come back at the end of the year to talk about next year. And as you know our strategy is to return capital to shareholders, first and foremost, through dividends, maintain our debt to EBITDA numbers and then, use excess cash whether or not it's for tuck-in acquisitions or for buybacks or for pension, depending on what the requirements are.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, George. Good morning, Siim. Question on the Bell Media and the wireless content packages that you have set up here. I'm just curious, wondering if any of your other wireless competitors have approached you to get access to some of the mobile content that you have created. And just wondering, over time do you see that being a meaningful contributor to the Media segment's revenue on wireless going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I hope so. I mean, the answer is we're open for business and we are if Kevin were on the line from Bell Media, he would tell you, he is hoping he enters into arrangements where other people who distribute wireless services will carry the Bell Media packages. At the same time, Bell Mobility is offering it in the marketplace and we're seeing traction and we think it's going to be important.</p>
          <p>Our model is really straightforward for Bell Media. We think it's a better new financial model for the asset. We believe all four screens will be valuable. We believe that the CTV Bell Media asset is the best aggregator of content in Canada. And we'll be planning to distribute those contents to all four screens but we plan on monetizing each of those screens.</p>
          <p>So, we are selling our content then looking to just distribute it on a pay model on the wireless side, similar to what we've seen on other screens. And that's really there is no logic why that wouldn't be the same model. And that's the model we're pursuing. So, we think it, over time, to lend itself to upside for the media business because over time, I'm a fundamental believer, especially with LTE, that mobile video is going to be a huge service on a worldwide basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you see the structure of these terms being on a pay-per-use, is it going to be a monthly access for the content? How do you foresee these structure...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From the Bell Mobility side, they've taken the packages, and we think, and we've seen this also somewhere else in Canada, a very intuitive way to do it</p>
          <p>to do it where the consumer knows they're paying $5 a month for 10 hours. I don't think they would do it where they don't know what's happening on the data metering and they won't have a way to assess the usage. So we actually see a third stream of revenue, one's the voice, the second is data usage and the third is a number of hours of watching video, so that's how the model and then we're selling, offering, obviously, to sell it from Bell Media, to our, to the customers of Bell Media in a way that's based pretty similar to what we see in the specialty TV model, where there's a fee paid to Bell Media for access to that content from the other wireless carriers.</p>

          <p>Thanks, good morning. My question is on Bell TV, George, you talked about the 12,000 net adds in Ontario and Qu&#xE9;bec principally from Fibe. As your roll out continues towards the 2 million homes, should we look at that as a linear sort of opportunity to add onto Fibe? Or do you think that some of the marketing and bigger additions will come, perhaps, back-ended, as you have a larger area to, or footprint to sell to? And related to that, obviously, a very strong flow through from Fibe customers bringing other products with them. Do you think that that 30% number can hold or perhaps even improve as you market to a bigger footprint?</p>

We believe and, certainly, we see that. We have to give credit in the West to the execution we're seeing on IPTV, and what we're seeing in the U.S. And it looks to us that as the footprint gets more ubiquitous, you obviously see some penetration increases because of the marketing reason.</p>
          <p>So, one other goal we've talked about is we plan to have all of &#x2013; for instance, take the area code 416, completed this year, so we can market Fibe TV to all of 416. And that's an intuitive marketing announcement that the customer knows exactly where they live and if you're in 416, you'd have it. So, we over time, think our execution and ubiquitous footprint will make the marketing of this product and the evidence, I think, is in front of us in the U.S. and in Western Canada.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Dawn, we'll take our last two questions and please ask that you keep these last two questions short given the time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah we apologize. We've got the annual meeting in a few minutes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Dvai Ghose from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much for taking my question. George, it's great to see the sixth dividend increase since you became the CEO in 2008. But, you point to this dividend increase reflecting CTV. You've increased your EPS guidance by a little less than 2%, your dividend by 5%. You're at about a 70% payout ratio now in your guidance versus about 50% to 55% for peers like Telus and Rogers who have much greater wireless exposure.</p>
          <p>You've also got a really unusually low tax rate this year again, you're very early when it comes to IPTV dilution and you have to issue about 1 billion of stock to Woodbridge. So, I'm just wondering whether you're thinking that this dividend payout ratio is a little high when looking at your peers. And if so, if you can give an explanation as to why.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dvai, it's Siim. We're very, very comfortable with where the dividend payout ratio stands. Obviously, we would not increase the dividends without having complete comfort on that. The reality is that with the acquisition of CTV and the $0.07 of accretions that that brings it still maintains our payout ratio below the midpoint of our payout guidance. And if we were to achieve the higher end of our adjusted EPS guidance, there's the possibility that our dividend payout could fall below its policy range.</p>
          <p>In terms of the free cash flow coverage on our dividend, it's one of the highest in North America at over 160%. So, we've always said that if there's a risk that our payout is going to fall below the range, that we would take action to increase the dividend and maintain it within the payout range. The shares that you mentioned being issued to Woodbridge have been issued. Those are 21 million shares and they've been taken into consideration in this dividend increase.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that makes sense. Just a quick factual follow up. Siim, does the wholesale gains help your business line this quarter, the shutting down of Rogers Call-Net business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there's a modest pickup that we get from that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can you quantify it or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't, it's included in our residential and wholesale results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The last question is from Vince Valentini from TD Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. Long distance revenues barely declined this quarter and, actually, the last two quarters in a row you've seen a sequential increase. Just wondering, is this a new trend or are long distance revenues going to start growing again somehow or is there something unusual in those numbers? And I hope I can sneak in one last follow up. Any reason why you haven't done an LTE network sharing deal with Telus yet or is it just a matter of time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the first question, no, we don't forecast an increase in LD revenue. We continue to, we think, through the packaging in our residential business, through all the bundling work and very, very careful re-price management see some of those benefits. We continue to see, on the business side, business is more active internationally so we are seeing some benefits in win backs and in traffic and what have you, and on the wholesale side winning --doing more and more work globally compared to what we used to do, all helping us on the LD side.</p>
          <p>But, no, Vince, I think you were being tongue and cheek, we don't expect to see LD revenue grow, but we're, obviously, it's important that it doesn't decline for all the reasons you are commenting on. And LTE, we're not prepared, I said this morning, our announcement is we're launching LTE market, but, I have really no comment on your question today.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, very good. So, on that thank you very much for joining us this morning. I will be available as usual throughout the day for questions, but only following our Annual General Meeting. Thank you very much and have a great day.</p>
