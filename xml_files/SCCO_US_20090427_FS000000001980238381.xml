          <p>Good morning, and welcome to the Southern Copper Corporation's First Quarter 2009 Results Conference Call. With us this morning, we have Southern Copper Corporation's Mr. Genaro Guerrero, Chief Financial Officer, and Mr. Raul Jacob, Manager of Financial Planning and Investor Relations, who will discuss the results of the company for the first quarter and answer any questions that you might have.</p>
          <p>The information discussed on today's call may include forward-looking statements regarding the company's results and prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially and the company cautions to not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Patricia and thank you everyone again for joining us for the first quarter 2009 Southern Copper earnings conference call. Participating in today's conference are Mr. Oscar Gonz&#xE1;lez Rocha, the company's CEO, and Mr. Genaro Guerrero, Southern Copper's CFO.</p>
          <p>Mr. Guerrero will now lead the conference.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome again. Today, we will discuss Copper &#x2013; Southern Copper's production, sales, operating costs, financial results and capital spending programs. After that, we will be glad to open the session for questions.</p>
          <p>As we all know, the world's economic recession has severely hurt commodity prices with significant reduction in price of copper, molybdenum and zinc. The London Metal Exchange 2009 first quarter average copper price was $1.56 per pound, 56% lower than the $3.54 per pound average for the same quarter of 2008 and 12% lower than the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Major drivers for these low copper prices has been demand contraction in the developed economies and inventory buildup. We believe that demand is growing at certain parts of Asia, particularly in China. Clearly, this country has finished the de-stocking process initiated last year and has come back to the market with a significant demand for copper, particularly for refined copper. We think that China is the first major economy to come back to copper demand growth.</p>
          <p>On the supply side, during the last quarter, we have the following factor influencing the supply. More production cost cuts at high cost mine operations; refined copper production costs driven mainly by shutdowns in the smelters due to the sulfuric acid stockpiling &#x2013; as you all know, sulfuric acid is a significant byproduct of the copper smelting process &#x2013; reduction of copper scrap production that represents about 12% of total supply. It is estimated that this source of copper has dropped about 40%, helping to balance the copper market. We think that the worst has passed for the copper market. We expect that soon some other major and emerging economies will show higher demand and see the end of copper demand reduction.</p>
          <p>Southern Copper's first quarter 2009 mine copper production was 120,000 tons, 6% lower than the first quarter of 2008. It is important to note that including 12,000 tons of Cananea production obtained during the first quarter of 2008, all other Southern Copper Corporation operating units of La Caridad, Toquepala, Cuajone have increased their production by 4% in the first quarter 2009.</p>
          <p>La Caridad and IMMSA copper production increased by 11% and 10% respectively. Cuajone and Toquepala increased copper production by 1% and the smelting production was 2% higher than the quarter &#x2013; in this quarter than in the first quarter 2008. At this point, we are looking forward to achieve our 2009 copper expected production and sales of 470,000 tons.</p>
          <p>In terms of molybdenum, prices average $8.75 per pound for the first quarter 2009, 74% lower than the first quarter 2008 and 40% lower than the fourth quarter '08. Molybdenum production was 4,000 tons in the first quarter 2009 compared with the 3,900 in the comparable 2008 period. The increase of 3.4% was due to higher ore grade and recovery at La Caridad mine, whose production increased by 32% and higher recovery at Cuajone mine, where production increased by 11%. The company is increasing the production and sales plan for 2009 from 17,000 tons to close to 18,000 tons.</p>
          <p>Regarding zinc, in the first quarter '09, the London Metal Exchange price averaged $0.53 per pound, 52% lower than the first quarter 2008 and $0.01 lower than the fourth quarter 2008. Zinc mine production in the first quarter '09 increased 9.2% to 27,000 tons compared with the 24,800 tons in the first quarter 2008. This production increase was the result of higher ore grades and recoveries at our Charcas, Santa Eulalia and Santa Barbara operations. The company is increasing its 2009 sales plan for zinc from 98,000 tons to 101,000 tons.</p>
          <p>Silver COMEX price in the first quarter '09 averaged $12.63 per ounce, 28% lower than the first quarter 2008. Silver mine production in the first quarter 2009 increased 1.8% to 3.1 million ounces compared with the first quarter 2008. Refined silver production for the first quarter 2009 was 2.4 million ounces, 1.5% higher than the first quarter '08 due to the better performance at the La Caridad and Ilo refineries. The company is increasing its silver sales estimates from 16 million to 17 million ounces of silver in 2009.</p>
          <p>Net sales for the first quarter were $622 million compared to $1.5 billion for the first quarter 2008 and 450 million for the fourth quarter '08. Copper volumes sold decreases by 2% when comparing first quarter '09 with its 2008 equivalent. Molybdenum sales volume maintained its one &#x2013; its first quarter 2008 level. Zinc and silver sales volume increased by 13 and 33% respectively when compared to first quarter 2008 volumes. During the first quarter of 2009, we have no material adjustments related to provisional price sales.</p>
          <p>Total operating costs and expenses for the first quarter 2009 was $478 million. This figure compares very positively with $634 million in the first quarter 2008 or the $581 million of operating cost and expenses in the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>The cost reduction of $103 million between this quarter and the fourth quarter 2008 includes fuel cost reduction of $8 million, $33 million reduction in power cost tariff, copper purchases from third parties decreases by $4 million, selling and administrative and exploration decreases about $12 million, and other cost and expense reductions including lower operating and repair material cost and inventory changes.</p>
          <p>As a result of diminishing sales and operating cost variances, the first quarter 2009 EBITDA was $225 million or 36% of sales. This figure compares with the $941 million or 63% of sales for the first quarter 2008.</p>
          <p>The company first quarter 2009 cash cost per pound of copper produced before byproduct credits was $1.40 per pound, $0.10 lower than the $1.50 per pound for the same period of 2008 and the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Southern Copper operating cash cost including the benefit of byproduct credits was $0.64 per pound in the first quarter of 2009. This is very competitive cash cost even when there are severe price reduction for all of our byproduct credits.</p>
          <p>Net earnings in the first quarter 2009 were $78.7 million or diluted earnings &#x2013; earning per shares of $0.09 compared with 565 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.64 in the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>In relation to capital projects, as indicated in our press release, during the first quarter 2009, we conducted a careful review of all capital expenditures and made significant cutbacks in our previously budgeted program. We believe this discipline is required to respond to the current scenario of weak net commodity prices and economic uncertainties.</p>
          <p>For 2009, the capital and exploration budget has been further reduced from 450 million to 328 million. The adjusted budget includes 178 million for the Tia Maria project and Toquepala expansion project, $58 million for other special projects, 69 million for maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, and $23 million for exploration.</p>
          <p>Regarding Tia Maria project, the company had decided to move forward with the project after reducing the dollar budget from approximately $1.2 billion estimated in 2008 to $949 million, of which $116 million has been spent as of March 31, 2009. As of the end of March of this year, we have spent 51 million on the Toquepala expansion. We will continue with the feasibility study as well as the basic and detailed engineering for this project.</p>
          <p>The environmental impact assessment is also underway and it is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2009. Aside from these investments, we have decided to put on hold any additional capital expenditures for this project.</p>
          <p>We continue with environmental projects at our mining and metallurgical facilities in Mexico. At La Caridad metallurgical complex, the gas handling project has been completed. Also the first stage of the byproduct and effluent treatment plant project is currently in operational testing. These two projects are at 100% and 78% of completion respectively and have a combined budget of 9 million for the present year.</p>
          <p>The feasibility study for El Arco project was finished during the first quarter 2009. The study indicates an annual production of 190,000 tons of copper, 105,000 ounces of gold and 1,700 tons of molybdenum with a 35-year life of the mine. The estimated capital cost subject to further review is 1.8 billion considering a copper price of $1.50 per pound. The economic valuation of this project yields an excellent return for the project.</p>
          <p>The Board has given approval to proceed with the environmental impact assessment and the basic engineering study. Given the investment size, we are evaluating several options to develop these projects.</p>
          <p>On April 14, 2009, the Mexican Federal Labor Court issued a resolution approving the termination of Cananea's labor relationship with unionized employees and the termination of its collective agreement with its employees and the union. In addition, the Mexican Federal Labor Court determined that damages to the relevant equipment at Cananea mine encumber its operations, and as a result the termination of &#x2013; and as a result the termination of all labor relationships are legally justified.</p>
          <p>In respect to the repair of damages suffered by the Cananea mine and plant, the company will assess the best court &#x2013; the best course of action to take once it comes with the necessary legal and safety conditions that allow the company to restore operations at Cananea.</p>
          <p>Regarding dividends, I'd like to state again that it is the company policy to review at each Board meeting the capital investment plan, cash resources and expected future cash flow generation from operations.</p>
          <p>In order to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend, accordingly on April 23, 2009 the Board of Directors authorized a dividend of $4.50 per share to be paid on June 2, 2009 to shareholders of record as of May 13, 2009. In addition, as part of the 500 million share repurchase program approved by the Board in 2008, Southern Copper has purchased 4.9 million shares of its common stock during the first quarter of 2009 at an average price of 14.50 per share.</p>
          <p>Under the approved program, the corporation has purchased 34.2 million shares at a total cost of $456 million. With the stock repurchases related to 2008 Board approved program, the outstanding shareholders have increased their stake in the company by 3.9%. Currently, the corporation holds 34.6 million shares in treasury and there are 850 million shares outstanding.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. And now we would like to open up the forum for questions. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And your first question comes from the line of Jamie Nicholson with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you so much for the call. My question relates to your sharp drop in cash in the quarter, mainly it looks like from working capital items. Can you give a little bit more color why there was a big drop in accrued workers' participation on the liability side from 205 million down to 82 million and then also why the increase in accounts receivable, if you were seeing any delays in payments from your purchasers? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course. Well, let's start first with the cash position. Well, there are four components that are affecting the cash position of the company since the last quarter until now. And one was the repurchase of shares that I already mentioned. The other one is the payment of the workers' participation in Peru, that was close to $100 million. Another fact is the payment of dividend correspond to the fourth quarter of 2008. That was another $100 million. And also capital investments that we have been paying during the first part of the year.</p>
          <p>In respect of accounts receivables, well, that has been also decreased as a result of the reduction in prices. And in respect of accounts payable, that also is affecting our working capital. That also has been reduced because our cost has been reduced substantially, as I mentioned during my presentation</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then the workers' participation payment in Peru, are you expecting additional payments there? If so, what's the timing on that or is that liability winding down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah, there is a little portion that is still pending for the second quarter. But basically, I would say that 90% or more than 90% has been paid during the first quarter</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks. And then just one more question, if I may. Regarding your CapEx plans for El Arco and Tia Maria where you are looking at significant investments there, but at the same time reducing your CapEx budget for this year, what kind of timing do you expect for those larger investment plans? Where do you &#x2013; and where do you see financing coming from that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in respect to Tia Maria, it's a project that is underway. And as far as our capital expenditures for this year, it's already considered, an amount that I mentioned. That is $177 million. And in respect of El Arco, it has a little bit longer term than Tia Maria. In El Arco, we are going ahead with basic engineering and with the assessment of environmental, but that is going to take us more time. That's the reason that for this year the investment for El Arco doesn't represent a substantial amount, but we will continue with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So do you think that investment will start increasing beginning in 2010? Is it kind of like a year away before you start investing more heavily in that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, we can think start investing additional amounts in 2010. We have now determined exactly the timing in order to start the investment. And as I mentioned, we are exploring several alternatives in order to finance and to develop this project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No problem.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Jorge Beristain of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Yes, good morning, gentlemen. Could you clarify what your current hedges are for the second quarter of 2009? And also for 2009, I did not notice they were expressly detailed in this press release this time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course. We don't have any hedge program established for this year yet. Of course, we continually are &#x2013; we are following the market and we are looking for opportunities. We are analyzing if &#x2013; in which moment we will trigger a hedge program, especially for copper, but we are still working on that. We don't have any program until now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And could you qualify the potential timing and cost of a Cananea restart? It's been in the news quite a bit lately. And the last I've heard is it's potentially now five to six months to rebuild the facility and around $50 million. I just wanted to get some quotes on that, and if this &#x2013; if these numbers are embedded in the current CapEx quote that you've outlined for 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, at this point of time, we cannot say so. We cannot determine the amount that we will spend in order to rehabilitate the mine and would depend in two facts. One is when the company is going to regain the control of the operations; and second, as soon as we get there then we will assess how much it will cost. It's very soon to mention an amount of money that this is going to take us, and we cannot speculate in that respect until we get more information.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I could just have one last question, could you qualify &#x2013; would there be any impact from the ruling that's been made in the Asarco fraudulent conveyance suit that 29% stake in Southern Copper is to be returned back to the Asarco credit steering committee. Are those shares embargoed? Is that going to have any impact on your ability to continue with open market purchases of the shares? And are you restricted in any way of reducing the free float in Southern Copper below 20%? And I guess just the flip side of that is, of the shares that you said you are holding in treasury right now, will those outright be canceled or is there some thought of selling those back into the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in this respect, first of all, I would like to mention that this issue is at the level of our parent company, Grupo M&#xE9;xico. At this point, Southern Copper is not affected. The management of Southern Copper Corporation, with all the information that we already have available, we are not expecting and we don't know about any kind of affectation at the level of Southern Copper Corporation. And as &#x2013; the same thing, as this matter is not in Southern Copper Corporation, we don't have any affectation or restrictions in terms of cash. And well &#x2013; and we'll see how this is resolved at the level of Grupo M&#xE9;xico, probably tomorrow in the Grupo M&#xE9;xico's conference call, you are going to receive additional information about this matter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And of the treasury held shares of Southern, are the &#x2013; is the intention to cancel those shares?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Southern Copper Corporation shares?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, which Southern Copper holds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are going to maintain the shares in treasury until we decide or until the Board decide what to do with the shares that are in &#x2013; as part of our treasury. But I would say that that also is not going to affect any kind of &#x2013; it's not going to affect our balance sheet.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Jordi Dominguez of HSBC. Your line is open</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. My question relates to the cost. I saw a marked improvement in the cash costs for the first quarter from the last quarter of '08. Could you give us a little guidance on costs going forward into the year, could we expect them to see them at current levels or can we assume that costs might even trend slightly lower from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think that &#x2013; hi, Jordi. This is Raul Jacob. We think that cash cost should be dropping from both at the &#x2013; by &#x2013; before byproduct credits of $1.40 that we have average for the quarter and also considering the byproduct credits. In both cases, we think that &#x2013; in the first one related to costs that has been decreasing through the first quarter and should be going lower through the year as well and the fact that our byproduct credits should recuperate their prices somehow at the second half of 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my other question is regarding moly, we all know that with the current lack of demand for steel products, moly is suffering. Do you guys have any visibility regarding moly markets or you guys still foresee sub $10 for the reminder of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that right now we are seeing very depressed molybdenum markets. We believe that it should go back to higher prices. That should make our plan to work and I &#x2013; let me remind that we use $10 for molybdenum as an average price for 2009. So we believe that the last part of the year, whenever we say pickup in the steel demand, that will certainly help the molybdenum demand as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Those were all my questions.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Alex Thermalt from George Weiss. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Thank you for the call. Two questions. First of all, you talk about the Chinese being one of the biggest buyers in the market out there. Could you elaborate a little more? You saw this trend in the first quarter. Do you foresee this going throughout the year? And then second of all, you talk about maybe seeing that it was the bottom for the copper market at this point. We are still talking about 400 plus thousand tons <mark type="inaudible" />. Where do you see that this draw-down inventory will come from and how do you &#x2013; in which timeframe did you see that happening?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think that &#x2013; let me focus on the Chinese demand first. The Chinese demand has been over any expectation due to two facts. First one was the strategic purchases made by the State Bureau &#x2013; I'm sorry -- State Resources Bureau and the second one has been the recovery of demand coming from the Chinese industries that are copper consuming. China, as you know, it's short in copper, and usually their GDP growth transforms in 1.5% demand of copper. Even in a conservative scenario, we think that the Chinese demand will be strong for the whole 2009. Not at this level, probably they will slowdown somehow in the rest of the year, but still positive for copper imports to China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously &#x2013; just one. I'm sorry, just one <mark type="inaudible" /> there. Obviously part of this strong demand from China has to do with the fact that by-scrap market has been &#x2013; the availability of scrap has been a lot lower, right? Apparently prices, perhaps they are starting to coming off, if you could tell me, on your opinion, how much you think this rising copper was relative to China buying in it and how much you think was buying for the purpose of doing some strategic inventory and how do you think was actually the scrap market effect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the scrap market effect is about 0.5 million tons. There are different estimates on what the Strategic Reserve Bureau &#x2013; State Reserve Bureau is doing with the purchases. But clearly, if you take 500,000 tons away from the market and add the number between 300 and 400,000 tons, which is what this estimated &#x2013; the purchases of the SRB, you have a significant amount of copper that has been removed from the market.</p>
          <p>Regarding your &#x2013; the second part of your question, I think that we are seeing a slowdown in the demand reduction from developed economies. And we are seeing one major economy which is the Chinese one in this case going out to buy more copper. We think that these two trends should accelerate somehow in the rest of 2009, meaning by this that some other major copper consumer economies &#x2013; emerging economies actually should come into the market to buy more copper.</p>
          <p>And in the case of developed economies, basically a slowdown or the end of demand reduction from those economies. That's &#x2013; those two things are the basis for our belief that the worst for the copper market, it's already passed &#x2013; has already passed.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Dan Richman, an investor. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. Going back to Cananea, has the labor union appealed the Labor Board decision and why can you not get control of the mine back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. The answer is yes. The Labor Union has appealed the decision regarding the approval of the termination of the labor contracts as a union. In addition, individual workers have already filed their own appeals. So these two legal developments explain why is it that we cannot at this juncture determine when is it that we legally can predict the moment where we can regain the control of the mine. We are confident that we will prevail in those legal proceedings, but again it is still uncertain when that will take place.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto of Dahlman Rose. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I'm sorry, I didn't hear your response to the question about cash costs before the by-product credits and I was wondering if you could just describe for me how you see that playing out through the remainder of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's going to be lower than where it currently is. It's $1.40 for the first quarter. We believe that this $1.40 has not captured all the savings that we have achieved by talks with our suppliers and some reduction in the international markets for fuel and local markets for power. So we believe that this cost should trend lower. That's on the before by-product credits for the cash cuts, including by-product credits. We think that we will have better by-product prices and volumes for the rest of the year. That will improve our cash cost overall through 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Just two follow-ups if I may. First, can you tell us what the power costs are currently that you're paying in Mexico and Peru on a US cents per kilowatt-hour basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I'm sorry, Tony. We don't disclose that information.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I wonder if you can describe the impact of sulfuric acid. Obviously you've got some SX/EW at Caridad and you obviously smelt a lot of your production. So what are the competing impacts of that on your own system?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as &#x2013; you know that Southern Copper is long in sulfuric acid and we do have long-term contracts with several customers that somehow has isolated us from the current low prices of sulfuric acid. So even though we're not getting the prices that we obtained in the past in 2007 or 2008, we're still getting very attractive prices from the company point of view regarding sulfuric acid sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's on a contract, will that begin to diminish as we move forward into this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we have pretty much &#x2013; all of our production sold at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>

          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Jorge Beristain of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, sorry. If I could just have a follow-up, excluding Cananea for 2009, what would your baseline guidance be on copper production or sales for 2009 and also on molybdenum?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As I mentioned, the copper guide is 470,000 tons of production and sales; and for Molybdenum, 18,000 tons.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And could you just talk a little bit about the grade issue in the first quarter where you seem to be getting slightly more than expected copper recovery, is that a one-off or do you expect this to continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We expect this trend to prevail through 2009.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
