          <p>Thank you, Yolanda, good morning and welcome to Honeywell's third quarter 2009 earnings conference call. With me today are Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Dave Anderson. This call and webcast including any non-GAAP reconciliations are available on our website at www.honeywell.com/investor.</p>
          <p>Note that elements of this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. These elements can change, and we ask that you would interpret them in that light.</p>
          <p>This morning, we'll review our financial results for the third quarter and our expectations for the remainder of the year, and of course allow time for your questions.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Cote.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Elena, and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to report a quarter of better than expected results and that's despite a continued tough economic environment. With sales of 7.7 billion, we were able to generate earnings per share of $0.80 and that includes covering 35 million or $0.03 on EPS of additional repositioning actions. We also had a $0.04 positive impact from lower than expected tax expense, and we anticipate that that third quarter tax benefit will be offset by a higher income tax rate in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>While the top line environment continues to be challenging, we were able to deliver these results because of the strong growth initiatives and aggressive cost actions we have in place throughout Honeywell, and as evidenced by our ability to preserve and grow margins in this environment. Segment margins were 13.8% in the quarter, up 130 basis points from the prior year, and are 12.6% on a year-to-date basis, down only about 60 basis points on $5 billion less sales, and that really reinforces the quality of our earnings performance.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, we generated over $1 billion of free cash flow with working capital a major driver. Having generated 2.3 billion of free cash flow year to date, we are confident in our cash performance and I think it's a really nice comment on our earnings quality, and we're raising our free cash flow guidance to approximately 3 billion for the full year.</p>
          <p>Our sales are coming in about as planned and combined with our focused productivity, we can still expect to deliver our full-year EPS of about 2.85 on sales of 31 billion.</p>
          <p>We continue to drive productivity across the organization and remain focused on flawlessly executing the repositioning projects that we've initiated across the company. This focus on fixed costs remains a priority for us. We also continue to take other aggressive cost actions across our businesses. For example, our focus on reducing our indirect expense is working and will save us more than 20% of spend this year. Actions like our plant shutdowns and furloughs are being taken where appropriate and will save about $200 million this year, while also maintaining our industrial base for the recovery, which will come. These are all difficult actions, but our team is executing well and responding quickly to market conditions.</p>
          <p>Repositioning actions are helping reduce our fixed costs with attractive returns benefiting 2010 and beyond. We've executed on $190 million gross repositioning actions and that's about 145 million net or $0.14 of EPS so far this year. And these actions alone should provide more than $200 million of gross savings next year.</p>
          <p>Seed planting is something we talk a lot about and we've continued to invest even in these turbulent times. Seed planting investments in strategic growth platforms like the acquisition of RMG that we closed in the quarter further strengthens our position in the attractive natural gas segment. As you know, with more and more gas reserves being discovered around the world, gas is going to become a much bigger part of the energy cycle, and RMG plays wherever that gap needs to be moved, measured, or stored. RMG along with UOP are not only enhancing Honeywell's position in this attractive segment, but also expanding our geographic foothold, building further focus in emerging regions serving the natural gas industry.</p>
          <p>Seed planting like innovation investments that increase our leadership in next-generation technologies and applications like our SmartPath Precision Landing System, which is designed to allow airports to increase capacity at a fraction of the cost to add new runways. SmartPath is the first and only ground-based augmentation system or GBAS to receive FAA system design approval. SmartPath ground-based systems provide differential GPS corrections to replace or supplement the instrument landing system or ILS currently used at airports.</p>
          <p>Replacing ILS with GBAS technology has been identified in the FAA's NextGen system and EUROCONTROL's Single European Sky ATM Research Program as critical enablers for improving air traffic capacity and safety. Honeywell is a pioneer in this technology. This approval not only reinforces our leadership position in air traffic management, but will further increase awareness and penetration of our SmartPath like management systems, and that will save airline operators fuel and it will lower emissions, saving airlines billions of dollars through more efficient flight path and fewer delays.</p>
          <p>Our investments and focus in emerging regions are also really paying off with sales growth in the quarter offsetting some of the declines we saw in developed regions. Orders remain strong, particularly in China, the Middle East, and North Africa, where our ACS [Automation &amp; Control Solutions] and UOP businesses continue to partner and invest in growth in the region.</p>
          <p>And lastly, we continue to invest in our big process initiatives, our enablers, as well as other seed planting across the organization, things like the Honeywell Operating System, Velocity Product Development, and Functional Transformation. They have been huge enablers for growth and cost savings this year. With 75% of our manufacturing cost base now within HOS deployment and more than half of those at Phase IV or better where we really start seeing transformational results, we're seeing real momentum across the organization.</p>
          <p>Velocity Product Development continues to be a significant driver and is yielding very real benefits for us today in places like ECC [Environmental and Combustion Controls], where we continue to win market share with new products; and in places like aerospace, where our development costs and cycle times have been materially reduced, thus further increasing our competitive advantage on future platforms.</p>
          <p>Functional Transformation is now on track to save over $200 million this year, up from our previous estimate of 150 million, while service quality improves. We continue to drive additional productivity through shared SAP infrastructure and applications as we near almost 60% completion of our company-wide ERP rollout.</p>
          <p>So in summary, a stronger than expected quarter, demonstrating Honeywell's ability in a tough environment to both execute operationally and invest in future growth; as such, we are very well positioned for growth and the economic recovery. And as I said last quarter, we want to be your best investment, not just in these tough times, but also when times get better.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me turn it over to Dave Anderson. Dave?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave. Good morning everybody. Let me take you through the material, starting with slide number four, which is the summary of financial results for the quarter. As you can see and as Dave said, we posted earnings results ahead of the guidance that we provided to you in July. We reported sales at top line down 17%, in line with expectations, down 15% organically, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>Segment margins, on the other hand, increased 130 basis points to 13.8%, with increases in three out of the four businesses. Aerospace was able to grow margins 80 basis points despite soft conditions in the commercial aftermarket. We saw further good margin performance in the quarter from ACS, which was up 180 basis points. It's the fourth quarter in a row of margin expansion for ACS. And we had an impressive quarter from Specialty Materials, which was up 330 basis points.</p>
          <p>Net income declined 15%, and EPS declined 18% in the quarter. And in addition to higher pension expense, which was $30 million in the quarter, and a slightly higher share count, we had a number of moving pieces, which I want to spend a minute just taking you through. First, we were able to take an additional, as Dave said, 35 million or $0.03 of net repositioning actions in the quarter, which together with our cost actions taken earlier this year will provide an approximately $40 million benefit in '09, and more than $200 million incremental in 2010.</p>
          <p>Second in the quarter, we also recognized lower than expected tax expense due to a few discrete items, mostly larger R&amp;D tax credits, driving $0.04 of higher EPS. So the effective tax rate in the quarter of 22.4 compared to our guidance and planning assumption of 26.5. And by the way, we anticipate this will be fully offset in the fourth quarter by a higher rate. So in total on a net basis, these items contributed to a tailwind of approximately $0.01 to our reported EPS of $0.80.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow came in very strong in the quarter, over 1 billion of free cash flow. It drove an almost 500 million improvement versus '08 despite a more than 110 million decline in net income. Working capital including foreign exchange contributed more than 200 million, driven by progress on inventory and receivables, and CapEx was down 40% year over year. We also benefit from lower cash taxes in the quarter, which were partially offset by higher repositioning and other payments.</p>
          <p>The cash flow equates to a conversion, which you can see, of 168%, which really reinforces the quality of the earnings and is a direct result of the core processes we have in place around the organization to drive cash.</p>
          <p>Now we'll go to slide five and talk a little bit about what we're seeing in '09, just recap and provide a little more color in terms of by business as well as for total Honeywell. As you can see, the top line remains challenged but our assumptions remain generally intact. We continue to see softness in Commercial Aero, with the most pressure on the air transport and regional aftermarket. And although flight hour estimates are improving slightly for the year, we're continuing to see airlines aggressively manage spare parts buy and therefore spares sales continue to decline at a more pronounced rate than flight hours. We'll get into some of those details when we go to the Aero results in a minute but we anticipate this phenomenon to continue into the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>We also expect business aviation flight activity and OE demand to remain weak for the balance of the year, and despite the fact the BGA aftermarket has basically now stabilized. In other words, we're seeing the same approximate run rate in terms of absolute spend in the BGA aftermarket quarter after quarter.</p>
          <p>Defense &amp; Space, which accounts for half of our total Aero business, is performing well. We're seeing continued growth in US and foreign military sales, logistics services, as well as space. This is a theme where people continue driving much of their forecasted sequential growth in aerospace in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Regarding ACS, despite continued economic softness, we're seeing selective signs of improvement with the residential business stabilizing in North America as well as improvement in emerging regions. ACS importantly is also benefiting from new products. ACS has launched 385 new products this year alone. And cumulatively, new product introductions represent 30% of the forecasted revenues for '09, derived from products that have been released in the last three years.</p>
          <p>We're seeing positive &#x2013; in terms of a little additional color on ACS, we're seeing positive point-of-sale trends with our products at the major US retailers in the month of September. We're seeing growth in the microprocessing segment of our high-tech gas detection business. It's certainly a bright spot for us. And we're also seeing a pickup in energy orders, which are up over 25% in the third quarter and year to date, so some attractive underlying positives going on in the business. However, we continue to see delays in CapEx and OpEx decisions across a number of the businesses, mainly Process Solutions, with uncertainty around energy and commodity prices influencing buyer behavior there.</p>
          <p>Transportation Systems and Specialty Materials remain on track for the year, although obviously at reduced levels over last year. In Turbo, we anticipate revenues in the fourth quarter to be up now compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, driven by Turbo volumes which are increasing sequentially as a result of production schedules, which are now falling in line, in fact slightly ahead of consumer sales.</p>
          <p>So overall I think the takeaway from this slide is we're seeing some stabilization as rates have declined and both orders and revenue are moderating in the majority of our businesses, which are translating to sequential gains quarter over quarter. And as Dave mentioned earlier, the actions we're taking across the organization to control the bottom line, including reduced labor costs, the benefits of prior period restructuring, and significant indirect spending savings are helping to deliver on our commitments.</p>
          <p>So now with that backdrop, let's go to each of the segments, starting with Aerospace on slide number six. As you can see, reported Aerospace segment sales in the third quarter were down 16%, down 15% if you exclude the impact of the Consumable Solutions divestiture, which as you recall we consummated in the third quarter of last year. While segment profit for Aero was down 12% on lower volumes, margins were up 80 basis points to 17.4% due to productivity improvements, driven by cost savings initiatives and also the benefits from prior repositioning actions and the absence of last year's accrual for payments for BGA OEM customers, which you recall were tied to the production schedules and also contract milestones.</p>
          <p>Now on an organic basis, total commercial sales for Aero; that is the combination of Air Transport and Business Aviation, were down 29% in the quarter, with declines across both OE and the aftermarket segments. The organic commercial OE sales were down 38%, with Air Transport and Regional down 14. It was just really expected due to lower production rates, platform mix, and also the timing of shipments to regional jet customers. Business jet OE really, really was impacted, as expected, down 66%, a bigger decline of course than we saw in the first half as a result of the significant customer reschedules and also cancellations of deliveries.</p>
          <p>On the aftermarket side of Commercial, revenues were down 20% in the quarter. And as I referenced earlier, although flight activity is improving, we're still seeing declines year over year. We're continuing to see airlines aggressively manage their inventories, defer maintenance events, and also cannibalize parked aircraft for spares. As a result, air transport aftermarket sales in the quarter were down 17%. BGA aftermarket sales were down 27%, both in line with our expectations and in line with what we have in terms of the internal monitoring of turbofan or TFE engine hours and maintenance events. However, again the sequential growth over the second quarter reflects stability at these new lower levels.</p>
          <p>Defense &amp; Space sales were up 2% in the quarter, building on the positive growth we've experienced in the first half of the year. The performance reflects growth in both US and paramilitary OE sales, including continued demand for retrofit Chinook heavy-lift helicopters. Additionally our Government Services business is well positioned to provide logistics support services. It also contributed to growth in the quarter. In Defense &amp; Space overall, the portfolio just continues to execute well on programs and remains well positioned as we finish out the year and transition to 2010; so in summary, tough market conditions on the commercial side of Aerospace, particularly in business jets with continued strength in Defense &amp; Space.</p>
          <p>The Aero team continues to execute well, faced with additional cost actions to mitigate the volume declines in Commercial, a renewed focus on capturing customers and market opportunities in defense. And of course we continue to win attractive new business. In addition to SmartPath, as Dave discussed, we continue to have success, gaining significant share through our AT [Aero Twin] Retrofit program. A great example is a win in the quarter with China Southern's fleet of 20 new Airbus A320 aircraft, and also supply materials on their existing Boeing 737 aircraft in a contract that's valued at over $70 million.</p>
          <p>With that review of Aero, let's go now to slide seven and highlights for Automation and Control Solutions, or ACS. Reported sales for ACS were down 14% in the quarter, an 11% decline on an organic basis that is acquisition and currency adjusted. The biggest declines were in the Americas and Europe which were partially offset by growth across the emerging regions. Segment margins were a good story in the quarter, up an impressive 180 basis points to 13.5%; again, the fourth sequential quarter of margin improvement. I like to keep saying that in terms of the ACS performance.</p>
          <p>Our Products businesses were down in ACS 11% organically, with the continuation of the difficult trends that we saw in the first half. However, as I said, we're seeing some signs of stabilization on residential and gas detection. For ECC [Environmental and Combustion Controls] and Life Safety, while both down the quarter, they continue to win in the marketplace and gained share with key new products. To add some color, ECC had the strongest month in September since January, driven by the reemergence of residential in the Americas and improvement across their portfolio in Asia-Pacific.</p>
          <p>On the Solutions side of ACS, while down 11% organically in the quarter, they continue to perform well. Demand for energy efficiency as well at the integration of climate, fire, and security controls for critical infrastructure continues to drive growth within Building Solutions. And at Process Solutions, oil and gas production as well as distribution projects continue to be solid, particularly in emerging regions. However, refining remains weak. And as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing continued delays in CapEx and OpEx decisions across the board.</p>
          <p>Orders in the third quarter for Solutions were down 13% organically, primarily due to Process Solutions, reflecting order delays, particularly with US refineries. However, these are a couple key metrics and insights into the businesses, the Solutions businesses. Our service bank increased in both Buildings and Process in the quarter as we continue to benefit from a significant install base. And importantly, backlog improved sequentially in the quarter for both Building and Process Solutions.</p>
          <p>Now in the ACS segment, Process was flat in the quarter, but we saw an impressive 180 basis points margin rate improvement, two percentage points improvement sequentially over the second quarter, a great effort by the ACS team who continues to execute very well on new product introductions, productivity actions, as well as acquisition integration. Overall the market conditions at ACS were largely as expected in the quarter, reflecting slower global economic growth. However, again the ACS team continues to perform well in this environment, driving growth, revenue actions as well as cost actions.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide number eight, Transportation Systems, overall TS sales were down 24%, including a 3% negative impact from foreign currency. And at Turbo, we saw the rate of decline moderate, and this is the good news, 51% in the second quarter you'll recall to down 30% in the third quarter for Turbo, a positive trend. However, obviously it's still impacted by the downturn in the automotive industry with lower vehicle production rates at OEs globally year over year as well as customer shift towards cheaper, lower displacement gas engines. And as you recall, this phenomenon largely motivated during this period by government scrappage programs, particularly in Europe, where we have the highest penetration.</p>
          <p>During their quarter, OEs continued to significantly reduce their inventories, which we estimate to be down now approximately 2 million vehicles in Western Europe. We would therefore expect and we saw indications of this as we closed out the third quarter that OEs will start increasing their production in the fourth quarter and for Honeywell to gain share as we benefit from the high win rate on both new turbo gas as well as diesel platforms, like our recent launch. And a good example of this is the recent launch of BMW's new ActiveHybrid turbocharged engine for their 7-Series and the S6 models, BMW's S6 models for 2010. These are impressive. I had the opportunity to get acquainted with them at the Frankfurt Auto Show, and just a lot of buzz around both these vehicles.</p>
          <p>Another positive data point was that our sales in the quarter were up 14% sequentially from the second quarter, and our shipments continued to increase week over week during the quarter, indicating in fact demand is certainly picking up. And again, it's largely related to this phenomenon of earlier in the year production falling significantly below consumer pull in terms of particularly the European auto sector.</p>
          <p>In the Consumer Products business of TS, which is down 15% reported, put that in perspective, really only down 6% if you exclude foreign currency and also the pass-through impact of lower raw material pricing, which is largely ethylene glycol for the antifreeze business. So we're seeing much improved business performance within CPG, and CPG delivered double-digit margin the last two quarters. We had low double-digit margin 2Q and low double-digit margin from CPG 3Q, so this is really a significant turnaround.</p>
          <p>Overall, TS down 39% in segment profit; however, on a sequential basis, segment profit is up 150% from the second quarter, underscoring the efforts of the team to continue to be making good progress on productivity and cost actions, and also the improvement that we're seeing sequentially in terms of the top line.</p>
          <p>Turning now &#x2013; let's go now to slide number nine, Specialty Materials. As you can see, SM segment profit is essentially flat at 155 million on a 23% decline in revenue, expanding margins by 330 basis points to 15.2%; again a credit to the work that Andreas and the team are doing to manage costs, invest in innovation, and their renewed focus on sales execution and commercial execution, as well as the overall changes that we've made over time to the SM portfolio.</p>
          <p>UOP sales were down 11% as expected, with continued deferrals of longer cycle projects due to weakness in CapEx spending and refining in petrochemical primarily. However, the backlog is stable and UOP orders are improving. Catalyst sales, which were up 30% in the quarter, benefited from anticipated reloads and the timing of some new unit sales. And again, while the timing of reloads can be difficult to predict, we're gaining better visibility for those planned in the fourth quarter. We'll talk about that a little bit in a minute when we come to the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Resins and Chemicals were down 44% in the quarter, driven primarily by the impact of lower raws and the pass-through pricing, the formula based pricing. Specialty Products declined 25%, primarily due to continued challenges in the semiconductor industry. However, we're seeing sequential improvement in Electronic Materials as customers in that segment are signaling improved business conditions and we're seeing some evidence of inventory restocking.</p>
          <p>So as I mentioned earlier, segment profit for SM at 155 million, down 2% in the quarter, margins up 330 basis points to 15.2% on terrific cost control, lower raw material costs despite lower volume, and the continued investments that we make for growth.</p>
          <p>So with that review of SM and the review of the four segments, let's go to slide 10 and talk about highlights for the fourth quarter. As you can see, we're planning for the fourth quarter revenues to be in the range of 8 to 8.2 billion, down approximately 6 to 8% from last year; EPS to be approximately $0.91, down roughly 6%.</p>
          <p>And just highlights &#x2013; a couple highlights by business; we anticipate Aero sales to be around 2.7 billion in the fourth quarter, down about 15%, continued softness in commercial Aero. And while declining sales to air transport OE customers will moderate slightly, we expect further sharp declines in business jets due to reduced delivery schedules to the OE customers. In fact, business jet OE sales could be down as much as 80% year over year, which is indicative of the magnitude of the correction that has occurred in that industry.</p>
          <p>In the aftermarket, we anticipate the current run rate level to hold. As I said, that's what we've really seen. It's stability there in terms of the aftermarket. In business jets, TFE hours are expected to be down consistent with our expectation of declines, which is approximately 25% for the full year. And finally for Aero, consistent with what we've been seeing, we anticipate continued good growth in the fourth quarter in Defense &amp; Space, driven by military OE as well as logistics services.</p>
          <p>For ACS, we expect revenues in the fourth of about 3.4 billion, with both Products and Solutions under pressure, partially offset by the positive impact of foreign exchange, and also the benefit of the RMG acquisition that closed in the third quarter. Overall, we see some selected improvement in Products, again mainly in residential, industrial, gas, and emerging regions.</p>
          <p>At Transportation Systems, we expect sales of about 0.9 billion, 900 million, up slightly, showing growth for the first time since the downturn began last year, driven by new launches in Turbo. We've set continued CPG, good operational performance, in addition to similar benefits from productivity and previously funded repositioning actions within Transportation.</p>
          <p>And finally at SM, for the fourth quarter we anticipate revenues of about 1.1 billion, down slightly due to lower volumes, mostly offset by inventory restocking in some end markets including agriculture, electronics, coupled with higher Parax catalyst shipments at UOP.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we're preparing ourselves for the fourth quarter with continued top line challenges supported by aggressive cost actions. And we do expect to see top line declines moderating, as we've said, as we move into the fourth quarter. However, our businesses will be well below 2008 levels.</p>
          <p>You can really see that on the next slide. We've added it just to show you on a historical and forecasted basis what the fourth quarter sales look like; and also going back to 2008, to depict the timing and the slope of declines and the slopes of recovery in each of our businesses. The message I'd like to convey here is that while the forecast implies some sequential growth, we're still planning for absolute levels of business activity to be below 2008, and in some cases below 2007 levels.</p>
          <p>So let's just take just a few minutes for a few brief points on each of the businesses. On the top left quadrant, Aerospace, we expect again to see sequential sales growth in the fourth quarter as year-over-year declines moderate, given continued growth in Defense &amp; Space, and softening in the rate of decline in the commercial aftermarket. We've set Aerospace sales to be in the range of 11 billion for the full year.</p>
          <p>Moving to the upper right-hand quadrant, in ACS, we saw the most pronounced declines in volume in the first and second quarters of '09. Further, the US stimulus program had a chilling effect during this period, and it actually ended up delaying orders to which we see incremental orders and hopefully project funding beginning to materialize, benefiting us in 2010. So while we still see year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter, we expect &#x2013; or declines rather in the fourth quarter, we still expect selected stabilization, emerging market growth, further share gains based on recent contract plan, new product introductions, and the positive impact of the RMG acquisition to offset the mix and end market challenges in ACS. And overall for the full year, we expect ACS sales now to be approximately 13 billion.</p>
          <p>For TS on the lower left, TS as we said is now starting to show consecutive quarters of sequential improvement, driven by Turbo. And as you can see from the chart, we expect sales in the fourth quarter to stabilize on a foreign currency adjusted basis and to be up slightly. Sequential increases are driven by the benefit of the increased OE production as a result of declining inventories as well as new model launches. And we're going to expect full-year revenues for TS to be in the range of $3 billion.</p>
          <p>And finally on the lower right, Specialty Materials, we expect a tick up in Resins and Chemicals, primarily in agricultural exports, the timing of catalyst reloads at UOP, and stabilizing end markets to drive sequential growth in the fourth quarter. Overall, we anticipate full-year sales at Specialty Materials for 2009 at approximately 4 billion.</p>
          <p>So now let's turn to 2010. Go to slide 12. We've got a couple highlights here just to further update you as we continue to plan for next year. First, not surprisingly, we are obviously continuing to plan on the basis of tough economic conditions; however, stabilization in most of our end markets, which we anticipate will result in flattish sales for Honeywell overall in 2010 compared to 2009. While it's too early to declare recovery in certain sectors, we're certainly expecting Turbo and Commercial Aero aftermarket to both rebound somewhat in '10 following the depressed levels of 2009 as well as the end of the inventory &#x2013; or nearing the end of inventory destocking that we're seeing as we exit this year. Now both of these businesses obviously are high margin contributors, and we should benefit nicely from some improvement in both of these businesses.</p>
          <p>On the other hand as we have discussed, we're planning for Commercial Aero OE deliveries to turn down in '10 as well as the non-res construction piece in ACS broadly defined to be down. However, our mix of government funded and energy efficiency products should help offset some of this decline. We're also planning for modest segment profit improvement despite flattish sales in '10. While it's still early, we anticipate some favorable mix, driven by better commercial aftermarket as well as Product Solutions mix within ACS.</p>
          <p>In addition, labor inflation, driven by all the cost actions that we've taken this year, will partially offset some of the year-over-year repositioning benefits from actions funded across the organization in 2009. Clearly, pension expense is going to be a significant headwind for Honeywell in '10. We previously discussed this. We've indicated earlier a number of about a $500 million increase in 2010 compared to 2009. But based on changes in the discount rates and what we've seen in terms of the decline in overall rates, it's now likely to be approximately a 700 million headwind on a year-over-year basis.</p>
          <p>I'm going to take you through the sensitivity table on pension in the next slide, but I want to remind you obviously it's a non-cash expense item that will hit us in '10 and not reflective of funding requirements. Given the voluntary contributions we made to the pension plan over the past year and the impressive year-to-date returns we've had on our US pension trust, we'll likely not be required to make any contributions to the plan in '10. Anything that we do again would be on a voluntary basis.</p>
          <p>As you know, our pension accounting methodology just to remind you is more conservative than our peer companies and most comparable companies. We smooth assets over three years, amortize gains and losses outside the actuarial corridor over six years, which is about half the time period compared to the conventions used by our peers. While the discrepancy makes it difficult to line it up, the economics of the pension mainly in terms of either underfunded status or funding requirements are essentially in line with our peers.</p>
          <p>Regarding other below the line expenses for 2010, we would expect those to be in line with 2009 levels, so let me just refresh you on the 2009 assumptions. Net repositioning and other costs including asbestos and environmental are estimated to be approximately 400 to 450 in 2009. So again, we would expect those other below the line expenses to be in line with this year.</p>
          <p>We expect continued strong cash generation in '10, converting cash at 100% or greater. Our priority for capital allocation will remain to further our business investment and debt paydown and to focus on growth and balance sheet flexibility during these tough times.</p>
          <p>A factor that could impact our '10 free cash flow is the timing of the funding of the NARCO 524(g) trust. It's still winding its way through the legal process. There is a reasonable chance we can see a portion of that funding of the trust in 2010, and that will of course influence the numbers.</p>
          <p>So while some things are too early to call for next year, our preliminary framework remains well balanced we think between opportunities and risks on the operational side, with still a number of unknowns, which we'll continue to monitor. We look forward to sharing all of that detail with you in our guidance call, which is scheduled for December 16.</p>
          <p>So now let's go to slide 13 to look at the range of possibilities, just to spend a little more time on pension just to give you that perspective. Still a moving target; as you can see, we plotted a range of values assuming a discount rate between 5.5 and 6.5%. And the key takeaway is that we think a reasonable expectation now would be approximately $700 million of increase over the approximate $120 million of expense this year.</p>
          <p>So again that said, I'd like to spend a minute again emphasizing the importance of the voluntary contributions that we made to the plans in '09, totaling about $800 million. We're earning a very good return. When we look at the latest estimates, we do not anticipate required contributions for '10. And as I said, we anticipate the funding status at year-end to be in line with our peer group when expressed as a percentage of PBO [Pension Benefit Obligation], potentially even better given the voluntary contributions and the returns that we've seen on plan assets this year.</p>
          <p>So, finally let's just go to the summary slide, slide number 14, before turning it back to Elena for Q&amp;A. Standing back from the quarter, looking at the full year and our to-date performance, it really underscores the organization's ability to execute well in the tough times by continuing to invest for growth, our focus on cost controls, and our ability to emerge from all of this an even stronger company. It's evidenced by our ability to preserve margins at higher levels, with segment margins down only 60 basis points on sales declines of over $5 billion year to date. Further, we've underwritten 145 million of net repositionings through the first nine months. That's 190 million gross in new programs, which will yield more than 200 million of incremental operating income benefit in 2010.</p>
          <p>We've been able to generate $2.3 billion of free cash flow through the nine months, up 14%, despite lower net income. It reinforces not only the quality of the earnings, but the focus and capital discipline &#x2013; capital allocation and capital discipline that we have in the organization. Working capital has contributed approximately $600 million to this free cash flow on a year-to-date basis including foreign exchange. It clearly gives us confidence to increase our guidance, as Dave said, for the full year for free cash flow to $3 billion.</p>
          <p>We're pleased to be able to report a third quarter at previously stated guidance. And while we're preparing ourselves for continued tough conditions in the fourth, we remain confident in the cost actions we put in place and that will support our full-year 2009 EPS guidance of $2.85.</p>
          <p>The organization continues to perform well in this difficult environment. Seed planting will position us well. It will drive our performance in the recovery, and again positions us to be a much stronger company. Our businesses have stayed on top of market shifts. We're responding we think both quickly and effectively, exercising a judicious approach to reducing costs while maintaining the industrial base so we're prepared when things start to turn.</p>
          <p>And to just take a sentence out of Dave's comments on the earnings release, our employees have responded remarkably and supported both our growth initiatives and our productivity actions during this unprecedented downturn.</p>
          <p>Now as we've highlighted throughout today's review, we continue to invest in new products and services, our global footprint, and the key process initiatives that will help Honeywell outperform over the long term. We're seeing the results of these investments. They're showing up in orders and sales with Aero's key technology wins, new products and share gains in ACS, Transportation's volume of new platform wins, and Specialty Materials green initiatives whether it's an environmentally friendly refrigerant or UOP's penetration in the growing natural gas market.</p>
          <p>We're executing on our repositioning projects. We're aggressively implementing functional transformation, which is on track to deliver more than 200 million in savings this year, up from our previous estimate of 150 million.</p>
          <p>In the near term, we are focused on executing in this environment, and over the long term, we're planning for the company to be performing well when the economy recovers.</p>
          <p>So with that, Elena, I'll turn it back to you for Q&amp;A.</p>

          <p>Good morning guys.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Shannon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm just wondering when you look at ACS and Aero margins in the quarter and you think about your longer term expectations for that segment, I know in ACS, you had put out this 15 to 17 target a while back. And I know the world has changed, but the margins there, as you pointed out, are finally starting to come through despite products being down as much as it is, and aftermarket being down as much as in Aero. So can you just talk about longer term what is this telling you about the margin potential of those segments or what do you think they can do?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It makes me feel even better than I did before. I was always confident in our ability to grow margins in every business. And I'd say being able to do it when sales are going up is a lot easier than when sales are going down. And the fact that Aero has been able to contain the fall-off significantly better than they did last time, and that ACS is actually able to increase at a time like this gives me a lot more confidence in what we can do in an upswing. Dave?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think the other thing is the investment we've made in new products and new platforms.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And what we'll see I think as markets recover, Dave, is even more of that opportunity. So we would see also I think an increased cadence in terms of our penetration on new platforms as well as for ACS, new products and global expansion. I think all of that is very, very positive and will help us relative to sustaining the ability to raise margin rates over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shannon, I guess I would add that when we've done that, the restructurings that we have, we've always done it with an eye on how do you do stuff that's a permanent reduction in fixed costs. And as you know, we've always said that our intent was to contain the growth of fixed costs and let the volume run, and that worked very well for us during the last upswing. I think that's going to put us in an even better position this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on Turbo, you mentioned the penetration in the new platforms. How much should we expect you guys to be able to outgrow the market in terms of market share in Turbo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll continue to grow share. I don't know that I'd put specific numbers on it. But we'll continue to grow share, and share based on dollar volume, not on units, which we don't think most annual reports are done in units; dollars are more relevant. And we will continue to gain but I'm not ready to put any numbers on it. Dave, anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what you'll see in Turbo, we have modest, very, very modest contribution from new launches in the fourth quarter of this year, but we'll really start to see that pickup beginning in '10. So it's really &#x2013; it's a good question and we'll see the evidence of that I think in '10, '11, and '12, and be able to update accordingly during that period.</p>

          <p>Hi, Jeff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Can we just get a little more granularity on particularly what you're seeing on the energy retrofit front? Clearly the tone of things sounds better. But has the stimulus money progressed to the point where you can really tangibly see measurable significant bid and proposal activity? And if the answer to that is yes, is it also a booking process that's started to happen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say kind of yes -- that there is no real reflection yet in any of our &#x2013; I'd say in any of our financials yet. But we are finally starting to see the orders come in, and that's something that will help us on an ongoing basis I'd say over the next nine, twelve months.</p>
          <p>But Dave's choice of adjective or adverb was pretty good when he said it was chilling initially. It was really surprising how we had all this stuff in the pipeline at the time, and it really just slowed everything down initially as everybody waited to see what the package would say. And that's finally starting to reignite, and I think we'll see it more over the next nine, twelve months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would that also imply then that you actually see a pretty good pipeline of non-stimulus dependent energy retrofit work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, absolutely. There is just a much greater awareness out there now than there was before. Everybody is paying a lot more attention to it. Everybody wants to be able to talk about their carbon footprint in a way that makes their company look good. And that's causing a lot more interest in the energy efficiency work that we do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on pension, obviously this has been a tail wagging the dog frustration for you. But if &#x2013; when do these more conservative approaches help you? In other words, if we end up at the same discount rate at the end of 2010 and there is some modest improvement in financial markets, would you expect a tailwind in pension expense in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think so, Jeff. I think we would still anticipate some headwind, and then it begins to turn.</p>
          <p>And it's really related to that amortization of losses outside the corridor given that 2008 return on plan assets. So that math is kind of given; it's going to vary obviously based on returns and exact discount rates, but that math is pretty much set. It will be much less significant than we're experiencing, in all likelihood, than we're experiencing or anticipating to experience in 2010, but then it will turn around after that.</p>
          <p>And just to underscore again, and you heard this and you know this, but two points. One is no funding requirements in '10 based upon current data and current outlook. And no requirement. Number two is when you look at our underfunded status and you look at the dollar amounts, when you look at it stated as a percent of PBO, either way, compared to that set of multi large capital industry peers, the numbers are very much in range. The economics really aren't different, it really is a book accounting difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you've got to imagine, Jeff, this is one of my pet frustrations and has been -- that economically, we're about the same as our peers. Yet because of the way the accounting works, we end up having to take these non-cash hits that are not reflective of how the company is performing nor how the pension is performing or what our potential liability is. And it's a liability that can disappear with an increase in interest rates. It's very frustrating.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. And then just one quick follow-up on UOP. With that 30% increase, Dave Anderson, that you mentioned in catalyst reloads, was that a year-over-year number or a sequential number?</p>
          <p>And can you just give us a little more thought on what to think about Q4, and I think even in the first half of next one, we should be up for the biennial reload exercise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's always one that's, Jeff, to your last point or question, or element of your question, it's always one that's tough because of the way it's dynamic in terms of the rate that it moves around. The number that I had referenced is a year-over-year number, that 30% increase year over year.</p>
          <p>Now remember in catalyst product sales in UOP, we were down 35% from the first quarter. We were down 33% in the second quarter, so some of this is timing related. And we would anticipate in the fourth quarter total revenues -- in terms of catalyst revenue -- to be about even with the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Is that helpful, Jeff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that is helpful. And then the question just becomes that every other year reload cycle is technically on for early 2010, but I guess there just has to be a little bit of question about how strong that comes through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of quick questions; first on 2009, the EPS walk that you've been giving between seasonality, repositioning, cost controls, and FX, is the mix of that, given the performance this quarter, largely intact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's pretty much unfolding the way we've been saying since I guess May.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then secondly, when you look at the margin expansion across most of the segments, how much of that &#x2013; how do we think about that in terms of the price/value gap, the price/cost gap on materials? I know you talked, you referenced it throughout. But if you look across Honeywell, can you give us a better sense for how that's unfolding and how that's feeding into your expectations for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, just to clarify that question, are you talking about...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm talking about pricing -- top line pricing changes, not mix. And then I'm talking about the cost of raw material inflation, et cetera, commodities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think pricing has held up okay, and we continue to work the purchasing side pretty hard, with -- I'd say it's mixed depending upon the business, when we see what the overall impact is, but I think we've been doing a pretty good job on both overall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we clearly see it, as we communicated and built into the walk that you referenced earlier, that EPS walk that you referred earlier, we clearly benefited from raw material and indirect -- both direct and indirect material saves and productivity on a year-over-year basis. And I think to Dave's point, the other key takeaway is that pricing has held in this environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you think of it on the raw side, going back to that walk you were talking about, there was the inventory effect from that also.</p>

          <p>So between the negotiations and the inventory effect, we're just really starting to see some of the benefit of that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's consistent with the modest segment profit improvement comments for next year?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then I'm trying to reconcile your comments on the flattish top line and your comments on stimulus spending and around energy, et cetera. And I know you're going to give us more detail on December 16. But it strikes me that, given most of the trends, where is &#x2013; are the biggest weaknesses that you've talked about in Commercial Aero and Construction enough to outweigh the turning economy at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess the way I'd describe it is there are various puts and takes in every one of the businesses. And in Aero, we see some upside, but we also expect commercial OEM schedules to come down. In ACS, we do see energy efficiency upside, but there has also been a reduction in orders, and this is more of a longer cycle business that we've talked about.</p>
          <p>And I think it's important to put all of this in the context that we're going to play in 2010, we think, reasonably conservatively just like we always do because you just don't know how things are going to unfold. We'll be prepared if sales are better, and every one of our businesses is going to think that way and plan that way. But we are going to &#x2013; or at least be prepared that way, I should say -- because we're going to plan based on lower sales or flattish sales.</p>
          <p>There is a big phenomenon that's just going to be tough to predict, and Dave alluded to it in his comments, but the inventory destocking, when you look at what the airlines have gone through, what MRO shops have done, anything that goes through distribution in ACS, which is substantial, what we're seeing in Turbochargers -- there has been this tremendous destocking. And the way I would describe it is we'll say there was an end market that existed in 2008. We'll say that end market was down 10%. The orders placed on us were down 20% as inventory destocked.</p>
          <p>You can only hold your breath for so long. And at some point, it's not so much an inventory restocking as it is orders have to be placed just to meet that anemic end market demand.</p>
          <p>Now the problem is, of course, having an insight into exactly how much inventory is at the airlines, how much it is at all the ACS distributors, exactly how much auto inventory is out there. That's a little easier to tell but not perfect.</p>
          <p>It's just tough to predict because we just don't know. But that effect will happen at some point, we'd like to think in 2010. It's just difficult to predict, so we're going to continue to look at this as how do we plan conservatively to make sure our costs are in line. In the event that sales are stronger, we will be prepared to respond.</p>
          <p>Dave, anything you want to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think that said that well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just final question on &#x2013; can you guys give a little more detail around the labor inflation comment that you're making say relative to the '09 cost benefits? I'm thinking that these are all the temporary cuts that are just coming back, bonuses, things like that that were taken out this year. Can you give us a little more flavor of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Just a lot of actions across the organization. This year we had work schedule reductions. We had obviously attrition. We didn't backfill positions, Steve, as they came open. We reduced merit -- that is annual -- increases.</p>
          <p>So a lot of things that were taken this year -- when you look at those in combination on a year-over-year basis, our view is that for planning purposes, our expectation is some of that is going to come back in 2010. It makes sense for us to use that as a starting base as we think about '10.</p>
          <p>It also then says what are those other productivity actions. What are the things that we need to do to make sure that, on a year-over-year basis, we're continuing to drive the right cost outcome -- right cost behaviors, and the right cost outcomes? So just I put that as a placeholder literally for you to just indicate that although we're going to be the beneficiaries of some very nice tailwind from repositioning actions this year, there is also, we believe, from a planning standpoint, smartly, there is going to be some labor inflation next year that we need to count on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you therefore not trying &#x2013; I mean how are you trying to offset the additional pension headwind into next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the pension headwind is so big, Steve, it's a very good question. I mean you really have to look at I think Honeywell on a year-over-year basis taking out pension. I mean that's the way to do the math. And then when you add pension in, you really see the result.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good morning, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Scott.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Part of your cash investment plan is, at least according to the slides, is to pay down debt. And I guess given that you probably could make a voluntary contribution or a bigger voluntary contribution in the pension, then it would probably be a little higher return for shareholders than paying down debt. How do you think about the pros and cons of that right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We just continue to focus on the trade-offs that are involved in that, Scott. It's a very good question. I mean the key thing for us, as you know, is maintaining our credit rating, our financial flexibility, and liquidity in this environment. We think that's highly important. And we'll just continue to measure that.</p>
          <p>We've really gotten through now what we committed to do for 2009 and what we guided to in terms of 2009. We're mostly through that in terms of the pension contribution for the US trust. So we'll just evaluate that for 2010. As I said, no contribution is required. That's the good news.</p>
          <p>We'll see how events transpire, including underlying performance, cash generation, et cetera. We'll see what happens to discount rates. We'll see what happens to the projection of future funding requirements. So it's a good question, one that we'll continue to evaluate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And also, our decisions on all this are going to be focused on the economics of what makes sense and not by accounting. These and all underfunding can disappear as quickly as they appeared, and we don't want to be driven by accounting. We're going to be driven by economically what makes sense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, no, I understand. I was thinking in the context of your implied return versus your interest expense, and you get a tax deduction on interest expense and a tax deduction on the contribution, I assume, unless you go over a certain amount, so it seems like it will be pretty favorable to contribute to pension, but nonetheless, we can cover that another time.</p>
          <p>I wanted to just follow up on the management changes in Aerospace. I haven't heard of -- you've had a change in both CEO and CFO -- if there has been change in mandate or mission or anything that you want these guys to do differently or -- if you can just talk about that, that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think like anything else, we're just going to continue down the evolutionary path that we're on with every business in the company. We keep getting better and better. And the mandate is the same in every single business, keep growing your earnings and cash flow, and keep making sure that you're investing for the future so that we don't just make this quarter, but we make this quarter next year, two years from now, five years from now.</p>
          <p>And the nice thing about it is we have no shortage of ideas in any one of the businesses on how to keep making it better. And I would say it's as true for Aero as it is for any of the other businesses. Tim and Bob are on the same path, I'd say making it even better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So no real change and things you do differently, I guess is my point.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. In the past, you addressed the benefits of FX and the dollar sure is going to make a big difference to ACS in the final period of the year and into the next year. Could you address how you're thinking about that, Dave?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On a year-to-date basis, obviously, Howard, foreign currency has been a headwind. It's a pretty significant headwind for almost a billion in revenues and $0.11 in terms of earnings per share. We anticipate some favorability obviously at current rates...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A substantial impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...in the fourth quarter. We should see some favorability in the fourth quarter. Currency is a tough one because &#x2013; look at earlier this year and look at the movements that have just taken place on a year-over-year basis. So again in December when we provide guidance for '10, we'll give you what we're using for the pound as well as for the euro.</p>
          <p>We tend to be conservative in our planning on those because of the significance of those to our performance. So other than telling you that we're going to provide that detail or that color -- and we'll point that out in terms of what that represents as year over year or the impact to us at that time -- but other than that, for 2009, it's pretty much baked and may end up being a net headwind for this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on &#x2013; I mean the fourth quarter is a dramatic change. I don't want to push back on you too hard, but it's...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we'll get some benefit in the fourth quarter. But just to put it in perspective, every penny move -- every 0.01 move in the euro in the quarter -- impacts us about $10 million in sales and only about $1.5 million in operating income. So it's clearly a positive for us in the fourth, but it's not a major driver for us.</p>
          <p>I think the bigger question is what's going to be '10, what's our planning assumption to be for '10 compared to these rates that we're actually at in '09.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on cash flow. I mean you had very nice numbers. Share count was up sharply. I guess that was due to &#x2013; did you complete the funding of the pension plan?</p>
          <p>And then this low level of CapEx, will that continue into the final quarter of the year? And how are you giving marching orders to the team going forward on that, Dave?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The share count and then I'll turn it over Dave in terms of marching orders. I'll just give you the tabulation. We contributed $340 million of the company's stock in the fourth quarter. That really pretty much rounds out just under the 800 million guidance that we provided. We may top that up, and as Scott Davis asked, we may top that up either via stock or via cash, or elect to do that into 2010. That's really to be determined.</p>
          <p>So we're largely complete and on track, and that is reflected in the share count for the company and the guidance that we've given you and embedded in the guidance that we've given you for the full year. The second question has to do with...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>CapEx.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>CapEx, we're anticipating that CapEx will have about the same kind of run rate in terms of reduction in the full year. We're in the neighborhood of about $700 million for the full year, which is consistent with what we've talked about previously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you wanted to get a sense for what are the marching orders, the way I would say it is we tell them all to act like it's a recession, but don't betray the future.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>First of all, congratulations on strong execution this year in the face of the sales challenge. It says something about what you have done with the organization over the last four to five years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on Turbochargers, one of the main moving parts in that fundamental slide you guys usually put up there is European auto builds. And I think there are some crosscurrents there, whether this year was bolstered by stimulus.</p>
          <p>What do you hear from your guys in the channel on what to expect from European auto builds next year? And in a flat or modestly down auto build environment, are you still looking at &#x2013; can you still do up turbos in that type of environment because of all the share gains?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think we can really do up despite the share gains. Steve, you're right. We saw an uptick in European, now total EU. So Western Europe and some of the countries obviously in Eastern Europe, 4.6 million units sold in the third quarter. And as a result of that in some of the scrappage programs in Europe, the forecast is for only 4 million units to be sold in the fourth.</p>
          <p>And obviously there is going to be some dampening effect in terms of total sales in the full year of 2010. Some of those scrappage programs will continue only modestly. For example, France will continue, but in Germany it's not expected to continue. So we will see some dampening on the 2010 numbers. But to Dave's quick response which is actually right, we will see improvement and growth in our Turbo business in '10, not only as a result of that phenomenon of that stabilization of production rates, but particularly production as regards turbo vehicles and the benefit of new launches. So you'll see both of those in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I didn't quite understand the answer to Jeff's question on UOP. Is that just you were expecting &#x2013; I guess the industry was talking about visibility on reloads in the first half of 2010, but given the state of the refining industry that that's a little bit less visible now or maybe if you could just give a little more color on what you're seeing there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would say is that, what we'll do is we'll get into that as we talk about 2010 guidance really. It's a very important item obviously and the tracking and forecasting, that is something we just &#x2013; something we haven't, while the business has been preparing, we have not actually had the opportunity to go through that level of detail yet with them for example.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We continue to demonstrate that we're a strong performer in both the tough times and the good times. And as you recall the question a year ago was, would we fall apart like we did last time. And I think we've been able to convincingly demonstrate that that concern was not a real one, and that doing what we said is very important to us. We've been able to generate these results while at the same time continuing to invest in the future.</p>
          <p>And when you think about coming on the last recession, for us the cupboard was bare and that's not the case this time. Our continued investments into new products and services, expanding our geographic growth, investing in our enablers, our process initiatives, and getting it to great new areas like we did with RMG, all of these make up a much better company for when the times get better. We intend to be a great performer, not just in these tough times, but also when the times get better and they will. Thanks for listening.</p>
