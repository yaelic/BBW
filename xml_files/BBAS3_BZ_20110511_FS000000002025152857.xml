      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. This is Gilberto Louren&#xE7;o. Good morning. Welcome to our first quarter results conference call. We'll start our presentation with slide number three where I show that we achieved the best results for the first quarter ever. Some highlights were loan portfolio growth with high quality, an outstanding performance in agribusiness, the maintenance of our leadership in trading finance, diversification of revenues with cards, insurance and capital market, and efficiency gains due to the focus on service quality and cost control, which grew below the guidance, the main highlight in our view in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide number four, we observed that we kept our leadership in a major segment of our Brazilian Banking Industry, rely our leadership on assets and credit in our ability to attract funding that can be seen in broad space in asset under management.</p>
          <p>On slide number five, we show that Banco do Brasil reached the best result ever in the first quarter &#x2013; in our first quarter, with a recurring return on equity close to 25%. The recurring net income amounted R$2.9 billion, increasing more than 42% over the same period last year.</p>
          <p>On slide number six, we have the expansion in our deposit base. With these distribution network nationwide has supported the maintenance of our leadership in deposits, and the growth in low cost funding highlights the savings which grew 15% one year.</p>
          <p>On slide seven, we see that beside these additional funding Banco do Brasil is diversifying its base mainly through letras financeiras, long-term bank security, which had a strong LTM growth in Letras de Cr&#xE9;dito do Agroneg&#xF3;cio, agribusiness credit letters. We also had an increased access to more source of foreign borrowings.</p>
          <p>On slide number eight, we can observe that the amount obtained abroad grew substantially. The solidity of Banco do Brasil and the recognition of the international market is evidenced by the bond issues, which grew 37.5% one year.</p>
          <p>On slide number nine, we have our performance in assets under management. With the market share reaching 22% in the first quarter, the balance increased 20% one year including the 50% managed by Banco Votorantim.</p>
          <p>As can be seen in slide number 10, there was a slight recovery in loan operation spread given with reduction in individuals and agribusiness net interest margin. This is mostly explained by the outperformance of individual portfolios in terms of growth, better growth in the total portfolio and better net interest margin corporate loans. Anyway net interest income delivered good growth over the last quarter that's the guidance that we start to give this year to the market. The growth that we tend to have between 16% to 20% in net interest income.</p>
          <p>On slide 11, we can observe that Banco do Brasil kept its leadership in the credit market. The portfolio reached almost R$400 billion including private securities and guarantees, which represents a 21% growth in one year. The share of agribusiness in the total portfolio was below 20% for the second consecutive quarter and credit to individuals took share in the total.</p>
          <p>On slide 12, we have the individuals portfolio and we can see the increase in operation with lower risk profile backed by collaterals, such as those related to payroll, auto loans and mortgage, which in the first quarter 2011 were responsible for almost 79% of the total portfolio to individuals.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the next slide number 13, we have the evolution of the corporate portfolio with highlight to the securities and investment lines present outstanding increase. Actually we have a growth of 30% investment lines, those long-term lines, and private securities, 74% &#x2013; 75% growth.</p>
          <p>Slide number 14 being the &#x2013; our agribusiness portfolio. We have a 61% market share being the major partner of the Brazilian agribusiness. Portfolio is increasing in a consistent way with highlight to corporate operations, which one year grew almost 62%. The following slide number 15, 16 and 17 bring us information that help us to understand how positive are the prospects to the Brazilian agribusiness.</p>
          <p>Beginning by slide number 15, shows us that the main cultures bringing good profitability to the producers are soybeans and cotton, which 53% and 62% in terms of margin, respectively, in 2010, 2011 crop. And slide 16 presents how the investment in agribusinesses guarantee more efficiency to the production. Better seeds, fertilizers, machinery make possible to increase the productivity.</p>
          <p>The slide 17 summarize our view for the next crop. We expect good price and cost under control, guaranteed reasonable markings, we also expect a favorable weather. All of these together should benefit the producers and bring new opportunities to Banco do Brasil include improvement to the book credit risk quality.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 18. We have evolutions in the level of risk from Banco do Brasil with highlight to the increase in operation with better risk, AA to C that reached 93.8% in March 2011. Also regarding the quality of the portfolio, slide 19 shows us the delinquency ratio and confirms that has been worthwhile the strategy adopt by Banco do Brasil on focusing in those lower risk operations.</p>
          <p>The NPL ratio over 90 days are back to the pre-crisis levels. As you can see, 2.1% was the NPL 90 days at the end of March 2011. Highlight to NPLs in agribusiness portfolio with 140 bps drop in one year.</p>
          <p>Next slide, we have disbursement of long term financing, which reached R$5.4 billion in the quarter. Cards, BNDES, a product in which Banco do Brasil is a wide range of leaders in terms of amount disbursed, number of cards and transactions, was once again the highlight in this kind of operation. The BNDES card has a special design to SME segment.</p>
          <p>On slide 21, we have the evolution balance of operation guaranteed by Fundo de Garantia de Opera&#xE7;&#xF5;es, FGO. FGO decides to facilitate the assets to credit to companies that do not have collateral &#x2013; contribute to review the average risks of the portfolio. It can be seen in a comparison between SME's average risk from March 2010 to March 2011, which dropped from 6.1% to 4.6%.</p>
          <p>On slide 22 we have the attached positioning of Banco do Brasil abroad with breakdown of credit portfolio in its main branches, New York, London, Tokyo and Buenos Aires.</p>
          <p>With this presence overseas fundamental to support a Brazilian foreign trade as we can see in slide 23. It will be remains as leader in the import and export market, foreign trade market and also in a trading finance. Regarding mortgage loans on slide 24, we have the monthly disbursement in contracts since the first quarter of 2010. Actually you have here the quarterly flow. It is pretty clear this is business is growing fast in Banco do Brasil. In the Q1 we settled three times as much as the first quarter 2010. Talking about the partnership with Banco Votorantim, we see on slide 25, that its market share surpassed 20%.</p>
          <p>The delinquency ratio remain under control, and the payroll and auto loans production are back in the same level Q1 2010 due to the macroprudential measure released by the Central Bank at the end of last year.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide number 26, we can observe that the turnover in cards increased more than, again 25% over the same period of last year. The expansion in this business was important to boost the income growth and grab more market share as seen in the 120 bps increase reaching 21.6% market share.</p>
          <p>Slide 27 pictures Banco do Brasil card, Ourocard, brand of credit cards of Banco do Brasil, which has been the favorite and most attractive card to Brazilians according to market sources. This choice can also be seen in slide number 28 that shows us the sales of Ourocard, Travelmoney cards. From December 2010 and to the end of the April 2011, the sales of cards in dollar increased 2.7 times while those in euro increased 4.1 times.</p>
          <p>Now, on slide 29, we have some projections to Elo. One of the main initiatives of Banco do Brasil JV with Bradesco and Caixa Economica Federal to go forward in the card market. In 2015, we expect the total turnover of R$1.2 trillion in a market in which Elo is going to have a 15% market share.</p>
          <p>On slide 30, I would like to bring some information on the insurance business. Recently, we restructured our insurance area including the reorganization. All of our affiliated companies aiming to increase our market share to a low selling of insurance in alternative channels with automated solution and launching products of specific niches. With that said, we can observe that the insurance results increased 24.2% over the same period of last year.</p>
          <p>We also see on slide 31 that the restructuring is reflected in the numbers of our affiliated insurance companies. As an example, I would like to mention our private pension plans company Brasilprev, the first one to have the restructuring concluded in April last year and that already raised its market share from 19.9% Q1 2010 to 27.4% in this quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally, on slide 32, we can see that the future of insurance business is very positive. Some pro forma calculation indicates that a combination of revenues from Banco do Brasil and Mapfre would surpass R$4.1 billion in February. Each would represent 21% market share in the leadership international market of insurance.</p>
          <p>On slide 33, we show the consolidation of our investment bank position in a capital market. Leading fixed income origination and equity distribution where we have a 60% market share.</p>
          <p>To act in the capital market abroad, Banco do Brasil has its own broker dealers at main financial centers in the world, New York and London. We also have a broker dealer being installed in Singapore. We are going to have broker dealers covering all times zones in the world.</p>
          <p>On slide number 35, we show that a focus on service quality is bringing some important results. The commercial revenues, which include NII, fee income and insurance revenues for our customers grew almost 9% one year. This is only an example of the results from the Retail Enhancement Program, BB 2.0 which invest among all the initiatives in our new business platform allowing more agility in product sales, in technology, mobile, Internet, ATM, call center and in modernization of our point of service in branches.</p>
          <p>The focus in customer service is also reflected on customer satisfaction. As we can observe in slide number 36, the satisfaction increased in all the segments researched. On slide 37, we have said that the improvement in revenues and customer satisfactions are also due to the increase in number of employees at the front half of the bank in our branches. The increase in employees at branches is twice as much as in the total that can be seen in the slide.</p>
          <p>The expansion of the business has been accompanied by free control of the admin expenses, our expenses grew below the guidance and our peers. And that has affected the operation efficiency. On slide 38, we show that a LTM cost to income ratio accounted 41.8% at 210 basis point reduction over the first quarter of 2010. On a quarterly base, as can be seen on the slide, we accounted 44.3% Q1 2010 and 40.9% Q1 2011, so the same trend.</p>
          <p>On slide number 39, we've given some information about Banco Patagonia, part of our overseas strategy to reinforce even more our operation in a corporate segment, not forgetting all the opportunities that these investments may bring.</p>
          <p>Slide 40 brings us most recent movement abroad, the acquisition of EuroBank in United States. This bank operation will be towards a retail segment to support the Brazil and Latin America commencing in U.S. The acquisition of EuroBank will be added to all the initiative to improve our operation in North America market. We have already centralized the cost and we are now opening our concept branches in New York City.</p>
          <p>Also regarding Banco do Brasil's support to the Brazilian companies on slide 42, we have obtained the authorization needed to change the big office in Shanghai into full branches. This initiative is inserted in our plan to develop operation of those countries with strong commercial relationship with Brazil.</p>
          <p>On slide 43, we have the BIS ratio, which at the end of March reached 14.13% with Tier 1 capital representing 11.15%. This ratio allows an expansion of up to R$134 billion in credit assets, weighted by 100%. It is worth mentioning that Banco do Brasil Tier 1 capital had an expansion up only in a comparison with March 2010, but also with the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 44 shows us that our performance allowed us to achieve or even surpass most of our guidance. Regarding net interest income, the slide with performance below estimates the growth expectation between 16% and 20% is backed by the expansion in earning assets during 2011 as well as the gradual incorporation of the effect of the repricing of a total credit portfolio due to the macro scenario.</p>
          <p>Regarding total deposits, the expectations that during 2011, the total deposits will reach the growth range between 14 and 18% as given to the market. To the corporate loan portfolio side, we can see that in the quarter some of our credit demand by large companies was supported by securities underwriting as well as the other business loans which explained the growth above the guidance in the other business portfolio.</p>
          <p>Talking about provision, although the first quarter 2011 did not show a worsening in the credit risk profile, we kept our guidance in a conservative way due to the macroeconomic scenario. We're getting ready to see how we're going to be developing in the year in that regard.</p>
          <p>Regarding fee income, the expectations that also during 2011 range between 12 and 17% will be achieved, mostly because initiative related to increased cross-selling in our customer base. And finally regarding admin expenses, the performance was due to the strict cost control and also through the synergy gains related through the acquisition with highlight to the acquisition of Banco Nossa Caixa. We expect the concentration of the expenses in the second part of the year due to the new branches openings and hires of new employees during the year. Well, those were the information I would like to share with you.</p>
          <p>We can now move to the Q&amp;A session. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Excuse me, Mr. Daniel Abut with Citi has a question. Mr. Abut, you may ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In your opening remarks, the performance of your expenses which drove the improving efficiency was floating under the finance of the quarter. You said at the end that we should expect some concentration of expenses in the second half of the year because of branch openings and correspondingly &#x2013; but you also said that part of the reason you performed so well in the first quarter was from synergies from the Nossa Caixa integration.</p>
          <p>I wanted to ask you how much more in synergies you think you're going to extract from Nossa Caixa and therefore what &#x2013; can we characterize your expense growth driver or is it according to 10% to13% relatively conservative, because of more and more synergies to be expected there if we end up exceeding that target but you don't want to realize it yet?</p>
          <p>And second on the asset quality side, which your provision fee is so much below your guidance 3% but you're guiding a 3.3% to 3.7%. I understand you want to be conservative, but is it fair to say also that unless we see major deterioration in market conditions in the second half of the year, it's unlikely that you're going to be within the guidance that you offer, 3.3% to 3.7%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Daniel. So, beginning by expenses in Portugal in mind to that, we do have a plan to increase our branch network, above 500 branches this year. Half of it those low expense branches, I mean those complementary branches, so &#x2013; and we open only 25 branches. So, it will take a while to have the total approval to get the branch open, so the expectation &#x2013; that's why we expect to see more opening of branch in the second part of the year.</p>
          <p>Secondly, number of employees, we are planning to hire more 4,000 employees this year probably because at beginning of 2010, the plan was to increase our employees base by 10,000 employees in front office mostly as can be seen in the presentation. We doubled the growth and branches when talking about our attack force. So, bear in mind that we're going to have inflation this year, probably going to be in high end of the target of the Central Bank above, something close to 6.5% inflation. So, everything added, at the end of the day, the plan is to have our expenses increases in between 10% to 13%, hopefully in the lower end of the guidance, close to 10%.</p>
          <p>Talking about provisioning, so the first quarter if you analyze NPL 60 days overdue or 90 days just quite good numbers, but seasonally effect is rising 15 basis up to 30 basis points increase, so that's why we waited to see what's going to happen moving forward in a quarter because we have to bear in mind that we're going to have more inflation this year. It's going to affect us all when Brazilian &#x2013; say, they take more &#x2013; they are more leveraged than used to be in the past because of the bank privatization.</p>
          <p>So, we have to see what's going to be the behavior mostly in Individuals portfolio, behavior of delinquency to see it's going to maintain or not the guidance. For time being, we maintain 3.3% to 3.7%. Bear in mind that if by any chance we get 3.3% we're going to have the same of last year there was 3.3% in the entire year. So, meaning that the provision expense will grow following the average growth of the total portfolio, that's quite good, okay. You're right. Using &#x2013; consider only the first quarter numbers that's only 3%, even lower than 3%, 2.8%, 2.9%, but again we're going to wait and see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two quick follow-ups, Gilberto, on the sale side. Do you have any indication of what additional costs in Banco Nossa Caixa you think you're going to obtain and when, more this year or into 2012? And on the quality side, you mentioned that you have to wait particularly the evolution on the individual depending on how inflation, interest rate and other items will evolve but do you disclose the so-called early delinquency performance because other banks have seen an increase in the back end that go from 30 days to 90 days, there are no NPLs present yet. But that increase that they saw in the first quarter would lead us to think that eventually it will part of that at least will go to NPL status; have you seen a significant increase in that early delinquency bucket that you can share with us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not a significant increase. What you saw was an increase of 20% to 30% basis points in those 15 days NPLs, 15 days. That's mostly in consumer finance, not in company. Unlike the other banks when talking about delinquencies, it's very important to bear in mind the fact that we have an exposure to Agribusiness and Agribusiness are enjoying a very good momentum.</p>
          <p>Okay, so actually in Agribusiness we're going to have &#x2013; because we have postponed &#x2013; postponement in the past and we have over-provisioning because of that, we're probably going to have agribusiness, Agro and Banco do Brasil with condition to save more provision. But again it's too soon to change the guidance.</p>
          <p>Okay. We probably are going to have downturn come from consumer finance of course, setback in economy, more tightening scenario, but upturn come from the Agribusiness. So, at the end of the day, it's quite reasonable to see maximum at the lower end of the guidance using what we have to analyze the issue now. Okay. Synergies, not the cash, we are talking about expenses, we got some synergies because we have some sales come from the processing side, I mean processing Agro related expenses. Money to apply security guard, so we reassess all contracts that we have all together at Nossa Caixa and we &#x2013; it is granting synergies for Banco do Brasil.</p>
          <p>When you compare with 2010, probably you're going to see these synergies are rising. Okay, but that's limited, okay. So, when we try to compare 2012 with 2011, we are going to see everything is done.</p>
          <p>In revenue side, that's very important. In revenue side, we are addressed Nossa Caixa with this strategy that we have for all banks and repay segment. There is strategy related to enhanced cross-selling more people in front-offices and less people in back-offices. So, that's something that we have done for all bank that include Nossa Caixa, but not only Nossa Caixa, all the acquisition that we made Banco Votorantim, Banco <mark type="indiscernible" /> and POE in our organic approach in our bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is the 23 basis point that you saw in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> consumer finance, is that the normal behavior for seasonal reasons in the first quarter or was it little more than you would basically see in every first quarter of every year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of this are normal behavioral seasonal behavior of first quarter where we have people &#x2013; a more, a more tighter budgets to face all commitment from their income. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Mario Pierry with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Let me ask you two questions, first question is on your capital ratio, you show a 14.1% BIS ratio in this quarter. But there is a lot of concerns from the market with regards to your capital ratios under Basel III. I know that this, the Brazilian Central Bank has not yet given a final decision on Basel III about their interpretation of Basel III. But I would like to hear from you, if Basel III were implemented today, what would your core Tier 1 ratio look like? And if you can tell us, your appetite for doing an equity offering in the next two years.</p>
          <p>The second question will be related to your loan growth, we definitely saw a very weak growth in the corporate segment. This quarter you haven't changed you forecast. Could you just give us a little bit more color what happened in this quarter and why you think you are going to be able to meet your guidance for the year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mario beginning by the last part of your question. Especially, in SME segment we have much more settlement in the first quarter 2011 than it used to have, because we grant at the end of the year that's a seasonal approach of the bank to win more condition because at the end of the year the companies have more commitment to raise Christmas bonus, their purchase and so on and so forth. And because of it we've raised a kind of grace period to companies at the end of the year and at the beginning of the year, we have more concentration of settlement. So, that's it, that's for SME segment.</p>
          <p>In each mid and large companies, what we had was that we have fund available come from the agribusiness and we can use this funding for those companies related to the whole chain of agribusiness, so, that's why you have this growth concentrated in agribusiness portfolio for companies.</p>
          <p>And we also have securities, I mean, underwriter of securities, private securities of the company. So, that's the way that we have to finance along with a long-term finance those traditional credit lines come from here and there, to finance long-term project of companies. It's very important the focus that Banco do Brasil has put on companies. So, the focus had been investment line, long-term finance. That's good for company, that's good for countries, that's good for Banco do Brasil, because we got cross-selling. We get cross-selling from the companies, because you got loyalty, you are going to have the companies working with the bank more time than it used to be in traditional of working capital line.</p>
          <p>If you analyze SMEs for instance, the only growth that we have in SME segments were those related to long-term finance. We got 7% growth investment line in SMEs. Why, we have negative growth in those working capital lines. So, the strategy is to maintain our approach to long-term financing. And, of course, we're going to fight back competition in SME side and working capital lines to grant to deliver the plan that we have for this year to grow 17% to 20% in corporate loan side. Okay. Basel III, so a Basel III, what do you have?</p>
          <p>First of all, talking about the plan that we will lead to the market from talking about growth, it is done. Credit portfolio is going to grow 2011, 17% to 20% and as a result, the commitment that we are going to have in our capital base as a consequence of it.</p>
          <p>So, we can talk about 2011. 2011, there is no plan of equity raise for this year. Not only because of our plan, but also because of the change in regulation, okay. For 2012 on, we will depend what's going to be the approach implement by the Central Bank. If you are talking about the regulation itself, it is affordable. The total implementation in worst case scenario, it is totally affordable by our current capital base.</p>
          <p>At the end of the year, we are going to discuss the budgets of 2012, 2013 so on and so forth, we are going to have the implementation of regulation and we are going to put it on the table or benefit to get it to see what's going to be the decision really to grow to manage our capital base. But we got that an alternative because bear in mind, by increasing 168bps in our Tier 1 base, we got more room to increase in the Tier 1 and Tier 2 levels. That's a very important point.</p>
          <p>And Banco do Brasil has begun a frequent issuer that would be clear frequent issuer in the bond side because last year we were in a market, I believe it was four times. One of them was to raise a subordinated debt. At the end of 2009 raised hybrid instrumental, so that's something that Banco do Brasil decide to do, as long as we got opportunity in terms of open window to do so. Okay.</p>

          <p>Okay. Let me just follow-up. Central Bank here in Brazil has made already some comments about the interpretation of Basel III. Based on this comment, I'm sure you guys must have done the calculations of your core Tier 1 capital. Can you just provide us what was that number?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon gentlemen. Actually I have a couple questions. The first question Gilberto is referring to margins, we saw based on your slide number 10 in your presentation that we had a slight increase in margins for loan operations with individuals still coming down. I was wondering if, one, you already saw, obviously the new originations are coming at higher spread as for the Central Bank, I was wondering if you already saw that, and when can you expect to see the impact of these new originations to higher spread flow through to your report in them?</p>
          <p>The second question regards &#x2013; as regards to Banco Votorantim, the bank increased its results significantly in the quarter ROE approaching 20%. Two questions specifically; first, was that asset quality declined for Banco Votorantim in the quarter? I was wondering if you could give us some color there, what can we expect? And second, you stopped giving out capital ratio number for Banco Votorantim. As per the Central Bank in December, it was at 13.1%, I was wondering if with the new level if &#x2013; with this new level of profitability if that is sustainable whether the earnings generated by the bank itself will be enough to support the growth that you expect for the bank going forward or will there have to be some sort of a measure or capital infusion into the bank in order to increase its capital ratio? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Talking about the net interest margin, first of all, the guidance that we gave to the market is related to net interest income, okay. So, the assumption that we have that we're going to have 16% to 20% growth in net interest income, so probably consider the guidance of, for hedge portfolio, 17% to 20%. And if by any chance, the earning assets fall in the region of our deposit base, 14% to 18%, we're going to see at the end of the year a slight recovery in our net interest margin of the total earning assets. Analyzing net interest margin of the total credit portfolio, we tend to see a recovery for two factors.</p>
          <p>First of all, we expect to have more growth, continued growth in the individuals' portfolio. Okay. We're going to have a downturn individual portfolio, because of mix effect, mostly, because we expect to see more growth in those lower-yield operation again, as same as we had in 2010; mortgage, payroll loans, financing, so on so forth. So, that puts some negative pressure.</p>
          <p>But if you analyze each product itself, we're going to have to reprice individual portfolio. It's begun after the macroprudential measure and we tend to have everything &#x2013; almost 60% of the total individual portfolio repriced this year, because the duration of the total individual portfolio is at 18 months. Okay. So, it's going to be a mix between increasing those lower-yield operation individuals and the repricing that we're going to have in the fourth quarter, because of the condition in market. And at the end of day, slight recovery &#x2013; sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I was just wondering, if &#x2013; are you thinking we might be able to see that in the second quarter, already, a part of this already?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's &#x2013; part of it, yeah, part of it we expect to see in second quarter, but that's quite tight room too, because of the price of repricing, okay, and the price of the change in mix in the portfolio. Okay. But at the end of the day, we prefer to stay in the guidance that we gave related to NII, because, if by any chance, we have a repo, a real repo that &#x2013; this quarter the repo operation increased, I don't know how much, but it was quite great increase and put negative pressure in spread, because of the tighter spread of this kind of operations. So, at the end of the day, it's better to analyze the NII behavior of the bank and expectations would be for, hopefully, to repeat the growth that we grant in the first quarter 2011 and second quarter.</p>
          <p>So, talking about Banco Votorantim, you're asking about BIS ratio and NPL of Banco Votorantim, so we have a very special quarter, fourth quarter 2010, when analyzing the numbers of Banco Votorantim, okay, out of the curve, I would say, to you. So, the trend is maintained in Banco Votorantim, so when compared Q1 2011 to third quarter 2010, second and first quarter. So, we expect to see a Votorantim at that level, probably, if by any chance, would have some deterioration, could be a slight deterioration, we do not see any with the condition that we have in portfolio, so the trend that you see at that level NPL ratio in Banco Votorantim considering the total portfolio, okay.</p>
          <p>Of course, Banco Votorantim, we have seen a very important change in interest rate charged by the bank. If you analyze the number we leak in December related to interest rates to individual in Banco Votorantim have increased &#x2013; it increased significantly. The numbers that we have been in our MD&amp;A. It was December 1.85%, and now is at 2.19%, as an increase to compensate some &#x2013; to compensate the cost of money, of course, by the macroprudential measures, but also some deterioration that we may have in the portfolio. Okay. Talking about BIS ratio of Banco Votorantim, flat, flat compared that we accounted &#x2013; at the end of 2010, we are at 13%. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the question I had it was &#x2013; is, given that the global profitability increased and you're saying that it will be sustainable, is it going to be enough to support the growth of the loan book? Or in other words, are you going to need some sort of capital infusion or will profitability be sufficient?</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. One final question on Banco Votorantim. Does the bank sell loans either to Banco do Brasil or to other banks in the market?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven an agreement with Banco Votorantim to purchase its portfolio. So, &#x2013; we have with me Marcelo Vives. Marcelo Vives, you can share your thoughts on that, if you --?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Yes. We have agreement to buy individuals portfolio and the expectation is that we can achieve this a little bit less than this agreement, because the macroprudential --</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Following the origination, generalize origination decreased from almost R$10 billion per quarter to 6.6%. So, as a consequence, the acquisition of portfolio of Banco Votorantim through this facility that we have will decrease. But at the end of day, we're going to maintain this status too. So, it's again the part of our strategy.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, we think because &#x2013; no, no, because this agreement with Banco Votorantim, we have agreed since the beginning of last year. So, that's something that there is no &#x2013; it's not the same that we had in the &#x2013; in other quarters. Okay.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Hi, guys. I have a follow-up question on Grupo Votorantim. You mentioned that you saw profitability increased around 500 basis points this quarter. We saw the revenue spread and also better efficiency in terms of personnel and administrative expense, which declined almost 16% quarter-over-quarter. But it call my attention also that the number of Banco Votorantim branch offices reduced 48 branch offices in the quarter and also the number of employees declined in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Do you believe that there is more room for further improvement in efficiency and maybe ROE expansion in Banco Votorantim? I would like to know what are your expectations for next quarter and the main strategies related to the JV? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Regina. When we started the partnership with Banco Votorantim, the main challenge established to the management was to bring Banco Votorantim at the same level of profitability of Banco do Brasil, because when we started partnership, they are below &#x2013; in the low-teens, I'd say to you, so 12%, 13% return on equity. So, this change in the profitability, and we intent to see moving forward this chang in profitability of Banco Votorantim, is a consequence of the negotiation that we have in the bank, because we are in the board of the bank, approving their business plan, their budget.</p>
          <p>And among all those initiatives, it is we have to increase efficiency, we have a part of revenues of the bank, which is originated through partnership with dealers. We have to reduce the cost of &#x2013; by operation, each operation, when talking about the payment of commission to dealer.</p>
          <p>So, many initiatives related to gain more efficiency in the bank to bring Banco Votorantim in the same level of profitability of Banco do Brasil. So, the expectation is to improve, that's the challenge that we have for the bank. I don't know if Marcelo Vives want to add something.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can observe in this first quarter, we are around 28% above the budget. But we can anticipate some kind of revenues from the year, and our expectation is we can achieve this budget in the end of the year. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, the budget, we are quite ahead of the budget, if I may add, okay, quite ahead of budget. But in fact, talking about the budget, the main goal is to bring Banco Votorantim to the same level of profitability of the bank. That's something &#x2013; I'm not telling you that we're going to have it this year, but that's the plan. That's the medium long-term plan when talking about Banco Votorantim, because they got potential to do so.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone. I have two questions. The first on the just going back to your capital ratio issue. The &#x2013; I mean, if you look at the issue that are still to be defined by the Central Bank, I know most of the government have been set. Can you remind us what these issues are that you are waiting for more clarification? I think that's probably related to the recommendation of PREVI but if you can get into more detail on what is being considered or discussed at this point, that would really appreciated.</p>
          <p>And the other point regarding your loan growth, how do you see the &#x2013; your interest in the infrastructure sector in Brazil. I mean, I think it's obvious that, I mean, this is going to be a sector that's going to have a lot of demand for financing. But, I mean, there is not much availability besides BNDES and some of the public banks. Do you see Banco do Brasil increasing exposure to that segment in a material way this year or at least over the next two to three years? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marcelo. So, if I can put in the range, of course, in the first place tax credit, okay, so the guideline talking about 10% of common equity. But tax credit the way we treated it in Brazil, it is mostly related to a time differences. So, if by any chance, onto given extent, so only an exercise here, if by chance, we change the accounting approach it could change the tax credit related time difference, for instance. So, we are in a process of discussing with the banks. So, we're going to see &#x2013; we have to wait for the final resolution.</p>
          <p>In the second place, specifically related to Banco do Brasil, this regiment of actual gains, so we have to wait what's going to be the final conclusion of Central Bank. As far as they are concerned, Central Bank has said that those actual gains, where we can prove that we do have assessed to do it, we're going to be able to maintain our capital base. So, we have proven that we do &#x2013; did have assessed 2000, 2006, 2007 and 2010. So, in regards to the Central Bank, of course, at the end of the day to understand or to allow not to &#x2013; related to the treatment to relates to this issue.</p>
          <p>So, at the end of the day, actually you have to wait to see what's going to be the final resolution. In a worse-case scenario, our current capital base will afford the implementation of Basel III in Brazil, consider the timeline guided by the Central Bank, okay, beginning by July next year. So, that's the point. On the second question --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Gilberto, just a follow-up on this first question, before you answer my second question. I mean is it fair to say that if you were like to work in a worse-case scenario, I mean regarding the Previ case, that &#x2013; I mean if you want to be highly conservative, of course, we don't know if that's going to be the final outcome or not, I mean it might be better than that. We can assume that you are able &#x2013; you would be able to at least keep the &#x2013; or account as core Tier I capital the gains from Previ that are already recorded under this accounts receivables line, I mean the R$7.5 billion. Is that a fair assessment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. Okay. And of course bear in mind, the tax credit related &#x2013; not tax credit, but deferred &#x2013; the tax &#x2013; the liability &#x2013; the tax accounting liability related to Previ, you have to put everything together. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, when talking about Basel II implementation, because of the regulation it's affordable by the bank. So, after the implementation of the regulation, what you're going to have is to decide what's going to be the approach of the bank related to growth, where you're going to grow, what is going to be the alternative related to capital that we're going to put in place to face the need that we're going to have for growth, because for regulations, quite okay. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we asking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, second question involve infrastructure lending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Infrastructure lending, so that's the challenge for everybody in Brazil, okay, because long-term finances in Brazil is mostly limited to be in the source of funding, okay. But we try to see the government put in place some initiative related to private bond releasing from taxation in private issue. That's quite good. We have a fixed strategy on that to provide. That's why we try to see this exposure increase in a bank. That's the way we understand that we can support infrastructure side in the country, so, along with B&amp;S source of funding also underwriting risk to private insurance, okay.</p>
          <p>So, that's the alternative that we have, but at the end of the day very important to bear in mind the price in economy. So, we are in a pricing cycle. B&amp;S tends to be for this year because B&amp;S &#x2013; the cost of fund is to deal the long-term interest rate that's kind of subsidized. So, for this year, we tend to see B&amp;S again ruling the need in the system, but over time capital market tend to be very important alternative and we're going to be there, okay, so that's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you mentioned earlier, I mean in earlier occasions that, I mean there were like about R$85 billion in infrastructure projects that could be analyzed by Banco do Brasil. Is &#x2013; I don't know if you can just elaborate on that number? I mean I talked about that you can actually finance 100% of this R$85 billion, but would that be like in the course of the next like three or four years or that's something that you'd be financing on a three year basis? I mean if that's not the case but if you can just clarify that, I'd appreciate it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe all banks in Brazil have on the table four time as much project to &#x2013; that they have comparing to the money that they have to finance this project. That's the case of Banco do Brasil. Probably according to what we have in the first quarter, R$5.4 billion in long-term financing then to repeat in the following quarters and accounting the same that we had last year, R$23 billion that was the amount disbursed when talking about investment, I mean the flow &#x2013; yearly flow 2010.</p>
          <p>The quarterly flow Q1 2011 was R$5.4 billion. So, compared to R$85 billion, so R$85 billion, the plan that we have is by any chance we having limit approved, of course, analyze our project, we couldn't add these supporting, but at the end of the day we're going to be limited to the money that we got available. So, the budget could be close to 20 something billion reais for 2011.</p>

Should we expect to see resolution on the specific issues with regards to Basel III implementation, the tax credit, the actuarial gains by year-end? I recall from previous conversations with you guys that you expected to see resolution on that I think by December of this year and I just want to clarify if that's still the case.</p>
          <p>Secondly, on your loan growth guidance, your first of 17% to 20%, how comfortable are you with that guidance right now because obviously growth in the first quarter for the total portfolio ran fairly light in comparison to that number. Obviously, there is competition. The economy is decelerating. And frankly, policy makers would like to see the financial system grow at a slower rate. How comfortable are you with the 17% to 20% loan growth guidance at this stage? And is there some downside risk to that guidance?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, the implementation is expected to be at the end of this year. And so what we have as guideline, we're talking about Previ is it is those related to the guideline of February, okay, 10% tax credit, 10% of common equity and Previ gains or actuarial gains those that we can prove in the effect of FX. So, there is no change in the &#x2013; according to conversation or not &#x2013; other guideline from the Central Bank, so the same for time being. Okay. According to &#x2013; what is the next question? It was...</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Comfort, your comfort on the 17% to 20% loan growth value?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we were in February 2012, then we're quite comfortable, because we got 18.9%, so in the mid of the guidance over the March last year, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think just joking, but we're going to maintain the guidance because when we release the guidance, we mention that we expect to see, especially in consumer finance, better behaviors in the second part of the year. More steady growth in mortgage business, but when talking about other consumer finance lines more growth in second part of the year. The same as in SMEs portfolio, the expectation to see recovery in SMEs portfolio because in SMEs portfolio, as I mentioned earlier, we have concentration settlement at beginning of the year, because of grace period we granted at the end of last year.</p>
          <p>So, recovering SMEs portfolio, their growth so quite &#x2013; we're quite in line with system. We've got 3% growth in consumer finance, so expect to see more growth in following quarters. So, we are quite comfortable. Of course, it would depend, if by any chance, there will be or not any change in the regulation macro potential side. But consider that what you've got in terms of regulation, we're going to maintain the guidance, okay. And we're going to have another conversation in the second quarter 2011.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you very much. Gilberto.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're welcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Boris Molina with Santander.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking my question. Just a couple of clarifications, most of the questions already been answered. When you give your guidance of the provision charge, what are the underlying macroeconomic variance into some growth in interest rate that you have? And you mentioned that the consumer finance portfolio would be probably where you could see some risk depending on the evolution of economy, which type do you consider as greater importance, slow GDP growth, higher interest rates or inflation, what could drive asset quality worse here?</p>
          <p>And the second question is just a clarification regarding this issue with the Previ and the recognition for Basel III and the criteria for effective assets. I just wanted to see if you could clarify what are the contractual conditions of this receivable that you have on your balance sheet in terms of when you expect to receive it? How does it &#x2013; or are the mechanics of the disbursement, whether this requires regulatory approvals from local bodies, et cetera? I guess just to understand what is the basis for this asset going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, first question was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Asset quality and drivers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Asset quality, okay. Asset quality, I mentioned earlier that we expect &#x2013; we saw some deterioration in those earlier delinquency ratio, 15 days NPL, 30 basis points below the market because the market accounted 50 basis point increase in 50 days NPL, okay. So, it tends to be seasonal in the first quarter, because in the first quarter we have more commitment of income, Brazil income, more scholarship tuition, taxes and so on and so forth, so more commitment and as a consequence a slight deterioration in NPL ratios.</p>
          <p>If you ask me in a rank what could be worse for a low income Brazilian? Of course, inflation. For companies, GDP growth. So, that's the major driver, because interest rate, it could affect individuals if by any chance we decrease the average tenure of the portfolio. But consider the same installment it could be diluted in installment. It is not an important driver when talking about delinquency. Of course, it is &#x2013; now I'm talking about the 100 basis points increase, 150 basis points increase, not talking about 200 and 400 basis point increase of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What is your current expectations for SELIC? Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At the end of the year, the expectation of SELIC is 12.75%, yeah, 12.75%. And inflation 6.4%, 6.5%, yeah, something close to that. So, for low income Brazilian inflation could be more, could be worse because it hurt their income because there are our commitment related to housing, so rental, food and other commitments. Relatively speaking, it consume more in term of that kind of customers, okay.</p>
          <p>So, that's why when we gave the guidance at beginning of the year related to provision expense of the total portfolio, we gave in a range of 3.3% &#x2013; we got 3.3% last year to 3.7%. First quarter 3%, even lower, 2.8% if you analyze only the first quarter. And we're going to expect to see in a conservative way if by any chance we're going to have more deterioration in delinquency levels. So, if we're going to maintain this 3.64% hopefully, we're going to be in the lower end of the guidance. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And second part, Previ.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the Previ asset, what are the conditions when you record this asset in your balance sheet? And what is the expectation in terms of duration and how the disbursement get authorized and how do you expect to &#x2013; this asset to be realized over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To my mind, it's not &#x2013; it's no longer actual assets that's receivable, right now, the receivable that we have with Previ as we could have with our third part, okay. So, on that, we're going to have updated according to the contract that we have with Previ. So, that tends to follow the benchmark reviews by Previ, so inflation plus the interest rate used by Previ, 5%, I believe so, 5% plus inflation. So, it's going to be updated quarter-over-quarter &#x2013; quarter-over-quarter, waiting for to be cashed out.</p>
          <p>Okay? So, we can use this receivable in other commitment that we have before our proceeds because we have other plan, we have our defined contribution plans. We have the Pre-67 plan, so we have other commitment before Previ can be &#x2013; this money can be used, okay? So, there is no decision made on that regards. So, but over time, that's the final use of this kind of asset.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just to clarify. This is a long-dated asset that grows along with the &#x2013; your actuarial assets and liabilities, but has no defined maturity date. And that will be because whenever there is a kind of a solution of what to do with the surplus at some time in the long future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is no specific maturity date, okay, no specific maturity date. But it is a specific updating of rate that our inflation slows, the benchmark rates are 5%. So, 10%, 11% considering the inflation they have nowadays. So, there is no calculation for these assets, no calculation related to the behavior of the Previ assets, no longer. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's regular receivable.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Victor Galliano with HSBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, most of my questions have been asked and answered. But just to stay with the issue of capital and hoping not to flog a dead horse here. But is there any way around this issue in the form of maybe disposals of non-core assets to bolster capital rather than capital raising? I mean there's been some talk in the press about Banco do Brasil selling its participation in Neoenergia. Are there any other kind of non-core industrial assets that you could sell that could make a difference to your core capital ratios?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Victor, this issue related to Neoenergia, we got &#x2013; our CFO, they stated yesterday that non-core assets depend on the price condition. We can decide to sell that &#x2013; it doesn't matter because it is under our investment bank. Our investment bank, they have two approach; the capital market itself to originate operation, to distribute operation, so on and so forth and to hold participation company, and holding participation company that in the future can sell its participation and join the profit &#x2013; consider the price that we can get in this transaction, and that's it, okay.</p>
          <p>We have other assets, non-core assets under investment bank, but there is no decision made on that regard. So, it's a matter of the underlying because we disclosed our &#x2013; the total stake that we have in companies &#x2013; in many, many companies in our MD&amp;A in our financial. So, when &#x2013; as long as we have some decision related to Neoenergia or related to other assets of the bank, we have to be in a maximum release the material effect to bring that proper transparency on that regard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me see if I can just ask the question in a slightly different way. I mean if you get a very strict ruling or decision by the Central Bank on Basel III, what can be included and what cannot be included in core capital, would that &#x2013; so is that likely to then prompt a discussion on the disposal of some of these core assets and taking advantage of those gains?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Related to those assets, could be goodwill, but goodwill, according to the Central Bank, will be only those accounted from 2012 on. If by any chance related to those assets that we may sell in the future, so if by any chance we have goodwill accounted, it couldn't be deducted in our capital base because we have already accounted, okay. So, I can't see any other...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm looking at it as a solution to a problem rather than us creating a new one, but maybe...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a solution. Yeah, thank you very much, I appreciate. But we have a solution because as I mentioned, in a worst case scenario, implementing everything related to Basel III, we can afford the downturn impact that it could have in our capital base. So, we &#x2013; it would be only a matter to decide in the following years what's going to be the upside of the bank in terms of growth and that's it, not because of there is no pressure on Banco do Brasil only because of the regulation.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Eduardo Nishio with Pactual.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thank you. Thank you for taking my question. Couple of questions. Two questions regarding the insurance channel. Can you give us an update of what's going on there on the restructuring, the approvals needed from Susep and why it's taking so long?</p>
          <p>Also, can you give us a little bit of your views, your outlook for growth this year, if you expect an acceleration after the approval is done for insurance? And one more, on the Basel calculation, whether you're going to consolidate the insurance channels, since this is a non-controlling unit, how you're going to do with the insurance channel when Basel III comes up? I guess you would not be able to consolidate that. Right? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nishio, if you analyzed our IFRS release, we're going to see that Banco do Brasil will maintain the same approach, no matter the accounting pressures, intend to be the same in Basel III when talking about our affiliated company &#x2013; when we do have the partnering control if I can say that. That's the case &#x2013; and it's affiliated company in insurance business.</p>
          <p>That's the case of Banco Votorantim and that's the case of credit card companies. So, when we have operations, it's not the case of non-core companies, but in core companies, when we do have the control with other partners in our JV initiative, we're going to consolidate no matter of IFRS, BR GAAP or Basel, that's our idea. Okay? But at the end of the day, it's up to the Central Bank again.</p>
          <p>And the second point this &#x2013; the timeline of this reorganization related to Mapfre, we are quite advanced. Okay, we &#x2013; in getting the approval actually are in the red tape phase because of the approval &#x2013; we have already gotten it from the Susep, okay. So, we are ready to put in place, to roll the business waiting for the final red tape related to filing the conversation of the company and so on and so forth.</p>
          <p>So, we are almost there. So, the idea is to at least at the beginning of the third quarter to have the bid in force and helping Banco do Brasil to reach on our objective in this segment is that it is to increase the participation of this in our net income to get in five years, four to five years 22% to 25% stake in the net income generation of the bank come from insurance business. That's our goal.</p>
          <p>As you can analyze, after the reorganization of Brasilprev, that was in April 2010, the market share of Brasilprev according to last one that we have increased from 19.9% to 27.4%. That's the idea that we have in mind because if you analyze at the same time the market share that we have in our insurance, it decreased, and why because we're waiting for the approval of this partnership. So, as long as we got it &#x2013; we get it, we are pretty much confident that we're going to be &#x2013; we're going to put Banco do Brasil in the right place that it deserved when talking about everything related to bank service in the country. That's not different in the case of insurance.</p>
