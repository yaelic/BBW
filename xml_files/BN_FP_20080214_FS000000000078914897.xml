      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>So we are going to have a two-time session. The first session will be for journalists, but also for analyst, but I will rather favor journalist questions if possible and then there will be a second time after a short break when Emmanuel and Antoine will explain more in detail the figures, of course.</p>
          <p>The questions are welcome in both parts, but it's just time for the ones to be able to draft what they have to write and then to go deeper and further in the accounts. To speak about the 2007 year I'm going to address this year through some kind of history, so that you can understand before speaking about the New Danone, what we call the New Danone in what spirits we are today in terms of management.</p>
          <p>I don't have any screen, but where is the screen?  There, I have a very small screen.  So first, 2007 it turned out to be amazing, it's a year where we had a lot of things to be performed. We see sale of Biscuits since the acquisition of Numico and the workloads and the impact of these, the Chinese adventures we could also have added for the other business entities, the evolution of raw materials, the impact in terms of marketing pressure as far as the management of the divisions is concerned.</p>
          <p>So the 2007 was really loaded, it was full of significant events, but you already know our result, so it showed the strength of our model, the strength of our teams and the capacity to be reactive.  This chart has been asked by me because I didn't understand when Antoine was showing me the results, which is quite mentoring.  It doesn't mean that I'm totally stupid, but it's &#x2013; the consequence of the former chart, the former slide, we could have accounts in any assumption possible.</p>
          <p>So take this slide as some kind of a glossary, so that you can be explained in what a background I'm commencing these accounts. The idea for me was to be sure knowing that in the world in which we live, I wanted to be sure that we could be talking transparent and to be able to evidence whatever the assumptions the Danone Group reached its objectives for an additional year, whatever the scope, assumptions, like-to-like basis.</p>
          <p>So first slide I am going to speak about the opening scope for Danone.  Once again for me with respect to the Danone management, why? Because we're missing the 12 month of biscuits that the impact is also significant because here the results of the management of Danone for 2007 on the scope on which we committed ourselves at the beginning of the year. I'm not speaking about accounting or financial data, it's the scope on which we committed ourselves, which means Danone activity with Dairy products, with Water were half of one year and Biscuits business too.</p>
          <p>So we see that 7.2% of growth, you see the other skills, which are a bit &#x2013; both in terms of growth of sales and the evolution of margin was 59 basis points, but they recorded that we told that we would be between 6 to 8 and the improvement is at least by 20 basis points.  That's my comment on this slide.</p>
          <p>Second slide, it's where I'm viewing some kind of a history. Before speaking of new Danone Group and looking forward and the enthusiasm we have for the future of our group is to look back what has been done, how did we do it and how did we perform in the previous years, is that totally innocent to go back to '97, even if the current team was already present in 1996, just to show you where we come from, where do we come from and the fact that 10 years ago we decided that we wanted to focus on some businesses, on health positioning and we are convinced that it's effects to the strategy that we could have the results that you have today in front of you.</p>
          <p>If you look at from 2003 an average growth of 7.7, including Wahaha and with our Biscuits because we are already in this future scope around 9%, 8.9 more precisely, which shows that we have the ability, the capacity to improve the models in the course of years. It is true that part of this improvement comes from this these investments because some businesses were less profitable than other. So it's honestly speaking beyond that I think there is essentially simplification and the easiness of a group such as Danone on a daily basis.</p>
          <p>In the decision making process the fact we're refocusing on businesses with its own specificity enabled us to be outstandingly efficient. Next slide, Numico, once again we took necessary since 2003.  You also see that they are really good trends which are spilling out, but also seem to be able to strongly contribute to the model from the 1st of January, 2008, whatever the business is, whatever the business units, Baby Foods or Medical Nutrition.</p>
          <p>Next slide, it's business unit that you totally know, the Fresh Dairy products, including Bl&#xE9;dina because up to the creation of the pool, Bl&#xE9;dina, as you knew, was integrated within this Fresh Dairy fold.</p>
          <p>You have these &#x2013; the figures, you have a list like the figures for the whole year, highly dynamic Q4 with no change of model, but the impact of some increases in tariffs because increases of tariffs, even if they have been highly commented in France, worldwide, globally it has started in June, July or August because most of our increases in the rest of the world were before the beginning of the summer.</p>
          <p>Good news for us is that you see volume growth, which is highly sustained, plus 5%, even if it's seemed weak for the whole Fresh Dairy pool, but it's plus 5% in volume, remains a very strong performance as over more as you know that some increases in prices in some emerging countries could be two digits, which is even more impacting in these emerging countries of two to three months rather than in mature countries.</p>
          <p>What I can say today is that I think we'll come back to a more standard balance in between volume and value. It will take some time.  It won't appear totally at Q1 because some countries, such as Spain or France, will have their increases in tariffs starting 1st of January. For France, for instance, you know that the new tariff has been issued 1st of December, but as you know, you can always negotiate a postponement of this tariff and it has been postponed to the 1st of January.</p>
          <p>But some of our competitors had already started this increase, but you see that we need a full quarter to have a classical standard balance in between volume and value, but you can see the performance is quite outstanding for Fresh Dairy.  What I could say regarding this plus 35 basis points for the second-half, it's more, as I said, a postponement because the increase in tariffs were compensated for in 2007 for these raw materials increases, plus productivity effect.  We always have this time span, I would say, in between the impact of the tariff increase and the impact for us of the raw material increases.</p>
          <p>But you see that if we sum up you can see these margin improvements, which is connected to the outstanding growth increase and when you see that it accounts for 55% of our sales, it's quite ensuring. So Beverages, a very simple comment. We excluded already Wahaha, the company's simple. Beverages is a business which is highly seasonal and you can see it there because as I'm very often telling you if we sold three bottles of water for the third quarter, it's a max for the Central Europe.  So you can see a strong drop of these sales.</p>
          <p>This business is close to heavy industry, which means that if we have a highly seasonal cycle, it shouldn't be too strong because it's difficult for us to just give speaking, when you have a good seasonality the capacity of selling marginal sales is showing a huge impact on margins.  When you don't have the volumes of course you have a very strong drop and quick drop, but you see that in the fourth quarter we came back totally in-line with our expectations and you have less data.</p>
          <p>I have already January, of course. I can see some countries with seasonality, which are totally the opposite of ours, where our growth rates are even higher than those which are explained there on &#x2013; for Q4.</p>
          <p>Numico, I have just one comments on Q4.  I'm going to think about depletion, the sale of Numico towards the end-user is highly sustained. Once again I can speak about January, that is highly sustained sales.  The reasons are quite simple.  First, Danone explained, sorry, used a realignment of the staff management in the various distribution channels, which I'm going to qualify as being more consistent with our policy in other business units, which was not the case for the previous Numico structure.</p>
          <p>And another phenomenon, which is much more classical, the tariff increases was last year in January.  This year it was in February, so we have a performance there on products, which are much more stockable that you can store, storable, rather than fresh dairy products that you can't.</p>
          <p>So I think that Antoine and Emmanuel will come back thoroughly for the impact of this strategy &#x2013; of this will, I would say, rather than strategy.  Of course it didn't disorganize the starting of FY '08 and you can see that even with this realignment at fourth quarter, the business of Numico for the year is, I mean, is consistent with our expectations and highly sustained and it should contribute to the growth objectives that are those of the Group.</p>
          <p>For Medical Nutrition, nothing to add except that we did &#x2013; we performed the same realignments again in Q4. We can just show there and outline there that the growth rate is even more contributing than Baby Food and we know that margin is higher too.</p>
          <p>Before as I told you what &#x2013; before speaking about the New Danone, I wanted to share with you the health strategy of our Danone portfolio, how did we built it?  What are the means?  And how before the Numico purchase because before Numico and after Numico, how did we manage the major lines of Danone Group?  First, you may say that I'm quite proud, but it's quite satisfactory.</p>
          <p>We wanted to focus on value creation for our shareholders. You have here on this slide an item, which is quite interesting, the yield for the shareholder and we will benchmark it with some of our competitors. You have the list bottom of the page, so 19% whereas the benchmark was showing 10% only.</p>
          <p>I think it's quite significant to have the averages of the various lines you have, which is sales growth, the margin, the cash flow, ROIC, which are these items that we decided 10 years ago to introduce in the bonus system for the managers of Danone. So we focus on these various items and it was not clearly the case previously and we think that it's quite interesting to see beyond the managers, which is the consequence or the consequences of the strategy of refocusing the health positioning on a limited number of brands and geographical developments and innovations, research and development upfront.</p>
          <p>The average for the various items are the group could deliver over these last years. Another slide, which is &#x2013; I'm rarely speaking outside them, so it's done with my own words, you maybe amazed.  That's why I need to be close on this topic. When I'm reading this slide, it's exactly the means which have been implemented to deliver the figures I showed you just earlier.</p>
          <p>The major figures show we sold, we disposed of assets for 10 billion, business units, so we'll see that afterwards. Beyond refocusing on health positioning business unit. We sold 7 billion euro, we gave everything to the shareholders because when you add the dividends and share buybacks, you have roughly this 10 billion. And we also just decided to have the Group, so we financed it, we acquired for 9 billion.</p>
          <p>So the net final result of the Group is <mark type="inaudible" /> but once again I'm not a financial guy and I'm performing road shows and I've been asked if share buyback was a strategy or if was it a lack of strategy?  And I think it was interesting before speaking about this New Danone to show what were the major balances and the mass figures that we managed over this last years, last ten years, building, creation, acquisition, share buyback, to have a new net financial debt.  But we are helped by the specificity of Danone in its capacity to generate cash, more specifically in the Fresh Dairy products.</p>
          <p>So what do we want to do now? Nothing really new, nothing real new.  We are going to carry on, we are &#x2013; we have built strategies of being number one everywhere.  One of the priority actions of Danone is to build leadership positions per country.  The fact of being number one worldwide is just the consequence of these will wish to be number one per country, per business locally because we showed in the previous years that it is certainly the thing which could help us to be so strong in terms of innovation, in terms of product launching, in terms of knowledge of our consumers.  Because beyond this wish of being number one locally, you have the obligation of implementing organizations which are leading to that.</p>
          <p>If you just want to be number one worldwide and you have figured at European level, which are not in connection with the countries, so you don't have the proper organization and if you don't have these proper organizations it will have the marketing people being focusing on a specific country, on a specific market, so you don't have the sales force being focusing on a specific client.</p>
          <p>It can be France for Carrefour, it can be a UK for fiscal and according to me it's the results of this strategy beyond the power that it can give you, it can offer you. When we look once again '96-2006, it seems that you know by heart, by the way, the building, the geographical building of this Group, we noticed the short of information and before seeing how Numico is going to impact, it's interesting to have this current picture, snapshot.  When I'm seeing this 2006 snapshot first we transformed the geographical balance of the Danone Group even if you see that France is at 21%, that's we are before Numico and before Kraft we are all in 2006.</p>
          <p>Eastern Europe at 29%, we see the arrival of major geographical areas, which are once again strategically will to create a growth relay even if we are quite proud and we think that our businesses are growing businesses. It is clear that it is easier to offer growth with a Fresh Dairy product in a country where you have this growth potential.</p>
          <p>It's what we call in our jargon these geographical growth relays you have there the evidence of it in terms of strategy.  It's our will to build this to encourage these new countries and if we look at the businesses, you understand the simplification of Group and you can see it's quite obvious.</p>
          <p>Just look at the budget items for Danone, whereas these countries know the business is more.  When you have 50 businesses to manage it means that you have a lot of wet ground, even if it's more.  Today the budget, the strategy, everything around management, the decision-making process are made at Danone quite simply and it was one of reasons which let's me to the dispose the Biscuit business was each time I have to make a decision, I have to prioritize and the priority was always for the other businesses than Biscuits.</p>
          <p>Why?  It's because Biscuits was becoming smaller and smaller in our Group. It was more than most dynamic entity in terms of growth, so it was totally damaged if it could &#x2013; I mean if it stayed within Danone Group, but here you are still with Biscuits.  But you see the simplification of our businesses with a huge power of Fresh Dairy, huge hopes for Beverages, a very small part of Baby Food, so it's only Bl&#xE9;dina and Biscuits accounting for 16%.</p>
          <p>I spoke about the brand strategy all around. That's the result with new brands, such as Activia, Actimel, we could have put Danatte or Petit Gervais, that I call the light range of products on the various brands, brand names. We put Bl&#xE9;dina because we thought a it was nice to recall that Bl&#xE9;dina, which is a very strong growth brand in France, 500 million euros, on a very mature country, was not such a huge number of growth. So we found this development capacity there and I was speaking about the evolution of the market share.</p>
          <p>If we look where we &#x2013; what we reached in terms of assignment because since the assignment of the Danone Group, our assignment is to bring health through food. I know that some of the people speak about this concept. We did it, I just showed it to you and we add this dimension of to bring to the largest number of people, as you know, it's what led us to test a model in Bangladesh is to meet these requirements.</p>
          <p>This assignment, I don't have this slide, by the way, that's a brand new one. This slide is obvious for me when we acquired Numico, being the CEO of the group I attended many presentations by Danone people and Numico people.  Being there attending it led us to conclude because the operation was made already, but we had the capacity, I mean we had assumed the fit, the matching in between Danone and Numico. And that is of help in terms of management.  I would have even said that there were even more social connections and links in between Numico and the Fresh Dairy products of Danone.</p>
          <p>Then in between Numico and Bl&#xE9;dina if today we have something to align, to show you this, sorry, we have this company, the fit we have it's more with this young brother is how we call with Bl&#xE9;dina, the older brother was Numico, so there is an alignment, a very strong alignment there in terms of positioning, health positioning, in terms of what we are looking for at Numico, the plan, profitable growth, innovation.</p>
          <p>It's also present at Bl&#xE9;dina with another culture, and the broad-based geographical presence. Again to give you an example, let me go over of Bl&#xE9;dina, but Bl&#xE9;dina off of Numico. Bl&#xE9;dina is currently launching a milk and a stunning milk.  Very often when you give milk to an infant, to a baby, newly born, if there is an allergy you change the milk and if there is still the allergy, you are told anyway it's going to be cured.</p>
          <p>It's true that the baby is going to be used to this milk.   Bl&#xE9;dina is launching a milk which is called <mark type="inaudible" /> It is evidence that the milk after 10 to 15 days the whole impact on the skin, the whole impact of the allergy on the skin disappears, so this milk up to now is going to be a success in France.  That is where it is only in France. Tomorrow, it's going to be dispatched in 45 countries, it is as simple as that.</p>
          <p>I took this example from the natural Numico, it is a list of people from Numico can also benefit from something which is quite significant.  The development of the specific foods for the Baby up to 18 to 24 months, but now up to three years old. And you have all the brands of Bl&#xE9;dina, which are one of the specificity of Bl&#xE9;dina and they are all going to be also going to be able to be transferred.  And you have also the Numico specificities, which are going to reinforce Bl&#xE9;dina's position.  They now have 20 points in advance of its competitors.  We were equal five to six years ago.</p>
          <p>This is the reason why we think that there's a perfect fit with our activities and so if we look at the Health positioning now and once again that's before starting operations, after the starting operations against the strategy of Danone Health is now 100% executed with some variables in relation to the weight of each of the businesses with the substitution of Danone to Numico.</p>
          <p>I'm not sure I've got the chart actually. Well it is for us really the achievement of a strategy. So &#x2013; well I've already talked about that a little bit, but this is summary of the integration, really, this chart.  The alignment of the things and we have been even surprised because we Danone when we come to Numico we say we don't want to be bothering you, but we said well we can say we're not going to cause that for Numico and all, but Danone Baby Food and they said, why?</p>
          <p>But actually they thought that it was quite logical and there are so many examples of the kind, the alignment of management and if things go as smoothly about, it's because the themes were built up in a very mixed and balanced manner. You have as many Numico people as Danone and Bl&#xE9;dina people because also you shouldn't only think of the integration as Numico into Danone, you also got to bear in mind Bl&#xE9;dina. I'm not totally convinced, actually, that Numico is totally digested itself its acquisitions.</p>
          <p>I knew that there were questions about some people announcement of Numico leaving.  Well, this is the result.  First thing, they've left, but &#x2013; and that was a pity, but they all would have been replaced and let me tell you we've got the resources to meet the needs of Numico.  And we haven't decided to privatize them because we're aware of our priorities, of our responsibilities at this acquisition phase.</p>
          <p>The whole group that favors, if need be, Numico in terms of human resources, essentially you have that right there some or identified and some &#x2013; or even achieved. So we are not &#x2013; we don't have any delays in that regard.  Then there's the much of the revenues, just examples of leads, it will take the necessary time to put them in place, but they are identified anyway. Then science, it is what's &#x2013; what was the most &#x2013; the quickest to do when your non-population of researches now they all want to exchange things with one another, other means have been put in place.</p>
          <p>You already have Numico researchers who work with the researches of Danone and vice versa. So once all that has been set, we're got to look forward and move forward.  Oh, one is missing &#x2013; we've got to go back, so the pro forma had various discussions with Antoine and Emmanuel because I told you I'm not a financial person.  Pro forma, it maybe something that I've got to manage tomorrow with figures that I know.</p>
          <p>But pro forma I was told has got a financial definition and so it's necessary to include in that some part of Wahaha, so it's the left column. So &#x2013; but it's not the one that I'm the most interested in.  The one that I'm interested in is the one on the other side that is the responsibility of management of Danone as of the 1st January 2008 with regard to the future of the company, that is Medical Nutrition, Baby Food, Water.</p>
          <p>And I call it Water because Beverages to me is an odd designation and Fresh Dairy product. So this is what we're going to have to manage in a group of a little bit more than 14 billion euro, a margin of 10.56% and an EPS of 2.38. That's my pro forma and I know it's not pro forma as such, but this is what we're going to base all of our commitments on for the future years.</p>
          <p>So within what we've built, how we've built it, what is the signed platform of Danone and we can see on where what we explained before that it is the Health positioning at 150% be bounced between the business lines.  We can see also that the geographical allocation is wide-spread in Eastern Europe because the Nordic countries and Numico have joined when we didn't have a very strong presence as Danone and so we have a fantastic &#x2013; fantastically balanced presence in Europe with France and Spain only representing 14% of our turnover now, which is quite different from the Danone that you may have known about 10 years ago.</p>
          <p>There is no conclusion to be drawn, but I think that is going to be accelerated because the emerging areas have got heavier and heavier weights. So let me come back to this chart, so just a reminder, you know that our guidance is not for the coming year, but that it represents commitments over several years. Why?  Because our strategy does not evolve very much, our business lines to do not evolve very much either.  It is not about executing the strategy than changing the concepts every year.  That's why we commence ourselves over a number of years. So before 2006 we had a commitment of 5 to 7% of growth and it was zero to three years before that.</p>
          <p>It was modified in 2007, considering the pressure of our results of our performance because when we made calculations at the end of the year, even though we didn't have a very clear vision of what we were going to do with Wahaha in China, that had an impact minus 20%.  But we have committed ourselves to raise those targets to 6 to 8% and after what was just presented, given that I'm not a mathematician, it didn't seem to be consistent just to stay with a target of 6 to 8.</p>
          <p>So we've gone a little bit further because we consider and we think that it's our responsibility after this acquisition that we must all consider that given the if the context is the calculated it's half optimistic, we consider that's our geographies, our projects, our brands, etcetera, can lead us over a number of years to reach growth level of between 8 and 10% of the turnover.  And our will is to develop the sales, improving the margin at the same time and that's the following slide. It's not as precise as the previous years because we want to be running now.  We want to go faster, so you've got to release something when you want to do that. So within an operational margin that much is all of the commitments that we've made.</p>
          <p>That is that it will grow more rapidly than at Danone, that it will improve every year.  Than this specificity for 2008, for 2008 I told you that we already had made clear and strong commitments concerning the synergies with Numico and we highlight them to be 45 million euro in 2008, so that's 30 basis points minimum and the synergies of Numico will not be reinvested in the growth means.  We have them.</p>
          <p>So those synergies will be re-injected totally in the margin of the Danone Group because we don't need these synergies to reinvest them in advertising, researches or other. We've got the means to grow without that and due to maybe the marginal benefits of the synergies that we are going to achieve, first you take 30 basis points and make some calculations you realize quite rapidly that margin of Danone is going to reach a rate that is gross something that we imagined some years ago, but we didn't think &#x2013; we didn't know how long it would take because it's the result of a strategy even though there's been assignments and acquisitions.</p>
          <p>The Danone Group will reach an operational margin of 15%, which is quite a high level if you look at the charcoal chart of the Group over 10 years and the EPS for 2008 is more than 15%, so I think I've told you everything.  Obviously I'm ready to answer all of your questions, but please may I remind the analysts that there is a specific session for them after the break with Emmanuel and Antoine and I'll stay here anyway, even though I'm not competent, so there will be very detailed presentation of the accounts for 2007.</p>

          <p>One can try, well in fact maybe I would ask you read again the press release of 21st of December.  That was the last official press release concerning this matter because it includes many of the elements that we could share with you today.  The first thing is we have stopped on both sides all of the legal procedures whether in China or elsewhere from the 21st of December at midnight. The center of this agreement to start negotiations and on amicable terms was done with representatives of both governments, there were representatives of the French government with us in Beijing. The main principles that govern the negotiations are quite important, one is equality. That is obviously ambiguous from the point of view the mode of consolidation, and it's one of the reasons why when we've looked at all of the events that have unrolled in the second semester, we've considered that the elements that characterize the notion of exclusive control were not met and that's why we've changed the mode of consolidation of Wahaha to go from a global one to one on the basis of equivalence. And it can also be understood and from the point of view of the negotiations, the important point in this press release is there are sanctions that as the parties commit to continue discussions, the aim of which will be to find a solution that will allow to make the beverage business of Wahaha grown.</p>
          <p>Then there's a comment that is more the political nature that reminds that it will enable to strengthen the cooperation between France and China. So I want to make this reminder because it's important, it really is according to these principles that we are working with the Wahaha team. We communicate all the time and that's according to a schedule that I cannot comment on today.  While there will be ups and down, I'm sure, but I think it'll still go on for several months before we can implement a solution.</p>
          <p>So the change in the mode of consolidation is only going to, from our point of view Danone, allow us and our environment more legibility of the accounts when you look at the way they were disturbed last year, by the evolution of the situation in terms of the products manufactured in the network organized by our partner. So we are working on that matter and we've decided to put ourselves in a situation that will allow us to find a sustainable solution.  Another question?</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'd like to come back to the agreement that you've concluded with Weight Watchers. So, does it mean that so Danone is starting a new business line?  Is it part of the new strategy in relation to emerging markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it's more in relation to a method of Danone that is to try to validate and understand things that we consider to be outside the scope of our business.  It's a business of service and obviously that can be of interest to us, but it's a geographical area that we know better and better.  I'm talking about China and hence, when you have ranchers like <mark type="inaudible" /> that you have a health position in that people talk to you about obesity all day long, obviously it's almost natural to get interested in this kind of business.  But as of today there's no plan, there is no project outside of the one that has been described.</p>
          <p>But in China with Weight Watchers, and we don't have even majority participation. We're just participating in it because we're interested in getting to understand this kind of business, the methodology of Weight Watchers because Weight Watchers for us is not at all a new channel of distribution to sell finished products. We just want to understand the notion of service in a health environment, but it no way -- and actually the business of Weight Watchers is really about advising, explaining more than it is to sell products, even though there are some Weight Watchers products. And actually if it had been the case then we wouldn't have gone for it because our brands can sustain this kind of positioning and we don't have to share, really.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Mr. Riboud, or good afternoon, sorry. I'd like to come back to France if you'll allow me. And especially concerning the report that's been published in the recent days concerning the industrial positioning.  We've heard that there are very difficult negotiations with distributors in France.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now it was my first job really, it was the job that I had for 10 years and I've always thought that they were very hard, those negotiations.  But having said that, even last year we were told that they were really hard and I said that they have never been as easy.  The timeframe in which they happen is more and more precise, so the way they're happening now, while they've been opened and at the end of last year, now we just have to negotiate the evolution of the conversion from net to gross figures. You know, it's always the same really, a negotiation is really according to the pressure that you've got on your shoulders. If I didn't have the Danone brand in hands, if France didn't make 60% of my sales &#x2013; if, if, if. I would have more pressure than I do.  When you look at the positioning of our businesses, of our business lines and our strategy has been to be number one locally, just to give you an idea, the market share of Activia in France is 11%.  I think that's the market share of our competitors.  But all of that range is about the same.  So it's not about negotiating, it's about making business grow together.  That is the topic, say the first part of your question of &#x2013; I've always been under the pressure -- under the impression that disputers wanted to negotiate the tariffs.  But now I've got the capacity to build the business plans with reciprocal commitments to grow our and their turnovers.</p>
          <p>So this is our priority and some others take more radical positions.  I've read the press release of the <mark type="inaudible" /> you've got to understand I am not talking about the <mark type="inaudible" />  But <mark type="inaudible" /> represents the spectrum of companies that are very different from one another, of different sizes, they don't necessarily have the same business.  So there again, it's clear that the pressure on the first transformation and first processing, it was written in this report, were to be implemented, well the impact would be strong because the differentiation is weaker, the added value's weaker, lower.  But it's not the case of Danone.  And then I've got the habits in this country to wait and see what is going to happen and to -- I may make real comments.</p>

          <p>I'm just a journalist, but like to get some comments concerning the profit and loss accounts and &#x2013; well, you can start with if you want to, you're invited.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it was 300 euro, I think it was totally absorbed by increase of the process, and some proximity increase.  You've got the same impact in 2008.  So already it's been absorbed for 2008 by price increases in July and August and December. Just a supplement.</p>

      <speaker type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the price increase is about 5 to 10% according to the country but that milk &#x2013; well, we use lot of liquid milk and liquid milk, you can't store it, you can't carry it, so it depends on the contracts that we may have with milk producers. If you take the example of the USA, the increase was about 5%.  It was before the summer in May or June I think, but it was varied for the whole period, so we're covered.  So we have settlement terms with some spot positioning, but on average it's 5 to 10%. You wanted to add something?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What are the other projects you have in 2008 for Fresh Dairy Products in China?  And what is going to be your reaction to the acquisitions of &#x2013; accusation, sorry of misleading advertising in the US?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now in China I've read rumors, we said that we're not going to comment on rumors.  The only things I can say is that we have deactivated our joint venture in China and China is a very important country for us. It is obvious that we've got projects of development of our blockbusters in China and even if the JV has been deactivated, we've got an agreement with <mark type="inaudible" /> which is such that the success of Activia in Shanghai is sustained and we don't want to comment on those negotiations.  But the second question, yes the US and advertising.  Well, there must be 150 class actions in the US, we're part of one of them.  We have responded quite violently because there was no demonstration of the fact that this advertising was really misleading. We take it seriously but we've got specialized and very competent lawyers who defend us -- actually the same advertising as in the rest of the world.</p>
          <p>For Essen 6 in some countries, in Spain for example, it's a good start; in France it's slower even if are above what Daneko used to do at its launch. I think the concept is more difficult to set up, first thing.  The second thing, when I think that there are elements of the marketing mix took the reports.  And third there are other clinical studies are going to be published to reaffirm the health effect on skin of Essen 6. We are convinced that we have got to be patient.  The difficulty is more the capacity of our relationships with large distributors if we are transparent with the previous questions. It's true that Activia has got some &#x2013; is difficult to be removed from departments &#x2013; is not the case with Essen 6.  But we're convinced that this current concept has got a future and an efficiency that will be stronger in consumers' heads.  I say we've got to find the right marketing mix but that the way that the good mode of performance of the project.</p>
          <p>And, but the studies that allows to understand how to position the products with the products being refined.  But the product was launched at an early stage and the target was realigned between 25 and 35.  And we are realizing today that people between 45 and 65 are more eager to buy this kind of a product because it's a matter of right of humidity. So we've got to understand better what can be the target of SN 6 maybe a more restricted one.  Because it's a response to an issue for a particular target, while maybe the target is not as large as we thought in first place, but so be it.  But we are building up our blockbuster as we always do.  It takes the necessary time but felt that we have more positive results in other countries, help us also -helps us to refine our position.</p>
          <p>The French market was a little bit better at the end of the year, you know that it has been negative for a few year.  But you should be &#x2013; you should pay attention because the fresh dairy market even if it was slightly negative, is much less negative than the milk market or the oil markets.  Within this market, Danone France reacted quite well because we are now positive with gains in market shares and it's the same demonstration. When you have a market, you take all the categories of products from the basic yogurt to Activia. I can tell you that in France Activia has a two-digit growth and the first figure is at one. The growth of Danette, which was a quite dead product five to six years ago has been revisited in qualities and in mix, and today it has the same product and the two-digit growth as for Activia that was launching of products, its labels and quality.</p>
          <p>The wide management range of products is also growing. Actimel needed some fine tunings.  It is reaccelerating now, but of course it's what we call, the commodities, they are decreasing. So we are currently in a country where we have 30 kilos of fresh dairy being consumed per year and per inhabitant. The target is not to reach 70 kilos, but to have a switch in between the yogurt and Activia or weight management I feel is more interesting for us.  That's our marketing approach.  Rather than increasing the number of kilos per year per inhabitant knowing that in the States it's 4 kilos, in Russia, it's 3. So don't think I'm totally disinterested in France, obviously it's not. It's just that mechanically speaking in terms of potential, we have so many things to do in other countries that some of our means in terms of investments &#x2013; industrial investments are made in countries which are requiring that type of investments due to the growth more specifically for the States, Russia, tomorrow China. We launch in Thailand, Activia and we are reaching 20% in Egypt after two years of launching. So we have to manage all this growth potential, but it's a nice thing to be -- France is growing now as far as Danone is concerned. As the market share is above 40% we may imagine that it helps for this recovery of the markets, that's true. No more questions?  Last one.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I'd like you to explain why you are speaking of water rather than beverages and if you could explain its health in China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Emmanuel, will speak to you about Health.  Why I'm thinking about water, because we have explained since -- but it was in Moscow what was our strategy in terms of beverages?  Actually we're going to refocus strongly on source water than mineral water. When you are saying that we are selling water, we're not selling H2O, we are selling a product with water, but with also a high emotional charge. Taking the same example, if you buy a bag just to carry, you would take a plastic bag, if it's just a function of the bag.  When you buy a bag, it's because you have a message you want to have it to be more than practical, more than being able to carry. So the reasoning on water is the same.  To sell water is to take into account the resource of protected, to have society role around this resource and then to have a health benefit because it's the water which is totally natural.  But also to endorse the best part of the water, to implement in all the countries, such as where you can recovery these plastic bottles through waste disposal or because we are reusing more and more in the countries where we can do it because this recovery has been made possible.  PET, to be able, not to re-do bottles not starting from oil, but from PET being recycled.  So we are focusing now on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Why?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because it is our know-how.  Our know-how is not to carry in trucks water bottles that's coming from Malaysia.  Other people can do so with spice, and this is our business. The business I just described is that a business was a high-value being added.  We don't have the leverages of this business, whereas when we are speaking about source water and mineral water, we showed, we evidence when you see the success of Evian through the world or Bonafont in Mexico or Villavicencio in Argentina, we have this know-how.  And we're going to reproduce that type of approach in various countries because we know that we can value this approach. Afterwards, there are beverages, and our beverages are one more built around our water brands. So they comply and they enriched the approach I just explained to you.</p>
          <p>And the best example is the product that you're going to see in the months to come.  It is evolving through the flavor in which we don't have any additive, no additive at all. And the taste is quite outstanding.  Why?  Because and the commitment is quite strong.  Because to be able to have that type of product, you need to have a bacteria management of the industrial process with a lot of optimization and a lot of research and effort in terms of investment. And beyond that we are developing functional drinks, but with this consent of being close to what we know, everything dealing around the water aspiration.  That's why I told you that our beverages development is going to be on the long run more sustained in what we call the fresh dairy product rather than the beverage unit in which we put some kind of strategical spectrum.</p>
          <p>Whereas the fresh diary report, which is above &#x2013; which is using milk as a raw material, but if you take Senj&#xE0; soya, and we are convinced that these health benefits that we're developing today could be developed on other platforms, other food platforms in the years to come and may be on -- and beverages or any other format. That's why we are &#x2013; we remain convinced they have a high potential of development because we totally manage the benefits on health connected to some active yields. And we are currently making more and more clinical studies, because we are increasing the clinical demonstration on our product.  But the food platform we'll see that I think this can evolve, because we think that 70% of our benefits on health should come from nature and not from chemistry. A very last question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For the milk brand, you have the project to ask milk producers to produce milk with Omega 3. Is for Normandy now, do you think that you're going to expand that for whole French territory?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the same answer that <mark type="inaudible" /> for, which is very quickly because we are in association with Bleu-blanc here.  Why?  Because once again is part of the society commitments of Danone.  It's a way of valuing the milk.  And once again while not saying that we are going to have more Omega 3s or we are going to increase the effect of the Omega 3s, we are rather in an approach saying that let's reintroducing Omega 3s naturally from the milk in a natural way.  And we know that when we control the food of the cow, we'll be able to have these results, we'll have also other results as you know.</p>
          <p>The other result is the quality and the yield of the milk, because you know that today milks are fed, I mean cows &#x2013; sorry, cows are fed with grass from April to June.  The rest of year it's a dry food, which can be natural, which can be vegetable, and third thing is we are speaking a lot about the granule of the environment for methane.  One of the major source of pollution of the planet is the methane abdicated by cows.  You laugh of course, but I can tell you that's true.  The fact of transforming the feeding of cows and cattle has to monitor that type of pollution emanation, I would say in terms of methane. So, we are going to start to validate all these things.  Then it will depend upon the management for this milk collection. In France, we have a transferability of our milk collection, which is total and so on and so forth. So, we will expand that of course.  Very last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Why the departure, Mr. Giscard d'Estaing?  Why Mr. Faber being back and who is going to be in charge of Asia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The departure of Mr. Giscard d'Estaing, we spoke about it first.  He had other personal choices. Second, he wanted to report to the Group President. So, he preferred to leave Danone Groupe.  I'm going to thank him because he really helped us with Kraft and Numico, but that's life. I have my vision of the organization of my group and you see that we can stay together and he will review the accounts and everything is okay in the best way possible, that's life.</p>
          <p>When you reach a certain level of management, we need to be honest, we need to be frank, but we shouldn't modify the way of the vision of your personal view.  And for me for Danone the vision I have for the organization of my company, the return of Emmanuel, why?  Because I decided that he had to become Vice President of Danone with to support to my Board, because I think that he has the skills beyond finance, because you know he's going to cover everything which deals with society, human resources and finance. He's in love with that. I think Emmanuel is getting up and he is interested and he's interested in doing so.</p>
          <p>So it's quite simple. Don't try to be too complex.  Things are simple, on plan as other project.  Emmanuel is happy to come back.  One is leaving, the other one is coming back. Emmanuel is coming back as a Vice Chairman, not as a CFO. So the one we're going to replace, Antoine wants to be in a health company, and that's because he was working in a super good company, I believe. You need to be simple when you have a certain level of management. All these people are quality people.</p>
          <p>Who is going to chair Asia? Asia is reorganized. Asia is dedicated to be -- is dedicated to come back in its initial businesses. What today is not Aqua Indonesia being connected to Damascus, is certainly the best news for water business in Asia.  Why?  Because in the very organization of Danone, one of the specialties of this group is not to invent the wheel, is to show an evidence that something is working and to be organized to rolling out in the rest of the world.  And we can do it because we have that business organization. We are highly decentralized and sometimes there is some clash in the &#x2013; in various &#x2013; the various business.</p>
          <p>Baby Food is within a newly created organization that is quite simply created because it's a biscuit organization and then the day after, it's a baby food organization.  It's chaired by Christian Neu being the boss of dairy products for Germany and Northern Europe. We think we'll have &#x2013; we have time now to negotiate, and it's much easier now to negotiate in China because you don't have the leverage. You just negotiate.  You have time to negotiate and as Emmanuel said, to negotiate to reach solutions, which will be positive solutions, we need to have time to deliver these. But all this period, you don't imagine what Emmanuel Pei Sheen, Bertrand, could learn from this Asia area and this major country being China. It's useless to say that we don't want to lose these skills and expertise.  So beyond Emmanuel's comeback, is the comeback but he remains the CEO of Asia, because I want him to carry on to help the teams from what he could learn from positive or a conflict situation such as the Wahaha situation. So that's what I wanted to tell you.</p>
          <p>Sorry, I couldn't answer the question. The Asia businesses are connected to the people chairing the Asia region. It's rather simple.  It's natural.  We were not organized like that before. I like to have searches being implemented when we have the money for it. So it was not clever for us to have people around the world being based at the other part of the world. So we needed to implement our local skills.  Thank you.</p>

    <section name="MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION">
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome to those of you who are listening to this comp call from outside of Paris.  I'm sitting here with Emmanuel, and we will go through the detailed numbers for 2007.  We hope you all have in front of you the presentation because there are some technicalities and complexities which need some time to be explained for 2007.</p>
          <p>So our agenda is the following:  We'll discuss briefly the impacts of what has happened in 2007 in terms of scope, and they are especially important to understand so as to better read the performance.  So we'll discuss the different &#x2013; we'll discuss the operating performance of the different businesses.  We'll give you some flavor on the Numico business for the fourth quarter and full year.  We'll then move to the different set of numbers, which we have to publish; the two sets of numbers being either the opening scope, the businesses which we run in 2007, or the published IFRS version.  And I will of course give all explanation on the definitions themselves.  Then we'll move to a traditional balance sheet cash flow statements, and we will finish with a view on the pro forma numbers as if we had had Numico for the full year, and if we add at the same time all the financing of Numico.</p>
          <p>So I turn to the significant events, and of course the first one was the disposal of Biscuits.  The chart that you can read on Page 31 has to do with the capital gain which was booked.  As you remember, this business has been sold for a cash-free, debt-free 5.3 billion euro.  And the gain on the disposal is 3.1 billion euro.  The only point on which we want to draw your attention is the fact that we still have something to receive in 2008, which is related to the JV we have with Pleko for the Mikado business, and this payment is due and has not been booked for that reason in 2007 and is due in 2008.  And still has slight difference with the 3.3 billion euro of capital gain that some of you have had in your previous numbers.</p>
          <p>So do how we account for the Biscuit business in 2007?  Under IFRS, as you know, this is a business which is a discontinued activity; i.e., no sales and no EBITs, only a contribution to earnings, which is only on 11 months.  So any time when we discuss at a later stage, the Biscuit activity under IFRS we only have the earnings.</p>
          <p>One last chart, probably on the business conditions in the Biscuit division for these last 11 months.  This was a good year again with, as you can see, relatively good growth momentum across the quarters.  The full 11 months showed a plus 6.5% growth, the margin reached almost 14%, which was a good margin, and we've tried to estimate what the fourth quarter would have been.  It would have been plus 7%.</p>
          <p>Once again, this is just for the records because, as you have understood, no sales are booked under the IFRS numbers.  We only keep the Biscuit when we speak of the opening scope.</p>
          <p>I'll move now to something more significant, which is the acquisition of Numico.  Just to give you a reminder of the timeline, and there again it's key to keep in the back of our minds what has happened to understand the impact this has had on our numbers.</p>
          <p>As you remember, very early in the process, i.e. around the 10th and the 11th of July, the group bought a first 29% of Numico, for which of course we have had the financing for the first -- sorry, for the second half of the year.  So we have indeed bought Numico and have not had any profit before conciliation and we have financial costs for these last six months when we acquired this first block.</p>
          <p>Then the following steps were of course the clearance from the EU and of course the settlement of the shares.  We gained control of this company early November; i.e., this business under IRFS is conciliated only for two months.  We have only two months of sales and profits of Numico under certain assumptions that I will explain later on.</p>
          <p>Now I move to something which has to do with the price which was paid, just to read the balance sheets properly later on.  The final acquisition costs, the cash-out was 12.2 billion euro including the production costs related to that.  Of course we found some equity in this company.  Against that, Numico had some trademarks and goodwills which we put back to zero.  And the final allocation of the price is goodwill and trademarks.  We've reallocated the price, the 12 billion euro, to trademarks, approximately 3.3 billion euros on which you have to book the tax and the goodwill.  So the price is split roughly 25% on brands of trademarks and the rest in goodwill.  This means there are extremely few changes in tangible assets, which would impact the future of Numico.  So most of it has been allocated to intangible and goodwill for which there are no amortization at a later stage.</p>
          <p>One minor point which has to be explained, I'm sorry for being technical at this stage, but this is how it works under the company rules.  Once you acquire a company you go through fair value adjustments on everything including the inventories you find at the time when you buy a company.  So this means you put back the value of your inventories at the selling price. And we see that of course later on when you sell these inventories you do not record the profits related to these inventories that you've bought.  So you will see later on that we have this impact of the step-up of inventories that we found at Numico.</p>
          <p>I move maybe to a slide which is on Page 35, sorry, which probably is the most important to properly assess the performance of Numico in the last two months.  The last two months of 2007, of course, are absolutely not representative of the underlying trends of Numico, precisely because these were the two months when we decided to properly take a certain number of decisions so as to prepare the future.  And there are four major impacts that you must be aware of when you read the performance.  The first one was mentioned already by Franck Riboud. It was a tradition at Numico to be relatively aggressive at the end of the year to push and ship other products to the trade. And we have decided to be extremely cautious, on the contrary, and you will see that in the soft landing of sales that you will notice on Q4.  And we decided purposely not to push to a certain extent the sales to our distributors.  This has resulted into a decrease of the level of the inventories at the level of the trade by four or five days across the board in most geographies. This is a managed decision, has nothing to do with the underlying business, and of course is here to prepare us for the future so as to start with the right team base of relatively reasonable level of stocks in the different business where Numico operates.  One can estimate, and you will be capable to do that very easily when you look at the fourth quarter sales, that by doing so we will use the sales probably around 50 million euros.  And of course this has an impact on the profitability with a normal fall-through of 50% or something like that.</p>
          <p>So this is number one impact.  It is managed, it is decided.  Christian Neu has full responsibility for this division, has asked of course the executive committee and Franck Riboud to do that. This has been decided.  It has nothing to do with any problem at the level of the Numico trade.  On the contrary, I take the opportunity to say already that the beginning of the year is extremely good and favorable.  So there is no change in the trends of the underlying business.</p>
          <p>Number two impact is the second box you see here, the one I just mentioned.  Again, increase of the value of the inventories, and no profit generated from the sales of these three-year asset inventories.  And here again we have a negative minus 50, which you will find in the numbers at the end of the day for at least two months.</p>
          <p>Then on the top, these two phenomenons, the soft landing reducing the sales level, and the step-up of inventories.  Those two impacts are recorded at the level of the operating income.  Then we have taken additional decisions exactly like some other companies when you have big acquisition, which were of course to prepare the future and provide -- and make the necessary provisions either to anticipate the full alignment of the IT systems.  There are of course some writedowns to do so that we can inter-operate those two companies efficiently and to terminate some distribution contracts, especially in a limited number of countries we're having now both Bl&#xE9;dina &#x2013; these were exports, present Bl&#xE9;dina- where having Bl&#xE9;dina and Numico will mean we'll have to pay specific fees to these -- one-off fees to these distributors.</p>
          <p>So this is the third box, which is the one on the left, with a normal charge of around 39 million euros.  And then there's been some additional work so as to do some restructuring, mostly in Western European countries which we call here synergy preparation.  Most of it has to do with synergy.  Some of them were productivity plans that Numico would have done in any case, mostly in Germany, the UK and Belgium.</p>
          <p>So these are the numbers that you will see when we report the full numbers of Numico.  And these are decisions that have been taken, once again, so as to prepare the future and be sure we start 2008 from a very clean base.</p>
          <p>Maybe I can turn now the floor to Emmanuel to give some update on Wahaha itself.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>For those who did not attend the previous session, I will briefly remind you of where we think we are with Wahaha on this chart.  The first thing I think is important to keep in mind, the Wahaha brand is doing well on the market.  It continues to have great consumer acceptance, great push through the trade.  Whatever the products, or wherever they products come from, whether they come from our joint venture factories or whether they come from the non-joint venture factories.  So it means that the business itself is doing well, and so far we don't think that when we take the whole of Wahaha together there has been disruption.  We don't think that there has been a disruption owing to the dispute between the shareholders of the company.</p>
          <p>As expected, and as already guided, the sales our joint ventures on a consolidated basis have declined by 20% in 2007, which is entirely linked to the fact that the product manufactured in the non-joint venture factories have stopped being sold through out joint venture sales company and diverted through an independent sales company with the products, or the sales of our products, being slightly growing on the market.  But obviously as in the previous year we have the entire portfolio of products, including the non-joint venture products.  We account and we recognize in our accounts the fact that we've lost those volumes.  I don't think there is any thing on this.</p>
          <p>Overall the impact on Danone accounts have been limited because again, as you know, we did not make any significant margin on the sale of the non-joint venture products and, therefore, the amount of profits that we've actually lost from those sales is very minimal.</p>
          <p>The free cash flow has been impacted for one main reason, which is that in preparation for the network of parallel sales last year, sorry in 2006, at the end of 2006 there had been very significant step-up in the amount of customer deposits being received by Wahaha in November 2006 which we have booked in our accounts and which have essentially then served in the financing and the business of the parallel business.  So this customer deposits that we had in "excess" in 2006 have disappeared from our consolidated balance sheets in 2007, and therefore, there have been a significant decrease in the cash flow if we had consolidated Wahaha on a 12-month basis.</p>
          <p>This chart is simply to remind you of some meaningful recent events about Wahaha.  I will just come back again very simply to what we signed on December 21st in Beijing.  The last two bullet points, peace talks to resume with the spirit of both equality and mutual benefits and the objective of those talks, the last bullet point here, is for both partners to grow together the entire range and the entire group of Wahaha Beverage companies.  This is the objective of the peace talks that we are currently holding with Mr. Zong with the support and guidance of both Chinese and French government.</p>
          <p>In January you may have noticed that following my appointment here in Paris we reviewed internally, according to our policy internally of Danone, the number of Board directorships and chairmanship that I had in Asia and I resigned from a few of them, including one in China &#x2013; two in China actually, one in Indonesia, Aqua And this review, including Wahaha, so I resigned from the Wahaha chairmanship in January which I think in China was seen as another sign of peaceful discussions and peaceful resolution of the conflicts.  It now puts the appointment of the chairman of the Wahaha joint ventures on the table of the global discussions.</p>
          <p>And the latest event is our announcement today that Wahaha will be equity accounted as of June 2007 and going forward on the basis that when checking the multi-criteria, or the multiple criteria which define exclusive control which is necessary for global integration, we estimated and we decided that all the conditions weren't met anymore and therefore moved the consolidation mode of Wahaha from global integration to equity accounting. This again, we think from a Chinese perspective, is also helping and will probably to help in the resolution of our discussions with Mr. Zong. So I think in a nutshell that's where we are with Wahaha. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>So the next page is just a reminder of what Emmanuel has just explained, which is a how you can look at Wahaha either from a full year perspective, this is where we call the opening scope or if we take only one first half full consolidation and the second half only as an equity investment, and this is a transition to the next slide, which is I'm sorry for once again having to take you through all these details.  But we need to add those two sets of definitions.  This is a year when we have those two big divestments.</p>
          <p>By the way they happened at the end of the year so that's why it's a bit difficult for us to be the things in a simpler way, but we have to try to explain this performance under these two sets of numbers.  So, I'm sorry for repeating but I think it's easier this way.  What we call opening scope is Fresh Dairy, Waters, Wahaha for the two first semesters and Biscuits for the first 11 months, and what we call IFRS is Fresh Dairy, Waters, Wahaha as a fully consolidated company for the first half, Numico with its financing cost from July and with only two months of profits.  So, these are the two sets of numbers.</p>
          <p>Now, before we see how we have performed and the message here is whatever type of presentation you take we've met all our commitments, so just here to demonstrate that we've met those performance under those two sets of numbers.  Before we do that let's go maybe and have a look at the different business lines.</p>
          <p>So of course the first one is Fresh Dairy and the message that you can see on Page 41 is we ended the year with a very sound growth, a very good one.  The value content of which is of course smaller at the end of the year but we still little later on in the presentation we still have five points of volume in this last quarter, but a plus 13.9% quarter is absolutely excellent.  So, at the end of the year, the full performance of Dairy is plus 12%.</p>
          <p>You see on the chart itself that this has generated a fantastic leverage and even though the pressure from the milk price was very strong this division has been capable to generate a very good margin improvement and I will come back on this one.  Last but not least, when you look across the geographies and the comments that you have here are just for the fourth quarter.  Eastern Europe, LatAm were fantastic and a very good news, which was some subject of concern for some of you at least at the beginning of the, year which is that the US operations will be doing very well at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>We see very good growth, north of 15% in the fourth quarter. At the end of the day, the business generated by the four block business is growing overall more than 20% so an outstanding probably for Fresh Dairy.</p>
          <p>I move to beverages and of course one should read if you want to have a clear picture without Wahaha just to get rid of those changes in consolidation.  So, the underlying x Wahaha businesses in the blue line would give us a full year of plus 6% and of course you see that we have a three good quarters and we missed one.  The one was the one of course the third quarter when the weather conditions were bad in Europe and as a result of that, some major markets like the UK, France, Germany and Spain mostly were pretty much hit.</p>
          <p>At the end of the year, the business was well in the gross profile gain.  You see that the fourth quarter was positive double-digit with a good number of especially in LatAm and Asia x Wahaha, which is mostly in Japan and Indonesia.</p>
          <p>The geographic view of course is consistent with the analysis that we've just made.  Just to mention that Europe was pretty solid again.  In the fourth quarter Europe was almost 9%, Asia x Wahaha accelerated its growth as you can see it plus 9, plus 8, plus 15, plus 18, so a good end of the year for those businesses which we have there.  And the rest of the world this is again on the back of relatively high equivalent quarters a year before.  The business was in very good shape in the rest of the world as well.  So, we enter the 2008 year with a pretty good momentum in all these geographies.</p>
          <p>Next slide is about the break I already mentioned of volume and value for the full year and of course as you can see it the price impacts and the increase of prices were more significantly in Fresh Dairy and Beverage and more significant of course in Europe and in the rest of the world.</p>
          <p>I'll move now to the performance of the Numico, which is from Page 46 onwards.  So, first message here and this is under the Numico definition slide for that.  There will some slight changes when we report them under our own GAAPs because some of the listing fees are deducted by us on the &#x2013; from the sales, but let's look at on the comparable basis what Numico would have reported if it had been an independent company.</p>
          <p>So, they would have reported a very good and solid 2.8 billion euro of sales, which is plus 11% including the soft landing of the fourth quarter.  So, the first message is let's look at the global performance.  The global performance is still outstanding with the fourth quarter in which the sales were managed in the way I mentioned.  So, first message a very good year.</p>
          <p>Second message, when you look at the different business, a fantastic performance of Medical Nutrition plus 13.4%.  It's double-digit across all geographies, Northern Europe, Southern Europe and the rest of the world, so this is a business which is giving us some additional growth potential in developed countries.</p>
          <p>'</p>
          <p>And Baby Food, almost 10% including the plus four of the fourth quarter and this is where you can reconcile with another I gave you of something like 50 million euro of sales that which we didn't do in the fourth quarter.  You see that the underlying trend of the business is all around 10%.  So, the message for us is a good year for the plan for Numico in almost all its geographies.</p>
          <p>When you look at the lower part of the chart, you see that the we have a pattern in which the matured companies are doing very well. Asia is doing very well, the rest of the world is doing excellent.</p>
          <p>I'll move now to the same type of breakdown between volume and value and this is an area where we find the Baby Food something which has some similarities with our Fresh Dairy type of evolution.  As you can see it, the value component of the Baby Food growth was 5%.  This is the opportunity for me to explain that Numico adds roughly 90 million euro of net inflation of milk prices and this has been offset by price adjustments, which they took.  The result of which are here and this price adjustments which were between 2 or 3% in Europe, possibly around eight or ten emerging countries, have yield the 15 million euros.  So, they are not fully matched as of 2007.  The mismatch between the de-inflation of milk and the prices and we still have a couple of price increase, which they will take &#x2013; which we will take rather at the beginning of 2008.  So, this is for Baby Food.</p>
          <p>As you can see for Medical Nutrition, it's a business which is driven by volumes.  Volumes have been extremely sound and solid and a few increases of prices were necessary to generate this fantastic 13.4% growth.</p>
          <p>I move now to the profitability sales, and the profitability sales is &#x2013; we can see a slight decline in Medical Nutrition.  This has more to do with the mix of geographies, so this is not as for us a major subject of concern.  And of course, the Baby Food decline has a lot to do with what I've said on the &#x2013; and about sales, the 160 basis point for Baby Food or 110 basis points.  It's only 30 million euros, the 30 million euros has to be put against the 50 somewhat million euros of sales that we missed in the fourth quarter although that we decided not to harder.  So, for us, at the end of the day there is no major subject of concern when we look at this performance because once again this has to do with a relatively soft end of the year.</p>
          <p>I'll move now to our numbers and you can skip to Page 50 which is a basically a wrap up of some of the things that have been mentioned and some of the things that I would explain.  So, I move to 51, opening scope.  Opening scope, we will have reached 14.6 billion euros.  This is plus 7.2% including the full year 20% decline, sorry, &#x2013; I'm sorry, I that was on the right slide.  So, this is plus 7% including the full impacts of Wahaha minus 20%.</p>
          <p>Trading operating income will have reached 2 billion euros including the Biscuits as you can understand that easily, would have been plus 12% and the trading operating margin would have been up by 59 basis points.  So, we would have reached had we had not &#x2013; if we had no M&amp;A activities, Franck and the team would have come back and said we have reached 14%.  It's important to understand because when we speak about pro forma 14 point something we start from the base which will be 14%.</p>
          <p>Next slide; if we look at what we book under IFRS, so this is without the sales of Wahaha and without the sales of the Biscuits between only two amounts of very low profitability of Numico and with the cost associated of the financing of the 30% of Numico we reach 9% &#x2013; 9.7% of top line growth.  It's very easy to reconcile the plus 7% and plus 9%, 10% of the business declining by 20% which is Wahaha.  If you exclude Wahaha if you get to the 9%, so fairly easy to reconcile.</p>
          <p>Trading operating income on a comparable basis 13.4%.  We divest Biscuit, which have a good profitability, north of 14%.  So the mix is what you see here and on a comparable basis and I will go back on this one, we improved the margin by 45 basis point.  So, when we look at this two sets of numbers and this is probably something which we can see later on, we are well in the target which we wanted to reach.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the reported sales.  The reported sales including under eye size including scope, including currency, it's plus 6%, as you can see it.  So, this is what you will see in the official published numbers and we had to do that to explain to anyone so that you can do the budgets, 12.8 billion euros which negative 3% of currency, negative 5% of scope of consolidation, the plus 9.7 which we have discussed, mostly Dairy and Beverages and the additional 450 million euros of two months of sales of Numico and this is how you get to these numbers.  This is the chart that I think that Franck has already shown so it is here to demonstrate that if we take Opening Scope or if we take IFRS, we are well within the six to eight and even north of it.</p>
          <p>I'll move now to a glitch on the profitability, so these are IFRS numbers x Biscuits from the beginning of the year.  We have excluded of course scope of consolidation for x.  This is a 45% operational performance and I will explain it in detail, I will get to this number.  And it was close, we have the negative Numico impact of the first &#x2013; the last two months.  I've explained that we have had 450 million euro of sales with a negative, minus 16. So, of course this has to do with the closing options which we took and this is how we get this minus 61, which of course is something absolutely one of the elements.</p>
          <p>So, I move to get directional performance itself, which is what we have had during the year.  So, you see that the input cost inflation was around 200 basis points.  The 260 million euro of inflation on milk, the other commodities didn't move significantly.  260 as Franck has explained is net of around 40 or 50 million euros of productivities on purchasing.  So, 260 is our net increase of commodity cost and against that we have generated 250 million &#x2013; 250 sorry basis point of productivity, two-third of that has to do with the pricing, 150 basis point roughly.  And you find again the match, almost the perfect match which we mentioned to you many times, between the inflation of milk and price increases 250 million euro one side, 250 million euro on the other side.  And the additional productivity has to do with the absorption of fixed cost on the right productivities and other type of productivities, so two-third of that 250 basis point was generated by pricing initiatives.</p>
          <p>If you look at the term division analysis, you see that the like-for-like progression for Fresh Dairy is around 62 basis point and it's flat whenever you correct Beverages for the previous year excluding Wahaha, which had a negative impact.  It's flat in a year when the sales as I mentioned, well in the upper 6% in Beverages.</p>
          <p>Now, when you look per geographies, it's a good sign of the strength of the business model that all geographies have improved at mostly in Diary of course, but most of the business unit in all the geographies have improved their profitability and we end the year with a profitability in which Europe including Eastern Europe has a very sound 50% average profitability, but way you see it both Asia and the rest of the world improving the profitability.</p>
          <p>I will skip the next one, which is just here to give you the glitch.  You see the minus 16 from Numico for the last two months, so you have the food bridge and I will get to these numbers with the conservative and cautious decisions that we took.</p>
          <p>I move to now &#x2013; to Page 16.  So, this is division of our trading operating margin.  I just want to mention that under the line other operating item is 150 million euro provisions, you will find the 80 million euros I mentioned at the beginning for integration, preparation of synergies 80, which are things which we have provided for Numico and the rest is made as of the year as a minor adjustment of values like goodwill adjustments in the magnitude of 30 to 40.  This value gets to this 150.</p>
          <p>I move now to the next page, which is a vision of the full IFRS channel and when you take them line by line I think it's pretty easy to understand what's been happening during the year.  Cost of net debt, of course, I explain we bought for 3 billion euros, 30% of Numico in July.  So, our cost of debt has increased by an amount which is probably 150 million euros, which is why we have this change and the level of our customer debt.</p>
          <p>We move on the income tax levels, which are relatively favorable.  We have a good switch, a positive switch of the profitability of our FES.  Two reasons; last year we booked some depreciation for the HOD business and this year we get in the second half, a small proportion of the profitability of Wahaha, which the equity constitutes the second half.</p>
          <p>Net income from discontinued activities.  This is the category gain on from the Biscuits and the contribution of the Biscuits division itself.  This is how we get to this exceptionally high 4.1 billion euro of net earnings, which we'll speak later on between the current and the non-current.  One word on our tax proof.  So, you see our tax rate is &#x2013; effective tax rate is close to 27%.  This is good news.  This has to do both with reduction of the tax rates in many geographies, as you know the trend is going towards probably 25%.</p>
          <p>So, any time when we generate businesses in countries where the rates are going down, we benefit from that and we have that some aggressive &#x2013; ambitious tax planning, which has given us good results.  So, it's a number, which is important to monitor, and we are in the right direction for effective tax rate and as you can see for the comparison last year, we had some important additional tax assets, which were related to previous losses.  So, we have to exclude them to look at the income tax level, which is pretty consistent with our expectations.</p>
          <p>Now, the full result can be split of course between our underlying net income, in which we look at our EPS and non-current items, the non-current items are pretty easy to understand, one capital gain and around 150 million euros of exceptional provisions that I mentioned both for Numico and for some minor impairments.</p>
          <p>So, this give us an underlying net income of 1.2 billion euros, which we have on Page 64, which on the EPS basis is 2.47.  Some of you were with us in Moscow when we explained that because of the different elements that I have mentioned especially the financing we would be almost flat.  We are slightly positive, so this is pretty consistent with what we thought by that time.</p>
          <p>The Board has decided to propose to the general assembly of shareholders to increase the dividend by 10% to 1.1 euro per share.  This is just a sign of confidence just to show to our shareholders that this year has numbers, which are difficult to read just for the reason that I'm trying to explain at length today, but that underlying trend of business is extremely good and solid.</p>
          <p>Next slide is a bridge for you to reconcile in a way what we would have done without Numico.  This is the bridge somewhere between the opening scope and the IFRS numbers.  So, on the opening scope we would have generated probably 1.3 billion euros of sales and this is the plus 11% EPS that we can post here.  This is opening scope including Biscuits, non-Numico, non-Numico financing and for sure this is north of the 10% in our minds at the time when we spoke at Moscow, so here again something pretty consistent.  And of course the bridge is pretty easy to do, you deduct the net impact of Numico, you deduct the financing net of tax and you get to our 1.2 &#x2013; sorry 1.85 million euros, which is the 2.47 per share.</p>
          <p>I'll move now to another section, which again is a bit difficult to read and sorry for that, but this has to do with the changes of scope.  When you look at the free cash flow from operations including the Biscuits, we have generated 1.2 billion euros, which is significantly less than the 1.5 of the previous year.  And the lower part of the chart is here to explain this change.</p>
          <p>These changes are easy to identify.  First, when and Antoine has explained that when the Wahaha was fully consolidated, it had the significant free cash flow contribution around 130 and we have had the negative impact to show during the first six months, which were impacted especially by the decline of these deposits that we &#x2013; that were recorded before that.  So, this is the switch you can see on the Wahaha line.  The second one has to do with the financial cost which we have incurred because of the acquisition of Numico and the previous year was flat red in a certain way because we booked enough free cash flow some financial proceeds related to a vendors loan we had on previous activities, so plus 101 so minus 100 next year.</p>
          <p>And then of course we have to deduct the free cash flow from Biscuits.  So, the real underlying trend on the comparable scope of free cash flow is rather a progress and once again it's made of other things including spending more in CapEx, which is more than 1.1 billion euros versus something which was less than the 1.1 billion euros.</p>
          <p>The next page is just a bridge to explain how our debt changed.  We had these net proceeds associated &#x2013; sorry, next slide.  We had net proceeds related mostly to the Biscuit sales, some other minor disposals like the HOD business in Europe and against that we had mostly the acquisition of Numico, no other significant acquisitions, some share buyback which we did at the beginning of the year 2007, the dividend.</p>
          <p>And of course to get to the final full debt on the balance sheet, you have to take into consideration the debt, which we found when we acquired Numico.  So, the total change in debt is 8.1 billion euro, which explains on the next page our present level of net financial debt of 8.5.   Franck Riboud mentioned that the beginning of 2007 the group had almost no debt, in fact a little less than 400 million euros.  So, our present debt is 8.5.</p>
          <p>Against this level of debt, it's important to remind everyone that our equity base has been significantly increased because of the big capital gain we have made on the disposal of Biscuits.  So, we have a total equity, which is 9.1 billion euro.  Of course, if you combine these numbers with the profitability, we have a decline in our return of invested capital by this initial it's a year when we have almost have additional contributions of Numico and a big, big, big investment.  So, it's fair to say that our return on capital employed has been probably reduced from 16 to something like 8 or 8 or 9% so this has to do with the fact that we bought this business at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>One point which of course is of attention for everyone at &#x2013; in the presence of consensus our present level of debt and liquidity other, so this 8.4 billion euros of &#x2013; or 8.6, sorry, billion euros of debt is split the following way: most of it has the form of a syndicated loan, which we put in place in the middle of the last quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>We have some existing debt of Numico and we have a smaller proportion, probably 30% percent, which is made of commercial paper or euro medium term notes.  So, these are instruments, which are traded.  But against that, the group has all the necessary backup lines in case these markets would be very shaky which we don't foresee anyway.  So, at the end of today we have a full liquidity provided for our full financing.</p>
          <p>The average financing cost is probably less than 5%.  We'll discuss that when we discuss the pro forma numbers.  And we have taken decisions so as to as to cap any risk of rate expansion north of 5%.  So, we have 80% of this debt which is cap and we have an exposure probably around 60% of this debt with the full exposure to the reduction in rates.  Under the present circumstances, it is true that the banking financing are much cheaper than what we would found, what we would find sorry, if we were to issue bonds.</p>
          <p>The last chart before I give the floor to Emmanuel has to do with the pro forma numbers.  So, as Franck has explained we have two sets of pro forma's, the economical pro forma, which would be excluding Wahaha and probably the better base to assess the business so, it's the last column in which we have 14.5 billion euro of sales and profitability of 14.6%.  So, the combination of the 14% of a &#x2013; that we saw and the combination of the profitability of Numico gave us 14.6%, it's 14.4 if we still keep one half of Wahaha's activities, which is the second column.</p>
          <p>Now, if you want to get to what is our pro forma EPS of course, you need to assess the cost of the debt which we would have had if we had financed the Numico from the first year for the first month of the year.  So we'll take an average rate slightly less than 5%.  You get the financial cost, which will &#x2013; which would give you the net income you see here and probably an underlying EPS of a 2.38 pro forma EPS, which is again very close to the numbers which we gave to you at Moscow when we said it would be probably in this in this 2.7, 2.38.</p>
          <p>So, this is it for the set of numbers of 2007 and I of course give the mic to Emmanuel.</p>

          <p>We'll move to the next one, if it works.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just briefly again and as Franck said at the end of his presentation, 2007 has been a very significant year for the Danone, extremely stretching on the teens to deliver a performance that internally we are extremely satisfied with.  We have grown our business whatever you take the measure of anywhere between 7 and 9% or 10%, depending on which scope you're looking at.</p>
          <p>In terms of margin, it's been anywhere between 45 and 60, which is beyond the guidance that Franck and Antoine had shared with you and managing through the timing of all these situations we end up in a situation where we deliver 11% EPS growth.  I have a clear recollection that the guidance was about 10% growth for EPS on the entry scope in 2007.  And we end up slightly positive in EPS despite the financing cost of Numico and all the rest where I think we have been guiding you guys at the flat EPS in terms of the reported.</p>
          <p>So, if we turn to 2008 now, there is no doubt with everything that has been shared by Franck that we now have a new group, which is very well in the direction of what had been created over the last ten years and will continue to be managed in the same spirit.  One of this spirits is a challenge and we feel confident in terms of sales growth to commit to grow this business going forward so that the next mid term period anywhere between 8 to 10% on a like-for-like basis.  This 8 to 10% for 2008 will apply on the basis of this about 14.5 billion number that has just been displayed as being our pro forma comparable being meaning outside of the Wahaha or leaving Wahaha outside of our global scope of consolidation.</p>
          <p>The next chart is a summary of what we've seen before.  We are committed to grow our trading operating profit faster than our sales growth.  So, we are committed to continue to improve the profitability of the business.  I remind you that we've been growing that business 42 basis point margin improvement every year over the last ten years.  And we continue to be committed to grow the profitability of the business, despite the fact that we already have a step up in margin through all the strategic activities that were taken last year.</p>
          <p>The trading operating margin will therefore improve year after year from where it is today and where it is today just to be very solid on this is the 14.56% that you have seen on the previous chart, which again is a 2007 IFRS pro forma accounts deducted of the impact of the Wahaha six months.  So, 14.56% is our entry point for the new Danone story with Numico.</p>
          <p>This year in 2008, we have said we would grow this margin by 30 basis point minimum, minimum means minimum.  The &#x2013; there was a couple of questions during the pose and I'd like to maybe to clarify these questions immediately.</p>
          <p>The 30 basis points is purely linked to the synergies and the program of synergies that we have identified and we are implementing as we speak for Numico in 2008 of 45 million euros, which translates if you allow sales growth to be 8%, that will be 31 basis points, if you allow sales growth to be 10% next year the high end of our guidance it will be 28 basis points.  We call it 30 basis points.  That's the first thing.</p>
          <p>The second thing is we need to clarify probably the impact of the soft landing of Numico in the Q4 and the impact on our margin.  There are essentially in the charts that have been shared by Antoine, two issues.  One is the step-up in the stock valuation, the inventory valuation in the accounts of Numico.  This step-up will have no impact on the 2008 margin improvement for one single reason, which is that it has been taken in the opening balance sheet of the Numico.  We have already recognized the value through the IFRS methodology.</p>
          <p>The selling value of these finished goods in the Numico balance sheet and therefore, this is a profit that is in the equity.  We will not find in the P&amp;L anymore.  So, there won't be any impact on the fact that in the last &#x2013; the back end of 2007, we have sold on the markets Numico &#x2013; the Numico team had sold in the market products that had been valued in the books at their selling price, and therefore at zero margin.  You should not &#x2013; we cannot expect any improvement of our margin linked to this situation, neither negative obviously.</p>
          <p>The other aspect is the soft landing itself.  We said we have managed the landing of Numico in 2007 in a manner which we feel is appropriate under the Danone management and there was a second impact linked to the fact that the price increase, which traditionally took place in January will take place in February and March actually.  And therefore there is not the same effect of pre-loading that in 2006 had taken place within Numico.  In this situation, you can see basically two things.  We said the total impact of this is roughly 50 million euro sales that we have lost in the accounts of 2007.</p>
          <p>One is a structural part.  We do not intend to change the policy of Danone or Numico within Danone in the way we managed the trade and the inventory level of the trade.  So, this is something that will be structural.  It's one-off loss and that will not incur any improvement in the margin nor the profits for the year 2008.</p>
          <p>The impact on the country of the delay in the trade loading due to the price increase will have an impact.  So, now you can also make very simple math just to make sure we are talking &#x2013; we are on the same page.  We said the total is 50 million euros.  If you assume that we have a 50% margin on valuable costs, which seems a fair amount on the very marginal sales we are talking about 25 million profit.</p>
          <p>On the high-end of things, if you take or assume that we would have or add back into our sales in 2008 the total of the 50 million and 25% therefore of additional operating profit, the impact on our total margin would be about ten basis points.  And I told you we don't think that this will be the case because part of the decision is going to be a structural decision.  So, if you allow only half of that happening and assuming exactly the same assumptions you will find a 5 basis point impact.  So if this is what was the debate of the question, that's the answer.  We will be ready to be accountable for a five basis point additional impact positive in the margin if indeed about half of the total effect was linked to the delay, but you should not expect much more of that linked to this situation in 2008.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we are talking about additional profit, and this will be additional profit, but these are &#x2013; these will be attached to sales and therefore the impact on the margin is minimal as you can see if you take it at the overall group level.  I hope this clarifies and if you have further questions on this we can go back.</p>
          <p>The one additional point I'd like to make is about on margin is about H1 and H2.  Franck told you that it would take some time before we go back to a volume and value equation in our sales, which would be the natural value volume equation.  Given the fact that as you have heard, the impact in 2008 of input price increase will be about the same as in 2007.  We are basically at the trough of the situation right now, as we speak very early 2008.  So, there will be a gradual and probably symmetrical situation to 2007 in 2008 meaning that we will significantly more volume in our growth at the back end of the year and more value in our growth as we speak right now.</p>
          <p>One of the results of these in the margin in terms of the delay between input price and selling prices is that we will have a debalance this year in the margin improvement.  So, you should expect that our margin improvement will be higher in H2 than it will be in H1.</p>
          <p>The final comment is on EPS on this chart and consistent with what we said before based on the 2.38 pro forma EPS number for 2007, our guidance is now to grow at least our EPS number in 2008 by 15%.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you.  Maybe we can take the first question from people outside of Paris. Can you transfer us a question from the conference call?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Highlight for us what the underlying margin would have been excluding the charges and the inventories or at least give us a guidance on what that would have been and also the underlying growth estimates for the fourth quarter.  Would it not have been for the inventory adjustments?  The second question I have is on your M&amp;A position.  As you know, Mead Johnson is currently in the offering.  And would you consider at this stage given your current financing and also equity position to have an interest in Mead Johnson and the further question would then also be would you then also consider equity financing in this particular matter?  And I'll leave it at this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I will take the first question on what Numico would have been.  If you have the presentation in front of you, you can turn to Page 91 in which we've precisely tried to give you a flavor of what it would have been taking the first ten months under Numico and the profits of the last two months.  So you got it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, maybe it's not the same number.  Anyway it's &#x2013; what number did you get?  Anyway I will give you the numbers.  First, you have to understand that in the pro forma sales of Numico you have to divest &#x2013; you have to deduct the business, which we will divest because of the antitrust subject.  You remember we have to divest some businesses in France and Belgium.  So, the pro forma sales would be 2.7 billion euros on which the underlying profitability excluding everything except the slow down in the last quarter will have been 262 million euros at the EBITDA level.  So, you have a full reconciliation of what the EBITDA level would have been for the full year of Numico ten months plus two months.</p>
          <p>Now, your question is of course what would have happened if the sales had been the same magnitude in the fourth quarter.  So, it's very easy, probably the top line will grow in around 10% instead of 5 or 4 and I already mentioned that this would have generated an additional 50 million euro of sales and this would have generated an additional &#x2013; an adjusted 25 million euro of EBIT.  So, when you combine all these numbers, you get to an EBITDA level on a combined basis, very close to 17, 17.5%.</p>
          <p>On the second question about Mead Johnson; Mead Johnson is an obviously an important player in the Dairy Food market.  We simply believe that the conditions on net-net for us to have an interest at this point in Mead Johnson and we understand that there could be actions being taken by the current holder of Mead Johnson, but we have no discussions with them.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Simon Marshall-Lockyer from Bear Stearns.  I'd just like to come back to this whole Wahaha situation with you for a couple of seconds.  It strikes me and we've all been observing over the last year of the whole sequence of events with Wahaha, but in the presentation and the decision presumably recommended by you auditors and legal counselors to deconsolidate Wahaha for the second half despite the fact that you still own 51% of the joint venture, isn't that an implicit &#x2013; effectively a concession of your own weakness in terms of your negotiating position in this matter?  You own 51% of the business and effectively you've conceded that you've lost effective control of that business.  So, the question I have for you, you seem to have made a lot of concessions in terms of negotiation, you, Mr. Faber have to resign from the Board as a concession effectively as you indicated earlier on, there being quite a few concessions that you've made and now you've deconsolidated.  My question to you is, over time given the fact that you are declaring that you've cleared the decks and therefore you're in a position to re-approach the table of negotiations, do you think one day you will be reconsolidating Wahaha at this stage?  It's &#x2013; I have to say it seems increasingly unlikely, and I'd just like to ask you that question.  Do you think it is at all likely that one day you might reconsolidate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said earlier on, we are not going to elaborate much on anything that relates to the Wahaha negotiation given our current agreement with the other party of not making public comment on this.  Whether there is a likelihood that we reconsolidate, I would simply rephrase the question by saying I'm not sure that there is any willingness for us to do so anyway, given what was described earlier about our water strategy in China and in other places in the world and many other constituencies of this joint venture.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I come back to this issue of the margin guidance?  I'm trying to reconcile the 61 basis points impact on the 2007 margin from the soft landing with the five basis point benefit that you're expecting in 2008 and I'm struggling, to be honest.  And the other point is the deconsolidation of Wahaha in the first half of this year, presumably gives you a margin benefit as well, given that it's not making any money or making a very small amount of money.  Is it possible to quantify that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will take the 2008 part, which is about Wahaha.  We have reflected that already in what we have established to be the pro forma at 2008 scope by recognizing if you go back to Page 24, I think of the presentation, you have the margin of the pro forma IFRS 2007, which is 14.36%, and the margin at the scope of 2008, which is 14.56.  This 20 basis points is the uplift in margin, which is brought by the deconsolidation of Wahaha on a full year basis.  So, it's already in the &#x2013; what we have called the pro forma, so that we make sure that starting 2008, we are all talking on the same page in Wahaha is in the equity accounting methodology.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The minus 61 has to do with the fact that you just look at a negative contribution of minus 16 out of 450 million euros and this is what we have in the last quarter.  So, after that you need to take some assumption of the profitability as you would have in the normal quarter, which is probably at the EBITDA level that I mentioned, which is about 17%.  And when we give the full guidance for 2008, of course we take a certain number of assumptions of top-line and full margin for the full year of the business. So, the 61 has just to do with one quarter with a negative contribution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you shouldn't add it back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will complement this maybe just to clarify. This is Page 55. The 61 basis points impact is a negative contribution of 16, 1-6 million euro as Antoine said earlier during the presentation. We're going to there anyway.  If you look at this 60 basis point of this 16 million negative, it's a combination of two things.  33 positive, which is the profit, trailing operating profit of Numico during this period, 33, and a negative of 50, which is the lost sales impact that we have on the uplift of stocks, of inventories.  So the net is a minus 16.</p>
          <p>The point about the soft landing is that the profit instead of 33 should have been higher than this and this is back to the debate that we had earlier, what I discussed about positive impact in 2008 of this anywhere between 5 and 10 basis points. The minus 50 of inventory step up is impacting the number that you see here, which is 13.27% on a full year 2007, but is already restated in the IFRS number that we have looked at of 14.36, which is a number we just discussed before, and therefore you already have restated this.  You don't have it &#x2013; it doesn't impact negatively, the pro forma IFRS number.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Warren Ackerman here at Dresdner. I'm sorry to come back on this whole Numico issue again, but I think there is a lot of confusion still out there. My question on this is I'm slightly surprised that you didn't flag this inventory issue in Moscow.  I appreciate you only owned the business for a week or so, but this must have perhaps come up in your due diligence process. And specifically I mean I know you're saying it's a one-off in Q4 but should we assume therefore in Q1 and Q2 of '08 that the top line growth will be back to the normal double-digits level? Can you give some sort of clarification...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On that? And then the second one is on input costs. The 300 million euros you've given for '08, it think that's an ex-Numico number.  Can you perhaps tell us what Numico might add to the 300 million euros? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I'd take the second first which is probably shorter to answer.  The 300 additional 2008 for Danone has to be increased by something like 90 to reflect Numico's integration. So it's approximately an additional 33%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in the business case of course, this is offset by pricing initiatives, the same magnitude that we had them in 2007.  So we have some carry over from 2007 on 2008, plus some additional pricing initiatives.  And last but not least, as you remember when we discuss that the Numico business is such that they tend to buy spot more quantities than we do and have a better exposure to some changes in the skim milk price.  So we have built a conservative budget with the idea that we would have some price increases to cover that.  The reality might be that at the end of the year, the prices put less pressure on us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you getting any benefit from the recent reductions in the skim milk powder prices?  I think they've reduced from sort of 4000 euros per ton down to sort of 3000 euros per ton.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Starting to give some good  -- I mean, the change is in the right direction, it's too early to give a number for that, but clearly the trend is in the positive direction for sure. Now I move back to and sorry, it probably I didn't make it clear enough on the Numico stuff, on the Numico volume activity in Q4. This has to do with a decision to ship less in the fourth quarter because our vision once we were inside the company was that probably level of inventories with the trade were too high. So, this is a business decision, this is a business decision that you take once you are in the business itself and of course, we couldn't see it from outside and certainly not in the early days of November. So, it's a decision that has been taken and which has been done mostly in December.</p>
          <p>So these were initiatives that were decided with the people who manage and run this business to say probably we have a better &#x2013; cleaner business and better business conditions, in early 2008. If we slowdown so to speak and then bid the shipments to the trade. Now, I've said it &#x2013; sorry, probably I was not clear enough. The underlying trend of the sales of Numico products by our distributors are exactly as they were in the first 10 or 11 months, and they're still very good growing double-digits. So one should certainly not read that as any bad news.  It's a decision by the management of the company to start from a clean base with a lower level of stocks of inventories with the trade. So, here again don't read it another way and it's been &#x2013; and to be quite frank, this is something you do in the last month of the year. This is something you decide at the end of the year and the push you put with your sales force.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Antoine, would it be possible to put some numbers around this?  I mean how many days of inventory were Numico running at in terms of the customers?  And how many days do you think is more appropriate just in terms of getting a feel for the actual quantification of this stock issue?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well to give you -- I gave the magnitude, the magnitude was to reduce these level of inventories by four or five days.  They still have relatively high number of days inventories &#x2013; north of two months in many countries, so you see it's very sensitive if you just reduce it slightly and the magnitude I gave it to you, I don't know if you got the message clear or not but the message was it's probably an impact of 50 million euros.</p>

          <p>Its Emmanuel here.  I'd just like to reaffirm clearly. We &#x2013; the business that we have found within Numico when our teams went in in November is a great business. We have seen absolutely no slowdown, no change in the trend whatsoever since we have taken over the business and manage it with the ongoing Numico team. We believe that the 10 percentage growth of baby food in 2007 is sustainable for 2008.  We believe that Q1 will be a good demonstration of this and I've made already my comment on what the impact of any delayed sales being part of this 50 million that Antoine mentioned would be on both profits and margin improvement, 5 to 10 bips in 2008 so this is for us business as usual.  We've done our job.  We &#x2013; it may be unfortunate that it was only a few days before the year end but that's &#x2013; we're not managing Numico for the few days of year end, we're managing it for the long term and we believe that all of this is embedded in the guidance that I've just given to you.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, two questions if I may.  The first one is on marketing spend.  I think you said at each one stage that marketing was down around 22, 30-basis points?  Just wondering what the full year picture is on that?  And the second one is just on some market share data, which we've seen which shows a marked decline in Numico volumes in the fourth quarter but I realized that short-term reach between consolidated sales and retail sales can be flaky, but nonetheless it just seems a bit surprising though that you've experienced what you have in the fourth quarter and I'm just wondering, has there been perhaps some weakening at the consumer end?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take this one again so I will repeat what I just said.  We have seen no change in the trend at Numico in November and December.  The Numico team that continued to run the business for us under our guidance at the pace of integration and alignment that we expect for the business, and which Franck has described earlier this afternoon. We see absolutely no change in the consumer depletion, nor in the distributor's traction.  We have made a conscious decision of realigning the policy. I would continue to say the same as earlier. As you will see that the Q1 will be fully aligned with what I just said and we believe that the growth rate of Baby Food operation of Numico in 2007 is replicable in 2008. That's for the second part of the question.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>For the full 2007 year. It's fair to say that we have generated some productivity there. So, we have increased which is only 5.5%, something like this, so it's -- the number is increasing.  Is increasing slightly less than the top line.  Frankly when we look precisely across the different business units, they have demonstrated a fantastic growth profile, so there was some optimizations that we could do in different business units and this has not had any impact at all on the top-line expansion, so these were more tactical moves here or there, and of course we have built for 2008 an ambitious plan with a full speed of promotions, but we have to be tactical if the numbers are very good and if it happens that we don't need full support everywhere at all times, we optimize a little bit. So the &#x2013; at the end of day, we've spent 1.1, 51 million euro of A&amp;P, which is again in euro terms at least 60 or 70 million euros more than the previous year. So, in terms of the additional presence it's significant.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />.  A couple of questions. First one is on that slide on the debt you put up,  could you just run through the maturities of various debts that you've got and also the maturity that you have on your interest rate fixes last fall.  And secondly, given that you're probably going to be reporting Nutrition as one complete division as of next year. Can you tell us what Bl&#xE9;dina's sales and operating profit were in 2007?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take maybe the first one.  So the maturities of the syndicated loan we have put in place is almost full year.  On the top of that, in the red part of the chart which we have on page 69 we still have an outstanding 1.5 billion euro of our initial bridge loan which has a maturity till the end of 2008, so we have one full year to get a better maturity on this loan. The Numico commercial paper I think has a &#x2013; and it's debt has an average maturity on the four or five years. And then I mentioned the fact that we have this short-term financial instrument by the commercial paper of euro million term notes.  They usually have maturities around six months to one year then of course we have the backup line for the next three years. So, our liquidity is provided by these additional backup lines, which are here for the next few years. Having said that, it's true that takes the market conditions were to be better. We might see if it's of interest to go in to the market for bonds especially in geographies all with currencies that are very cheap, and might be cheaper during this year. So, this is for the majorities of this financing, and the swap which we have put in place for the next three years, and you will find all details in the &#x2013; of course in the published numbers that we have everything by. We probably have opportunities to go for funding into non-euro currencies. We're on the process of pushing back the debts, the acquisition debts to the different entities inside Numico.  This is a work, which we will do, and we can do some funding in different currencies. Probably get some interesting opportunities there. Can you ask it again?  Sorry, I think we missed it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just on Bl&#xE9;dina, what its sales and profits were in '07?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, sales were up 8 or 9%. I don't have the exact final number of profitability, but it was in the very high teens.  I don't think we have had a significant change from last year, but we can have Bob William give you the final number but very high teens, and again more than that because this is a sign of our capacity to develop the markets in a relatively mature country. A very good 8 or 9% top-line expansion. Take maybe another one from this room?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Arnaud Langlois, JPMorgan. I have three questions. First of the one related to Numico, not really to go back to the fourth quarter issue but looking actually the trend in sales in Asia. I mean, that's where we saw the biggest deceleration. I was wondering whether we should be concerned about Dumex, and is there any potential negative consequences on actually the Dumex franchise related to your dispute in China related to Wahaha. That's the first question. Second question is related to your underlying assumptions I would be interested, what you have in your model to just for the 8 to 10% like-for-like sales growth. In particular I would be interested in what you can say about the Water business, given that post the Wahaha deconsolidation. This may be regarding to say dilutive business growth and in that context one could argue that this business may not be owned to Danone for a very long period of time. So I would be interested in how you regard water these days and what sort of those assumptions here for it.  And last question is on the tax rate on there that Numico do very low tax rate, around 26%. I was wondering to what extend this was reflected in your guidance for this year or at least what sort of tax rate we should be using when modeling Danone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Numico Asia no, I don't think that there has been any particular sign of change in the trend over the last two months of the year, about the Dumex situation no impact in whatever shape or momentum of the Wahaha situation on Dumex In terms of the constituencies of the 8 to 10% guidance for 2008, directionally we see the Dairy business to be in the high single digits, we see Baby Food to be somewhere around 10, as I said earlier. We see Medical Nutrition beyond this and we see Beverage anywhere between middle-to-high single-digit. And there's some &#x2013; we'll make somewhere between 8 and 10%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the tax rate we are cautious people so we do not immediately reflect in our initial projection a possibility of reduction in rates. As you &#x2013; if you read carefully we are around 27 or 27.5 in the pro forma numbers. Our capacity to get a better tax rate has to do with our capacity to push that down to Numico or to developments where you mentioned much lower tax rate of two other geographies. We don't take it for granted before it's done, and especially in the case of the Netherlands where if you read carefully the published numbers of Numico, as you know, they had an agreement with the tax authorities in Netherlands to keep a certain level of profitability there and hence not to put too much debt in the Dutch tax space. So to make it short, we have not taken additional productivities in our initial budget. Having said that, there are probably options here and lot more from mid-term objective and we do, we usually communicate to the market once we are absolutely confident that the new tax optimization or a new push-down on debt, is really feasible. So at this stage we have not put additional prospects positively</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In this magnitude, yes.  Close to this number.  One question from the room.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="inaudible" /> The first question again with guidance on the margin, just to be clear to understand, the 30 basis points were given just to show that you were able to grow margin whatever non-recurring percentage impacts will benefit to you?  Another way to say that, any way your margin is likely to grow despite from despite raw materials and so on, and that's why it's really for that that you've given the 30 basis points. And so could you be maybe a bit more specific in saying that at constant <mark type="inaudible" /> or without positive restructuring of these kind of things you will be able to grow your margin in '08 as signs to the continuing improvement on profitability. And my second point will be maybe on more long term. What would be your vision of them and ability to grow its EPS due to the very high level of debts to carry?  I think that some investors maybe concerned about the vision you have about these investments.  So it's good to have margin provision on long-term planned growth, but it's also good to have some long-term EPS trends. Everyone can do its own math, but my personal math showed me that you can grow your EPS on the sustainable trend close to 15%.  Is this I'm seeing, that is it is rational?  Or completely irrational? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And so I will clarify on the margin, <mark type="inaudible" /> The mid-term guidance of the group will also apply into '08 which is we are committed to grow our margin. The margin will grow year after year on a comparable scope basis whatever happens that's our business model.  It has been the business model for the last 10 years. We will simply now apply it to a business that grows faster and there is a 100% Health Food business. The reason I mentioned the 30 basis point in 2008 is to recognize the fact that in 2008 we will have 45 million euros coming from the synergies with Numico, and we do not intend to reinvest this into the business model because we did not need that to grow our business, and therefore we will put that into the margin expansion. So to clarify, there is a definite commitment to grow the margin year after year and that starts, that has started 10 years ago.  It will continue to starting January '08 till the end of '08 and way beyond if you remember what I said about the margin expansion. So there will be a margin expansion on a business what will grow faster. And into '08 specifically we will have this 30 basis point.  And we said minimum.  If you come back to the slide, we said minimum because we are committed to grow the margin year-after-year and year-on-year. And I'm ready to have a further conversation about the 5 to 10 basis points linked to the Q4 of Numico if you want.</p>
          <p>On EPS longer term we've always resisted the temptation, I should say, of giving long term guidance for EPS. If you tell me whether our model is irrational that says you can grow close to 15%. No we &#x2013; I think we can live with the model like this one. It's quite clear for a business that grows 8 to 10% and has a profitability leverage year-after-year, but we should be delivering superior EPS growth. One word that you had about debt I think is important. I concur, we have finished the first 10 years of the new Danone story. We've zeroed it after having fully self-financed 9 billion euros of acquisitions. This year we've chosen in one year to swap this kits against Numico. That creates 3 billion additional equity on the net capital gain and that creates 8 billion additional debt. We have the same commitment in terms of repaying that debt down. We believe that the cash flow model of Danone is a solid cash flow model. We actually see opportunities but I will not quantify them now but we seek opportunities to reduce our debt both operationally and non- operationally, and we're committed to do this. Overall this will over time indeed create a further positive leverage on the EPS number. And I would like to add also on the return on invested capital, we mentioned earlier in the presentation that we have grown return on invested capital by 100 basis point every year over the last 10 years. Quite obviously when we make an acquisition of the size of Numico, our ROIC will be significantly reduced to around 9% from 16 where it was. Our commitment to grow ROIC year after year and that what we increase again the gap between our cost of capital and the return on investment for our investors is the same. This commitment is the same and year after year we will increase again the ROIC of the group with an equation which will apply the same management, tools, business processes, the culture, the organization, the incentives systems that Franck has described that has paid over the last 10 years to create this business where it is today and to continue to do the same with now Numico instead of our Biscuits operations as part of the portfolio.</p>
