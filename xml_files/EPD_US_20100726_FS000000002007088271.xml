        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Chelsea. Good morning, and welcome to the Enterprise Products Partners and Duncan Energy Partners joint conference call to discuss second quarter earnings. Our speakers today will be Randy Fowler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the General Partner of Enterprise and President and CEO of the General Partner of Duncan Energy Partners; and Jim Teague, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer.</p>
          <p>The Enterprise portion of the call will begin with a few comments from Randy filling in for Mike Creel who is out of the office, but listening in on the call, followed by Jim to discuss commercial operations and then Randy will wrap up with a financial discussion. Randy will then make a few comments about the quarterly performance of Duncan Energy Partners before we open the call up for any questions. Also in attendance today are other members of our senior management team.</p>
          <p>During this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21-E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 based on the beliefs of the company, as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management of both Enterprise and Duncan. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, they can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.</p>
          <p>Please refer to our latest filings with the SEC for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made during this call.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Randy Fowler.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Randy. Good morning. We are pleased to report solid results again this quarter, supported by increased gross operating margin from our NGL segment, Petrochemical &amp; Refined Products segment and Offshore segment.</p>
          <p>Our NGL business continues to post solid results, benefiting this quarter from record equity NGL production, strong natural gas processing margins, higher NGL transportation and fee-based gas processing volumes.</p>
          <p>The improved results from the Petrochemical business were primarily a result of increased demand for polymer grade propylene, which led to higher volumes and improved margins. We also had record onshore natural gas transportation volumes and higher offshore crude oil transportation volumes.</p>
          <p>This performance resulted in an 18% year-over-year increase in gross operating margin, after adjusting second quarter 2009 results for the $68 million charge for exiting the TOPS joint venture.</p>
          <p>Based on continued strong performance, we announced the 24th consecutive increase in our quarterly distribution rate this month, increasing it to $0.575 per unit, or $2.30 on an annualized basis. This is a 5.5% increase over the distribution declared with respect to the second quarter 2009.</p>
          <p>Enterprise generated 532 million of distributable cash flow, which provided 1.3 times coverage of the distribution to the limited partners for last quarter. One of our important financial goals is also to retain a portion of our distributable cash flow to re-invest in the growth of the partnership. This quarter we retained $100 million, or 19% of the total distributable cash flow and for the first six months of this year, we've retained $256 million.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss some segment highlights. The largest increase in gross operating margin was from our NGL Pipelines &amp; Services business, which reported gross operating margin of $441 million this quarter, up 21% from the second quarter 2009.</p>
          <p>Fundamentals continue to be strong for this segment, which benefited from higher equity NGL production and gas processing margins, primarily from our Rocky Mountain processing plants, increased transportation volumes on most of our pipelines and higher tariffs on Dixie and the Tri-State's pipeline.</p>
          <p>Our NGL Marketing business had higher sales margins, as petrochemical demand for NGL feedstocks remained strong. Exports of NGLs, primarily propane, averaged 93,000 barrels per day this quarter compared to 35,000 barrels per day in the second quarter of last year, as pricing differentials remained favorable between the United States and other regions of the world.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin for the Onshore Natural Gas Pipeline &amp; Services segment decreased $14 million from the second quarter 2009, primarily due to our natural gas marketing business, which had a non-cash mark-to-market loss swing of approximately $17 million the second quarter of this year compared to the second quarter of last year, from a $5 million gain last year to approximately a $12 million loss this year associated with financial transactions for hedging our natural gas transport hook. Substantially, all of these losses are expected to be reversed in future periods when physical delivery of the gas is made.</p>
          <p>In addition, this segment was negatively impacted by the delay in the Trinity River lateral by approximately $9 million for the quarter. The Trinity River lateral is expected to be in service later this week.</p>
          <p>While historically Enterprise did not benefit from the natural gas price spreads across Texas, in the first half of last year through our marketing company, we did benefit. And approximately 5 to $6 million of the decrease in gross operating margin from the second quarter of 2009 to the second quarter of this year was due to lower spreads across Texas.</p>
          <p>Collectively, gross operating margin this quarter increased by $19 million from our Texas Intrastate natural gas pipeline, the Stateline and Fairplay natural gas gathering systems, which we acquired effective May 1 of 2010 and the partnership's natural gas gathering and treating facilities in the Piceance Basin in Colorado.</p>
          <p>Included in gross operating margin for the Texas Intrastate System this quarter is capacity reservation fees of approximately $15 million, principally from the Sherman Extension pipeline, which went into commercial service in August of last year.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin from our Onshore Crude Oil Pipeline &amp; Services segment was $26 million for the quarter, compared to 42 million for the second quarter 2009, primarily due to lower sales margins from our crude oil marketing activities due to a very competitive trading environment, increased transportations costs and a weaker contango market this quarter.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin for the Offshore Pipeline &amp; Services segment was $83 million this quarter compared to a $1 million loss recorded in the second quarter of last year. Gross operating margin for the second quarter of 2010 includes $10 million of proceeds from insurance claims associated with hurricanes in prior years and $4 million of revenues from a tariff rate case settlement on our High Island Offshore natural gas pipeline system.</p>
          <p>The second quarter of 2009 includes charges of approximately $68 million associated with the termination of TOPS.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin from Enterprise's Offshore Crude Oil business increased to $26 million for the second quarter of 2010, compared to 14 million for the second quarter of 2009, excluding the charges associated with Texas Offshore Oil Port. Substantially all the partnership's offshore crude oil pipelines reported increases in gross operating margin and volumes.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin from our Independence facilities decreased by $12 million. Natural gas volumes decreased to 635 billion Btus per day this quarter from 891 billion Btus per day in the second quarter of last year, due to depletion and one large well watering out.</p>
          <p>Well workovers have been generally delayed due to uncertainty from the federal drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico. We expect volumes on the Independence System to average between 500 and 600 billion Btus per day for the remainder of this year until well workovers are completed and new wells are drilled.</p>
          <p>The Petrochemical &amp; Refined Product Services segment reported record gross operating margin of $158 million, a 65% increase from $96 million reported in the second quarter 2009. Our propylene fractionation business was responsible for most of this improvement, benefiting from higher sales margins and higher propylene fractionation volumes, reflecting increased demand for polymer grade propylene.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim to discuss the commercial business in a little more detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Randy. I'd like to start with a little bit of a market review or update. The relationship between crude oil and natural gas prices continued to remain low, with natural gas prices drifting between 30 and 40% of crude on a Btu basis.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, the average natural gas futures price closed at 33% of the corresponding crude contract, down from 37% in the first quarter this year and 38% second quarter 2009. Low gas prices relative to crude creates economic incentive for natural gas producers to pursue liquid-rich natural gas plays, such as the Eagleford Shale in South Texas.</p>
          <p>NGL supplies from natural gas are plentiful in developing shale plays, but require infrastructure to capitalize on opportunities to recover those liquids, process them and deliver to market. The industry has already addressed many of those issues associated with developing these shale plays, but as the market develops, additional challenges will present themselves and we're well positioned to continue to bring solutions to that market.</p>
          <p>We've seen a structural change in the petrochemical industry, as we've talked about over the last year. Light feedstocks, primarily ethane and propane, continue to be preferred by ethylene crackers over their heavier crude oil feedstocks. Approximately 82% of feedstocks consumed by U.S. crackers this quarter were NGLs versus traditional naphtha or gas oil. We are benefiting from this, because what we are today, we created some five years ago.</p>
          <p>You remember five years ago, we built over 2 Bcf a day of cryo-processing capacity in Wyoming and Colorado. We expanded the mid-America pipeline Rocky Mountain system and built the Hobbs fractionator, all of which are feeding our integrated value chain with over 100,000 barrels a day of natural gas liquids. We are reaping the benefit of this change in the petrochemical industry because of those investments.</p>
          <p>Planned outages tightened olefin supply this quarter, while demand for ethylene and propylene remained steady, resulting in higher ethylene and propylene prices and higher margins for all feedstocks. Average cracker margins of $0.195 a pound this quarter were highest on record according to CMAI data, except for the fourth quarter of 2005 as a result of Katrina and Rita.</p>
          <p>This compares to cracker margins of $0.03 a pound for the second quarter of last year. An additional Enterprise benefit comes from a position that was created many years ago, but expanded some five years ago. When crackers consume light-end feedstocks, they produce less propylene.  We've benefited from this, as our propylene plants are running at capacity and recording record margins.</p>
          <p>Ethylene producers with available capacity ran hard to capture those margins, as U.S. ethylene supplies remained tight and ethylene prices increased. Even as ethylene prices eased in late June, as maintenance outages were completed, the ethylene market remained tight. Just a couple of weeks ago, a cracker on the Texas Gulf Coast tripped, and spot prices instantly jumped $0.045 to $0.05 a pound, demonstrating just how tight that marketplace is.</p>
          <p>Last quarter on this call, I talked about a U.S. vinyls producer that had recently announced an expansion that can consume an incremental 975 million pounds of ethylene derivatives intended for international markets. Now we're seeing more evidence from other chemical producers that domestic chemical production remains competitive.</p>
          <p>Eastman Chemical said last month that it will restart its cracker in Longview sometime during the first quarter of 2011. This unit, which has the capacity to consume 10,000 barrels a day of ethane and propane feedstocks, has been down since November of 2008.</p>
          <p>We just noticed over the weekend that Amerada Hess and NOVA announced an ethane pipeline project from the Williston Basin to NOVA's crackers in Alberta. They announced that they would transport initially 40,000 barrels a day from their Tioga Gas Plant with a capability to increase to 60,000 barrels a day. You have to ask yourself, what does this say about what we've always called the Alberta advantage? And those plants have to import ethane from the U.S.</p>
          <p>Further, there have been several announcements of U.S. midstream companies working to export in ethane to NOVA's Sarnia cracker site, and we continue to see traditional naphtha crackers on the Gulf Coast continue to seek ways to use more ethane in place of naphtha. So to those naysayers that think that ethane supply will swamp demand, our response is that while prices create supply, price also creates demand.</p>
          <p>U.S. ethylene operating rates were approximately 88% of nameplate capacity again this quarter, producing an average of 50 billion pounds a year of ethylene, which is in line with the average of the last five years. Industry consultants estimate that U.S. crackers are currently operating at 91% of capacity. That would equate to a 53 billion pound a year run rate.</p>
          <p>In spite of the strong demand for light-end feedstocks, we believe that an incremental 6.6 million barrels of ethane was not consumed due to the active cracker turnaround season and unplanned outages during the second quarter.</p>
          <p>As a result, ethane inventories grew, but now with major cracker turnarounds completed and given the tight ethylene market and strong margins for ethane and EP cracking, we expect ethane inventories to draw down for the balance of 2010. I fully expect to hear a question as to why ethane prices have come down. Hopefully this answers that question.</p>
          <p>We think olefins demand will remain strong and demand for NGL feedstocks will continue to grow. Solid margins for light feedstock cracking will keep U.S. olefins producers highly competitive across the globe and keep downstream derivative arbitrage windows open to other regions.</p>
          <p>We continue to see high industry inventories in the refined product sector, although U.S. refiners are seeing margins that enable them to continue running hard. The EIA said they topped at 91% operating rates last week. With refinery operations strong, our pipeline assets continue to see solid throughput, including our crude oil storage facilities in Cushing.</p>
          <p>As Randy mentioned earlier, our NGL business performed well this quarter, posting a 21% increase in gross operating margins. Our assets in the Rockies continue to perform well, benefiting from increased gas volumes into our gathering pipelines and processing plants.</p>
          <p>Natural gas production in the west has again been resilient, with quarter-over-quarter growth in volumes on our Wyoming and Colorado assets. This is significant, as historically we've experienced declines in the late first and early second quarters of each year as winter conditions lead to reduced drilling activity. We have not seen this downturn this year, as producers continue to improve drilling and completing efficiencies, especially through the winter and spring.</p>
          <p>Our cryo gas processing plants are currently operating at over 90% capacity. Our assets and the agreement we have structured in both Wyoming and Colorado allow us flexibility in determining the quantity of gas that flows into our cryos.</p>
          <p>If they are full, we can either send the gas into our adjacent dew point facilities or off-load through agreements we have with third party facilities. We're not obligated to expand our asset base if we're running near capacity until we are comfortable with the long-term market conditions and supply assurance for any new plants or other facilities.</p>
          <p>Our Rockies processing margins continue to be strong, with approximately 78% of keep hold production for the remainder of 2010 hedged at a gross spread of around $0.56 per gallon. Our NGL business also benefited from increased transportation volumes on most of our NGL pipelines and increased transport fees from higher tariffs on the Dixie and Tri-States pipelines. On July 1 each year, tariff rates on Dixie are adjusted based on the producer price index and on Tri-States, the tariff was increased on January 1.</p>
          <p>Our fractionators at Mont Belvieu and Hobbs consistently run at or near full capacity, as NGL receipts from the Rockies, Mid-Continent and Barnett production areas continue to be strong.</p>
          <p>Construction of our new 75,000 barrel per day NGL fractionator at Mont Belvieu is progressing on schedule to go into service early in the fourth quarter of this year and we expect it to be full on day one. As a matter of fact, we recently announced plans to build another 75,000 &#x2013; that was late fourth quarter of this year. Bill Ordemann almost had a heart attack.</p>
          <p>As a matter of fact, we recently announced plans to build another 75,000 barrel-per-day fractionator at Belvieu that will be needed to accommodate additional volumes, including incremental volumes from expected production out of the Eagleford. Strong fundamentals continue to drive NGL marketing results this quarter ,which benefited from higher NGL throughput and margins, primarily from propane exports, isomerization demand and regional basis differentials.</p>
          <p>Propane exports were so strong this quarter that our terminal on the ship channel was completely sold out and it is sold out for July and August, with the majority of the cargos headed to Latin America. This export facility has been sold out since July of last year, with loading fees almost three times what we've realized prior to July 2009.</p>
          <p>Our Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines &amp; Services segment had record gas transportation volumes this quarter, primarily from the gathering systems in the Rockies, South Texas and our two new systems in the Haynesville that we acquired from M2 Midstream in May of 2010.</p>
          <p>The addition of the State Line and Fairplay systems is expected to enhance our opportunities for future development and expansions in the Haynesville. We recently completed a 300 million cubic foot a day expansion of the State Line system, which increased its capacity to 700 million cubic foot a day, and we're aggressively pursuing new shipper agreements for those systems. Currently, the State Line system is flowing just under 500 million a day and Fairplay has been steady at 175.</p>
          <p>Our Haynesville extension pipeline is on schedule to be completed in the third quarter of 2011. Currently, we have locked in our steel cost, nearly completed all of the survey and permitting work and acquired approximately a third of the right-of-way. We expect most of the capital spending for this project to begin in the fourth quarter this year and in 2011.</p>
          <p>Our schedule calls for us to begin laying pipe next January. We have recently announced a new ship commitment for an additional 200 million cubic foot a day of capacity on the Haynesville pipeline, which continues to gain support. We're on track to quickly have this pipeline fully subscribed.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Eagleford, there are 77 rigs now drilling in this play. Actually, I heard last night 93, which is a significant increase from the 10 rigs that were working at the beginning of the second quarter last year and we expect this trend to continue as producers are successful in drilling more wells. Total Eagleford production feeding our system today is in the neighborhood of 200 million cubic foot a day. By comparison, this was relatively nonexistent at this time last year.</p>
          <p>Last month, we announced several new projects that will extend and expand our natural gas and NGL infrastructure in the Eagleford and at Mont Belvieu to accommodate growing production volumes from that region. As part of this initiative, we plan to install 350 miles of pipe, build a new cryo plant and a new 75,000 barrel-a-day fractionator.</p>
          <p>We've completed several key projects, including the initial 34 mile segment of the east-west rich gas main line and final leg of the 62 mile White Kitchen Lateral. We continue to build our footprint in this region that will allow us to provide greater flexibility to meet the needs of our producers.</p>
          <p>I said earlier that what we are today was created years ago. What we will be in the future depends on what we do today. Our M2 acquisition, our Haynesville extension pipeline, our Eagleford initiatives, are examples of what we're doing today to position for the future.</p>
          <p>We know what we want to look like in five years. These projects are just a few of the components of our vision. Believe me, there are others.</p>
          <p>In crude oil, drilling is active in Texas and Oklahoma, which should lead to increased volumes into our onshore crude oil systems. We completed a new project in West Texas and we expect to complete another project in the third quarter that will result in additional volumes.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we announced the construction of 140 mile crude oil pipeline in South Texas to facilitate expected incremental crude oil production from the Eagleford. We've signed a letter of intent with a major Eagleford Shale producer that will provide a long-term transportation commitment to anchor this project.</p>
          <p>We're in discussions with other producers in the Eagleford to provide oil transportation and marketing services through additional connections to the pipeline. When completed, Enterprise's system will provide access to the refining markets in the Houston area, as well as the major storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma.</p>
          <p>Before I give the call back to Randy, I would like to spend just a moment to praise our propylene business, which reported strong results again this quarter, more than double what was reported in the second quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Propylene prices this quarter were twice as high as those in the second quarter of 2009 as a result of lower cracker source propylene production and improved product demand. This business continues to do well, reporting an 18% increase in propylene fractionation volumes.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll breathlessly turn the call back over to Randy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jim. I'll briefly discuss some items below the operating income line, liquidity and capitalization.</p>
          <p>G&amp;A expense for the second quarter 2010 decreased by $8.2 million, primarily due to $11 million of TEPPCO merger-related expenses that were incurred in the second quarter of last year. In terms of capital spending, we invested approximately $1.6 billion in growth capital expenditures in the second quarter, which includes approximately $1.2 million for the acquisition from M2 Midstream.</p>
          <p>Through the first six months of this year, we've spent $2 billion and expect to spend approximately $1 billion during the remainder of the year. Some of the larger approved capital projects for 2010 include the Haynesville extension pipeline, projects in the Eagleford, the Mont Belvieu NGL fractionators that'll be, as Jim said, completed later in the fourth quarter and then Trinity River Basin Lateral, which again, we expect that to be completed later this week, then finally the Anaconda pipeline extension.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter we spent $73 million in sustaining capital expenditures and $105 million through the first six months of this year. We still believe we will spend in the range of 225 to $250 million for maintenance CapEx this year.</p>
          <p>Turning to capitalization. Adjusted EBITDA for the 12 months ended June 30, 2010, was approximately $3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA, we define that as EBITDA less equity earnings, plus actual cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates. Our consolidated leverage ratio of debt to adjusted EBITDA for the last 12 months was 4.0 times at June 30, 2010, after adjusting debt for 50% equity treatment of the hybrid securities. Netting out the $495 million of unrestricted cash that was on our balance sheet at June 30, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.8 times.</p>
          <p>Our floating rate interest exposure was approximately 10% at the end of the quarter. The average life of our debt was 10 years, which incorporates the first call date for the hybrids, and our effective average cost of debt was 6%. At the end of June, we had liquidity of about $2.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to take just a couple of minutes to turn to Duncan Energy Partners before we open the call up for questions. This quarter, we reported improved results with each of our business segments, recording higher gross operating margin than last year.</p>
          <p>Distributable cash flow for the second quarter increased to $32.8 million and enabled us to increase the quarterly cash distribution rate for the seventh consecutive quarter, exceeding what was paid to our partners in the second quarter of 2009 by 3.4%, while providing 1.3 times coverage of the quarterly distribution to our limited partners. We retained about $7 million of distributable cash flow this quarter, after giving effect to the declaration of the distribution, and thus far this year we've retained $13 million that we'll keep to re-invest in the growth of the partnership.</p>
          <p>Now briefly turning to our business performance. Gross operating margin was up 25% this quarter compared to the second quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Starting with our Natural Gas Pipeline business, we reported a 23% increase in gross operating margin, due primarily to the Sherman Extension Pipeline that began commercial service in August of 2009. After adjusting for operational measurement gains and losses associated with our NGL storage complex which are allocated to Enterprise Products, our NGL's Pipeline &amp; Services business segment reported a 10% increase in gross operating margin, primarily attributable to higher storage fees and volumes at our Mont Belvieu facility.</p>
          <p>Last quarter, we mentioned one of our growth projects was a conversion of two NGL storage caverns to refine product service at our Mont Belvieu facility. We expect to have the first cavern, which will store up to 2 million barrels of refined products, in service by the end of November of this year. We are currently leaching the second cavern, which should be completed sometime next year.</p>
          <p>DEP had growth capital expenditures of $221 million in the second quarter of 2010, including approximately $119 million spent on the Haynesville Extension Pipeline Project. The total expected cost of the 270 mile Haynesville Extension Pipeline Project is approximately $1.56 billion, including capitalized interest, of which Duncan Energy Partner's 66% share is a little over $1 billion. Construction on the Haynesville Extension Pipeline is progressing on schedule and is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>At June 30, 2010, DEP's debt to last 12 months' EBITDA ratio per &#x2013; as calculated per its bank credit facility, was 3.1 times. Under this facility, DEP's maximum allowed debt to EBITDA is five times. However, there is a calculation in there to allow for a pro forma calculation of EBITDA associated with a growth project in calculating that ratio, growth projects such as the Haynesville Extension.</p>
          <p>Sustaining capital expenditures were $17.9 million this quarter compared to 12.7 million spent in the second quarter of 2009. We're on track to spend approximately $55 million this year with 29 million spent in the first half of the year. We had total liquidity of approximately $260 million at June 30, 2010, which includes cash and availability under the partnership's revolving credit facilities.</p>
          <p>In closing, we were pleased with the continued strong performance of our businesses this quarter and are encouraged by the prospects of our existing assets.</p>
          <p>With that, Randy, we are ready to turn the call over for questions.</p>

          <p>Hey, Jim, now that you've caught your breath, a couple questions for you on the NGL business along the theme of price creating demand for NGLs. We're looking at an industry that continues to add more processing and fractionation infrastructure to keep pace with productivity through the drill bit. So can you give us some insight into the incremental ethylene demand? I mean, we're seeing crackers operating north of 90%, as you said. Is there more capacity that can be utilized, or have we reached a level of full effective utilization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Darren, you think I'm a prophet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I hope so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what we see is, there's more capacity that can consume ethane and propane, not withstanding whether or not there's more ethylene required. If you remember in my comments, around 80, 82% of ethylene, I think, Don, was produced from NGL. That says 20% is still coming from naphtha and gas oil, and that's 10 billion pounds a year of equivalent. That's about 300,000 barrels a day and feedstock are in that neighborhood.</p>
          <p>The other thing that's interesting, that I've seen, is I was impressed with this announcement that Hess came out with that they're going to export ethane from the Williston Basin to Alberta. Quite frankly, I hadn't thought of that. And then I think you've seen a number of other announcements of people trying to export ethane into Sarnia's, I don't know the Sarnia site. It really boils down &#x2013; from our perspective when we say price creates demand, I think that's a pretty good indicator when you're exporting ethane and converting naphtha crackers. I don't know if I answered your question, Darren, but it's the best I could do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no, I appreciate it, Jim. I think what we're trying to do here is kind of piece together all the different aspects of a lot of this unconventional production. When you look at what's happening out of the Eagleford and the Granite Wash, over the intermediate term, it sounds like you think domestic petro can demand an export potential to international markets is going to be enough to keep the market balanced with the pace of ethane supply growth. And I don't think there's any question, from our standpoint, whether or not ethane's going to be the dominant feedstock and yield ethylene producers the highest margin. The question that we have is, at what price per gallon is ethane going to be and more importantly, at what frac spread are you guys going to realize on your unhedged equity NGL volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what it boils down to &#x2013; I don't &#x2013; there's no way of knowing. The reality is, when you have gas selling at this relationship to crude oil, that is an incentive, not only for petrochemicals to convert, but frankly we've had meetings with petrochemical companies recently who are talking about de-bottlenecks and expansions. We were with one last week that was talking about an incremental 500 million pounds of production.</p>
          <p>That's another 15,000 barrels a day of ethane. I was with a second one three or four weeks ago that said it's not out of the question that we will expand. I think what you're beginning to see in the petrochemical industry is much more comfort that this is something that they can take advantage of through, if nothing else, expansions of existing facilities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll go back and tell you, I remember in 1980 when this market had 35 billion pounds a year of ethylene production, and the word was you'll never see another cracker built. We're pushing 60 billion pounds now and we hear the same thing. I'm not going to say you'll never see one built.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Last question for me, Jim. On the propylene side, given the cost advantage of cracking ethane expected to continue and the tightness across that market, how close are you to an inflection point on price, where customers want to commit to term contracts? And then secondly, when you sustain max ethane cracking for three or four months, the co-products tend to go out of balance, so can you just give us some insight as to how 3Q looks on the propylene side of the business?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Steve Maresca. How are you guys doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Good morning, Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks a lot for all the detail. Really appreciate it, Jim and every one. My question is, you mentioned, Jim, that you have I think you said, 200 million cubic feet a day feeding into your Eagleford systems and, two parts. One is, you said current production. I read recently there's about 250 million from producers in the area. What are you hearing for expectations of where that goes to? And then, how soon do you think you get up to filling your 1.5 Bcf a day of capacity at the processing facilities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know when we expect to have our plants down there full before we need?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The 1.5 of existing capacity, we're getting real close to filling that up today. Our efforts really are on the expanded capacity for additional volume commitments, but that 1.5 is virtually full today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then are you hearing, just broader speaking, from producers, what is expected out of the area now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Depends on what production profile you look at honestly, Stephen, but they've all been fairly robust in their projections. So it could come on fairly soon and some of them are very aggressive with their projections.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Depends on the price of natural gas, doesn't it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Switching over to the Acadian system, the Haynesville extension.  I guess you signed on another 200 million cubic feet a day and what's the outlook going forward in connection with other commitments for that? And is there any impact that the State Line expansion is going to have on that system?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're going to be full when it's operating. Right, Chris?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean we're working with producers right now to enhance, when we get coordinated with State Line, it's expansion up to 700 million a day obviously has to all go into third parties, right? So right now, but when we get into service the third quarter of '11, we believe we will be, at the fullest, subscribed to 1.8 Bcf and then just set in compression to get us up to the 2.1 level &#x2013; 2.1 Bcf a day level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then my last question. You mentioned in your comments, or in the release, that you had NGL production in South Texas was down a little bit. Is there any color as to why and outlook for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what you're seeing is the little bit of decline still in the traditional, or the legacy, production in those areas where the producers are focusing more of their activities around the richer gas production in crude oil plays, like you're seeing in the Eagleford.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We also took our chute fractionator down in the second quarter and that reduced our throughput pretty good during that two week period. We took it down to expand it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. Thanks a lot, guys.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you comment on the activities around your Fairplay and State Line systems, with gas prices still pretty weak and service costs going up? Have you seen slow down from producers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this point in time, we haven't seen much slowdown. Obviously, the rig counts have been holding its own. The production, it's more of a function of getting the gas out of there right now, still building the infrastructure to get to the main lines. I think when some of our competitors pipelines get on midyear next year and we get on in the third quarter next year, you're going to see another 1 to 2 Bcf jump out of the basin.</p>
          <p>With regard to State Line and Fairplay, our Fairplay system, which is the traditional East Texas side, we've been holding steady there, not seeing a whole lot of drilling, although we're starting to see some Haynesville drill wells activity pick up a little bit over on that side. But if this pricing level out, talking with several of the key producers in the region over the last two weeks, you got a couple of them that have preferred acreage position that didn't pay up for the high dollar leases and they're continuing to drill. Other ones are kind of focusing back on just drilling the whole production by &#x2013; just trying to hold their acreage position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Gotcha. And on Independence Hub, you guys mentioned that you expect the rest of the year to average between 500, 600 million per day and in the past month and a half, you've been averaging below 500. What kind of activity you expect to see to bring that up to 500 to 600?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Mark Hurley will take that question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we expect the volumes over the remainder of the year to be in the 500 to 600 million range. We've seen volumes slip below 500 million on a very short term basis, just due to some operating problems, but those have been corrected and the platform is now ramping back up.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hey, guys. In terms of the next fractionation capacity, the next 75,000 barrels, how much of that are you thinking about potentially contracting out? We've heard people talk about doing frac-or-pay type contracts. And then, how much of that, when you're looking at the Eagleford volumes ramping up, is that fractionator expected to take Eagleford volumes, or is it just generally you're seeing overall liquid volumes being higher? Or just talk about the expansion a little bit more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The fractionator will be full the day it comes up with existing contracts. Right now, we're moving an awful lot of our raw &#x2013; light grade to our Louisiana plants. So that fractionator will be full of &#x2013; with existing contracts. We just won't send as much to Louisiana. That spare capacity in Louisiana will be what we use to bridge Eagleford.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Gotcha. Okay. And then you said you were hedged on 2010. I missed the number, but I think it was a high number. Have you done any hedging for 2011 on your key pool?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really. Not yet. It's funny. It's not nearly as liquid forward as it was last year, when we were able to put on a lot of hedges, but we've managed to get about 78% of the raw balance of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then if I could just follow-up on the Independence. Just how are you thinking about, again, the volumes going forward in 2011 and then even just bigger picture, future investments in the deepwater as we're looking at things post the oil spill?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll speak to future investments. We are spending, what is it? 104 Gs we're extending the Anaconda pipeline system into, is it Nautilu, which will feed our Neptune gas processing plant. So we're making a pretty sizeable investment, as we speak, on tying the Anaconda system into what we like to call our value chain, into our own plant. The Independence...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Independence and overall volumes in the Gulf of Mexico, generally speaking, there's a natural decline that occurs on the Gulf, somewhere between 5 and 10% per year. And you can only counter that with a robust drilling program and redevelopment program, and so until the moratorium gets lifted and regulations become clear, we expect to see that natural decline occur. Specific fields and specific wells sometimes do fly out. We had one of those occur on Independence when one of the wells watered out during the second quarter. And so those specific situations can lead to step changes in volume, but we think our number of 500 to 600 million is generally good into next year, but a lot depends on what happens with drilling programs.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>With Conway and Rockies ethane prices during the second quarter, I guess, compared to Mont Belvieu being relatively weak, can you guys just describe how Enterprise's Rockies processing plants have continued to perform so well? I mean is that something that's due predominately to hedging? Or is it your connectivity to Mount Belvieu market through your Mid-American Pipeline? Is it something that you expect to continue, even if ethane prices in Mid-Continent continue to stay weak?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our Rocky Mountains production goes to Mont Belvieu. As far as weak prices in Conway, we've been fairly successful in arbitraging that by &#x2013; just behind the Conway selling Belvieu using our pipeline system, using that to top off our pipeline system, but Conway doesn't affect our Rockies production. It goes to Belvieu.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So can you actually backhaul out of the Conway market onto Mid-American? And is there capacity there?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then also, we've heard a lot of expansions on fractionation processing and transport on the NGL side. Any indication on the NGL storage, like your fees and length of contract there? Do you see producers or even petrochemical companies more interested in NGL storage in and around Mont Belvieu?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our contracts on our storage has been &#x2013; our fees were up dramatically. I think we spoke to that last quarter. Our fees are up dramatically in our storage business and people are much more interested. This whole contango thing we went through last year, I think, made storage much more valuable. It's not just a hole in the ground that gives us an advantage. It's the brine system we have. We have one heck of a lot of deliverability. So what attracts people to our storage is our ability to deliver to their plants.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that an area that you &#x2013; I remember thinking about potentially switching some over to natural gas storage, but at this point, is it something that you might be able to expand NGL storage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What you'll see &#x2013; we did look at natural gas. We didn't do anything with that. We are expanding it into refined products. I think we're adding two &#x2013; we're converting two wells to be refined products.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're also continuing to develop an NGL well and we're putting a new brine pond in to increase our deliverability as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's Bill Ordemann, and he's right. You're right, we are adding another brine pond. So we're increasing our capability to provide NGL services. We're adding one well and we're converting to the refined products.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Ross Payne with Wells Fargo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Nice quarter, guys. First question is, is State Line, the M2 acquisition, is that going according to plan? I know you only had a couple months, but just want to know how that's progressing, generally speaking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Ross. Thus far, we're happy. 60 days into it, we're doing just as we had planned. We were probably a week late on getting one of our compressor stations up and running, but other than that, everything's been growing as planned. And like I say, we're up to almost 500 million a day of flow on the system, so we're very pleased.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, Chris, also, is Haynesville basically spoken for at this point, for current capacity? And how spoken for it is, with additional compression?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't...</p>

          <p>He wants to know, are you fully subscribed today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Are we fully subscribed in our existing Haynesville takeaway? No, we've got a little bit of room left and then we've got the 300 million day expansion that we can do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just by setting compression to get us from the 1.8 to 2.1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can you throw a number out that is committed on the 1.8?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We talked about on the call, we're north of 1.5 on a firm subscription.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. Very good. And also, Teague, if you could just talk, generally speaking, about what you're seeing for natural gas rigs in the Rockies and just general production in the area. I know you guys are doing quite well, but just have things stabilized somewhat from what you're seeing out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They have stabilized. Our throughputs continue to grow, frankly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, relatively flat to a little bit of an increase in the drilling activity, but I think a lot of what you see are the increases in efficiencies of the drilling rigs up there. Fewer rigs producing more wells, et cetera. They've become much more efficient in their activities in the Rockies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. That's it for me.</p>

          <p>Question on DEP. Just wondering if you have a growth CapEx number for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sharon, I thought we had that for &#x2013; I thought we laid that out in the first quarter call. Tell you what I may need to do is get &#x2013; if I could refer you to Randy after the call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sharon, I'll call you back offline on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The bulk of it will be DEP's share of the Haynesville, plus its share of one of these NGL caverns that we're converting to refined product service, but Randy can get that number for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I guess, is there any bending associated with some of the Haynesville projects that touch on DEP's assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sharon, I'm sorry, could you repeat that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For some of the Eagleford projects that were outlined touch on DEP's assets, I was wondering if there's any opportunities for DEP to participate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Eagleford assets principally are in the, if you would, the DEP II assets. So the extent to which that DEP could benefit from that is, once Enterprise earns its preferred return on investment, just like DEP earns its preferred return on investment, then there's a sharing ratio of which 98% goes to EPD, 2% goes to DEP. And then frankly, that's with DEP not funding any of the capital investment in those Eagleford projects. That's the way that's set up in the agreement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So right now, there's no plan for DEP to invest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, because, Sharon, frankly DEP, between the Haynesville extension and these NGL caverns, I think from a capital standpoint, DEP's got a lot of good opportunities just in those two projects and frankly, has its hands full on the capital &#x2013; contributing to capital for those two.</p>
