            <mark type="Inaudible" /> Welcome to Statoil's Third Quarter 2009 Earnings Presentation.  It takes place from our offices in Oslo. My name is Lars S&#xF8;rensen, and I'm the Head of Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>This morning at 8 a.m. Central European Time the third quarter earnings report was published through wires and through the Oslo Stock Exchange.  The report can be downloaded from our website statoil.com together with the presentation that will be used in this presentation call.</p>

          <p>As you know safety is paramount to us and with that I'm just going to take 30 seconds of your time to instruct the audience here in Oslo about safety.  We want to and the representatives in the back of the room and I will go on the left downstairs and out threw the garden where you came in.  Or you can use the right-hand side door and go down the stairs and to the reception, the main reception and the meeting point is close to the main room, the A18 for those who are resident in Oslo.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars.  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us at this Statoil third quarter earnings presentation.  Since our last presentation in August the global economy has been picking up additional speed.  And this is mainly been lead by an emerging economies and I would say also enhanced by positive market sentiments.</p>
          <p>However as we see it the fundamentals of the global economy and related to corporate investments to impairment and to private consumption has not been up to positive with their robust trend and we think this calls for a continued cautiousness.  We're still fundamental imbalances in the global economy driven by unsustainable public borrowing and spending and the stimulus packages that we have been implemented by governments across the world. They are seemingly working but at one point they will have to be retracted.  Further, monetary policies also seem to be more or less exhausted as an instrument in this situation.</p>
          <p>The fundamentals for our industry, for the oil and gas industry have not changed materially as we see it, at this quarter.  Industrial demand from the western world has remained weak.  Oil prices have rebounced based on expectations that the physical demand eventually will pick up, but so far we have seen only small signs, actually of that happening.  The current situation in the world economy implies also weak demand for refined products.  And as a consequence we have made an impairment this quarter related to our refinery at Mongstad on the west coast of Norway.</p>
          <p>The gas spot market has also this quarter been influenced by the rather weak industrial demand and the supply overhang.  This comes in addition to the normal seasonal of state pattern.  However we believe that the fundamental realities, energy realities of the world are the same as before the downturn and we have not changed our long term fundamental view on an outlook for oil and gas.  Global energy demand will continue to grow in the longer term and that includes oil and gas and its supply side that's struggled to keep up.</p>
          <p>The third quarter is another quarter for us with strong deliveries both when it comes production, cost reductions and cash flows.  Production outside Norway this quarter exceeded 500,000 barrels per day which represents approximately 27% of our total equity production.</p>
          <p>Our exploration activity is still high and also with a continued high success rate.  We've completed 58 wells so far this year with 33 discoveries and a number of wells that's also still pending under evaluation.  In this context I should also mention that we now also have two Statoil-operated ultra-deep water rigs on location in Gulf of Mexico.</p>
          <p>So let me now take a look at the financial results for the quarter.  This illustration gives an overview of our key components, or sole components this quarter compared with the third quarter, at the bottom here, last year.  And as you will see our reported net income is NOK 6.6 billion, against 6.3 billion last year, same quarter last year and that is an increase of 6%.  The reported net operating income is 28.3 billion, against 47 billion in the previous quarter, or in the same quarter last year, and that is a decline of 40%.</p>
          <p>The underlying or adjusted as we call it, earnings from operations were NOK 31.2 billion, while adjusted earnings after tax stands at NOK 9.3 billion, again which is down approximately 41%.  The main reason for this decline is of course 31% reduction in liquids prices in Norwegian kroner and a 32% reduction in gas prices also in Norwegian kroner, compared to the same quarter last year.  This decrease is to some extent countered by higher production volumes.  Equity production is up 8% since the same quarter last year, and entitlement production is up 10% quarter-to-quarter.</p>
          <p>Gas trading and arbitrage has again contributed positively to the result this quarter.  Our unit production costs have been reduced around 5% on a quarter-to-quarter basis.  And our SG&amp;A cost saving program of 1.5 billion that we have presented earlier for 2009 is now fully implemented.  The reported tax rate this quarter is 79%, while the underlying tax rate is around 70%, which is in line with what we have guided you on.  I will come back to both the tax rate and the financials later in my presentation, but let me now say a few words about the adjusted earnings.</p>
          <p>This quarter net operating income is adjusted with NOK 2.9 billion from the reported 28.3 to the adjusted NOK 31.2 billion.  The most important adjustment factors are the total impairments of NOK 5.3 billion.  As seen in previous quarters we are into the, what I call the impairment elevator when it comes to assets in Gulf of Mexico, in our Gulf of Mexico portfolio.  Assets that are increasing in value are kept in the account at maximum acquisition costs plus additional CapEx that we have spent, while assets decreasing below the full value will have to be impaired.</p>
          <p>The impairments in Gulf of Mexico this quarter is at NOK 1.8 billion and that derives only from assets within the Spinnaker portfolio where reservoir characteristics from more than one asset has been poorer than earlier anticipated.  However the largest part of the 5.3 billion impairment is &#x2013; comes from our Mongstad refinery as I already mentioned.  This reflects our more pessimistic outlook for refinery margins at least medium term, which also led to the impairment of the Kalundborg refinery in Denmark in the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>As we mentioned at that point, in August, the value of the Mongstad refinery was also reduced for the same reason.  The stronger Norwegian kroner versus U.S. dollar, or the opposite, have deteriorated the value of Mongstad even further and that has triggered an impairment as mentioned. Changes in fair value of derivatives on the list position amounts to negative total adjustments of 2.4 billion and that leads to a net overall adjustment on the earnings from operations of 2.9 billion as I mentioned.</p>
          <p>Let's then take a closer look at the production and our volumes for this quarter.  Total equity productions of oil and gas was 1,874,000 barrels per day this quarter and that's up 8% as I mentioned.  The growth in equity production was driven by a 5% increase on the Norwegian portfolio in total and a 17% increase on the portfolio outside of the Norwegian continental shelf.</p>
          <p>Entitlement production was up 10% to 1,712,000 barrels per day and this implies production sharing effects, PSA effects of 163,000 barrels per day this quarter and 139,000 year-to-date.  And this PSA effect this quarter is slightly higher than we have guided and that is mainly due to one-off adjustments or a one-off adjustment this quarter as we also had in the previous quarter in the opposite direction.  Our guiding for the PSA effect is however unchanged at around 140,000 barrels per day at an average oil price of USD 50 per barrel and we have had 53.5 so far this year.  And the sensitivities to higher and lower oil prices is as we have guided before.</p>
          <p>The total liquids production was affected by maintenance activities of around 50,000 barrels per day during the quarter.  The third quarter was also the last quarter of the gas year 2008.  Total off-take for this gas year 2008 has been more or less in line with what we have seen in previous years and close to the off-take commitment.</p>
          <p>Now with three quarters behind us, we maintain our production guidance of 1,950,000 barrels per day for the full year, although there is still some uncertainty related to gas markets regarding off-take and value optimization.  We will continue to be value driven in our Gas business, in all our business, but definitely on the Gas business, and that means that our full production capacity might not be utilized at all times.  Our flexible gas production capacity related to Troll and Oseberg is the main tools for us in this context.  Production in 2010 might also be affected by uncertainties related to gas demand and also as earlier communicated from the fact that new projects are planned to start up rather late in the year.  The production guiding for 2010 will be communicated at the strategy update on the 11th of February next year.</p>
          <p>And now to the adjusted earnings overview.  Our operational performance has been good also in the third quarter.  Maintenance activities have been according to plan and we have had very few incidents which have impacted production in a negative way.  E&amp;P Norway reached adjusted earnings of NOK 25.3 billion in the quarter and that is 42% lower than last year and the main drivers is 33% reduction in liquids prices in Norwegian kroner and 37% reduction in the trans-gas transfer price towards our Natural Gas business segment.  Oil and gas production is up 5% while the unit production cost has decreased accordingly.</p>
          <p>International E&amp;P had an adjusted earnings of NOK 2.8 billion this quarter, which is down 30% compared to last year and the main driver is obviously the lower liquids price of 22% in Norwegian kroner.  Equity production increased by 17% to 515,000 barrels per day while total entitlement volumes increased by 37% from last year.  Depreciation charges increased within this segment by NOK 2 billion and that is due to increased production mainly, combined also with relatively small initial reserve volumes that have been booked from these new fields and also a 14% stronger Norwegian kroner versus U.S. dollar on a quarter-to-quarter basis.</p>
          <p>Operating costs within International E&amp;P are increasing somewhat, mainly due to currency impact and increased production.  Natural Gas increased their adjusted earnings from 2.2 billion to 3.3 billion this quarter.  Processing and transport was at NOK 1.7 billion, which is at approximately the same level as we saw last year.  Marketing and trading increased their earnings from 0.7 billion last year to 1.6 billion this quarter, mainly from stronger trading results.  Now this demonstrates that we are able and we are in a good position to earn margins from moving volumes both in time and geography also in the current environment.  Manufacturing and marketing delivered adjusted earnings of NOK 0.1 billion compared to 2.7 billion last year.  The Oil and products' trading results have been weaker this quarter mainly because of a more flat forward curve but also from some specific market positions of use that created some losses.</p>
          <p>In addition the third quarter result was positively influenced last year by a currency gain of approximately NOK 1.7 billion which would not be there anymore because we now are running this business in our accounts at the U.S. dollar functional currency.  We didn't do that last year.</p>
          <p>Energy &amp; retail are again showing good progress in the tough environment with a contribution of approximately 500 million to the corporate this quarter.</p>
          <p>The manufacturing business continued to show a negative trend with weakening refinery margins and also methanol prices.  And this is reflected in a loss of NOK 4.4 billion this quarter.  And as already mentioned the continued negative outlook on the balance between refinery margins and demand also led to the impairment of the Mongstad refinery as already mentioned. So all in all this &#x2013; our adjusted earnings added up to 31.2 billion this quarter with a corresponding tax cost of 21.8 which is equivalent to a tax rate of 70%.  And that takes me to the next illustration to reconcile the tax cost and also discuss the financial items.</p>
          <p>Our reported net operating income had a tax rate of around 72% this quarter.  This can be explained from the starting point of 70% as I mentioned on the adjusted earnings and 54% on the adjustment, the net adjustment that we have made.  And the low tax rate on the adjustments is explained by the tax rate and tax position mainly related to the impairments.</p>
          <p>Now to the net financial items and the related tax costs we had earlier on our website presented this quarter's difference between net financial items according to IFRS and the net financial items used for calculation of tax. The net financial items for tax purposes this quarter is NOK10.9 billion higher than the reported net financial items under IFRS. In other words, we have NOK10.9 billion taxable currency gain mainly from our long term debt in U.S. dollar this quarter which is not recognized, not reported as a gain under IFRS. That's where the corresponding tax cost that you can see of 2.9 is recognized and is reported.</p>
          <p>We have calculated 49% tax rate on the reported net income as you can see from foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives of the aggregate NOK3.5 billion. And that means that the typical financial items that you can see at the bottom here, such as interest income at paying interest costs and gain and loss on financial assets tax rate of approximately 32%, which is more or less a typical tax rate for these kind of cost components. You can also see that when excluding the accounting volatility from the net financials, we are left with a result, which is very close to zero that you can see at the bottom here. All-in-all this explains the rather high tax rate at first glance of 79% of the reported income before tax this quarter.  I should also mention that the split of the financial items and the corresponding tax on financials, as you see here, is now also reported and will be reported regularly in our MD&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Then I would like to talk a little bit about our cash generation, as it have been during the three first quarter of this year-to-date is quite strong. This illustration shows you the cash flows from operations before tax during the first nine months and how this cash flow generation compares with our tax payments and also the CapEx program spending cash to the CapEx program.  We have indicated earlier cash neutrality before dividend at around $55 U.S. per barrel for this year, and as the average price has been 53.5 so far, we are in fact slightly on the positive side so far of this guidance.</p>
          <p>Net debt to capital employed was at 27% this quarter, which is also in line with the guidance that we have given you. We have raised around NOK$7 billion, of new debt so far this year to withstand the downturn and the volatility that we have seen in the commodity markets to maintain a high CapEx and expiration program, and at the same time be able to pay dividends in accordance with our policy.</p>
          <p>So let me round up my presentation by taking a quick look at the guidance for 2009. Production guidance is unchanged at 1.950 thousand barrels per day. The annual CapEx guidance of 30.5 billion, excluding acquisitions and capital leases to be precise, is also maintained.  The <mark type="inaudible" /> activity for 2009 has been in line with our guidance so far. The exploration activities in the fourth quarter will bring us up to around 70 wells for the full year and we expect to stay at approximately $2.7 billion in total spending for the full year, also as guided.</p>
          <p>The unit production costs are at NOK35.3 per barrel on a 12-month basis and this is consistent with our guidance of staying within the range of 33 to 36 and we also indicated that we would stay at the upper part of this range for 2009, so it's as guided. Guidance for 2010 and beyond will be further addressed at our strategy update on February 11.</p>
          <p>And this concludes my presentation and I'll then leave the word to Lars to take us through the Q&amp;A session.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Eldar. I should just say to the webcast audience we have some problems with the sound in the beginning, it should be solved now. If there are some who haven't got sound still, try to refresh your screen and it should be okay.</p>
          <p>Well I'll start the Q&amp;A session and if you are on the webcast you can ask questions, as I said in the beginning, by using the submit question at the bottom and I will get it on my screen here and ask the questions for you. <mark type="inaudible" /> please wait for the microphone and then say your name and state your questions. All right let's take the first question from a <mark type="inaudible" /> over there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hollis with Capital Markets. A question regarding cost reductions over the last nine months and as a year-on-year comparison how much have you reduced your costs savings in dollar terms? Including and excluding forex effects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at this on a quarter-to-quarter basis I don't recall the year-to-date numbers on a quarter-to-quarter basis because this is also related to seasonal activities. On a quarter-to-quarter basis the cost on &#x2013; operating cost is reduced by approximately NOK800 million, that's 6% reduction, and then I've not sort of adjusted for any currency effects on that. So and that goes in many parts of the business and it's not all related to the upstream part of the business because that also goes into the downstream part of the business.  If you look at the downstream business our operating costs within the Norwegian Continental Shelf,  if you look at the cash operating costs they are approximately at the same level as they were, nominal level as they were one year ago. And in addition we have increased the production by 5%. So it's down on a unit basis down 5%. On the international the operating cost is slightly up, for the reasons that I explained. On SG&amp;A if you, last year we have changed some accounting policies related to how we consolidate our capital insurance company. If you adjust for that we are approximately down NOK400 million from a basis of 3 billion, so that's more than 10% down on a comparable basis compared to last year.  So all-in-all this is just to tell you that we have implemented and we see affects from the targets and the efforts that we are doing on the Norwegian Continental Shelf.  It is a challenge to tight, sort of, immature province, to put it that way. More water production and you need to work really work for the wells. And maintenance activity we are fighting that, and we actually have a very comprehensive process now on the Norwegian Continent Shelf to keep the costs down, and we have managed to do that so far. And we are also on track with our SG&amp;A cost savings program that I talked about of at least 1.5 billion annually for this year.  And then you have an additional ambition of 1 to 1.5 billion that we will take into next year's business planning activities.  But we are on track.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  On my part of the state here I have been joined by the Head of Corporate Accounting, Mr. Kaare Thomson, who will join in the session in answering the questions.  Let me just take one question from the Internet before I leave the microphone to Ton Undon, and that is from Handelsbanken from Anne Gj&#xF8;en.  It's about debt, and she talks about if the net debt now is 72 billion Norwegian kroner, what is the financial flexibility and risk of change in a credit rating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we just had a new updated report from both Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, and they maintained the credit rating based on all the available information that we gave them.  So their view is that we discovered the rating that they have had for some time now.  Our debt ratio is approximately the same level as it was in the previous quarter, although we have actually capitalized the lease in between here, so it's actually down.  But in accounting terms it's at the same level.  And I think that is &#x2013; gives us robustness and we also obviously look into other factors like cash flows and so on, and they also tells us that we should be able to at least maintain the single-A rating in the environment that we see ahead of us, and we still feel there is uncertainty related to the macro and the commodity environment going forward.  So we are taking that all the time into account and into the way we plan our business.  And that does not mean that we are not looking only one way of running of the business but we are looking at both upsides approaches and downside approaches to protect us if things become worse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll just finalize it with a question from Anne and then I come back to Tom down here in Oslo.  There's so far this year significant deviation between reported and adjusted EPS with reported EPS as low as 3.5 Norwegian kroner after nine months.  Is it unlikely that you'll pay a special dividend for 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will not comment special dividends or anything like that.  All I can do in this context is to repeat what we have said.  The dividend policy says 45 to 50% of IFRS after it is reported.  The dividend policy also says that we can deviate from this starting point if there are good reasons to do that, referring to cash flows and so on.  We have also said that we will take into consideration mathematical adjustments but we will take into considerations that there is the kind of accounting volatility in our numbers that is you're referring to and which explains the EPS.  We will take that into consideration.  And the dividend policy says also that we have an ambition to grow ordinary dividend year-on-year.  That's what I can give you of guidance.  Boring, but that's what I can give you in guidance.  So we will take those kind of accounting volatility as I mentioned also into due consideration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bellis Tom Undon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of questions on project.  In Azerbaijan I see that the gas is still not back at the pre gas take level and Shah Deniz is lower.  But can you comment on the Shah Deniz gas level?  Is that more related to weak gas market? Or not comment on that?  And can you say anything about that ACG that plateau level?  Will that be back to one million very soon?  And with the other is on Marcellus, can you say anything?  How many rigs are currently producing and do you see any ramp-up of production over the next six to nine months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  When it comes to ACG I think the operator has been doing a very good job on dealing with the gas leakage to shut-down and gradually building up.  So I think we will probably, we still don't have the full understanding of what is going on down there but it has been dealt with in a good way.  Whether we will get back to one million barrels per day on this field I don't feel confident about that with the given uncertainty that I have just talked about.  But there are plans to also pursue further, pursue further, sort of the developments on the Sherdock part of this project for instance.</p>
          <p>On Shah Deniz I will not comment.  I cannot comment on the arrangement of gas marketing that is going on but for reasons on that I will be surprised if it was sort of related to gas market conditions, but I cannot comment on that.  On Marcellus we have currently 18 rigs, I think, 18, 20 rigs.  I think it's in that range that is operating, and the plan is to increase the number of rigs to around 40 rigs by 2012.  Current production at Marcellus is around 3,000 barrels per day I think, and it will gradually increase as we continue to drill the wells.  So, yes, it will definitely increase.  That's the basic idea behind the deal that we've made and our positioning of this market and the more sort of still our guidance is 50,000 barrels per day by 2012 as we had indicated earlier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that following, are you scaling back would be the operational plans because of the weak gas market?  Or are you progressing more or less according to plans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are progressing as expected.  This is still a very early days, its' a very low volumes so our view is that we should build capacity, build experience, learn our lessons from operating these in this environment and also these types of reservoirs.  And our firm conviction is that also the gas market in the U.S. eventually will pick up and that we should be in a position then handle volumes to benefit from that position.  So we don't see the current sort of environment as an indicator that we should reduce <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I'll take a couple of questions from the Internet.  There's a lot here on the gas market and on gas and such.  So we can just continue with on that basically.  Lucy Haskins from Barclays Capital asks, given the robustness of gas volumes this quarter, why are you nervous about the gas demand impact on next year's volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, its' in a way we have two different types of gas businesses the long-term contracts, which is regulated through contractual arrangements and take or pay commitments. And then its &#x2013; but there is a lot of flexibility on those contracts during the year as such and that also was why I commented on the fourth quarter this year, how was that flexibility going to be run by the customers.  So there is definitely questions in that respect.  When it comes to the more flexible part of our business, which is the short-term, the volumes that you sell stop, obviously we are in a position where we have the flexibility to move volumes. We have seen very weak markets.  We don't see that situation change significantly in the short term.  We expect actually a continued situational weak market. For how long, we don't know, but definitely into 2010, and at least a lot of uncertainty around those assumptions.</p>
          <p>So with sort of a weak market and based &#x2013; if we were to see market going into the future that looks stronger, more attractive for us, we would like to use the ability to move volumes to the extent we feel comfortable with out in time and move it out of sort of the period where the market is mostly depressed.  So that's why I indicated that it will have sort of volume impacts on the way we run our business, which is a value driven way of running our business.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was partly answer to the first question from Oswald Clint, also from Bernstein. But the second question he has, is, what are your plans for Troll gas production, which seems to be a five year, at a five year low, upward level in the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the Troll gas production is a wonderful tool for us and it's in a way what we use to regulate sort of our production and also create confidence that we actually can deliver to our long-term customers on their volumes.  But it also gives us flexibility in terms of the spot gas markets and that's basically what we are. There's no &#x2013; I meant here is no &#x2013; the field is as it has been and it's going to be there for many, many years. So it's basically a way of operating other fields and it's basically the same answer as to the previous question.  It depends on the market outlook and the way we look at the markets and how we will operate the gas any further.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that basically also answers the question from James Hubbard, here about gas volumes, whether we will continue the Troll volumes on Luva ramps up 34:10)?  Well basically Luva will produce and then we'll use Troll and also our best gas producers going forward.</p>
          <p>There's a question from Iain Reid at Macquarie.  Can you comment on how sustainable you think your gas volume growth is in Europe?  It has been 15% year on year in the third quarter and when we look at it going into the fourth quarter of the year, you've partly answered some of it but.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah well, it's just the 15% what we should remember is that there has been &#x2013; there is actually an underlying growth in our gas business from last year to this year.  All along we have been ramping up and so on.  So there is an underlying growth in the business as such.  And then you have the seasonal and the take OPEC commitment, which also has impacted the third quarter of Texas as such.</p>
          <p>And that has given the 15% combined, the 15% on a quarter-to-quarter basis.  The way the commitments have been dealt with by our customers and the underlying growing gas business.</p>
          <p>Going forward, I think I've touched upon it, in the fourth quarter the main uncertainty is related to how our long-term customers will utilize the flexibility that they actually have, and it's quite a big flexibility on a daily basis, and then the next level is the annual basis.  So there's a lot of flexibility.  But how they will utilize that flexibility, and also how we will respond to the market environment and the way we look at the gas market going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because, Iain, actually continues here the off take volume from gas product apparently have gone down, or deliveries from gas product have gone down so far and our volumes have gone up. So whether we have expectations to that turning in the fourth quarter, and I guess you partly...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  What I can say is that the underlying gas business has grown definitely from '08 to '09, but that will not be the same growth from '09 and beyond on the underlying gas business.  That comment on how the Russian gas volumes might impact our business, I'm not prepared to do that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Then there's a question from Mark Bloomfield at Citigroup.  It's about depreciation in the international E&amp;P.  So we're leaving gas for a moment, but I've got more gas questions later.  Could you offer some guidance on the outlook for the depreciation charge in the international E&amp;P segment for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I cannot give any specific outlooks for 2010, but the sort of &#x2013; I mean it's quite obvious that the direction of DD&amp;A, is going to reflect the tac due know that the cost has increased quite significantly throughout the industry for quite a few years now, and as those fields who have been sort of hurt by this growing cost is gradually coming into the portfolio, that will change the cost profile in terms of depreciations on the overall average portfolio.</p>
          <p>So for instance the Agbami fields, the Tahiti fields has typically a higher cost per barrel and implicitly also DD&amp;A per barrel than the old fields, the stat fields, the <mark type="inaudible" /> company and a share of the first developments in Angola and so on. So that's &#x2013; you will see that sort of gradually coming in and into the DD&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>He asked whether he could use the third quarter depreciation charge as a guideline?  And I guess guideline is good but we can't say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No I cannot.  I can just give you sort of an overall trend type of guidance here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question also from Mark Bloomfield.  Could you provide some more color on the prospects that will be drilled with your operated rigs of the government over the forthcoming six months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you know we have two rigs now.  The first one is the merch developers drilling at the Tacho Well, which is statted operated well these days and it will take quite &#x2013; this is &#x2013; this is long, deep, complex well, so, and it takes time.  So over the next six months I guess they will not do very much more than that.  And also when it comes to Discover America the next rig, other rig that is now preparing drilling activities at the Krakatoe acreage.  And so that will be the first sort of drilling target for that rig. And beyond that we still have time to firm-up and have flexibility in terms of priorities as it's a few months ahead until they are moving into other new locations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Another question from Argus Media, from Roderick Bruce.  It's about PSA, so production sharing agreements in the international business segment.  Your international production has been impacted by PSA effects.  You are still &#x2013; why are you still so high on PSAs when the oil price has fallen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Then I just have to repeat the 163,000 barrels per day that we saw this quarter is not reflecting down the line.  It was an adjustment related to assets. It's difficult calculations to make and to be precise on, so it was an adjustment.  Actually an adjustment which was related to the adjustment that we made in the second quarter, which was the other way.  So on average, forget all of that, what you could look at is what has been our number for year to date, which is 139,000 barrels per day and that is more a guidance going forward also for this year at least for, at the oil price of $50 U.S. Then we have given a guidance set an oil price of 75 and that increases from 140 on an annualized basis to 165,000 barrels per day on an annualized basis. So that's also some of the sensitivity you can also take and it's the same as we have given you before and also apply going forward. That's the best judgment and guidance that we can give you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question from Lucy Haskins at Barclays Capital about volumes from the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Would your drilling program this year give you more or less confidence that you can maintain the NCS volumes out of the &#x2013; end of the next decade?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the drilling program that we have made has been extremely successful. We have had in terms of discoveries, we have had a discovery rate of approximately 80% so far in the Norwegian Continental Shelf and since the merger around 70%. So we have drilled and made a lot of discoveries and we believe almost all of this actually can be developed. So what is happening now and we have also had programmed for the rest of this year in the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Next year the activities will be slightly lower. Then we will have to see what happens for 2011. It's a combination of both infrastructure led exploration and more sort of growth exploration and more frontier exploration, but the main focus is on the two first categories.</p>
          <p>I think what happens is that we have made a lot of discoveries, no big elephants. Most of this is tied &#x2013; can be tied back to existing infrastructure with high value, very high value. Some of this can justify separate new developments, and we are proceeding now this quarter for instance with the new gas development at the Luva area where there are four discoveries including the Luva in the deeper parts, water parts of the Norwegian Sea. So we will proceed with that. No decision, no investment decisions made, but we are proceeding with that meaning that we actually believe it can be a new standalone gas development with new infrastructure actually.</p>
          <p>The challenge that we have on the Norwegian Continental Shelf together with our suppliers is really to deal with a new type of situation where we do not have the high volume of large standalone projects that have to be addressed and developed in such a way. It's a much more smaller development with high value that we have to look at and develop in a different way with a different approach from what we have been doing. More standardized approach, industrialized approach and also different type of work processes internally in our organization. So it's a whole new set of challenges. We have to find new ways of addressing this and I'm confident that we will and if we succeed on that I think we have actually a very strong resource base, sufficient resource base. Remember that we have at least 20 years of current production level in our resource base on the Norwegian Continental Shelf and that that is sufficient to maintain the level going forward. But it doesn't come by itself. We have to sort of crack the code and find new ways of addressing these new type of challenges.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We're heading back for the Gulf of Mexico, there's a question from Oswald Clint at Bernstein. Should we expect further farm-downs within the Gulf of Mexico acreage positions? And is there strong appetite for acreage and could you update us on development plans for some of your discoveries in the region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. When it comes to farm-downs, this is the nature of the business in Gulf of Mexico basically. That you go through lease rounds, you get 100% of a lease and you want to go forward but you don't, might not want to take it 100% forward. So you basically want to share the risk and also add competence from strong partners and good partners. This is a very typical way of &#x2013; and this is also the way &#x2013; what we have used to get into the Gulf of Mexico to farm into other companies' leases. And now we are in the same situation, we are in more mature situations, so we are basically now farming-down from the assets that we would like to see slightly lower exposure on. So that's what we have been doing here. So we had a deal with the Ecopetrol, one deal with CNOOC now and that's, I think that will continue. It's part of natural way of doing business in Gulf of Mexico.</p>
          <p>Whether we have appetite for more, well we will always we are big guys now in Gulf of Mexico and we will always look at opportunities, good opportunities to leverage, to enhance the position that we have and the competence and organization that we have in the Gulf of Mexico and the technology that we gradually also are developing. So yes, we will look for further opportunities but now we have at least sort of a strong, very strong starting point from, going forward.</p>
          <p>When it comes to status on projects, I think we are now drilling. We have a lot of drilling activities, started operated drilling activities going forward. With Tahiti is producing more or less at full capacity now, performing very well. We have had the issues that I mentioned on the Spinnaker portfolio. When it comes to Seesatrona that was approved earlier this year so that's proceeding as planned. And then there is other projects that we are maturing going forward but they are not sort of &#x2013; and they are getting closer to a point of decision-making, but they are not there yet. But they are being matured all the projects that we are involved with in the Palogee, Jack, St. Malo, Tucker, Julia, and so on is progressing as planned and Big Foot and so on is also progressing as planned. So that's my general comment to the other assets.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have another question from, or last question from Mark Bloomfield [Citigroup] here also about the Gulf of Mexico. Could you update us on whether you've got plans to participate in any exploration wells in the DeSoto Canyon region in the Gulf of Mexico during 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have now, I think 50 leases through the farming and additional 14 leases I think from the lease route. So we have a quite substantial position in this area now and we think it's quite exciting actually to go into this area. The detailed drilling plans, I could guess, but I won't. So I have no specific information as to the exact timing of the first well in this area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is probably a little early to expect that in 2010 so...</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a number of questions on gas. We can take a gas field first on Ormen Langer, Paul Spedding, HSBC. Could you update us on the reserve position at Ormen Langer and comment on whether the recent LPD comments could mean an increased depreciation charge for Statoil, i.e. are the reserves you use to calculate depreciation still below the level that LPD envisages?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The well that I did refer to was obviously a disappointment. It's related to a segment, a sub-segment, which is not the ones that we are producing for now, which actually was presented to &#x2013; which is upside to the Ormen Langer. So basically what has happened is that it seems to be more challenging than we thought to capture this upside. It has nothing to do with the reserves that have been booked. They are not related to this part of the reservoir at all. So it will have no impact on the reserve booking and the depreciations as such. But it might be more challenging to get from that, the upside that we have hoped for, but it's too early to conclude on that as well. So additional activities and additional drilling will have to be performed before there is a final conclusion on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have another question from James Hubbard also about gas.  James from Morgan Stanley. What are the drivers and risks surrounding the gas customers' decision on off-take from Statoil over the next six months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think they have their customers and I would assume they're looking at the same picture that we are looking at, where sort of the demand for the gas is quite strong within the residential area.  On the power side, we see that the gas is, has &#x2013; some of the base load has turned into gas from coal but that there is this quite weak 10 to 15% lower off-take within the Industrial segment, which represents approximately 20% of the overall gas market as such. So I would assume they're listening carefully to what their off-takes are and storage positions and then also the customers want.</p>
          <p>And then obviously they &#x2013; the way the contracts are designed you're going to have a lot of flexibility located within the gas year, but at the end of the gas year the flexibility becomes much less. It might be that they, through the gas year, might use some of their flexibility to source gas, it's cheaper in the short-term in the spot market. But that's a situation which they can utilize but at the end of the gas year we're still left with a contract as such.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe we should just spend a little time on explaining the gas machine a little bit more because there's a question here from James Hubbard at Morgan Stanley, I'm sorry, Jon Rigby at UBS, which goes, "can you perhaps discuss why your off-take versus ACQ and your contracted quantity is apparently unaffected by the steep fall in Continental European gas demand? How should we understand the moving parts that impact this volume? Or presumably it is partly a reflection of the very strong first quarter, which was due to weather and the Ukrainian crisis?"</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a big question. Well as we said the off-take, this has to do with the contractual arrangements and it's not unaffected by the off-take. At the end of the third quarter this year, this rivals the end of the 2008 gas year and basically they have to fulfill their commitments in relation to the contracts.  And that &#x2013; what we ended up with at the end of that period was pretty much in line with what we have seen. There have been just a couple of years that I recall, a long time, with these types of contracts where they have significantly taken much more than the commitment volumes. It varies on temperatures and so on, and it's hard to meet exactly targeted volumes, but it's typically around 90 plus, minus, and so on in terms of the ACQ, typically contracts will vary between 85, 90% of the ACQ depending on which contracts you were looking at.</p>
          <p>So typically they would take at the lower 90s and this year it's the same pattern that we have seen so they have not sort of taken substantially more than they have to. They're taking basically what they have to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. There's more on the gas market, but let's just leave that for a moment and take a question from John Olaisen at Carnegie in Oslo. "The unit depreciation for the international business was very high in the third quarter. Is there any particular reason for that? And where will it be going forward?" Well we discussed that a little bit from the question from Mark, but we can't give any guidance there. But can you give a guidance on the ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This was on the unit depreciation...?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, unit production costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Unit production costs? Yes. Okay. I also touched a little bit upon that in the presentation. It's partly, remember there is 40% depreciation of the U.S. dollar.  So, almost all of this is U.S. dollar. So you take that into the Norwegian kroner you have automatically approximately 40% increase. Then it's a little bit like you see on the depreciation that it's a portfolio of sort of more expensive fields to run. So it's basically a depreciation issue and a cost issue depending on sort of the asset that goes into production and goes into the portfolio and the composition of the portfolio. I think that's what I can add to it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Teodor Nilsen at Argo asks, "do you consider any divestments of international assets?"</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We always do that. It's a natural thing for us to consider. We have a huge portfolio. I have to say that, that is firm and fixed forever; that is not a way of dealing with our portfolio. So we're always looking, constantly looking for opportunities to improve. Maybe, see if we have a too high risk, we want to reduce the risk, or we want partners into a project to combine sort of the competence base, to develop around the project. That could be a good argument. It could be, sort of, doing swap opportunities as well. So all of them hydrating our portfolio, both our exploration portfolio and our production portfolio. That's something that we are looking at. And so I will indefinitely not exclude that we would divest. We could also do acquisitions that's the same approach, that we might you know &#x2013; always looking into good opportunities, value creating opportunities. But what I can say to the extent that we, for instance, do divestments, it will definitely have to provide more value for us than to hold on to the asset or the sort of, the ownership in the asset. So it's not something that we do because we would be desperate for any reason.  It would be a value creating, to the extent that we do it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A question regarding Iraq if I may, on Southern Iraq. Do you have any &#x2013; are you in a position to get a new field in Iraq? Given the situation with BP, World Shell, Exxon and the Chinese companies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we have been in Iraq, positioning ourselves and working together with Iraqis for quite a few years now.  Five, six years, we've been there.  We see upon Iraq as a very sort of exciting, huge, enormous, hydrocarbon province.  And the country actually invites company like us to come and help them to develop these resources and that's extremely good starting point for any kind of involvement.  So through us, with that starting point, and with a huge resource base to exclude Iraq from our way of thinking and our type of company, that would not be wise.</p>
          <p>So we add that into the first round of brownfield developments and we lost by a margin.  And then we could talk a lot about what are the bidding parameters and understanding the bidding terms and how it works and so on.  And we might definitely not have done a good enough job on that.  But I think now we are into a learning process, fundamental learning process to see what have others done, what might we have done wrong, is there anything that we can learn from this and we are also looking at potential partnerships that we could proceed with going into the second round, which would be a greenfield round.</p>
          <p>So, yes, definitely we are very interested, very much interested in getting a position and hopefully with an operating position in Iraq and we are proceeding based on that assumption.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry a question from the Internet, and then we'll leave the question to Trond afterwards.  It is from Sigma Asset Management Louise Amatagrie.  "You mentioned European gas market as a potential risk.  Could you elaborate on that?  And could you discuss the impact on your company of the low gas prices in the traded markets and compare this with the long-term contracts?  Do you expect those contracts to be renegotiated?  And what will the overall impact be on that?"</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  The low, the low &#x2013; the gas market, as I said, it's basically, now we have seen the spot market now and we have all seen variations between the long-term prices and the spot gas prices.  That's not sort of very untypical.  But basically what we see is volatility and longer-term you know has been a quite strong link between oil related contract and oil as such and the gas market.  So this is a rather new situation that we for such a long time have seen a disconnect between the long-term and the short-term.  And we think this will get back to a more normal situation, that there will still be an oil link in the gas market.  But how long it will take, we don't know.  But we'll definitely address the uncertainty.</p>
          <p>Then on the long-term and the customers, we hear and see that they express views on their relationship to companies like us and I think we'll just have to wait and see.  All I can say is that we have a very good relationship and have discussions quite regularly with all our customers.  So we'll just have to wait and see what will happen on this issue going forward, potential issue.</p>

          <p>There's sort of a follow-up question to this and then I'll leave to Trond but James Hubbard follows up, "how concerned is Statoil over the threat of increased LNG supplies into Europe next year?"</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That really doesn't matter.  It's there, it's coming, and it's also this quarter additional L&amp;G coming in, into the U.K., a new capacity.  And there has been some maintenance activities including our own as evidently. So we see this is coming into the global energy market.  Some of this, most of this, is on long-term contracts but there will be definitely a spillover into the Atlantic Basin and we see that happening and it's quite substantial volume in total.  So we're talking about sort of 100, 120 BCM of LNG over the next couple, two, three years coming into the market.</p>
          <p>We see also that this is a development that will go on until, let's say, around 2012, and beyond 2012 there has been no new LNG projects which will sort of push the energy volumes much more beyond 2012.  But it's there and it's going to &#x2013; so this is one of the factors and as I say the other one has to do with the unconventional gas resources and volumes.  That is also represented quite huge capacity, particularly in the U.S. and also the low demand.  So that's &#x2013; these are the main factors why I talk about the uncertainty and a continued sort of soft gas market, at least for the short term and uncertainty also, to some extent beyond that, but I don't want to be more time specific as to sort of how long this situation might last.  But it is &#x2013; there will be an end to it and there will be a better balance in this market. We are confident about that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just to follow up on the Iraqi question, there has been some uncertainty relative to the BP deal on Rumaila but yesterday what the press release from BP seemed to indicate is a cost plus $2.  Of course BP had the advantage of doing reservoir studies on that field and they even discovered it in the 50s, 53.  The fact that you are bidding on fields where you haven't done, as far as being reported at least, these extensive field studies, is that to disadvantage? The other thing is, last time you were only allowed to bid on one, all of the companies were allowed to bid on one, you bid on West Kuma, now you can bid on several of them. Is it a like &#x2013; could you see a scenario where you're actually bidding in different consortium on several fields?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I don't think we were not allowed to bid on several fields the previous time, but we bid on one, as you say.  In terms of &#x2013; these were brownfield developments and I think it's fair to say that they have been in place and some companies have been looking at this for many years.  And it might be part of the explanation why we didn't sort of &#x2013; we were more focusing maybe on the risk elements going into brownfield development than feeling confident about the upsides.  So the characteristic, the brownfield characteristic of these fields in the first round might have been part of the explanation why we missed the way we did it.</p>
          <p>Now we are going into a greenfield round and that is, I think, we have been looking at several of these opportunities for some time, so the most attractive to us are not new to us now and I think we were better prepared to address this Greenfield round as such.  And that should also indicate that we might not be as disadvantaged if that is what has happened on a greenfield situation compared to a brownfield situation.  And we might bid on more than one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Since you call that greenfield, so like <mark type="inaudible" /> that's currently producing like 100,000 barrels, it's like 15 billion, do you consider that a greenfields?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I said it's mainly, mainly greenfields. There are over 10 fields I think, that's mainly greenfields in developments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  There is a question here from Banc of America/Merrill Lynch from Hootan Yazhari.  "Can you please comment on the rationale behind farming down the Peregrino asset, as has been highlighted recently, what other assets are you looking to farm down?  Would you be looking to purchase other assets to replace, if so, where?"</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well to the extent that we do it, it would have to be value. There's no other rationale for us than value. And I think the starting point of Peregrino, we've been open on this since we acquired the remaining 50% of that, that might not be the ideal thing for us to have 100% of a quite substantial and complex project and development like that.</p>
          <p>We have a very good understanding of what is going on, that is going to be there for a long time and 100% might not be the correct, but it might be other ways of spending some of that value that could create an even stronger portfolio for us.  So I think that is the starting point. It's no magic to it, it's just sort of risk and whether we've &#x2013; and competence, is there anybody who can make &#x2013; give us a combined even better competence to develop around this field. That would be good and it could take down some of the exposure and will give sort of flexibility in the financials to also attract other parts of our portfolio maybe more aggressively.  So it's not very dramatic and a quite straight forward thing for us to do and we will do it also in other parts of our portfolio if it makes sense and adds value.</p>
          <p>On other opportunities, I can just give you general comments that we will always look at portfolio-hydrating opportunities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Jon Rigby.  Can you remind us what your assumptions are around the refinery impairments, how does your view on the future compare to history?  And have you created an impairment elevator in the downstream like you did in the upstream?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well basically on the last one, once you have started to impair you are, then you can also take it up to the starting point of the book value and you of course will have to correct me if that is not the case.  So you will probably have more volatility now as we have started to take it down from the historic costs. On the reasons why this has to do with the outlooks for refinery margins, and it's related basically to the economic environment that we see and the demand for those kind of products, in particular distillates and the configurations of our refineries and how soon we think that there will be a recovery.  And then there are two types of recoveries.  First is to do with the global economy and the demand and we think that will come back at least for the distillates and diesel, gasoline and so on.  I think gasoline might be sort of a more permanent situation. And the other thing that needs to happen is that we need to see something happen with the capacity of the overall refinery industry.  And short-term, actually new capacity is coming in from India. And so it's &#x2013; there has to be a restructuring that is going to take place and it's going to take time before this finds the new sort of equilibrium.  And again we think it's beyond sort of the short-term, that we are definitely moving into the medium-term before we will find this sort of a better, better balance.</p>

          <p>There are a couple of questions on projects and project status from Elizabeth Adams at Dow Jones.  Can you specify which NCS fuels you expect to start-up in 2010?  And when?  And before you answer that, on our website from the capital markets update this year and also in the business update that we have updated frequently, there is a list of all the projects that will come into production and also when they will come into production.  So instead of listing all that now we can just <mark type="inaudible" />...</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And <mark type="inaudible" /> at the end, very end of the year, of next year <mark type="inaudible" />.  But you will find that this is the tip.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've got a question from Elaine Dunphy from Deutsche.  We've got a number of questions from her actually; some of them have been answered already.  So I'll just -- just give me a tick here can you &#x2013; to rephrase an earlier question, of the 7 billion synergy savings from the merger, I guess, what percentage have you achieved to date?  And what percentage of the additional 1.5 billion cost savings program from 2008 and 2009 have you achieved to date?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think when it comes to the merger we promise to come back to that once a year and we will do that at our capital markets update in February.  But we are on track. Definitely on track.  When it comes to 1.5, we have implemented all metrics.  So the spend that you see now is at the rate reflecting the measures that we have taken. And this measures on a lot of <mark type="inaudible" /> activities, which adds up to this and I think you can see it in the SG&amp;A for this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a question on shale gas here from Rolf Hawkins at Handelsbanken.  Are you happy with your acreage position in the Appalachia?  Or are you looking at increasing your Marcellus position?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it's actually a part of the agreement with them, with Chesapeake to look at expansions of the acreage.  So that is something that we are &#x2013; not in big steps, but it's small steps, to continuously look at good acreage and add to it, to the existing portfolio.  So that is something that we're doing, but it has to be sort of the quality that we would like to see. So I think that's what &#x2013; our main focus now here is to develop the asset, which is quite substantial.  It's quite a big bite and a new business for us. And to learn about this business and also gradually based on that to organically sort of through the joint venture with Chesapeake to grow the acreage space in this region.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a follow up from Teodor Nilsen, it's a very specific question &#x2013; very specific questions &#x2013; but which initial flow rates have you achieved in the latest wells?  And how much of the 2012 guided position do you expect to come from Marcellus?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well when it comes to 2012 we have indicated around 50,000 barrels per day from Marcellus.  On flow rate we estimated at the acquisition around 3.2 UR and I think what we have seen so far is 3.2 plus.  But I will not be more specific than that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of questions from James Hubbard at Morgan Stanley.  First one is on NGLs.  It seems like NGL suppressed NGL liquid realization in third quarter.  Do you believe this is a structural issue that will remain the feature of NGS EBIT on a &#x2013; or a temporary headwind?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the NGS represents &#x2013; in this quarter represented approximately 15% of the total liquids and I think that is quite representative actually of what you could expect at least short term going forward.  I think the NGLs had a problem with following the high peaks of the oil price definitely and we also saw that at the lower oil price in the previous quarter, that NGL prices were quite weak.  What we have seen this quarter that there is a better link between the oil prices and NGL, but basically NGL goes into a totally different segment, so it's for refineries and for petrochemical industry, so it's total difference in our customers and users for NGL.  So it has a separate life and so it's very hard to sort of relate it to oil as such, but it is a component of our liquid and <mark type="inaudible" /> that will be there for the foreseeable future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have another question from James Hubbard about E&amp;P, can you give us an update of the major growth projects in E&amp;P for 2010 and what are their current status, are they on schedule, are they ahead of schedule, are they slipping?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mentioned the projects, there are three projects basically for 2010 and as far as I know and I think I know them, they are on schedule, there's no new information on these projects.  Same goes for the national project in Canada.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Question on financing charge from Barclays Capital, why do financing charges not seem to be moving up, while gearing relative to year-ago levels with gearing, sorry, relative to year ago levels? We've increased debt but presumably our financing charges don't increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the interest rates, it's my topic, but an interest &#x2013; the  payments might not have increased, now interest rates have been down and we have floating interest rates basically.  And then also some of our interest cost is being capitalized and I don't know exactly what portion, but what we have said is that the typical interest cost and <mark type="inaudible" /> income and asset management typically adds up to zero.  We have guided for some time on that and you'll see that on a year-to-date basis it adds up to 0.1, I think.  So it's almost zero and 0.3 on a quarterly basis.  But of course you might have some additional information but then &#x2013; I think that's the answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Matthew Thomas of Morgan Stanley &#x2013; from Morgan Stanley and there's a lot of questions basically over the same theme here, which is back to gas and gas cost and where's an off take and so on.  We've answered a lot of that but let's just take another one, which is a little bit of a different angle but mainly is the same question that has been answered many times.  What are your thoughts on the outlook for oil in fixation for European gas contracts?  What are the issues of greatest concern among your gas customers?  Are they the price formulas, are they the take a pay volume commitments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To the extent they have concerns they will have to come and talk to us and we'll just have to wait and see.  But I guess sort of it would &#x2013; I wouldn't be surprised if that added up to sort of the fact that they see a spot market.  And in one way or the other we'd like to sort of benefit from what can come out of a good spot market.  And that could be a good way &#x2013; various ways to approach that issue.  But we just have to wait and see if that's becoming an issue.</p>
          <p> One more touch on in oil index here.  I think that question could also be taken into sort of what I addressed earlier, the oil link in more general terms.  And whether the spot market will be linked to oil.  And I think you have seen sort of that moving apart now and I think sort of gradually we will see that there is still a strong case for a relationship, for a strong relationship between oil and gas.  But it is fairly weaker than we have seen historically.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's another question from Sigmus Asset Management, Louise Asmatagrie .  Do you have any views about development of unconventional gas in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all it's, it will never be like the U.S. I think, in terms of resources, but they are definitely there.  And we are looking into these kind of opportunities now.  Some companies have taken positions in these type of resources and it's mainly shale resources.  So we are looking in a joint venture with Chesapeake, have a team from Litsbettle and Chesapeake people who have been looking for some time now at sort of opportunities in Europe, and other places also outside of the U.S.  And so far we haven't concluded on any specific targets that they would &#x2013; it's more a screening space at this level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I still have some questions on gas but I think we'll just leave those because they all go on the same theme that you have answered already.  But there's one question from Colin Smith which is about dividend.  You've also addressed that but I think we'll take that one more time.  IFRS has got nine billion earnings.  IFRS the first nine months have earnings of 10.6 billion, ordinary dividend cost of 14 to 15 billion, pay out ratio of 45 to 50 over time and it has been above recently.  Drilling is at 27.1.  Would you expect to pay at least the 4.4 Norwegian kroner you paid as ordinary dividend in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you want me to repeat exactly what I said to the extent that I recall it?  But I think this is &#x2013; I'll do it just to be precise on this.  As I said we have a dividend policy which is referred to here of 45 to 50 according to our press.  There's no change to that.  It's our press.  Then we also have in the policy that we might deviate.  We have a strong record.  We have paid 52% since the merger.  We might deviate based on other factors such as cash flows stated clearly in the dividend policy.  We might also and we will also take into consideration, which we also have said, it's not said in the dividend policy but we have said it explicitly, that we will take into consideration the type of accounting volatility that we have seen, the currency impacts which is not reflected in the account as I mentioned in my presentation, and other sort of accounting volatility.  We will take that into account but not grade the new type of IFRS stability that way which was not in our press.  And we will take it into account when we make our judgment.  And we have an addition as was stated to grow the ordinary dividend year-on-year.  That's what I can say.  Those components is what we will put together when we make our final decision on the dividend.</p>
