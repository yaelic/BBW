          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for holding and welcome to the Wesfarmers Half-Year 2011 Results Briefing. Your lines will be muted during the briefing; however, you will have an opportunity to ask questions immediately afterwards and instructions will be provided on how to do this at that time. This call is also being webcast live on the Wesfarmers website and can be accessed from the homepage of wesfarmers.com.au.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to hand the call over to the Managing Director of Wesfarmers Limited, Mr. Richard Goyder.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and welcome, everyone, to this call. We'll go through a presentation with each of the divisional managing directors, in order, Ian McLeod followed by John Gillam, Launa Inman, Guy Russo, Rob Scott, Stewart Butel, Tom O'Leary, Olivier Chretien and then Terry Bowen will talk about other business and capital management. I'll come back and talk about outlook and then we'll be very happy to take your questions.</p>
          <p>In terms of the Group performance highlights and I'm on Slide 4 now, the Group financial highlights. The first half profit after tax of $1.173 billion was up over 33% on operating revenue of $28.1 billion, up just under 6%. And our Group EBIT of $1.917 billion was up nearly 24%, with seven of the eight divisions, or eight of nine if you separate out Officeworks, all improving EBIT for the half.</p>
          <p>Pleasingly, earnings per share are up to just under $1.02 per share, 33% increase, and solid operating cash flows of just under $2 billion with a cash realisation of 120%, and that all helping to ensure that our liquidity position is strong, and as Terry will mention later, interest cover of 7.7 times. Strong capital investment in the business of just under $1 billion and the Board declared today an interim fully franked dividend of $0.65 per share.</p>
          <p>On to Slide 5, in terms of the businesses, the Coles performance continues to track with our expectations with revenue up just under 6% and EBIT up over 18%. We continue to make good progress on the turnaround of that business. We were pleased with Bunnings. You've seen the sales previously. The performance, the earnings performance, was strong and we continue to work hard on operational improvement across our three strategic pillars of range, price and service.</p>
          <p>The other couple of turnaround businesses in Kmart and Officeworks were good for the half, I think, pleasingly with good growth in customer transactions, revenue and earnings in both those businesses. Kmart up for the half 13.6% and 18.5% for Officeworks in terms of earnings.</p>
          <p>The Insurance result for this year is, as Rob will talk about later, is going to be impacted by many claims events, but underlying that, and certainly for the first half, an improvement in earnings. And then the underwriting business, that really does follow a lot of work we've done on remediating our underwriting and a very solid broking performance.</p>
          <p>In the Industrials businesses, resource earnings were up significantly based on increased coal prices, export coal prices, which helped both Curragh and Bengalla, notwithstanding the rainfall impacts the first half which obviously has continued in the second half and the impact they've had on mining costs, which Stewart will refer to.</p>
          <p>Again we were very pleased with the performance from the merged chemicals, energy and fertilizer division where we had strong demand for both the chemicals and a turnaround in the fertilizer business plus obviously some insurance proceeds from Varanus Island and a really strong performance from the industrial and safety division, which is benefiting from a strong demand out of the resources sector.</p>
          <p>Terry will talk a bit later about some non-cash revaluations in Gresham Private Equity and I'll also refer later on to impacts of the major weather events this half.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 7, I won't make any comment on that. That's information on the Group performance for the half.</p>
          <p>Slide 8 talks about an increase in earnings per share which we're pleased about following the equity raising for the impacted '08 and '09 numbers.</p>
          <p>On Slide 9, as I said earlier, most of our divisions recorded improved earnings for the half and of the eight divisions, as you'll see on Slide 10, six of the eight improved return on capital.</p>
          <p>I think, though, this slide does indicate the diversified nature of the earnings of the Group, and if you look over our history, I think this diversification has helped us both in terms of growth opportunities but also weathering some particular cycles in some businesses. So we're pretty happy with the portfolio of assets we've got at the moment.</p>
          <p>A very strong focus continues in the Company on return of capital. As I said, six of eight or seven of nine, depending on how you want to look at it, of the businesses improved their return on capital on a rolling 12 basis, and that continues to be, as I said, a strong focus.</p>
          <p>Then on to progress on key strategic initiatives, Slides 11 and 12. The divisional heads will talk a lot about this so let me just touch on a couple.</p>
          <p>The Coles turnaround is on track. There's a focus now on delivering consistently well. We put in place a five year plan but our very strong view is that the Coles opportunity for Wesfarmers extends well beyond five years and we're looking forward to that. John will talk about the work that's going on in terms of price and range and network expansion in the home improvement and office supplies division.</p>
          <p>We continue to be pleased with the way Kmart is affecting its turnaround, and Guy and the team are now focused on the growth phase of that business. Launa will underline the work that continues to occur in Target around differentiating our offer and delivering better value and service to customers.</p>
          <p>Rob will talk about continuing to work on underwriting disciplines and the premium growth initiatives in insurance; and in resources, Stewart will talk about some of the work we're doing on the expansion projects that are underway and productivity improvements. Within the chemicals, energy and fertilizer division, there's a number of expansion opportunities but the big one being AN3 and improving plant performance as well.</p>
          <p>Olivier will talk a bit about our existing customers, how we increase the share of spend and growth in the new markets. So we think we've got growth opportunities in each of our businesses, and at a group level we continue obviously to look at portfolio management opportunities. Terry and his team have a very strong focus on improving our balance sheet efficiency and funding diversity. We've made good progress on that fund and we'll continue to focus on it.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll hand over to Ian to give you an update on Coles.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Richard. Well, as we pass the halfway mark of the Coles turnaround, I believe today's half year profit result provides further evidence of solid progress. While we are well aware that there is still a significant amount of work to be done, substantial effort on a number of fronts has laid the foundations for further progress in the future.</p>
          <p>For example, we've developed management strength in debt, introduced a diverse culture where stores and customers come first, addressed many of the basic store infrastructure issues we inherited, improved operating standards and product availability, as well as delivering stronger value through lower prices and better quality.</p>
          <p>We've also enhanced our supply chain systems efficiency, rolled out almost a hundred renewal stores in a format which didn't exist two years ago, as well as training and promoting over 2000 team members in recognition of their support for the turnaround, part of an underlying plan to recruit and develop homegrown talent.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to Slide 14. Total revenue grew by 5.9% to over $16 billion with earnings before interest and tax rising by 18.3% to $575 million. The improvement in first half earnings plus an improvement in return on capital employed to 7.1% not only reflects an encouraging sales result but indicates our focus on reducing costs, reducing waste, improving efficiency in the supply chain as well as improving productivity in the stores.</p>
          <p>Food and liquor performance is encouraging as comparable store sales grew by 6.4% against a strong prior year comparative and flat space growth. Further focus on improving our cost of doing business facilitated a 22.1% improvement in EBIT and a 50 basis points improvement in EBIT margin. Coles Express delivered revenue of $3.2 billion for the half, 3.9% up on the prior year.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Slide 15. A key element of our strategy has been to encourage more of our customers to buy more of their fresh food requirements from Coles. This, combined with a genuine desire to invest in price, reducing rather than inflating prices, has seen us benefit from growing customer numbers with fresh participation growing the basket size and the delivery of our seventh consecutive course of Industry A performance.</p>
          <p>As well as driving the top lines, we're now beginning to see the benefits of our focus on lowering our costs of doing business. This has allowed us the flexibility to continue to invest in Coles in value as well as improving our profitability. Important efficiency initiatives such as better inventory management, stronger fresh food volumes, reduced waste and productivity programs, have generated well over $100 million in annualized savings.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 16, the savings pool from improved efficiency across the business has enabled Coles to reinvest in lower prices to customers and begin to rebuild customer trust and our value. Last Australia Day we implemented uniform state based pricing. This ended a disingenuous practice of charging different prices for the same product in nearby supermarkets, finally eliminating a key driver of mistrust.</p>
          <p>Since June last year, Coles has now cut prices in over 5000 products, to ensure that we provide the best overall value for our customers by lowering the cost of the overall shopping basket. Finally, we've sought to reduce prices on regularly key family items to make shopping for essentials more affordable.</p>
          <p>The growth in sales in customer numbers has given us encouragement that the idea of trusting Coles' pricing is beginning to resonant with consumers. Improving Coles' brand has been important in building trust in our value. The last two years has seen an overhaul of most products in the range, and this focus on continuous improvement is now embedded in our development program.</p>
          <p>The elimination of You'll Love Coles is now complete. We are growing the reputation of the Coles Finest fresh food range and the Smart Buy entry peer is currently being reviewed and redeveloped. Our value meals solutions for under $10 developed with the support of Curtis Stone continues to be a hit with customers with over nine million recipe cards collected to-date.</p>
          <p>MasterChef and My Kitchen Rules have also added to the credibility of the Coles offer and over 7600 schools across Australia participated in our Sports for Schools program, culminating with us donating over $7 million of sports equipment for schools last month.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to Slide 17. Another key platform for building customer trust in Coles has been our focus on animal welfare and ethical sourcing. We have seen a marked rise in consumer concerns on such issues, with customers looking to us to take a lead in delivering change. In response, we've worked behind the scenes with our suppliers to see what can be done. As a result, we've been able to announce certain commitments which provide further trust in Coles' determination to do the right thing.</p>
          <p>Beef without hormone growth promotants was introduced in December last year. We will stop selling caged eggs by 2013 and all our pork production will be sow stall free by 2014. We've been rewarded by customers providing us with double-digit sales growth in each of these categories since these announcements were made.</p>
          <p>Free range pork sales, for example, have more than doubled since last year. More broadly we've worked with suppliers to improve quality of fruit and vegetables and invested in price to drive higher volumes and freshness. In other categories, we've also focused on new product development, particularly at Christmas where we sold over 30,000 free range turkeys and over 70 tonnes of fresh Crystal Bay prawns. Sales of each of these items were zero two years ago.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Slide 18, we are now in a position where we have confidence in rolling our renewal store format with scale. We've 99 stores live, landing 49 so far this year. Through this financial year, we will land around 100 stores and we aim to do the same again in FY '12. We have also taken the opportunity to retrofit certain successful concepts into the chain.</p>
          <p>We now have 677 new health and beauty sections, 115 entertainment and paper shops, 103 stores with self scanning checkouts and 280 fresh curry takeaways, in case you need a curry in a hurry.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Slide 19, it is clear that retail in general has been a very challenging environment and liquor and convenience markets have been no exception. Since Tony Leon's arrival, we have had a real determination to improve sales value and profit in liquor, and are pleased with the results.</p>
          <p>A combination of stronger promotions, better everyday value, better ranging and effective cost control has allowed us to grow profit and increase market share in a difficult market environment. In our convenience business, we outperformed the market in fuel volume growth. To help customers loyal to Coles at Christmas, we introduced a $0.08 per litre double fuel discount for November and December.</p>
          <p>We saw a record four million customers buy fuel and impulse products from us over the festive season. We're also planning light refurbishments across 2000 Express sites in the forthcoming year.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Slide 20, I'll comment on the outlook. I think it is fair, as I said, that a lot of hard work and effort has been put in by all our team members at Coles as part of the turnaround so far. It is certainly gratifying and good recognition for all our team members that customers have responded so well to the changes we are making.</p>
          <p>However, as I said at the start, we are only passing the halfway mark of the turnaround and there is still a lot of work to do to embed the progress that we have made and ensure that Coles delivers for Wesfarmers shareholders now and in the future. The challenge will remain tough going forward.</p>
          <p>We will continue to implement the turnaround strategy at pace and respond to external disruptions such as the floods, cyclones and bushfires as and when they arise. The recent floods and Cyclone Yasi will have some impact on the business in the second half but we have worked hard to contain those costs.</p>
          <p>We have already visited our banana growers to see firsthand the disruption they've experienced. Wholesale banana prices were increasing even before the cyclone hit, so retail price rises have been inevitable. However, Coles is committed to supporting Australian banana growers and we are therefore not advocating introduction of imports.</p>
          <p>In addition, there are also signs that global soft commodity and energy prices are rising and this is expected to flow through into our input costs, such as transport and packaging and grocery prices. However, the extent and scale at this stage is difficult to predict. In summary, therefore, it's been an encouraging first half but internally we still have a great deal to do.</p>
          <p>External markets and conditions remain challenging and the competition are responding to our changes. Nonetheless, the Coles turnaround is on track and the determination exists across the business to see that improvement continue. I'll now hand over to John Gillam.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ian. I'll start with Bunnings and I'm talking to Slide 23. Bunnings finished the first half in good shape. Trading revenue grew by 4.4%, driving an uplift of over 8% in earnings. Trading margins remain strong. We continue to invest in new stores and new sites for future development and we maintained investments in refurbishing and expanding our existing stores.</p>
          <p>Our CapEx level lifted appreciably, exceeding $325 million in the half, and that had an obvious impact on our RSB but we're investing for the future.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 24, we achieved total store sales growth for the half of 4.1%, quite a pleasing result given we were building on last year's 13% sales uplift.</p>
          <p>Store-on-store growth was 1.7% for the half and commercial sales lifted by 3.7%. Results did reflect some headwinds, particularly the deflationary impact of our value focus work as well as adverse weather conditions in many trading locations. Our earnings growth was underpinned by good progress across our strategic agenda.</p>
          <p>The quality of work done to strengthen our customer offer and our business model over the past year has been very pleasing. In the first half, outcomes from our merchandising initiatives and from our longer term productivity focus were highlights. We've made good progress on the range reset project that I talked about in last year's May investor briefing.</p>
          <p>That project has seen us refining and decluttering our range, unlocking space for new and expanded categories while remaining true to two core customer promises of widest range and lowest prices. Within this process, we've worked closely with our suppliers, delivering higher quality products with terrific value appeal. The customer response has been strong and our investments in new service initiatives are exciting and they're also achieving good customer responses. Early days on that front.</p>
          <p>Expansion of the Bunnings network continues. We opened 16 trading locations during the half, including eight new warehouse stores, five smaller format stores and three trade centres. As you can see from Slide 9, in the supplementary pack, we had nine stores and three trade centres under construction at the end of December. That number has already increased. The quality and depth of our new store pipeline will support good levels of network expansion for quite some time. In terms of outlook, Slide 25, we anticipate continuing to grow sales.</p>
          <p>This will be driven by our strategic agenda which spans five growth drivers &#x2013; service, category expansion and optimization, enhancing and expanding our network, commercial customer opportunities both in our store network and via our trade centres, and business fitness to fund the provision of more value to customers.</p>
          <p>I'd like to draw your attention to the capital management work that has been announced today for the sale and leaseback of 13 warehouse stores will improve our ROC, and this style of transaction is an ongoing initiative.</p>
          <p>To sum up, Bunnings enters 2011 in pretty good shape, but we're not letting up at all. It's pretty exciting to see the positives for customers being worked on from where I sit across range and price and service.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 26, I'll comment on Officeworks. The Officeworks results for the half were very good. Trading revenue of $706 million represented an increase of 6.6% on last year. The increased volumes, together with good traction from a number of strategic initiatives, drove an 18% uplift in earnings. As a result, EBIT margin and ROC continue to lift. The pleasing safety improvement is an indicator, I believe, of better engagement levels across the team.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 27, within the Officeworks store network sales grew by 7.5% and our business channel sales also continue to gain momentum across the period. Given the more challenging economic conditions that were experienced, particularly in the second quarter, I think the sales growth achieved was good. Highlights for the half included further enhancements to the Officeworks online offer as well as more expansion and renewal of merchandising ranges and services.</p>
          <p>There's been good positive signs from the expanded and improved furniture, cleaning and canteen ranges, as well as the new print and copy services. Work expanding the Officeworks store network is accelerating. During the half, seven new stores were opened. Reinvesting in the existing store network to transform the store look and feel is also a major focus. Five full store upgrades and a much larger number of minor upgrades were completed in the half. Over one-third of the Officeworks store network is now trading with the new store format. Important gains in operational effectiveness were bedded down but there is much more to do on that front.</p>
          <p>Finally some comments on outlook, Slide 28. Within the markets that Officeworks services we've seen volatile trading conditions and increased competitive pressures on sales and on margins. The primary focus for Mark Ward and the Officeworks team remain executing their strategic agenda well. Work to drive enhancements to the customer offer will continue, as will our investments to expand and upgrade the Officeworks network.</p>
          <p>With that I'll now hand over to Launa Inman.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone. I'd now like to take you through Target's results and highlights. Looking at Slide 30 and 31, Target's performance basically and a summary of our highlights. I'd just like to say that our operating revenue over the half year declined by 2.8% to $2.1 billion with comparable store sales down 3.3% for the half year.</p>
          <p>Last year our record EBIT margin of 12.8% was a result of a number of positive variables aligning for us. We therefore did anticipate that there would be an EBIT margin drop this year and it certainly has been a challenging six months. However, the team have still been able to deliver an EBIT of $206 million with an EBIT to sales margin of 9.7%.</p>
          <p>Our customer numbers and sales volumes were up on the same time last year. However, this result does reflect the impact of price deflation across the market, which was further aggravated by the unseasonably cool wet weather. As a result we cleared seasonal stock earlier and with large markdowns. This, of course, is in contrast to the same time last year when we benefited from the early arrival of a hot summer across the entire country, which drove strong apparel sales.</p>
          <p>As a consequence of these factors, we've had sales decline in a number of categories, particularly the fashion category of ladies' and men's outerwear. However, we have seen solid growth in less seasonal areas such as underwear, socks and hosiery, particularly in our ladies' wear department. We have also had positive sales growth in our core children's wear categories, despite the price deflation and customers moving towards a lower priced merchandise. In electrical there is still strong consumer demand for new and innovative items, such as iPods and iTunes.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately our inventory levels did finish up on last year as a result of the trading conditions. However, because of the early clearance action and management by the team, we are comfortable with the quality of the remaining stock.</p>
          <p>Now moving onto Slide 32, as many of you know consumer sentiment was and continues to be affected by the threat of further interest rate increases, as well as impacts to discretionary incomes through high cost of everyday living, particularly with utilities and fuel. We don't see this changing significantly over the next six months. Our customers are purchasing very purposely and with far more consideration. We are spending a lot of time at Target understanding their behavior so we can deliver the right product at the right time.</p>
          <p>In August I flagged with you that we had reduced retail price points on similar products from the previous year in a number of categories, with no reduction on product quality. This still continues. However, the challenge facing us going forward is going to be the management of commodity cost pressures such as raw materials like cotton increasing dramatically. Our focus will be on delivering our customers the wanted product that incorporate great star, great quality and great value, while maintaining our market position between the department stores and discount department stores.</p>
          <p>With consumers focused on value, we are investing in first price right price to maintain our trusted price perception. The implementation of our new product design and development capabilities continue and will ensure our ongoing ability to differentiate ourselves in the market.</p>
          <p>The delivery of our in-house designs will commence in the third quarter of this financial year, particularly in the homewares and children's wear area, with the majority then hitting stores for summer.</p>
          <p>Our store network also remains a priority. However, getting the required quantity of new stores on the ground has continued to be challenging. For the half we've had new two Target Country stores, although one in Bowral in New South Wales in fact replaced two smaller stores in the same town. We have therefore taken the opportunity to reinvest in our existing stores. As the majority of our Target store fleet has been refurbished in recent years, we are now upgrading our Target Country stores. Many of these smaller stores are the major retailer in town and many have been long overdue for a freshen-up.</p>
          <p>Of the 39 refurbishments completed during the half, 20 were Target Country stores. For the remainder of the financial year we will have one new store and 33 refurbishments, with the rollout of new fixtures to our nursery and baby areas to be completed by the end of the financial year.</p>
          <p>We are also continuing to spend time and resources on developing alternative channels to provide further convenience to our customers. We entered the social media space on Monday with the launch of our Facebook page and we are now in the final testing stages of our online retailing site, which will be operational by the end of March, and look forward to sharing more of this with you at the strategy day later on in the year.</p>
          <p>Thank you and I'll now hand over to Guy.</p>

      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Launa, good morning or good afternoon everybody. The Kmart turnaround was cut into three phases of discovery, renewal and growth, and we have now moved into the growth phase. At Kmart our continued focus is on our new vision, where families come first for everyday items at the lowest price.</p>
          <p>I now move to Slide 34. We achieved a moderate sales growth of 2% or 1.7% comparable growth for the half. A strong earnings growth of 13% or $20 million increased to $174 million and a strong increase on return of capital from 19.8% to 25.8%. Overall a pleasing result, which I will now take you though now onto the next Slide, 35.</p>
          <p>Firstly profits, although sales for the was modest we were able to generate a solid profit growth with our strong focus to-date in reducing the cost of goods. Our focus on reducing items that are now below 50,000 and our model switchover to everyday lowest prices for our customers is also progressing well.</p>
          <p>As mentioned, lowering our cost of products, plus lowering operating costs across the Company, is moving forward quite smoothly. In July and December we successfully traded through toy sale and Christmas without deep category wide discounting and believe that the original focus on improving our major events like toy sale, Christmas and Easter have vastly improved for our customers and our bottom line. This new platform we can now improve on into the future.</p>
          <p>The customer focus turnaround and their satisfaction and improved return for shareholders is our barometers to measure success. Kmart's existing and new customers continue to respond well to the changes in our business, evident by the continued increase in customer compliments and seven million more customer transactions that we achieved in the half.</p>
          <p>Essentially what our customers experienced when visiting Kmart this half was continued lowering of prices across all 50,000 items, products that they now need and use for their family and home. Gone are the days that we created excessive ranges that hindered the ability for our customers to make a purchase in our stores, and also I hope they are beginning to notice our team members' commitment to them by being more friendly, helpful and serve them fast, as we appreciate how precious their time is.</p>
          <p>In-store customer experience remains high on our priority list, so we continue to ensure all customer walkways remain clear and we continued our upgrade on our floors, customer change rooms, extending our trading hours to be open when they most need us, plus to date we have successfully installed over 20 self-checkouts.</p>
          <p>The distribution centres and the renewals of our DCs is progressing as per plan with the recent opening of a new facility in Auckland and in the coming weeks a new distribution centre in Victoria. This focus was imperative to our turnaround to improve efficiency, lowering cost as well as catering for the increased volumes now flowing through our business.</p>
          <p>The plan for our store networks are progressing well with pleasing results to date from our dedicated property team to increase the number of stores in our fleet. We now have completed four new store formats and will open a further four by Christmas this year.</p>
          <p>Kmart Tyre &amp; Auto again delivered another strong sales and profit result for the half. Their focus remains on providing their existing and new customers quality services and tyres at great prices in upgraded facilities across the fleet, to ensure that customers know we care about their cars and that they are also in the best of hands.</p>
          <p>Now moving to Slide 36, I'll comment on our outlook. The business continues with the growth phase of the turnaround. Our focus remains on driving more customers into the store, more often, more profitably. To do this we will continue to refine the product offer for our customers. So whilst many categories are well-advanced on this journey, we still have some work to do. We also remain focused on sourcing quality products at the lowest cost, so that we can deliver lowest prices to our customers; and finally, to further improve the in-store customer experience through clean and tidy stores, improved customer service and fast and friendly checkouts.</p>
          <p>Part of that improved in-store experience for our customers involves continued investment in the store network through ongoing development of in-store concepts and renewing and refreshing existing stores. Pursuing new store opportunity also remains high on our priority list.</p>
          <p>As mentioned, whilst we remain focused on finding ways to source quality products at lowest cost, we are still experiencing competing pressures from the increase of cost of raw material and labour.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, we are well-advanced in resetting the Kmart business and are very confident that our focus on providing lowest prices on everyday items, with quality for families, is working well and will be the platform for growth for the Kmart business.</p>
          <p>Thank you and I'll now hand over to Stewart &#x2013; sorry, Rob.</p>

          <p>It's Rob Scott here on Insurance. I'll start on Slide 38. In the first half we increased revenue by 0.5% to $872 million. GWP was down 3% on the prior period due to the runoff of unprofitable business arrangements. However, this was more than offset by growth in earned premium and broking revenue.</p>
          <p>Our EBITA for the half increased by 11% to $70 million. We achieved double-digit earnings growth in both underwriting and broking. This was particularly pleasing in underwriting where we experienced above average claims from catastrophe events. Investment earnings was also up on the prior year, due to higher yields on term deposits.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to the highlights. Our broking businesses generated revenue growth of 4% for the half and through strong cost control achieved earnings growth of 12%. In underwriting, the remediation and portfolio management work undertaken in recent years is delivering improvements in underwriting margin. These improvements helped offset higher costs from natural perils for the half. These costs included $11 million for the Christchurch earthquake and additional claims for floods and storms in Australia.</p>
          <p>Good progress was made during the half on a number of key growth initiatives. This included the launch of a personalised offer through Coles where the take-up has been encouraging, and strong growth in new business through Lumley's EDI channel and via our corporate underwriting team.</p>
          <p>Lumley is receiving good support from key brokers following the capability build that we have undertaken, and Lumley New Zealand improved its ranking in the annual broker survey from number seven to number three.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to the outlook. The severe weather events since December have been unprecedented in frequency and severity, resulting in claims in excess of $3 billion for insurers. The Queensland floods and Cyclone Yasi both generated claims for our business in excess of our net cat retention of $11 million.</p>
          <p>The claims associated with these events and the purchase of reinsurance reinstatement cover has resulted in costs of $35 million above our normal allowances, which will be incurred in the second half. Our maximum event retention is now $15 million for any one event for the remainder of the year to the 30th of June.</p>
          <p>Our claims team have responded very well under difficult circumstances in handling the significant volumes of claims. There's a high degree of scrutiny on claims performance of insurers and we see that this is an opportunity to differentiate our service proposition relative to competitors.</p>
          <p>Looking through these events, we expect to see further improvements in the underlying underwriting performance and further growth in premiums through key growth initiatives. Further growth is expected from our personal lines initiatives, where through partners such as Coles we are offering a very strong value proposition to customers in this segment of the market.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to Stewart for Resources.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob. I refer you to Slide 42. Earnings before interest and tax of $250 million was dramatically up from last year's EBIT of $2 million. This increase was due to higher export coal prices, lower Stanwell royalty expenses and no hedge losses. This increase was offset by lower metallurgical production and sales, plus higher costs, both as a result of major rainfall and flooding at our Curragh mine.</p>
          <p>Importantly, our lost time injury frequency rate of 0.9 was significantly lower than last year, due to our ongoing commitment to create an injury-free workplace. However, tragically one of our contractors at Curragh was involved in a fatal light vehicle accident during the half.</p>
          <p>I refer you to Slide 43. Resources highlights for the half include a strong financial result was achieved in the face of extremely adverse weather conditions at Curragh, particularly in September and December. Curragh's mine cash costs were up 19.9%. This followed a 9% reduction in costs last year. This year's increase is due primarily to the impact of wet weather and our inability to catch up lost production until the new coal handling and preparation plant is commissioned at Curragh late this year. We continue to experience strong global demand for both metallurgical and export steaming coal.</p>
          <p>Our expansion programs remain on track. The $286 million Curragh expansion to 8.5 million tonnes of export metallurgical coal is underway and we expect to complete that late this year or early 2012. As announced in November 2010, the Bengalla joint venture approved the expansion of the mine to $9.3 million tonnes of ROM annual production on a 100% basis. Stage one completion is expected by Q1 calendar year of 2012.</p>
          <p>I now refer you to slide 44. Curragh was impacted by record rainfall and flooding in September, December, and that extended into January. This had a major impact on coal production for the mine in December with production in the upcoming March quarter also to be impacted due to ongoing pit dewatering, low coal exposure and the need to rebuild stocks previously drawn down over the December and January period.</p>
          <p>At the same time, QR's rail operations on the Blackwater line was suspended in December through to January, restricting rail access to the port for five weeks. As a result, we have revised our full year forecast for Curragh to 5.8 million tonnes to 6.2 million tonnes of metallurgical sales for this financial year, dependent as always on weather and satisfactory infrastructure access.</p>
          <p>I now turn you to outlook, slide number 45. As I have already stated, December wet weather will impact the March quarter performance. Pleasingly, March quarter price negotiations were completed with a 12% increase compared to the December quarter. Export coal demand continues to be high and favorable pricing outcomes are expected in the June quarter. Our carry-over tonnage will extend into this period. The full year sales mix is estimated to be approximately 44% hard coking coal and 21% semi-hard and 35% PCI coal. This is a temporary reduction in the percentage of hard coking coal produced for the year due to the impact of wet weather at Curragh. The Stanwell royalty is expected to range between $130 million to $140 million for the full year.</p>
          <p>Looking further forward, there is potential for continued tight labor market and industry cost pressures. Our expansions are presently underway at both our Curragh and Bengalla mines and next-stage expansion studies are continuing.</p>

      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Stewart. <mark type="inaudible" /> Chemicals, Energy, and Fertiliser, I'm going straight to safety performance and put up the slide 47. You will see a very disappointing increase in LTIFR between 2009 and 2010. Following the merger of the Energy and Chemicals and Fertiliser division last year, though, more resources are being applied to health and safety within the division, anticipating improvements in all safety indicators over time.</p>
          <p>Turning to financial performance, as I said the merged division came into effect in July last year. So today's results show for the first time the performance of the new division, both for the six months period to 31 December 2010 and the previous corresponding period. Earnings for the division increased significantly on last year, although there are a few one-off items worth highlighting.</p>
          <p>During the period, the Varanus Island gas disruption insurance claims was settled, resulting in a profit of $41 million being booked. That's in addition to the $5 million, which was recognized in the second half of 2010. In addition, it's worth remembering that last year's results were negatively affected by a write-down &#x2013; a $25 million write-down of fertiliser inventories and flow on margin impact as a result of a carry-over of highly priced inventory. Taking into account these items, it's pleasing to see underlying earnings increase relative to last year, with most businesses contributing to that increase.</p>
          <p>Turning to highlights on slide 48, we continue to benefit from good production performance in both our ammonia and ammonium nitrate plants, coupled with strong demand from the local resources sector. At Australian Vinyls, despite increased sales, we continued to experience higher input costs relative to the PVC selling price. That's known in the industry as the PVC/VCM spread compared to the prior year. And that's been exacerbated by the higher Australian dollar.</p>
          <p>In the Kleenheat business, LPG production decreased compared to the corresponding period, following particularly high content in the Dampier to Bunbury pipeline last year, and that resulted in lower export sales. The business was also affected by higher gas input costs incurred since October 2010.</p>
          <p>Offsetting those negative impacts were higher international LPG prices and domestic LPG sales volumes, as well as some good work done on reducing costs over the period. In fertilisers, we saw a recovery in margins following the hit in the previous year from the carry-over of highly priced inventory. This recovery more than offset the lower sales tonnes achieved. In terms of fertilisers market share, we're saying this being pretty stable, notwithstanding the changes to the channel in WA last year.</p>
          <p>Turning to outlook on slide 49 for the division, we're expecting continued strong performances from all of our businesses exposed to the resources sector, particularly ammonium nitrate and sodium cyanide, albeit that the sodium cyanide business will continue to face higher gas prices in the previous year and exports will also be impacted by the higher Australian dollar. Work is continuing on the feasibility study for our ammonium nitrate expansion and at this stage it's looking positive.</p>
          <p>Fertiliser earnings, as always, are very dependent on the seasonal break in the second half as well as on farmers' terms of trade. As a result of the recent drought in WA though, and in particular, the potential levels of nutrient in soil and in inventories on farm, together with the impact of the destocking of WA pastures that occurred during the last half. At this stage, we expect volumes for the full year to be lower than the 2010 financial year.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Tom and good afternoon. The Industrial and Safety division delivered a strong result, supporting by increasing demand from the resources sector, a broadening of the customer base and increasing market share. The division is reporting for the first time inclusive of Coregas, and the 2009 figures have been restated accordingly on slide 51.</p>
          <p>Operating revenues for the first half were $774 million, an increase of 12.3% on last year, and pleasingly most businesses and regions have achieved strong sales growth, which was supported by ongoing focus on customer service and on-time delivery performance. Solid growth was achieved in contracts, projects, services and eBusiness and we made positive progress in industry diversification across the division.</p>
          <p>Earnings before interest and tax were $79 million, up 21.5% on last year, and this result reflects earning improvement in all our business units. Return on capital increased from 9.5% to 11.8%. Thanks to the area result coupled with strong capital management across the division.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 52, a notable highlight in the first half was the continued strengthening of our business portfolio with not only the transition of Coregas into our division, but also the divestment of Motion Industries in September, the merger of the Blackwoods Paykels and Protector Safety businesses in New Zealand, the acquisition of a small gas detection services business as well as various network improvements.</p>
          <p>The division also continues to enhance its direct sourcing capabilities with the opening of a new multi-country consolidation distribution centre in Shenzhen in China. And over time, this will become an important element in reducing lead times and inventory holdings across the division.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to the outlook for the Industrial and Safety division on slide 53, I believe the division is very well-placed to leverage its strong growth platform and to take advantage of improving market conditions. The key focus will be to continue to grow the share of customers' spend, increasing industry diversification, and looking for acquisition opportunities. While the outlook remains positive, a number of factors have the potential to upset some of this positive momentum, particularly the slower recovery in New Zealand, ongoing competitive margin pressure, and a tighter level market in Australia.</p>
          <p>Thank you. I will now hand over to Terry Bowen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Olivier. Good afternoon, anyone. I'll provide an overview of the Group's capital management and then just touch on the other businesses results for the half.</p>
          <p>So turning to slide 55, solid operating performance as ongoing working capital initiatives, combined with a traditionally stronger first half retail cash flows, resulted in cash flows from operations for the Group of $1.960 billion in the six months to December. This result, together with disciplined capital expenditure, leaves the Group's balance sheets in a pretty healthy position. The Group's ratings during the period have been left unchanged by the rating agencies, but you'll notice in the results that all of our liquidity ratios have continued to improve.</p>
          <p>As Richard mentioned earlier, the Group has announced an interim dividend of $0.65 per share fully franked and that's 18% up on last year's interim dividend. In line with our recent practice, the Group will continue to provide shareholders with the option to participate in a dividend investment plan, but no discount would apply to this and the allocation price of the program will not be underwritten. The required number of shares will be acquired on market, which will neutralize any dilutionary effects again of any shares issued under the DIP. The record date for the dividend is 28th of February and the interim dividend payable on the 31st of March.</p>
          <p>So turning to 56, working capital. As foreshadowed at the 2010 full year results announcements, improvements in working capital for the half were lower than that achieved in the first half last year. Remembering that last year's working capital management benefited from the closure of off-site inventory storage previously used in Kmart, we had overseas suppliers being reset in the previous Coles acquired divisions and we also had to sell through a very high price to carry out fertiliser that Tom's alluded to.</p>
          <p>In the half &#x2013; this half working capital for the group's retail businesses reduced by $113 million, which we still thought was a good result and this was in an environment where there was capital investment in both Bunnings and Officeworks due to the store expansion process that John's been referring to. And as Launa mentioned, we had additional inventory in Target, despite the proactive clearance activity that was undertaken there.</p>
          <p>The major driver of the result again pleasingly was Coles' performance which continues to improve its net working capital days through solid inventory improvement. Kmart also saw some improvement in its working capital days position. Working capital in the industrial business is higher than last year, particularly in Wesfarmers chemicals, energies and ferts, as a result of increased commodity prices largely. There's further information in relation to balance sheet on slides 47 and 48 on the supplementary pack, which is new, which I'll refer you to.</p>
          <p>On slide 57, you can see for the half that the cash realization ratio was 120% for the group, and that reflects the strong cash generating nature of the group's businesses that Richard's referred to. As I mentioned, cash flows are traditionally stronger though in this first half, particularly in our retail businesses.</p>
          <p>Turning to CapEx on slide 58, the group's capital expenditure in the half was $992 million and this was $101 million ahead of last year. The increase in capital expenditure above this time last year mainly reflects store network growth in Bunnings and the expansion work underway in the Resources division.</p>
          <p>All of our retails businesses continued to invest in store infrastructure and lifting store standards in the period. Coles capital investment as you can see was down on last year, but renewal store activity increased and the reduction really shows a difference in property activity between the two halves, freehold and last year's strong investment in high-performing concepts across the fleet as well as we were having to invest increasingly in the early years of the turnaround in picking up store standards to basic levels following under investment previously.</p>
          <p>So if we look forward, we retain our current guidance of between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion for total capital expenditure for the year. But as I mentioned previously, this will be very dependent on freehold property activity in the second half. Turning to slide 59 on debt financing, the group's liquidity position is strong and all clear liquidity indicators are improving. The all in weighted cost of debt for the half was 8.8% and our guidance remains in that range of around 8.8% to 9% with 68% of the group's gross debt still hedged out to about December 2011.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 60, as I mentioned the group has &#x2013; as has been mentioned previously, the group has established a $2.5 billion revolving debt facility in December and this provides us with more flexibility as well as some favourable terms relative to our previous syndicated facility. So we've used the proceeds from this facility to repay those debt facilities. The new facility has an average term to maturity of 3.5 years with equal maturities in December 2013 and '14. So the graph on this slide depicts the group's debt maturity profile. And you can see on the average term to maturity for the group's debt is now 3.3 years, which is an extension of about 171 days over last year.</p>
          <p>In the next 18 months, if we look forward, total debt repayable for the group is approximately $250 million. So that's easily manageable. And at the 31st of December, we still had $1.3 billion of cash at bank or on deposit. And now with this new revolving debt facility in place, we are progressively applying funds on deposit to repay redrawable debt. And finally, touching on other businesses' performance for the half, the earnings from associates were lower than last year and recorded a loss of $12 million.</p>
          <p>The loss was as a result of downward revaluations associated with Gresham Private Equity investments. It's worthwhile pointing out that the carrying value of these investments are required under accounting standards to be continually marked-to-market and that's based on current trading performance and in valuation multiples, and this has a tendency to make valuations quite volatile and we've seen that in a couple of businesses in this half. And it's important to note that these valuations are non-cash in nature and may not reflect the realisation of businesses at the end of their time in Gresham Private Equity.</p>
          <p>So they're largely an accounting adjustment. Interest revenue for the half was down on last year and this reflects lower cash on deposit during the period. Pleasingly, there were no non-trading items that were recorded in this half. And at the bottom of the table, in other, you can see a recorded loss of $37 million and this primarily reflects the group's self-insurance cap div where we increased provisions for asset damage and write downs from self-insurance following the severe weather events that occurred in the half.</p>
          <p>Group overheads for the half were flat at around $47 million. And for your information for the first time, we've combined group overheads and other businesses in the appendix for the segment notes.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll hand over to Richard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Terry. Just a couple of things on the flood and storm events and then outlook and we'll quickly get to questions. We've detailed on slide 63 the impacts as best we can currently estimate of the impacts of flood and storm events post the 31st of December and so they are &#x2013; we'll have write down of damaged plant, equipment and inventory in the retail businesses group, retail businesses of around $40 million to $50 million and business interruption costs of $30 million to $40 million.</p>
          <p>Now some of that may be recoverable for insurance over time, but time will tell on that. As Rob has mentioned, their claims for insurance will be $30 million to $35 million. And since the start of the year, the impact of flood events at Curragh has meant that we've taken our guidance of a high end of the range down from 6.7 million tonnes to 6.2 million tonnes. So there's about 0.5 million tonne impact on the Resources division based on weather events to date.</p>
          <p>So that's as best we can currently estimate the impact of flood and storm events. In terms of outlook, I think the divisional managing directors have commented pretty well on that. So let me just conclude outlook on slide 65 by saying, we continue to focus very much on growth in each of the businesses but very much with a long-term sustainable focus. So, we will continue to manage the group for the long term.</p>
          <p>And with that, we're happy to take questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Richard and team. Just perhaps a question on Coles. They highlighted a risk from rising input costs or food inflation. Can you just describe why you see it as such a risk for the Coles business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there's a combination of factors, Craig, both domestic and international. I think what we've seen over the last six months or so are rises in sort of global commodity prices which could impact on discussions that are going to take place for future price rises towards the second half and maybe into next year.</p>
          <p>So that's something just as a callout really, but the overall impact is difficult to predict at this stage. And obviously we've had the challenges domestically with regard to produce in particular where, even before the floods and the cyclone, the bad weather that was experienced, the wet weather that has been experienced, impacted on items such as apples and tomatoes and melons.</p>
          <p>So there's an issue in terms of quality but also in terms of availability as well. So that's seen prices push up. But what we've done is ensured that in other categories that we operate in, the price investment we put in has more than compensated for those inflationary factors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So just to be very clear, the risk for Coles would be that you wouldn't get full pass through or recovery of a cost increase through to retail prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I'm not saying that. I think that what we need to do is be mindful of the fact that there are rising commodity prices globally and they may have an impact in terms of pricing in Australia but how much or the extent of that time will tell.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. A second question just on Target. Obviously there was some margin pressure. I would be interested to understand how much of the margin contraction you could attribute to having to discount more versus a reduction in shelf prices or list prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's difficult to really split the two in the sense that we have experienced deflation and it's been very dramatic in the apparel, and that has really been the case for everyone within the market. But what really did aggravate it, as I said earlier on, was the poor seasonal sales, particularly in November and December when it was really relevant to such things as swimwear and beachwear which being seasonal has to be marked down, we can't carry them through.</p>
          <p>One of the things we're very conscious of doing is ensuring that we keep our stock clean and push out whatever needs to be done at the end of the season. What I also can say though is we have seen in fact an increase in our regular sales, as in regular prices, because we've done a lot of work on our first price right price, and as I've mentioned also previously we have dropped a number of items on like on like from a year ago down in price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll just maybe clarify there then, if you've dropped the price on a like for like item year on year, was it more than the movement in the currency and tariff reductions that you'd seen?</p>

          <p>What we did find is that our units were up and our customer count was up but they were not up sufficiently enough to cover the drop in price. So basically, yes, we were able to cover some of it through the benefit of the dollar but not all of it.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My first question relates to Bunnings. Despite only doing 1.7% like for like, a fairly soft number given their strong performance over many years, you were able to again expand sort of EBIT margins. I'm just curious about where do you think EBIT margins will settle and do you see the risk, as I think some of your Coles colleagues have highlighted, that the margins in Australia might be too high in food and liquor? Could not a similar suggestion be made about the margins in Bunnings at the moment where you've been able to expand them without having material I guess sort of volume growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Shaun. I didn't think I heard Ian talk about that, that you last mentioned, but perhaps you're referring to some of the other margin aspects. But look, I've said before that when we model our EBIT margins looking out for the long term, five plus years, we do model them declining modestly. We work very hard to get the best result we can and so it's always pleasant to outperform what we model.</p>
          <p>Where did the margin lift come from? Well, terrific merchandising work. That's why I spoke about the range reset project. Now, we've refined and decluttered our range, and that's unlocked space. We've brought new things in. The new things are very exciting; customers are responding to them. We've worked very hard on value.</p>
          <p>Deflation is an issue all over the place, but you either sell a lower quality item at a lower price or you get excited about how a high quality item has reduced and become more available, and we've been able to work really hard on some much higher quality items. But because of deflation, are at far more exciting price points, and you change your sales mix.</p>
          <p>That sort of work across our merchandising has been backed up by good in-store execution and has enabled us to fight some headwinds and turn the sort of sales growth we got into the earnings growth that we achieved.</p>
          <p>You did say the numbers were pretty soft. Well, we were comping some monsters, and I'm pretty pleased that we were able to build on it, quite frankly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you're not worried? Your EBIT margins are quite high relative to some of your peers in North America. I'm just curious about whether or not you're worried about how your EBIT margins looked compared to global peers. Obviously, there are some differences in the way they're applied, but they are quite high.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're quite proud of what we've been able to do with our business model in terms of returns and EBIT margins. It's really returns that we focused on, and EBIT margin's just a number that accountants look at. But, for us, returns is what we're quite pleased at. When we compare ourselves to our global peers, when we compare ourselves with some of the best performing businesses in the world, what we see is our cost of doing business is very good.</p>
          <p>We're working very hard to make that cost of doing business even better, and we're working very hard to arrange resets to make our cost, in terms of the product we're buying, even better, and we're working hard to arrange resets to create more space within our existing network so we can bring more products to market.</p>
          <p>A whole bunch of things are setting ourselves up to be able to achieve good returns over the long run, and if the good returns are supported by outcomes that have strong net margins, then so be it.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My second question relates to Coles EBIT, just essentially two housekeeping issues. One, why did depreciation in the broader Coles decline, and is there anything curious going on there or is it the reduction in CapEx? And then what was the release of the meat provision and when does that meat provision get exhausted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In relation to the depreciation, there's nothing peculiar going on. The key issues &#x2013; if we go back to about a year ago, a bit ahead of that &#x2013; in Coles, we had a fixed asset register that we inherited that was in a bit of a mess, and it's taken a long while to get identifiable assets, which we've now been able to do stocktakes. As a result of that, we wrote off some assets this time last year, and that's had a small, if you like, negative impact in those products not being depreciated in the following year. We've also, from time to time there's the odd asset that drops off the asset register, so it's really just a timing issue.</p>
          <p>In terms of the release of the meat contract, it was 24 in the half, so it's come down a bit from where it's run, and we expect it winds off in '15.</p>

          <p>Next question will come from Phil Kimber of Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question, Phil.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a question on the food and liquor business. You mentioned &#x2013; I think on the sales call &#x2013; that your basket size was increasing, which is a positive. But I wanted to get a sense of what's driving that. You've mentioned fresh but also your health and beauty and increased general merchandise sales. Are they having an equally big impact, or is it really the fresh food that's really driving that increase in basket size?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're seeing some good benefits coming through on health and beauty as well, subsequent to the range change we've made there, investment and value there, and also the new formats that we've retrofitted across the chain. So we're actually getting ticks in most of the boxes, so we're getting higher foot traffic, more customers are coming through, they're spending more with us as well, and we're getting a mixed benefit in the fact that we're getting more fresh food sales.</p>
          <p>So, more customers are coming into the store and are buying fresh with us. Our existing customer base are buying more fresh with us, and those who were buying fresh with us before are buying more as well. So there's higher levels of customer trust emerging in terms of the quality and value of our fresh food offered.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then a second question just on sourcing. You pointed out Kmart, but I'm interested across Kmart, Target and Bunnings. You've obviously got this difference between Aussie dollar benefits but also US dollar cost increases. Could you maybe flag by business how we should think about that going forward? At what point do the Aussie dollar benefits start to reduce and the US dollar price increases start to drive the outcome more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In our business, we're behind the eight ball in regards to the benefits in dollars, currently probably giving a lot of people, because of the hedging we've done out of the last six months. So, it'll be probably closer to May/June if the dollar still stays at parity that we'll get that benefit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the same for Target.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's about six months off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of, I think the other part of your question is about input costs. Target's seeing a bit more of that in terms of cotton and the like than the other businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we are seeing it coming through very strongly at the moment, particularly because we do a lot of 100% cotton and printed dresses and so on. So we are having to manage it. We're starting to see it in the back quarter of this financial year, but we're trying to retain our retail prices, but we are going to see it. It's an issue that every retailer will be facing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, so the Aussie dollar benefit are currently offsetting that and at some point won't? That's where I was going.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Phil, we've got a bit more benefit to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because we buy forward, if you like. So providing that dollar stays where it is then we'll have a bit of benefit to come. And as Launa said, but we are seeing some pressure at the moment, particularly on cotton. I don't think it'll have much of an impact at all in Kmart. So I'd say net benefit on exchange for Kmart, if it's important, and I don't think it's that important because prices are passed through reasonably quickly. And &#x2013; but Launa is flagging that the cotton price increases are fairly significant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think so just to build on that, I think you got to be realistic that you're not necessarily going to see that benefit banked because we'd be using that to try and hold the prices down and absorb some of the increases that we're going to see. And we're just going to have to manage it as we go forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and maybe I could just to add a Bunnings comment. Obviously cotton is not too much of a concern for us, but 40% of what you see in a Bunnings store is sourced locally; Australia or New Zealand. So if you're trying to model it, Phil, you need to take that into account. We see in past that, everyone is in the same boat. The market will sort this out as it has in many years past when the dollars moved one way or the other quite dramatically.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, afternoon all, just a question on Coles and CapEx. You're annualizing at about $600 million there. Is that only because you're not investing in property or is it that you're doing research cheaper? I'm just trying to get an understanding of where that's likely to go over the next few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think broadly, we'd anticipate our CapEx being pretty much in line where it has been. I think some of the differentials between the half last year and the half year this year are about phasing. But also we're looking to invest more in refurbishments, which we've done and obviously the renewal program still continues unabated.</p>
          <p>And we've become more efficient about some of the ways in which we've been sourcing product as well. And there are property aspects. You know there was a heavyweight toll of property acquisition in the first half last year than there was this year. So it's more in the sort of mix and phasing and it isn't anything material.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And just another one on the dividends. I notice that the payout ratio has been cut there from 70% odd to 64%. Should we infer that you're looking at a weaker second half versus last year? I'm just trying to get an understanding of why that's been cut?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think and Terry might want to add to this, Tom. But yeah, Wesfarmers typically has had &#x2013; its interim dividend has been an interim dividend. We'll see how the year pans out. We've said that we'll set dividends based on where we think the cash position of the company will be, what our free cash flow is, what our level of franking credits are, and given the impacts of the floods and the like and a pretty heavy capital year. I think when you're setting an interim dividend, you do so on a relatively cautious basis, so that's the way we've set it.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Afternoon all. Just a first question on Coles. Obviously there's been a lot about the impact of the price cuts in milk. I was just wondering if you could talk to whether you've seen a big kick in transactions post that initiative in terms of sort of a positive customer response?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have, we've seen a very strong positive response from customers. I mean what we're finding is, is that each time we're doing something which is in the customer's interest then it's engendering higher levels of customer trust. So a customer's perception of the Coles' value is improving all the time.</p>
          <p>So when we align pricing to a uniform state base pricing last year, it improved, obviously bringing down 5,000 prices on the Down Down price program of prices coming down and staying down has worked. Obviously identifying certain key items in the average Australian family basket every week also has an impact.</p>
          <p>So a combination of factors have actually seen our customer numbers improve significantly over time and obviously we've had an additional pick up on the back of milk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is it sort of to the extent that you saw over Christmas in terms of Australia the double digit type kicks in customer numbers or not quite to that magnitude?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't go into detail on it specific &#x2013; with regards to milk, but we've added about 2 million extra customers in the last three years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And second question, there's obviously a bit of talk around at the moment over in the WA sort of ammonium nitrate space. Can you talk to &#x2013; I suppose firstly there's some articles going around yesterday in terms of you guys having a look at Burrup? Just if there's any comment on that? And secondly, if you were to have a look at Burrup would that rule the expansion at Kwinana out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just on the first one. We're a manufacturer &#x2013; it's Tom O'Leary here. We're a manufacturer of ammonia in the state. It's a sector we know and we're very comfortable with and in fact about a six of the outputs from the Burrup plant is actually consumed in our AN plants in Kwinana. So I think it'd be pretty surprising if we weren't interested in it, and having a look at it at least. The second question I didn't -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just talk about what the ACCC allows.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. With the ACCC we've spoken to them as it's pretty typical when we are evaluating a possible acquisition, and so following that, they have initiated in the usual way a round of marketing enquiries with all the market participants and that's what you've seen in the last couple of days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's so, if there is any process, we start off on an equal footing with anyone else.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if you were to be successful down that path, would the expansion &#x2013; would you still look at the expansion at Kwinana or would you look to upgrade or I suppose convert the Burrup plant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. we would certainly continue with our expansion plans in Kwinana. As you'd expect before we settled on our plans to pursue the feed study into the expansion of our plant in Kwinana back in November 2009, we certainly considered alternative sites including the Pilbara in some detail.</p>
          <p>And it'll come as no surprise to those of you familiar with construction costs in WA, there's a very big cost differential in costs associated with plants in the Pilbara versus costs associated with construction in the South West. So in addition a new plant in the Pilbara would require a new pilling plant whereas what we're planning in Kwinana requires only a debottlenecking modification of the plant we commissioned in 2008.</p>
          <p>So our analysis indicates that a Pilbara based plant wouldn't be economic at current AN market prices, so we'd certainly continue with that current plans.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Ian, just a question for you. Is it possible for you to clarify what you mean about by the easy ordering now being in 600 stores? My impression was that that hadn't been switched on yet. So is it just the software that's gone in and you still need to complete training of the staff? So if you could just clarify that and also give some sort of timeline from here for incremental benefits to wastage and costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have been rolling out easy ordering for the past two years progressively through the state. So it's not as if we just switched it on wholesale to 600 and now we're training them. So it's been a progressive plan to make sure we embed the changes so that they stick. So we're very pleased with the progress that's been made. Stores are enjoying the new efficiency benefits that they're getting from the system and the progression will still continue. And obviously we've got some stores that are more advanced than others because frankly they've been on the system a bit longer.</p>
          <p>But we're already seeing in the ones that we've changed reductions in stockholding, improving in stock loss. We've seen reductions in waste, and improved availability for the customer, which is clearly important, and also improved productivity levels. So it's got multiple benefits for us and we'll continue to leverage that over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess given you did roughly 300 stores in the last half there are still some notable benefits to come through in the next 6 months to 12 months, is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Absolutely, we'd expect that to continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one more question, from you just on the Fly Buys acquisition that's been spoken about. Can you just talk about where the strategy goes from here in terms of customer engagement? Can you just talk a bit about what's broken with the system currently, and where the opportunities are?</p>
          <p>Also just a comment on, you've got Woolworths and a number of other retailers that have been developing their own loyalty programs for a number of years now. Do you think that that market is somewhat saturated with existing programs at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well Fly Buys isn't broken, there are over 10 million people that have got Fly Buys cards. And in terms of value, if you use the card with a GE source card in Coles and if you spend $30 you get 24 points whereas competitor schemes you get nothing.</p>
          <p>If you spend $50 you get 40 points and in competitor schemes you get half that. So I think it offers value. But what was the really important thing for us though was that where you have mixed ownership on something like this, then leveraging it to full effect is somewhat constrained. And therefore, having control of it solely with Coles now we are more in charge of our own destiny. So that gives us opportunity and scope to leverage the product further and look to see how we might develop further value for consumers and then move it on into other aspects from there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So where do you see the opportunities specifically now that you do have control of the whole business yourselves?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we are not going into detail on this, we have obviously got plans for it, otherwise we wouldn't have acquired it. But it has taken quite some time to move to sole ownership but we have got plans to improve it and they will manifest themselves over time.</p>
          <p>What I will say, and I've always said, this is that the most important thing for Coles in the early stage of the turnaround is to be in a position where we're delivering better value to customers. That meant lower prices. And we've been successful so far in achieving that, and the focus on value will remain.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Just a couple of questions further to the question on Easy Order. Just wondering, I think you've mentioned in the past that the most significant benefits will come when you have the DCs on Easy Order as well. Just wondering if you can give us some sense as to the timing of when those DCs will also have that capability? And secondly in terms of the coal production cost increases of 19%, is all of that to do with the weather? I'm just trying to get a sense for what's weather and what's some cost inflation type thing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, clearly, we have to get critical mass of the Easy Ordering into the stores first in order to effect the same level of benefits out of the DCs. But now we're in that position we can now start to look at moving the DCs onto their system, and we can move that more rapidly. So we'd expect the DCs to be on by the end of this calendar year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think the guidance is for it all to be done by the end of fiscal year '12. Are you suggesting potentially that that might be &#x2013; you might do that by the end of this calendar year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not on the stores, I think that we can move &#x2013; because we'll have critical mass by then, but it will be a small tail that will go out to FY12, but we are working hard to move all the stores across to it. But what we want to do is make sure that we don't rush anything. It's always really important when you're putting these systems in, if you take your time, and you do it in a controlled way, and you do it in a way in which the stores and the organization can digest. So we're very happy with the way it's been implemented so far. We'll still take our time.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Emily, Stewart here. Just in relation to your question on costs. As you know the costs were up 19.9% for the half, and that follows on from a reduction in costs last year of 9%. It's fair to say that the key contributing factor was the record rainfall that we had in central Queensland during the first half, where we had three major flood events in September and two in December. And if you look at the increase in costs, the production impact was around about 10% to 12% of that 19% increase.</p>
          <p>And the remaining 7% was due to underlying increasing costs associated with more truck and shovel overburden removal as opposed to drag line. And that was, once again, due to wet weather, but where we had to reschedule more truck and shovel because of water in the pits; and also due to increased input costs, such as fuel, explosives and contractors. At the November Curragh operational update, I flagged that we thought that the cost for the half would come up by 15%, so we came in at 19.9%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you would expect those sorts of cost increases in the June half as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's going to be hard to bring that down in the second half. If you look at the production and sales numbers for the half year, they're around about 3.1 million tons to 3.2 million tons for that half. If you look at the guidance I've given already of 5.8 to 6.2, that means that if you look at the midpoint of that, production's going to be down by 400. If you look at the low end, the lower guidance, it will be down by 600 in the second half. So there will be some further production impacts on costs.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello all, a couple of quick ones for me. If I look at Insurance, Rob, you don't cover floods up in Queensland, but I've noticed in the past that you have sometimes given ex gratia payments to your policy holders who have been affected by floods. Are you looking at that, and is that included in your $30 million to $35 million expense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, David, just on flood, a couple of years ago we introduced some limited flood cover which allowed a sub limit of up to $10,000 or $20,000 on a number of household and contents policies which just went some way towards helping policy holders out with some initial clean up costs, and a bit of work if there was some river and flood damage.</p>
          <p>We have had quite a number of claims that have hit those sub limits, particularly across Queensland and Melbourne. The $35 million that we signaled really relates to two lots of hitting our maximum event retention of $11 million, plus reinstatement costs in the order of about $13 million. That's where we get to the $35 million. It's not our intention to be making ex gratia payments. We look at each and every claim on a case by case basis, based on the policy's terms and conditions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So when you look at your policies compared to Suncorp, who's the major insurer up in Queensland and who do cover floods, are you concerned therefore if you don't make some ex gratia payments that you'll actually lose customers to Suncorp?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've been through quite an education process with a lot of our clients on what's covered, and what's not covered. We feel that we're doing quite a good job of managing the claims for our clients. We've had well over 7,000 claims across Australia. A lot of those relate to flood, storm and cyclone events, and we think we're doing a good job meeting the claims expectations of our clients.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Terry, just following on I think it was from Shaun's question on depreciation in coal. I'll expand that to all divisions. It looks as though your depreciation expense was flat for the Group for this half versus previous half, despite the fact that you've put an extra just under a billion dollars worth of capital investment. Now, I recognize that some of that's going to be land, particularly in Bunnings, but it's not all going to be land. I'm intrigued as to why your depreciation expense actually hasn't moved, and on a potentially sales basis is down 30 bps.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I'm not sure percentage of sales would be the way that I'd be looking at depreciation, but in relation &#x2013; I think in relation to the divisions we've put a split there of the land and buildings that are out. And you can see that's quite a large amount. You can also see that in relation to a lot of the CapEx, David, in resources, for instance you've got big work-in-progress amounts as we go and, if you like, construct an asset that might take you 12 months to construct.</p>
          <p>So I think you've got to look at construction time frames as well as within those PP&amp;E amounts, because you're going to have big whip swings, and I think the only thing we can say in terms of across those divisions you mentioned, is there's been no change in depreciation practices or policies in relation to our group policies. So it is what it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So would I be correct, then, in saying that the &#x2013; for example the significant increase that we're seeing in Bunnings capital employed is primarily land or stores that are in construction at the moment?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, all. Richard, my question is on &#x2013; I suppose, to Stewart Butel, on coal, and the ability to be able to participate in what may be a price spike between, say, April and June. I think I heard him say that he's got some carryover tonnes he has to deliver into, and I'm trying to get an understanding as to what the volume schedule is likely to look like at Curragh, when they'll be able to get back up to a reasonable production level, and what the arrangements are with customers in delivering inter-prices that could potentially spike?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You can be sure we're asking the same question, David. But I'll hand over to Stewart.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'll answer that in two parts, David, and thanks for the question. As you know, that I've indicated in the slide pack that the full impact on &#x2013; of the flooding will happen in this March quarter, and &#x2013; so looking at that, we'll have deliveries at Q &#x2013; this current quarter that won't be delivered in this current quarter, so that will go into Q4. And we're currently under force majeure at the moment with our customers. And as we lift force majeure, as we get back to full production, there will be a negotiation on what carryover tonnage would apply, and also clearly what the coal prices will be for Q4, and for the annual tonnage that settles at that same time. Our best estimate at the moment is that we'll have carryover into Q4, and that will be approximately four to six weeks of production. So, that's somewhere between a third and a half of Q4 sales will be at carryover prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So do you get the &#x2013; like say &#x2013; let's just pick a number, say the price spikes to $400 for that quarter, and I'm not suggesting that's what it will be, but let's just call it that, does that mean that you only get a half a quarter's tonnage at that price, and then it finishes, or does that then carry over into the next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, each quarter is based on an agreed volume. So, say it is agreed at, I'd say, a $250 number, David, just getting a bit more pessimistic on coal prices, say it's $250, then that $250 would apply for the &#x2013; say, in this case, if it's six weeks of carryover, the second half of Q4 -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...and would extend into Q1 of next year for half of Q1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And given that the market's fairly tight &#x2013; I mean, not that you want to do your customers, but suppliers are in a pretty good condition here, aren't they, and you're all in the same boat with this carryover tonnage situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yet. Look, I suppose my comment on the market, David, to be a bit more specific, is the market is very, very tight at the moment, as you can imagine. All of the Queensland export metallurgical coal producers have been impacted by this major flood event and cyclone Yasi. At the same time, we're seeing Canadian producers, particularly Teck with quite a lot of industrial problems with production, and production out of Russia is also impacted as well. So, coal is very, very tight.</p>
          <p>The only producer out there that's probably got excess capacities is the U.S. We are seeing very, very strong demand from all our traditional customers in this &#x2013; since over the last 12 months, there's been new production come online in Korea, Taiwan and Brazil. And at the moment spot prices are very healthy, in the case of high coking coal they're up around $350 to $380.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the outlook looks very positive. But as I said before, we're yet to roll into that price negotiation. That will happen before the end of March, and that will ultimately set the marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Stewart. And my second question, before I get cut off, is to Launa, and I suppose to Guy, but I was a little bit, Launa, taken aback by the 26% drop in profit. I knew it was a very tough half for you, but your gross margin was down, yet Kmart's gross margin was up. I was a little bit perplexed as to why one could be down and one could be up.</p>
          <p>I suppose my question, Launa, is how much of the drop in the EBIT was a factor of &#x2013; you probably over earned last year, and it's coming back to more normal levels, but how much of that was due to that fact, and how much was due to maybe tough trading conditions? And was there anything in the half that maybe you didn't do well that you could probably have done better, that you might do better going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. So, I'll firstly break that into three parts. Firstly, I'm first to acknowledge that the great result last year was a phenomenal anomaly. And I do remember calling out to you that it was a wonderful result, but I didn't think we could do it again. Putting that aside, there's a number of issues. The biggest one for us has been deflation, and it's been particularly obvious in our apparel, which of course for our business that's our key competencies for Target. But as I said earlier, it has been right across the whole business.</p>
          <p>And secondly, we found we were very badly hit with our real seasonal stock, particularly ladies' wear, which is very important for us. And I have to say, David, some of that was due to probably our own making, not necessarily with the range not necessarily being ideal. We also did take a punt on a couple of things, because we had had an out of stock some real high seasonal products the previous year, we actually made the decision to back it a little bit more when it came to things like beach towels, deck chairs, a bit more swimwear, which unfortunately didn't pay dividends this time. The weather went against us, and particularly where a lot of that product is driven by Queensland for us.</p>
          <p>So, there was an element of some of it beyond our control, but also, I have to say, possibly some of it our own making that maybe we just didn't get the range 100% right, and we probably also were a little over optimistic initially.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Just a maybe quick question in relation to Coles EBIT margins. Another strong result, but you've had in the first half of this year stronger comparable sales growth, but at the same time you mention in your outlook statement that the competitive environment is becoming an issue, that you've actually separated out, which you haven't done before. I would have imagined that the level of competition hasn't changed in its intensity in the last 12 months, but are you suggesting that it has increased in the last six months, or is it going to increase further from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the market's always been competitive, but clearly our results are an outperformance of the market, and I would expect people to recognize that and look to claw back some additional sales growth, perhaps early expense. What I have said in the past is that there's 30,000 competitors out there, not just one or two, and our strategy has been about driving value and driving quality in fresh foods as well. So, I think that it's always important as a retailer to be cognizant of market changes and competitive impact, but it's also to remain focused on your underlying strategy.</p>
          <p>And what we've endeavored to do right the way through here is focus on value to get customers through the door, increase sales, fractionalize costs, utilize the efficiencies that we're gaining now back to investing further and try to deliver further sales growth on the back of that. And the combination of the sales growth that were coming through and improved efficiencies is leading us to the position where we're growing comparable store sales, but also have an option to improve profitability as well. And that's been part of our plan. And we know that things will get tougher, but we're being resolute to improve further going forward.</p>

          <p>Okay. And just in relation to easy ordering, you've progressed very well rolling it out within the Coles stores. At the end of FY '12, will you look to extend easy ordering into the department stores, and potentially into Bunnings? Is that an option?</p>

          <p>We measure ROC on a rolling 12 basis Richard and at the moment we haven't completed a major sale and lease-back transaction since the 2007 transaction. These things are lumpy. You'd love to do it in a way that you could match it perfectly, but you have to be very cognizant to market conditions, particularly for sale and lease-back. Whereas on the acquisition side, the significant change that occurred in the property sector post the GFC meant that we weren't able to really use developers and the developers lacked the capital to develop our stores.</p>
          <p>That's a negative but a bigger positive actually came up which was that more sites were available at really quite exciting prices and we've worked very hard since that 2008 timeframe to take that opportunity and you're really starting to see the fruit of that work coming through and our property team is doing a terrific job. And the pace we've got on building our store pipeline's really quite exciting because the quality of it &#x2013; the sort of sites we've got and what we're able to execute when we bring big stores on &#x2013; is very exciting.</p>
          <p>Hopefully with some more sale and lease-back transactions now that there seems to be some more appetite for that across the market will see us manage our capital better so that we get our ROC going in the right direction matching what we're doing in terms of earnings and other business performance.</p>

          <p>Okay. The second question is to you, Ian. You referred to the management strength and depth at Coles. Can you give any sort of comment around the &#x2013; I guess the longevity of that? What I'm interested in to get a sense for is obviously there's been a lot of publicity around what level, say within your top 200 managers at Coles had been imports, how long are they able to stay for, how long do you think they'll stay or what's the mix of Aussies versus ex-pats in the top 200?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, let me take that initially and then I'll hand over to Ian. I think it's completely irrelevant what the mix might be because it depends that we're talking first generation, second generation or fifth generation.</p>

      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I'll answer a little bit crudely. Richard, really what I wanted to get at is, you're saying there's management strength and depth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there is.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's today, how are we placed on a three and five-year route?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're placed superbly well because what Ian and the team have done &#x2013; one of the things we said when we first acquired Coles was we need to build a world-class top management team. We've done that but importantly and what people haven't had a lot of visibility on is that team has now put in place an exceptional team below it and further through the organization.</p>
          <p>And we've got those people from all over the place including Australia but importantly they've been recruited based on their competency and based on their desire to come to Australia and be part of the turnaround which we indicated to the market at the time of the acquisition in order to get time from the capital market to effect a sustained turnaround &#x2013; was a five-year turnaround.</p>
          <p>But in our mind this is a 15 to 20 year project and I think for the vast majority of people who've joined Coles they've joined it as a career project and they intend to be here for a long time.</p>
          <p>I'm not certain we've got limitations on timeframes for any of the employees we've got in Coles but Ian can take it from there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, Richard's pretty much said everything as well. I mean, really we're not that interested in employing people for short-term positions. We're in for developing the business for the long-term. I think Wesfarmers' track record is one where they hold assets for a long period of time and the whole point about the turnaround was a timeframe of five years was set because that realistically was how long it was going to take to turn around basically two decades of decay.</p>
          <p>And in this kind of environment that would be a reasonable timeframe to expect. It's not just a question of getting to give years and then the job being done. This is a long-term program to rebuild a sustainable business and a great brand and we're pleased with the progress that we're making and I'm delighted with the quality of people that go into the organization from whatever country and they're here for the long haul.</p>
          <p>A lot of people that have come internationally are actually seeing it as a lifestyle change as well and an opportunity to grow and develop their careers and clearly whilst we've started to make some progress then there's broader levels of interest about people coming in and joining the organization because they see the opportunities both for themselves in terms of professionally but also in terms of living in Australia. Even Melbourne for a Scot actually is a pretty nice place to be.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the meat contract we did not. I mean, useful life is not an adjustment because a useful life effectively was assets that weren't in, if you like, IT assets that were still in WIP that we effectively adjusted on completion. There's an amount in there but it's just depreciation and its consistent depreciation and it's not relevant to call it out and adjust it against previous periods because it wasn't there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I get the answer. My second question is to Ian. Ian, I wonder if there's any limitations to the use of the half price KVI strategy and the limitations, I'm wondering whether you'd discuss would be declining velocity uplift from &#x2013; as your cycle when you first introduce them, compromising trust of customers going forward or just even the financial burden of using such a strategy?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Any investments we make, Greg, are carefully planned and considered over a period of time. So I wouldn't like to give the impression that this is something that we thought up on a Monday and implemented on Tuesday. We've been very careful about our overall plan for two and three years and that will continue. What we are seeing is we've been rewarded with the changes that we've made and the improvements that we've made and it's broadening the customer base, it's broadened the basket base.</p>
          <p>And therefore, everything that we're doing is considered both in terms of the impact it has on that product category and also what we expect to happen in the basket and the overall foot traffic. So we're very pleased with the progress that we're making and the investments we're making and where we're putting them.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. My question's for Ian. Just in regards to Coles, when do you see EBIT margin expansion as a bigger contributor to EBIT growth rather than the very strong sales growth that you're getting because I'm conscious that you're only generating a return on capital of 7.1%. Dollar EBIT is going to be a key catalyst to get you there but eventually I can't see you getting to your cost of capital to a decent return on capital unless you get some still significant margin expansion. So when do you think margin expansion will be a bigger driver than sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I've never given an indication about where our ultimate EBIT margin will get to but clearly as we go through the program, there's an expectation that margin will continue to improve and we're well aware of that and that's what we'd expect to see happen. In terms of the mix on sales growth, I wouldn't necessarily get the two of them confused because nobody really knows what's going to happen to inflation going forward or the overall cycling of where you are.</p>
          <p>What's important is the underlying health of the business and as a result of the changes that we've been making, we're getting improvements in efficiencies and we've still got more to come. So we're pretty confident that we can continue to improve our profitability over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shaun, we're really focused on EBIT dollars and obviously for the transaction cash generation over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I mean I think that's part of the reason for the question. I mean to grow your EBIT dollars you're going to need to expand margins as well. Maybe another metric; how do you guys see the 7.1% return on capital where you need to be now that you've gone over the halfway mark of the five year sort of turnaround? Is that sort of ahead of where you're expecting? Below? How do you see that 7.1% return on capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And maybe &#x2013; I mean that's maybe more than what I thought and then there's the $30 million to $40 million business interruption on top of that. Can you give a sense of how many stores have actually been impacted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you've just got to look at the photos of stores like a lot of our stores around Emerald which were completely immersed in water to realize it doesn't take too many of those. I think there were all up 70 something stores in the group that were impacted by the floods and we've still got a number, a handful or so, that aren't open across Coles and Bunnings I think. So I mean we've got a Target store in Emerald that's in a warehouse somewhere now. So if you think about the network we've got in that part of the world it was a fairly significant impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the $30 million to $40 million is the business interruption, why they're getting &#x2013; not open. Once they're opened that doesn't then include any of the business interruption? Obviously the store might be open but people have still got other issues going on and can't get to the store, so I just wasn't sure how you define business interruption.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this stage, it would cover everything but not normal trading. So that's the best way to describe it, so it would be broader than what you've just referred to there. And supply chain has been a big &#x2013; particularly in Coles has been a big, if you like additional cost because of obviously a lot of the roads being inaccessible and having to use alternate sources which are often expensive.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there, just looking at the Coles and the Bunnings businesses in particular, can you give us an indication please as to how much of your EBIT margin improvement was gross margin-related versus cost of doing business-related? Was it more weighted towards one than the other in each business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not going to really go into great detail on that, David, but I think that all I will do is point to what I've said before which is we're looking to improve our costs of doing business. Clearly, there were opportunities for us to look at levels of investment and price that were supported by supplier base and also supported by ourselves, so there's a combination there.</p>
          <p>So in overall terms there's a mix effect which is actually borne out now really driving higher levels of efficiency out of the business that we can continue to invest. Clearly if suppliers are seeing broad levels of volumes coming out of the organization as a result of what we're doing then they themselves are more prepared to invest in that change as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to add to what Ian said, there's a similar flavor inside Bunnings. I'd point also to driving the productivity loop very hard. We've created a lot of additional value very purposely. That has a deflationary impact but it also makes your cost base work harder and that gives you good productivity gains. And with the volumes you're able to generate, that gives a much stronger bond with the suppliers that are participating. So it's a combination of good things that sort of flow around a halo effect really as you can get that working for you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Thanks. Just a quick one. Looking at the differing performances of Target and Kmart, I'm just wondering whether the respective business leaders there sort of compare foot traffic through shopping centres and if there's any evidence that suggests that there was actually less foot traffic in shopping centres or the performance of the brands is really a function of the brand rather than activity in the shopping centre?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, it's really difficult to comment on that. It depends to an extent by a shopping centre. I know Guy has some very good foot traffic and we certainly have seen an increase in customers coming into our stores but it's been also driven by states and it's been inconsistent and a lot of it, of course, is dependent on the weather. Guy, do you want to comment on that?</p>

          <p>I haven't seen any reduction in foot traffic in the shopping centres. There's a big parcel of stores that Kmart have got that are freestanding on their own with Coles that used to be part of the super centres. So those particular stores are growing at a similar rate to the ones that are inside the shopping centres as well. So I think the consumer's out there shopping and, as everyone's been pointing out around the table, they're shopping for value.</p>

          <p>Hi guys, just a quick on Kmart's inventory. I think there was a comment that suggested that inventory had increased. Obviously direct sourcing's an impact but given lower price points, deflation from Aussie dollar benefits, can you just give some sense as to why it's increased?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a lot more volume going through the stores, Craig, with the focus on -now that we've got out of all the products that we've been talking about in the last 12 months, the big and bulky loss makers and high end products in the range, our volume has increased significantly. And we are sourcing significantly more product ourselves from our own sourcing agent in China and Bangladesh and Hong Kong. So there's a lot more stock that we &#x2013; not significantly a lot more but more stock that we need to hold, especially on the water to ensure that we've got the correct amount of volume that our customers are putting into their baskets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. But stock turns would be up if your volumes are so much stronger but you're obviously holding more safety stock at the moment. Is there an opportunity for this inventory to come down over the next 18 months or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean what you saw in the last 12 months was a significant drop in inventory as we changed or switched models, if you like, in a period of the year. We're learning how to operate this everyday low price model and, at the same time, reducing costs. So I think we've got a little bit of a buffer in there because we're not relying on local suppliers to carry that inventory in their warehouses here in Australia.</p>
          <p>So there might be a little bit extra. But I'd rather saw that the good part about that inventory, it's good stock and because we're focusing on everyday items it's not special promotional stock. It's products that consumers want which is perfect with our strategy of everyday items for their homes that they need for their homes and for their families.</p>
