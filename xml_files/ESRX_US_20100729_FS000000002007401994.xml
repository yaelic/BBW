          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to David Myers, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and welcome, everyone, to our Second Quarter Conference Call. With me today are George Paz, our Chairman and CEO, and Jeff Hall, our CFO.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I need to read the following Safe Harbor statement. Statements or comments made on this conference call may be forward-looking statements and may include, but are not necessarily limited to, financial projections or other statements of the company's plans, objectives, expectations or intentions. These matters involve certain risks and uncertainties.</p>
          <p>The company's actual results may differ significantly from those projected or suggested and any forward-looking statement due to a variety of factors, which are discussed in detail in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
          <p>For clarity purposes, all numbers we talk about today will be on an adjusted basis. Please refer to the tables in our press release for the reconciliation of GAAP to the adjusted numbers we will be discussing. The reconciliation of EBITDA to net income can also be found in our earnings release. Our earnings release is posted on our website at express-scripts.com.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'll turn the call over to Jeff who will discuss our second quarter results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David.</p>
          <p>We plan to keep our prepared comments brief as we've already published a lot of data and we believe the question-and-answer session provides a better opportunity to address your questions and our thoughts and strategies.</p>
          <p>In summary, we had another strong quarter. All of our metrics are positive and moving in the right direction. Earnings and margins were up. Cash flows were strong. We're raising the bottom end of our guidance and we now have more than 50% of the WellPoint lives migrated onto our system. Given this strong performance, we remain confident in both the short and long-term prospects for our core PBM business and our ability to realize more than $1 billion of incremental EBITDA from NextRx.</p>
          <p>Moving on to a few more details on the quarter. We reported second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.60, an increase of 33% over last year. This increase was driven by EBITDA, which grew 46% from the prior year and 6% sequentially as a result of strong operating performance in the core business and the NextRx acquisition.</p>
          <p>Metrics for the quarter were solid across the board. Adjusted claims grew over 51%, reaching 189 million, mainly reflecting the addition of NextRx, but also the results of a successful selling season. Gross profit was up 31% over last year and gross profit for Rx increased 7% sequentially to $4.11.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we expect our strong performance in the core business and the realization of synergy will result in improving gross margins for the remainder of the year and into 2011.</p>
          <p>As expected, SG&amp;A spending increased from Q1 levels as we continue to vest in our future. We continue to expect that SG&amp;A, excluding amortization and nonrecurring items, will be between 865 and 881 million for 2010. EBITDA per adjusted Rx reached $3.10, up sequentially from $2.92 last quarter.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations was up 197% from last year, to 688 million. Cash flow was in line with our forecast, and is on track to exceed $2 billion for the year.</p>
          <p>As a result of our strong operating fundamentals and positive outlook, we are raising the low end of our EPS guidance range for the year. 2010 EPS is now expected to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.50, representing growth of 25 to 27% on an adjusted basis.</p>
          <p>We expect to give initial 2011 guidance with the release of Q3 earnings later this fall. Until then, let me reiterate what I said at the beginning of the call. Given our strong performance year-to-date and the market factors we are seeing today, we remain confident in both the short and long term prospects for our business, our ability to grow margins throughout the year and into 2011, and that we will realize more than 1 billion of incremental EBITDA from NextRx.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn it over to George.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>Our second quarter financial results reflect the strong fundamental performance of our core PBM business. We remain on track to complete the integration of NextRx on the lower end of 12 to 18 months with over 50% of our members already migrated onto our systems.</p>
          <p>In addition to our integration activity, we have begun working with WellPoint on cultivating our alliance and deploying next generation strategies and innovative programs to enhance the healthcare value we deliver to our members. Although the selling season is not yet complete, I will give you a preliminary indication of our progress. In 2010, we have seen high retention rates by incumbent PBMs for signature accounts. We define signature accounts as those with 1 million or more adjusted prescriptions per year. However, we also see significant opportunities to gain share in the smaller to middle markets.</p>
          <p>Consistent with previous years, we have made decisions not to bid or renew certain accounts. We focus our efforts towards those clients that share our commitment to take the waste out of healthcare while improving health outcomes for their members.</p>
          <p>With our unique tools and aligned business model, we can significantly reduce client expense, improve patient healthcare, and create value for our shareholders. We accomplish this with our clients when we are aligned both clinically and economically.</p>
          <p>For example, we chose not to renew a few NextRx direct clients, including a major retailer. Because of their preference for management of the pharmacy benefit was not consistent with our approach, we made this decision. Our past experience has taught us that these types of arrangements do not deliver value for our clients, and can also hinder our ability to leverage economies of scale and dilute the value of our overall offering for the rest of our book of business.</p>
          <p>I should point out, in the early 2000s, this retailer was a client of Express Scripts. When it came up for renewal back then, we also elected not to renew it.</p>
          <p>When we performed due diligence on NextRx, we specifically evaluated all of the direct contracts. We knew a few of these contracts were managed in a manner that did not align with our approach and philosophy. As such, we assumed these clients would terminate, and when we calculated our purchase price and run-rate EBITDA, we calculated those terminations in those numbers.</p>
          <p>Although we decided not to renew certain clients, to date, we've made substantial progress with our overall renewal efforts. At this point, we are more than halfway complete with our 2011 renewals. We anticipate by the end of the year we will have client retention consistent with our historical norms of about 95%.</p>
          <p>To date, we're having another strong sales year. We're ahead of last year's pace and have added over 140 clients, including two new signature wins. As a result of the strong selling season so far and strong operating performance in all aspects of our business, we currently expect 2011 claims to be flat to slightly up compared to the 2010 claims. We also expect EBITDA per claim to increase through 2011. We will continue to update you as the selling season progresses.</p>
          <p>In the midst of a tough economy and the impact of high drug trends, our tools are more in demand than ever before. Throughout our history, we have identified and tackled inefficiencies in healthcare. From the early days, where our primary tools were rebates and retail network management, we evolved with innovative tools to drive greater use of generics and low cost brands and increase the use of home delivery. We will continue to evolve by focusing on those issues which are driving up the healthcare costs for our clients, both today and in the future. Namely, adherence and specialty management are the focus of their needs today and are a focus of our clinical programs.</p>
          <p>Our ability to manage trend coupled with our expertise in consumerology provides us with the ability to drive out waste for our clients, improve outcomes for patients and deliver increased earnings to our shareholders. As just stated earlier, we remain positive on the underlying trends and opportunities in our space and remain confident in our ability to improve health outcomes and drive out waste, meeting the needs of our clients, lowering costs, and generating exceptional value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'd like to open it up to questions. Operator?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much and good morning.</p>
          <p>George, as we talked about last quarter around pricing, can you maybe just give us an update if anything has changed in your mind over the last couple of months on the pricing front, number one?</p>
          <p>And then number two, as you talk about the new clients that you've signed, maybe can you just give us some indication as to what plan design looks like? If we're looking at scripts roughly flattish but you're saying EBITDA per script is going be up. Are you seeing people do more step therapy, more mail, et cetera, in your new book of business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From a pricing perspective, and we did talk about this last quarter, I've been at this business since &#x2013; came in at the end of 1997. Been here throughout '98 and forward.</p>
          <p>Pricing has always been extremely aggressive. And I remember back in 1998 addressing this question. I think in those days, our EBITDA per script was about $0.70.</p>
          <p>And when you think about where we sat then, and clients' need to take cost out of the equation, there's two ways you can go about it. If you have a business model which is ineffectual, that doesn't deliver needs to the client, then effectively what you have to do is you have to give up your price because you don't have the clinical tools and the expertise to take out cost.</p>
          <p>On the other side of that equation, though, if in fact you have clinical tools and you have the ability to drive out cost, the much better item is to get people into generics, into home delivery, into lower-cost brand where we can share rebates back with our clients and drive down their costs. And everybody wins in that equation. The clients save money, the patients save money, and we make more money.</p>
          <p>And that's again around our model of alignment. We put our profits into those second tier brand of products that save money for our clients, are more efficacious. We put our profits &#x2013; or even greater levels of our profits into the generic products. And of course, mail, which is the winner for everybody in the equation, as you get better health outcomes and lower cost, is also our highest profit margin items.</p>
          <p>So as long as we keep that model strong, the best way we can take out cost is not to focus on our pricing, but instead to focus on the clinical programs that drive those prices.</p>
          <p>We've got over 95% retention with our book of business. The reason I believe that exists is because we go in, year in and year out, and effectively show our clients &#x2013; and we hold ourselves accountable to a scorecard, where we show what overall drug trends are doing across the industry, what drug trends are in their specific industry, and then what it is for them. And when we're doing our job right, their trends are lower than other companies in their industry, and they're lower than the overall PBM industry.</p>
          <p>So I do believe that approaching pricing properly does not mean it's a win-lose situation, the client versus the PBM. It's a win-win. When you have an effective model such as ours, that focuses on the economic behaviors of our members, and behavioral economics, to say it more appropriately, we can drive out those costs, and we can have it a win-win for all three constituents, the members, the plan sponsors, and for us.</p>
          <p>As far as our wins, keep in mind, we're saying that we are going be flat to slightly up on claims next year. But that takes into consideration the loss of a major retailer and another client that &#x2013; another direct client that was part of the deal that came over with us, that we also knew the way they approached it was not in line with us.</p>
          <p>Just talking about the retailer for a moment. Keep in mind the way that one works. It's adjudication only, and 95% of the volume only goes through their stores. Well, in that situation, where's the leverage? What value do you get in signing up a client like that? Obviously, they don't want clinical programs. They want everything dirt-cheap. They don't want any intrusion by us in driving better health outcomes.</p>
          <p>That's not that way our company's put together. That's not the way we manage, and that's not the way we train our employees. So to try to carve out and do one-offs for clients like that creates tremendous inefficiencies inside of our operations and technology components of our business, and it's just not worth it, especially just to adjudicate a claim.</p>
          <p>So what we do is we are willing to jettison those type of clients and sign on clients that are looking at either &#x2013; have strong three tier systems, that have a passion for trying to drive out costs. We sign up clients that have two tiers but the management team is dealing with a tough labor situation where they're confined by a labor contract, which doesn't allow them to go to three tier or make big differentials between generics and brands. Well, we have the tools through consumerology to go in and, without changing plan designs, to drive higher generic fill rates, to drive higher mail penetration, and the unions buy into that. And they allow us to take cost out for our clients and meet their needs, and therefore drive our profits.</p>
          <p>When we get clients lined up like that, our scale grows. Scale, in and of itself, doesn't matter unless it's aligned scale going after the right metrics in order to drive overall profitability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. So what you're saying is that it's just more of the same for 2011? You're not really seeing much as far as changes go, George, in what people are looking for from plan design? So that they're basically looking to Express Scripts for all the things you just talked about, rather than making big plan design changes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would tell you every client's different, Lisa. So what we see in some situations, is a client will have taken on a step therapy program. And once we get huge utilization in the preferred product, then what a client may do in the following year is eliminate the &#x2013; a drug off the tier, in order to get even better economics.</p>
          <p>So we see people constantly &#x2013; and that's our job, is for our account management team and our clinical pharmacists to sit down with those clients and help them work with their book of business and the situation they're in, and tweak it.</p>
          <p>So hopefully, for all of our clients, we are constantly tweaking plan design with them in order to drive the desired benefits and minimize employee disruption. Because especially in today's environment, where HR departments have been cut back, they don't want employee noise. And so I think our tools are designed to get them to those results while minimizing that noise. I think that's the reason it works.</p>
          <p>And again, if drug trends are running 7, 8% and we can deliver zero to minus 1%, we've done a pretty effective job. And therefore, price concessions aren't nearly as important.</p>
          <p>Having said all that, keep in mind, no client has ever called me on the phone and offered me more money the following year to increase their &#x2013; to walk away from discounts. So our job is to figure out how do we drive those discounts and drive those costs, and still do what we do each and every quarter for our shareholders, which is drive up our profitability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then just one follow-on. Jeff, did I hear you correctly that now you expect free cash flow for the year to be north of $2 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's correct. We expect cash flow for the year to be above 2 billion, but to be fair, I think we said exactly the same thing last quarter, Lisa.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next we will go to Robert Willoughby with Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>George, on some of those NextRx clients that you've walked away from, how does this jive with the guaranteed claims number that you have with WellPoint? Are these numbers &#x2013; have these claims been excluded from day one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, we're looking for strong relationships with our partners. And we believe that WellPoint is a great partner. And so when we went in, we knew these would go away, so we never wanted to include them in the calculation. That wouldn't be fair to them, and it wouldn't be fair to do in general. So we excluded them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just &#x2013; you've obviously bought stock back at some higher levels here than where the stock is today. Might the share repurchases going forward take a different form, more front-end loaded or overnight repurchases of some sort? Or any changes in how you're going about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've always had the same philosophy towards the use of our cash flow. Strategic opportunities will always come first. But we weigh those against the options.</p>
          <p>So once we look at those, we then look at investing in our self. But as you know, our business is not all that capital intensive. And then the third option is share repurchase. And you've seen our behavior for the last 12 years. So I think that speaks for itself.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, George.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And next we will go to the line of Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. So just to be clear, George, when you're talking about not renewing, obviously these are things that you didn't even bid on. Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, the one big retailer, we didn't bid on that. There was no sense in bidding on that.</p>
          <p>It takes &#x2013; I don't know if you've ever been part of a PBM or seen what a proposal looks like, but we're talking thousands of drugs, and a lot of plans have multiple divisions, and so you have different plan designs for different divisions. It's a lot of work.</p>
          <p>And I don't believe in spending money that doesn't make sense. So in that situation, we could see the pricing, we knew where it was at. We knew the client well. And we elected not to bid it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just changing gears. Your volume for the year is sort of in line with what you've talked about in the past so far. But obviously there's been issues that have been discussed out there around physician office visits and pressures on overall industry script volume or maybe some shifts in mix versus what people were looking for. Can you just maybe make a comment toward the macro environment and how it's shaping up versus what you've been expecting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff may want to chime in here as well. But our focus is not just to let the environment evolve. We have to be a major player in the environment.</p>
          <p>So when we see members, diabetics, people on their lipid lowering drugs, hypertensive drugs &#x2013; when we see that they're not filling their scripts, we don't just say, okay, it's a bad economy. We reach out to those members, and &#x2013; with our clinicians and our pharmacists &#x2013; and we try to make sure they understand the impact of non-adherence.</p>
          <p>I think we do a pretty good job. Year-to-date, we're actually seeing trends close to 3% to slightly under that in our book of business &#x2013; utilization trends. We see it both in new prescriptions being filled as well as in renewals.</p>
          <p>I can't speak to some of the comments made by others and why they're not seeing the same thing we are. But maybe it's because our consumerology &#x2013; or it's probably because our consumerology approach really does work. And our messaging to our members really is effective, and it does drive behaviors. And we are getting those better clinical outcomes. And I 100% believe it, that it's working, and we're seeing the numbers come through.</p>
          <p>Jeff, do you have anything you would like to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's exactly right. We looked in detail at our utilization yesterday, again, after comments were made. And our utilization is exactly where we forecasted it for the year. And adherence remains very strong in our book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any differences in mix, retail, mail, et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, mail is always stronger. And again, I think it only makes sense, right? And if you're an Express Scripts mail user, and a call comes into your house or a text message comes to your phone or whatever your appropriate means of communication is and it's got Express Scripts on it, if you're a mail user and you're using our pharmacy on a regular basis, chances are you're going to open it and read it and see what we have to say. And so we reach out to the individuals when they miss scripts.</p>
          <p>If we see that their renewal is due and they haven't refilled it yet, we send out a reminder notice to them. They can sign up for automatic renewals if they &#x2013; so they just show up automatically if they want. So we give them a lot of tools and a lot of opportunities. We've got our pilots going with our GlowCaps and that's giving us some very positive results as well. So we constantly look for ways to evolve our programs to make sure our members use the first line of defense, which is prescription drugs, to maintain their better healthcare outcomes. And I think we're very effective at it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Two quick questions if I could. One of the questions I think that's been on a lot of people's minds post-reform is maybe whether the insurance companies might decide to claw their PBM businesses back in house based on the new MLR rules or ultimately decide to outsource those businesses. We obviously had the WellPoint data point last year and this week we had Aetna. George, I don't know if you kind of have a view on potentially the direction of those captive PBMs and maybe if you think there's more opportunity down the road potentially, what you see given within the reform rules.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's a great question. And quite frankly, I think it works to our advantage. When you have pressure, and you've got to figure out, how I maximize profits, keep in mind that a health plan selling an insured product, when that drug cost comes in for them, that drug is going to be included in that premium cost, so it's already in the number. When they sell &#x2013; when we pay the drug on their behalf, it becomes part of their cost of goods sold. So the drug cost is embedded into their MLR. So that's in there whether they do it internally or externally.</p>
          <p>Now the question becomes, how do you make profits at this and how do you get the best outcomes. So our job is to make sure that we are better than the alternative in sourcing and I think it speaks for ourselves. With &#x2013; WellPoint saw our expertise in this area. They have a tremendous expertise on the medical side. By them allowing us to manage the drug side for them, their focused on the medical side, I believe they can drive their overall loss ratios to the right level to meet their clients' needs and allow them to maximize their profit levels within their book of business. And I think that's what it's all about. So our focus on the drug side, their focus on the medical, and then our joint focus on overall health outcomes, I think is a winning combination that you'll see in both of our results as we go forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So with kind of that being said, you would expect to see that trend towards outsourcing continue? Is that a fair way to characterize it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm pretty biased at this, obviously. So you're asking me, I would think it's the right answer. We provide outsource benefits to many, many blues plans around the country plus other managed care organizations. I think we are considered by most, if not all of them, as their right hand in helping them manage their overall cost. I think it's the right answer. I think it's transparent from their perspective.</p>
          <p>From their perspective, they're getting the best of all worlds. They're getting the value of a $40 plus billion revenue company that can make the investments in the drug side that they need to be competitive. And at the same time, they're getting very good pricing and the proper clinical outcomes for their members. It's great combination for all the parties, while we can create value for our shareholders. So I think it works and I think it works great.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, George, maybe if I can just ask one other follow-up. If I listen to kind of your call and then CVS's and then ultimately MedCo's, it kind of sounds like each quarter you guys are sounding more and more different from each other. And your models are kind of evolving further and further away from each other. How is that being perceived with the client base out there? Do you think that the bigger clients are starting to view you guys more and more differently over time and will that ultimately impact pricing in either direction as maybe you're viewed potentially less as a commoditized business over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I've always believed that. I've always believed that we were different and our approach was different. We have a very strong focus on that member. Pat and Gary, operations and IT, Ed from sales through account management, their whole mission is to treat each of those 65 million members as an individual, and to give the right tools and the right offerings, to not just worry about the 5% of the patients who spend 20 &#x2013; or 80% of the drug costs, but instead to focus on every member. Because if you're one of those other people that just has episodic care, you don't care that you're taking really good care of that other 10 or 15%. You want to know that you're taken care of.</p>
          <p>And that's our approach. We treat each member with a tremendous amount of respect and a passion for their situation and try to solve it. I do think that makes us different, at least in my view. I can't speak to MedCo or Caremark's view. You've got to ask their CEOs their approaches and what they're doing. But I do think that each of us have a different approach to the marketplace. I like to think that they're all different.</p>
          <p>Again, as I stated in my prepared comments, I don't believe that the answer is just to drop price. If you got to just drop price to get business, that speaks for the quality of your service and your offering. I think you've got to be able to go in there and show that you can drive better health outcomes, while lowering costs. And if you can do that, you can maintain your profitability. If you don't have a model that can deliver that, then you only can deliver on cost. And that's not what we're going to be.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Have you ever disclosed how much of the billion dollar incremental synergies you have included in guidance for 2010? And if you haven't, will you do that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's very &#x2013; I'll let Jeff answer this. But from my perspective, I think you also have to understand that WellPoint has many, many what we call dibs, and that's different plan designs. Five different &#x2013; they've got 14 different blues plans and each of those sells a myriad of different products. They have come onto our systems. We can calculate the synergies that we're going to gain from where we stood back a year ago when we closed the deal, or before we closed the deal. Once you start putting all the companies together, it all gets commingled.</p>
          <p>We buy drugs at mail order. We buy &#x2013; we negotiate discounts from the retail drugstore chains. We go negotiate discounts and rebates. That's why it's so important that we have a homogeneous approach to the marketplace and we no longer focus &#x2013; I mean I know that many of you look and try to focus on how much is coming out of WellPoint and how much is coming of out of this. For us it's a lot of allocation. And we feel very, very confident in the numbers and the trends that we have. But we just don't break those out. We don't talk about client specific economics and we're not about to now.</p>

You also hear us talk a lot about behavioral economics. And we're spending a lot of time and effort there in building out new programs, new systems, that really let us continue to build our lead there, continue to build our intellectual property so that we can continue to deliver better health outcomes and lower costs to our clients and members along those fronts.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks very much. Another question about the progress around the WellPoint integration. Seems like you're &#x2013; you've gained some speed recently. Given that, are you starting to feel comfortable that perhaps in 2011 you could start transitioning to the next phase where you can drive more mail, especially in some of your more clinical programs, or should we view that more as an opportunity for 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the first thing we want to do is get everybody on the same platform. That's appropriate. But as they come onto our platforms, we now have the tools in our operation centers to actually start effectuating and driving, especially from the generic side. So that's already starting to happen. It becomes full force, though, with a real drive behind it in 2011. So we're not waiting for 2012. What I hope we're doing in 2011 is driving their generic penetration beyond where it is today as well as the mail order. And we also simultaneously, through Dr. Miller, we have a focus on what is that next generation. And those groups are already meeting and we hope to have &#x2013; start delivering on some combined new approaches to the delivery of healthcare throughout 2012 and '13.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. And then, George, just a follow-up question on healthcare reform. Based upon what you know now, when do you think you might start to see some additional competition within the specialty business through biosimilars?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's a great question. We've been meeting &#x2013; both Jeff, myself and many of my senior management team have been meeting with several representatives and Senators. It's great we got in what we got in. We fought hard for that, but we're still far short of where we need to be. I think the big question for pharma today is they try to use the pipeline &#x2013; or the pathway or do they just go about it in a new &#x2013; just try to introduce new products? And I think that you're going to start seeing some come into the market because of the receptivity.</p>
          <p>But I think that Congress, as they look at new ways to drive down healthcare costs &#x2013; because keep in mind, through this bill what we've done is we've given coverage, but we really haven't tackled the tough problems of cost. And as we start tackling those problems, I think there's room for that component of the bill to be amended and made more easier for pharma to introduce products. So I think under the current rate, we're a couple years out. We should see some biosimilars. What we'd really like to see is some biogenerics coming into market. And we're going to need some more legislation for that.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I want to build off of something that one of the earlier callers talked about. There's been a lot of fear recently kind of on the healthcare reform front, but really across the service complex, on sort of core growth and the sustainability of earnings and the sustainability of capital returns. I mean as you look at your business, and then you look at the next several years which we've known for some time are going be quite good, and think about the various threats on the horizon, I mean is there anything different today than versus six months ago or 12 months ago or even before in terms of how you thought about things that you can even perceive as a potential threat to any of those metrics as we go forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, of course. There's always threats, right? I mean anybody that's a businessman is going be looking for threats. My job is not just to look for threats, though, it's how do you mitigate those threats and then take advantage of the opportunity? When I look out to the next &#x2013; through 2017, I see a tremendous amount of blue sky. Think about what we're about to embark on. The government is just opened up coverage to over 30 million more &#x2013; and it's probably more than that, based on the state of the economy today. It's more than 30 plus million people are going to now have access to coverage.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, who's got the tools that work? The PBMs have a proven pathway and track record of showing that we can reduce cost while improving health outcomes. Think about all the statements that were made by the administration about what they needed to have in health outcomes and it's a blueprint for the way the PBM was designed. So you got millions and millions of individuals coming to the market. You've got a proven model that does what it needs to do to take costs out.</p>
          <p>I think we're sitting in incredibly good space right now. I think we have &#x2013; sure, there's pricing pressures, but keep in mind we have tremendous inflationary impacts of drug costs. When drugs are going up at 7 to 10% a year, you got specialty products that are going up at double digits, 14%, utilization trends in specialty that are driving overall specialty drug trends at 20% or more, those things are all opportunities for us. So when you have those kinds of increases, you can actually give part of it back to your client as price concession and still have profit for yourself, especially if you can show that you're driving people to the cheaper alternatives.</p>
          <p>With all the headwinds that we have as a nation, and healthcare inefficiencies, I see the PBMs as a great, great tool to continue to grow, to innovate and to change the way healthcare is delivered and take advantage of the opportunities that are out there. I think we are part of the solution and being part of that solution, provides us runway for more &#x2013; for better years to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I certainly tend to agree with you there, George. Maybe one for Jeff. We have the maturities coming due I believe in October on one of the term loans. The interest rate you're paying there is pretty de minimis. As you sort of think about where leverage is today on the balance sheet and putting that into the context of the interest rate environment, you're sort of appetite for rolling that over, or maybe keeping more leverage, I guess would be the way I'd put it on the business, and then to the degree that you might do that, you obviously have a pretty attractive stock price, here. And I think someone hinted earlier to kind of the desire and appetite for that. What sorts of things would be possible in that context?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean certainly there are lots of possibilities. I think &#x2013; I mean you're exactly right. We've got about $980 million of debt that's due in October. Our expectation, same thing we said last quarter, expectation remains the same at this point, that we will pay that off when it indeed comes due. When we do that, we're going be at about one times EBITDA, debt to EBITDA. And we've said many times in the past that our goal for &#x2013; the correct range for us for leverage is one to two times EBITDA. So we're certainly going be at the low end of that range. So being at the low end of the range along with the strong cash flows that the business is producing, really opens us up to a lot of different opportunities. And our view of how we want to use that cash hasn't changed over time. We still think the best use is reinvesting in our business.</p>
          <p>And second is solid, accretive acquisitions like the NextRx acquisition. And to the extent that we still see excess cash beyond that, then we use it to do share buy-backs. And as George said earlier on the call, we're buying stock back at higher prices earlier in the year. So certainly if the stock stays at the level it has been recently, that's certainly in a very attractive price to us as well. So I'm not really ready to give any more detailed guidance than that today. But certainly we have lots of opportunities and have historically done the right thing for our shareholders.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. Sorry for jumping in a few minutes late. Just a couple quick things. First, a clarification for Jeff. I'm assuming a little over 1% is great growth in '11. But I know back in February you guided to I think 740 to 760 million adjusted claims. Seems to me you're on a run rate to do kind of the higher end of that. Is there any way to clarify that and is it fair to say that's kind of the right base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I don't think we want to tighten up that range at this point. We still think that 740 to 750 is the right range for scripts for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just on &#x2013; George, I know you mentioned another direct client from WellPoint that you assume was leaving and is. I know you don't talk about specific customers, but can you give us any clarification even of the industry group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I prefer not to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only reason I mentioned the retailer is because that's been a press release that somebody else put out. I don't take a great pride in jettisoning a client. I mean you do it because it's the right economic answer. But I would rather have them conform. I would rather have them look for more than just adjudication. For me, purely adjudicating a claim for a couple pennies a script, just that doesn't do anything for me. Unless it's adding scale and size as we talked about earlier, and doing things that are benefiting the entire book, it just doesn't make sense. So singling clients out to talk about is not something &#x2013; whether we win them or lose them, is something I've ever really wanted to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair point. And I guess to that point, George, you make an interesting observation of some customers understanding your system and some not. And we step back and, say, Aetna, they used to be a customer of yours, they chose some years ago to go their own way and start their own PBM, build their own facilities. Obviously they've chosen to partner with another competitor. So implicit in that, is it fair to say you're not necessarily in agreement with how they're thinking about running their business relative to your customer or are you not in a position to comment on their strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'd rather not talk about other people's strategy because that's their business and what they've elected to do to get a deal done. But I would tell you, again, from my perspective, it's &#x2013; the economics &#x2013; if a big company comes to us and let's say it's a health plan and they own their own PBM and they want to carve out that PBM and partner with Express Scripts. We're going to be &#x2013; there's two ways to be competitive on that deal. One is we can do it for no value, i.e. free, no shareholder value, give all the economics to the client and have them do whatever they want to do, whether they manage their own formularies, whether they manage their own networks, whether they want to partake in all the back office stuff. We can do that. But the value just isn't there.</p>
          <p>If we can convince them, which is what we do, that they should align their formularies with ours, at the end of the day we have a P&amp;T Committee. Most health plans have a P&amp;T Committee. Yet when you look at our formularies, they overlap 99% of the time or somewhere in that range because we can get them to understand how we make our selections. We can show them the economics of it. So when we can find clients that want to conform to our ways, and I believe it's the right clinical answers, and they want to go after the things we want to go after, they want to drive generics, they're willing to pay me more for my generics and maybe lose money on my brands, but make money on my generics. As I can drive more, they win, I win. Those are the clients we want. Those are the clients we line up with.</p>
          <p>Same thing with, again, the rebates on the branded products. Again, going back to conformity of formularies. So if a client comes to us and none of those things are lined up, they just don't line up well, we quite frankly don't waste our time even bidding the account. It's not worth it. We can spend thousands and thousands of dollars, a lot of man hours, a lot of &#x2013; kill a lot of trees, and at the end of the day we're not going get it anyway, so why?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Okay. No, thanks for the elaboration. I appreciate the perspective.</p>
          <p>And then I guess finally, back for Jeff, and maybe George. I know you've been very consistent in suggesting $1 billion of incremental EBITDA to the enterprise when integrated. I know you've communicated you anticipate the integration being completed at the lower end of 12 to 18 months. I know your partner suggested yesterday they anticipate integration being completed by the end of 2010. Is there any reason to think then that the $1 billion of incremental value should accrue fully in 2011? Or are you not willing to say that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's &#x2013; we haven't really gone there. I would say that if you assumed that everything is &#x2013; if we are indeed completely done by the end of the year then I think it's reasonable to assume that the billion dollars would all accrue in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Larry, what we'd like to do is at the end of the third quarter we will have &#x2013; for the most part, keep in mind the small employer counts, the TPA business, a lot of the small brokerage business, is still out there. A very profitable business, by the way. So it's something that we really do focus on. But having said all that, the majority of the big accounts have been selected. Retentions are pretty much done. And so when we disclose our third quarter earnings, as Jeff said earlier, we will give full year guidance for 2011 at that time.</p>

          <p>Great. Great. Thanks, guys, for the questions. Just, George, first a follow-up. A lot of cash flow being generated. As you think about the longer-term picture, what's your strategic appetite to add businesses or diversify away from the core PBM offering or add tangential businesses to what you currently have?</p>

          <p>Well, I look at our business and I see growth rates &#x2013; I think Jeff talked about 25 to 27% growth for this year. We've got the value of NextRx coming in. I have a lot of confidence in the WellPoint management team and where they're headed. I have a lot of confidence in my other blues plans and managed care partners that they want to do what we want to do in driving out the wasted cost. And we've got hundreds and thousands of clients that are aligned with us. And I look &#x2013; and I ask, what other industries do you own or do you have that since 1992 have grown in excess of 20% each and every year?</p>
          <p>And then I'd have to ask myself, why would I diversify out of that? What do I add into that mix that can supplement that growth rate and not be a drain on the ROIC, which I &#x2013; I'm the ex-CFO here. Jeff is 100% behind it. The management team believes in ROIC. And so I can't think of why we would want to diversify when we've got a business model that's in demand, that's needed by America, and we can deliver exceptional value for our patients, clients and shareholders. It just doesn't make a lot of sense to me.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean I guess, asked differently, as you look forward to 2015 plus, I mean do you think that growth rate that you're putting up right now which is obviously significant, do you think you can sustain that growth rate through that period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you're talking 2015. It's 2010. I mean I &#x2013; we do three-year plans. The third year is always a bit of a challenge because what's going to happen in three years? I can't speak unequivocally that 2015's going to continue on the same path. But I think the answer to that question resides in the management team you've entrusted to run your capital here at Express Scripts. Our job is to make sure we don't give up on that growth rate. My people, my management team is absolutely focused on maximizing our growth rates. And we don't take that lightly.</p>
          <p>And I don't think &#x2013; it's not like we come to work every day and we just switch somebody to a generic. Our whole idea is to innovate, improve and change the way we administer. If you were to walk into Express Scripts in 1998, you'd have walked in in 2002, in 2005 and now in 2010, our approaches, our reporting, what we do for our clients is far different in each one of those different intervals. We don't just sit still and wait to get commoditized. We innovate, change and come up with new ideas and new approaches to tackle the myriad of problems and inefficiencies that exist in healthcare. Our job is to stay on top of that.</p>
          <p>2015's a long way out. I feel really good about where we sit today. We talked about what healthcare reform can do for us. I think it's &#x2013; there's a lot of blue sky out there. Our job is to make sure we capture our share of the value.</p>
          <p>Can we do one more question?</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. First on the selling season and your two new signature wins. Can you just elaborate a little bit more as to what in particular resonated with these two new clients that their current vendor wasn't providing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Ed Ignaczak sent me an email yesterday which was a debrief. Every time we renew a client or we win a client, I think we have a very high track record of winning in a jump ball situation. But quite frankly there's times when the client renews with the existing &#x2013; the incumbent. And so what we do is we just don't say okay. We take that apart and understand, could we have done something different? Was it merely the client trying to get a better price from their existing vendor or was it just effectively doing a market check or were they actually going to change hands? So we take it apart.</p>
          <p>Well, Ed sent me an email yesterday that looked at three major wins we've had this year and what was the driver. And I will tell you, consumerology was a very important component in all three of those wins, two of them are those signature wins, where in fact they pointed to the fact that we were addressing their needs and hitting the market with opportunities that they don't otherwise have access to, to get the best pull through without massive plan design changes which cause employee disruption. Our approach here is resonating, it's working, and it's good for us and our clients and our members. So I think that is the driver.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then in your prepared remarks, you made some comments about you seeing some opportunities in the small to mid market, which I thought was interesting because I would have thought that with acquisition of NextRx, using your jump ball analogy, if you were taller you'd probably be playing with a formidable competitor with the Fortune 100. So is the small to mid market more of a focus this year or am I just reading too much into it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's been a focus every year since we went public in 1992. It's always been an area that we really go after. Let me make sure I'm clear, though. When we &#x2013; in those states where NextRx has a dominant position and there's a small client opportunity, we would rather work through them than go direct. So we want to partner with our blues plans. We have blues plans throughout the country. We have managed care organizations throughout the country. And so we will actually put our salespeople and our clinicians into their shops to help them secure clients and grow.</p>
          <p>So we do it in two different ways. We do it either through our existing managed care book of business or we do it direct in those areas where we don't have a managed care partner. Or if a client wants to carve out and no longer offer an insured benefit and they just want to go purely as ASO and they want us to bid, then we would bid on those, too. But that's always been a big focus of ours.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then just lastly, it's clear you're making solid progress in migrating the NextRx lives onto the Express Scripts IT platform. But can you maybe discuss a little bit as to what you've started to do with these lives now that they've migrated? Are there any metrics you can share? I thought that that was a very low mail penetration rate, for example. So anything you could share on that would be great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The focus, as we said earlier, the focus this year is really getting all the lives migrated. And we have &#x2013; while we've started to explore potential ways to increase mail and generic fill rates and those things, we aren't spending a lot of effort on that this year. The primary effort is to get the lives migrated. And then, just to be clear, integration doesn't end with migration necessarily. There's lots of other things that we have to do that are also related to integration. But as we go through the integration, once that's complete, in the &#x2013; early next year, we would expect then to spend a lot of effort mapping out new mail plans, new generic plans and really starting to second order drive the integration and the synergy. Certainly both WellPoint and Express Scripts, in keeping with our model of alignment, are both very highly motivated to increase mail and increase generics and we're confident we're going to be able to do that over time.</p>

          <p>Well, again, I thank everyone for joining us this morning.</p>
          <p>We do have a tremendous confidence in our space. And we feel very good about our position in the marketplace. We believe our clinical tools are second to none. Our consumerology approach, coupled with those clinical tools, allows us to compete extremely effectively in the market to maximize shareholder value while delivering value to our clients and our patients.</p>
          <p>So again, we appreciate your attendance on our call this morning. We'll look forward to talking with you all soon. Thank you.</p>
