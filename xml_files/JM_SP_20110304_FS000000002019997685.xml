        <plist>
          <p>Good evening, everybody, and welcome. Thank you for joining our presentation tonight on Jardine Matheson's 2010 Annual Results. First, I'll start as usual with an overview of the Group's structure and last year's performance. I'll then discuss some of the major developments that took place during 2010. And before closing, I'll provide you with our views on the outlook for 2011.</p>
          <p>Our Finance Director, James Riley, will then provide more details on the year's results, both for the Group as a whole and for the individual businesses. We'll then be happy to take any questions that you may have.</p>
          <p>Here you can see the percentage ownership in each of the Group companies at the Jardine Matheson Holdings level, together with the share of profit, which we derived from each of the main Group companies. The largest contributors as you can see to our underlying profits were Astra, Hongkong Land and Dairy Farm.</p>
          <p>For the year as a whole, the Group's revenue including a 100% of associates rose 31% to US$47 billion. This reflected increased contributions from most of the businesses. The Group's underlying pre-tax profit, which is of course also before minorities, increased by 39% to US$4.2 billion. The underlying profit attributable to shareholders increased 34% to US$1.36 billion and earnings per share &#x2013; underlying earnings per share rose by 33% to US$3.80.</p>
          <p>For the first time, Southeast Asia accounted for over half of the Group's profits, to be exact 56%. Most of these earnings came from the markets of Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia and reflected strong performances in that region by Astra, Hongkong Land and Dairy Farm.</p>
          <p>You may recall, it's our first year &#x2013; first-half performance was a strong one, with underlying profit up 70%, due in part to the relatively weak first half of 2009 that we were comparing against.</p>
          <p>Earnings growth in the second half of last year was a more moderate 12%, which was influenced by the fact we had lower residential profits from Hongkong Land in that half. The Board is recommending a final dividend of US$0.85 per share, which gives a total dividend for the year of US$1.15 per share.</p>
          <p>Let me move on to the contributions of the individual units. Jardine Pacific reported good growth from a number of business units particularly our Air Cargo Terminals HACTL, and Jardine Restaurants. Jardine Motors grew its profits strongly particularly in the first half and so the record number of Mercedes-Benz, motor cars in mainland China and also in Hong Kong and Macau.</p>
          <p>Jardine Lloyd Thompson faced still some quite challenging market conditions in its home market yet it continued to deliver strong organic growth across the businesses and it benefited at our level from a material tax write-back.</p>
          <p>Hongkong Land's underlying earnings increased modestly, it benefited from good conditions in its commercial property portfolio in Hong Kong with relatively stable rental reversions and residential developments generated higher profits as several projects were completed.</p>
          <p>Dairy Farm had another fine year as generally favorable trading conditions persisted throughout our markets. Mandarin Oriental had a much better year after a very tough 2009 as higher occupancy rates combined with prudent cost management and that helped to drive higher earnings.</p>
          <p>Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage's businesses excluding Astra saw a small fall in their profits due to a very sharp reduction in the market size in Singapore, which is controlled by the government.</p>
          <p>Astra's profit contributions, Jardine Matheson on the other hand increased by a spectacular 63% to US$437 million, reflecting an excellent performance by almost all of its units and our earnings too were enhanced by the strong rupiah.</p>
          <p>I'll leave my comments on the business performances there, as James is going to elaborate in a moment, and I'll just move on to a brief overview of the key developments within the Group during the year. At Jardine Pacific, our construction and engineering businesses, JEC and Gammon both finished the year with record order books, as they continued to win large projects. We increased our stake in Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals from 24% &#x2013; 25% to 42% earlier in the year and the company HACTL also benefited from increased cargo throughput.</p>
          <p>Jardine Restaurants has recently made two acquisitions: KFC in Taiwan was bought in January last year, and we acquired an additional 75% in Pizza Hut in Vietnam making that business wholly-owned in January this year.</p>
          <p>JOS has also expanded its footprint in the region with the acquisition for US$130 million of a leading regional IT distributor with operations in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore.</p>
          <p>In Jardine Motors, we continued our operation on the Mainland, expanding it with, we now have a total of 17 dealerships operational in Southern China, extending as far west as Chongqing and Chengdu and we have a further five, are currently under construction, and several more in the planning stage.</p>
          <p>While the underwriting environment remained soft, Jardine Lloyd Thompson strengthened its market positions in number of its businesses, and it benefited also from its increasing profile in the high-growth economies both here in Asia and in Latin America, we saw a good growth.</p>
          <p>In the London Market, the Group's U.K. advisory retail business, including the U.K. regional offices were successfully integrated, and the Employee Benefits division integrated two recent acquisitions. Another notable event at JLT was the launch of its proprietary benefits management system, BenPal, in Latin America, Europe and the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p>2011 was a busy year for Hongkong Land. In Singapore, the first two office towers were completed at the Marina Bay Financial Centre, in which the Group has a one-third interest. Construction of the final office tower, which is already 66% pre-let, is scheduled for completion next year.</p>
          <p>In Jakarta, our 50% owned associate Jakarta Land commenced construction on a 61,000 square meter tower, adjacent to its existing central Jakarta office developments. This tower is due for completion in 2012.</p>
          <p>In the residential sector in Singapore, the first residential tower at Hongkong Land's Marina Bay project, which was already fully sold, was completed last year. MCL Land acquired one new site and completed two major projects. It also pre-sold all the units at The Estuary, a development scheduled for completion in 2013. During the year, the Group announced the proposed privatization of MCL Land and this was completed in February this year for a total consideration of US$150 million.</p>
          <p>On the Mainland, Hongkong Land acquired two new projects, a 190,000 square meter site in Chengdu and a 386,000 square meter site in Chongqing, that one in Chongqing would be the Group's first wholly-owned residential project on the Mainland. In addition, Hongkong Land increased its interests in our joint venture in Shenyang from 30% to 50%.</p>
          <p>Dairy Farm continued to expand organically and through acquisitions during 2010. Its total number of outlets increased by 315 to 5,386. In the larger format segment, the Group operated 113 Giant Hypermarkets at year end, comprising 67 in Malaysia, 38 in Indonesia, seven in Singapore and one in Brunei.</p>
          <p>In the Health and Beauty segment, Mannings continued to expand on the Mainland and added 43 outlets bringing the total store network there to 163 by year end. Dairy Farm's expansion on the Mainland also continued through Maxim's, which opened its first Genki Sushi restaurants and also Simply Life outlets in Shenzhen.</p>
          <p>Mandarin Oriental now has a total of 26 hotels in operation, with a further 16 under development. A new Mandarin Oriental hotel opened in One Central, Macau in June under a long-term management contract from Hongkong Land and its partner. This was followed by the launch of The Residences and Apartments at Mandarin Oriental Macau in November, which was sold out very well, where about 77% sold now I think.</p>
          <p>Three new projects were announced; two in Abu Dhabi and Doha, Qatar, marking the Group's entry into the Middle East, while the third, in Shanghai, represents Mandarin Oriental's fourth hotel project in mainland China. One previously announced project in Atlanta will not now proceed.</p>
          <p>Moving to Astra, we've seen strong organic growth in most of the businesses. At the end of the year, Astra completed the acquisition of the 47%, it didn't already own in Astra Sedaya Finance, the main motor car finance company, and Bank Permata, our banking associate completed the acquisition of GE Finance Indonesia, a domestic credit card issuer.</p>
          <p>Lastly, in Jardine Strategic, we acquired a 12% interest in Acleda Bank in Cambodia. I will now comment briefly on the year ahead. Conditions in our main markets in Greater China and Southeast Asia remains relatively buoyant at present and trading during the first couple of months of the year has been encouraging, and yet as you all know, the world still has plenty of uncertainties with the turmoil in North Africa and the Middle East, a new factor to consider. We are also mindful that in due course interest rates will need to rise and that will put some pressure on demand.</p>
          <p>But the Group's made an encouraging start to 2011. After an excellent performance in 2010, growth is likely, however, to be harder to achieve during this current year. In particular, there will be a lower contribution from Hongkong Land due to the reduced number of residential projects that we will complete in this year of 2011. The Group is however financially strong and we are well placed to develop our businesses further in Greater China and in Southeast Asia.</p>
          <p>I will now hand you over to James, and as I said, at the beginning, I along with him will be happy to answer questions you may have at the end. James over to you.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Anthony. Before I get going through the results in a little more detail just a couple accounting points. A recurring reminder that the Group uses underlying profit attributable to shareholders as its key earnings performance measure and to keep things simple I will refer to this as underlying profit. This measure excludes non-trading items, which we identify and explain separately in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Group's ongoing business performance. You should also note that any dollar figures I mentioned will be U.S. dollars.</p>
          <p>Next, I would like to say a word on a number of changes we've made to accounting policies. I'm delighted to say that after many years of lobbying, we were successful in persuading the International Accounting Standards Board to amend its tax standard such that we are no longer required to provide tax on the revaluation surpluses generated by Hongkong Land's investment properties in Hong Kong and Singapore. There is no capital gains tax in either territory, so the requirement to make a provision for tax has long been a subject of debate, and I'm delighted we've been able to reverse the provision this year.</p>
          <p>As a consequence, we made a change to our accounting policies and there was an increase of US$2.3 billion in Jardine Matheson's reported net assets as at the end of 2009. This and two other more minor changes in the accounting policies have been made retrospectively and therefore the 2009 balance sheet and profit and loss accounts are noted as being restated in the financial statements.</p>
          <p>I should also remind you that the Group began consolidating Hongkong Land with effect from June 2009. In consequence, in 2009 it was treated as an associate in the first half and as a subsidiary in the second half, which effects comparisons.</p>
          <p>So the results. Jardine Matheson's underlying profit was $1.36 billion for the year, an increase of 34%. The overall profit attributable to shareholders was $3.1 billion including non-trading items totaling $1.7 billion.</p>
          <p>The main non-trading item was the increase in the fair value of investment properties in Hongkong Land. They increased by 26% overall with the existing investment properties in both Hong Kong and Singapore increasing in value by 22% with the additional uplift being provided by the Marina Bay properties that were completed during the year. The only other significant non-trading item was an increase in the fair value of Astra's plantation assets, which have to be revalued each period.</p>
          <p>The Group's balance sheet strengthened over the year with total equity increasing 27% to $32 billion and shareholders' funds rising 28% to $13.7 billion. The increase in shareholders' funds was essentially attributable to the Group's retained net profit. This contributed to a 27% increase in net asset value per share, which stood at $37.99 at the end of December 2010.</p>
          <p>The cash inflow from operating activities for the year was $2.2 billion. This represented a decrease of $576 million on 2009 mostly due to higher working capital in Astra. Capital expenditure for the year before disposals was $1.9 billion. This included $233 million for the purchase of associates, joint ventures and others, which included $80 million for an additional interest in the Shenyang project in Hongkong Land and $98 million for the subscription to Bank Permata's rights issue in Astra; $231 million for the purchase of other investments, mainly in Astra and the company; $156 million for the purchase of intangible assets, which include such things as project development costs in Mandarin Oriental, Paris, $60 million for the purchase of freehold land and $33 million of commissions for securing insurance contracts in Astra; $868 million for the purchase of tangible assets, which included $211 million in Dairy Farm, and $537 million in Astra; $87 million for additions to plantations in Astra; and $223 million of advance to associates and joint ventures, mainly in Hongkong Land.</p>
          <p>At the Group level, Jardine Matheson had a net debt position before financial services of $2.3 billion, which represented 7% of total equity. In addition, we had $2.4 billion of net borrowing within the finance companies in Astra. These have increased during the year due to the healthy growth in the motor vehicle market in Indonesia, but remain conservatively financed.</p>
          <p>Focusing on the Group debt, excluding financial services companies, I've broken this down by business unit here. You can see that the principal borrowing vehicle within the Group is Hongkong Land. The main corporate holding companies continue to have net surplus cash.</p>
          <p>Jardine Matheson corporate had a net cash balance of $160 million at the end of 2010, down from $246 million a year prior. Jardine Strategic's corporate net cash position rose from $110 million to $297 million over the same period. At Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage, the dividends received from Astra net of withholding tax essentially flow through into the Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage dividend and thus the net cash should remain fairly flat absent any significant capital commitments.</p>
          <p>I will now move to the businesses we Group as Jardine Pacific. Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals recorded a 25% improvement in cargo throughput and this together with the increase in the Group's shareholding drove the increase in HACTL's contribution. Jardine Schindler achieved an improved profit, when account is taken of a $2 million provision reversal in 2009. This improved profit was derived from new installations and additional units coming under maintenance.</p>
          <p>With most of its operations performing well, JEC also produced good profit growth when compared to its 2009 result, again when account is taken of $2 million of released provisions in 2009. Jardine Restaurants results included a $6 million first contribution from the KFC business in Taiwan and steady performances from its other units.</p>
          <p>Gammon's contribution to underlying profit was down slightly at $21 million, although its order book rose 30% to $3 billion as it continued to win new large projects. JOS produced improved earnings as it benefited from healthy demand for its products and services.</p>
          <p>Jardine Shipping saw earnings growth with freight rates and volumes recovered part of the year, and Jardine Aviation Services benefited from greater flight frequencies as aviation markets improved.</p>
          <p>Jardine Motors produced an underlying profit in 2010 of $87 million, up 66%, as its business in Hong Kong and mainland China in particular enjoyed much improved trading conditions.</p>
          <p>A higher contribution from Zung Fu in Hong Kong and Macau resulted from an increase in deliveries in Mercedes-Benz passenger cars despite there being no significant new models &#x2013; new launches. There was also a good contribution from aftersales and commercial vehicle activities.</p>
          <p>The Group continued to grow profitably in Southern China, where new car deliveries rose from 9,200 units to over 15,600 units, although margins did come under pressure towards the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Despite difficult trading conditions for Jardine Motor's dealerships in the United Kingdom, the business was able to record an improved underlying profit due to the Government scrappage scheme in the first half and profits arising from two property disposals of $6 million.</p>
          <p>On Tuesday, Jardine Lloyd Thompson announced another satisfying set of results in the United Kingdom. In sterling terms, underlying profit rose 22% to &#xA3;88 million. This was in part driven by trading margin improvements across all divisions. The Group also saw growing revenue contribution from high-growth economies such as Asia and Latin America with organic growth of 20% and 25%, respectively.</p>
          <p>The improved contribution to Jardine's underlying earnings from JLT, which increased by 34%, also benefited from the write-back of a &#xA3;10 million tax provision made in previous years that were no longer required. These were treated by Jardine Lloyd Thompson as exceptional. Our treatment of them is underlying reflects the fact that the provisions were originally made against underlying earnings.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Jardine Strategic, it achieved underlying profits of $1.4 billion, an increase of 32%. Underlying earnings per share were higher by 33%, at $2.32. The net asset value per share shown for Jardine Strategic is calculated by reference to the market value of the underlying investments held by Jardine Strategic. At the 31st of December, this was up 46% to $47.53 per share.</p>
          <p>The Jardine Strategic dividend will be increased by 5% to $0.21 per share, which is consistent with our approach for a number of years of increasing the Jardine Strategic dividend by 5% to 6% per year.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the main listed companies under Jardine Strategic, Hongkong Land's underlying profit increased by 4% to $810 million from the record results in 2009. On the commercial side, steady demand for office space in Hong Kong's Central district helped to support rental levels, which continued to increase from the lower rates seen in 2009.</p>
          <p>Vacancy in the office portfolio stood at 2.9% at year-end, while the Group's retail space in Central remained fully let. In Singapore demand for office space recovered and rents began to improve in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>In the residential sector Hongkong Land derived profits from several sources. The first residential tower at Marina Bay, Waterfall Gardens, and D'Pavilion were all completed during the year, having been already fully sold.</p>
          <p>In Hong Kong, profits were recognized on approximately one-third of the apartments of the Serenade, while in Macau profits were recognized following completion of Tower 4 of One Central. Profits were also recorded in mainland China from two existing residential projects, Maple Place in Beijing and Bamboo Grove in Chongqing.</p>
          <p>In 2009, residential property contributed $384 million to Hongkong Land's earnings. And in 2010, it contributed $433 million. Both these figures are unusually large and reflects a period of strong growth in residential property values in markets where Hongkong Land has exposure and the coincidental completion of a number of projects in the same years. Looking forward, we would expect the level of income from residential earnings to lessen and not return to these levels for a few years.</p>
          <p>Dairy Farm experienced another good year in 2010. Sales, including a 100% of associates increased by 13% to $9.1 billion, while the underlying net profit $410 million represented an increase of 13%.</p>
          <p>The Group continued to grow its store network both organically and through acquisitions. There were mixed performances from the Group's operations there in North Asia, where overall sales increased by 9% and operating profit by 4%. Mannings and IKEA in Hong Kong achieved excellent results, Wellcome traded reasonably. Maxim's also produced a very good result with its profit contribution to Dairy Farm increasing by 28% during the year.</p>
          <p>However, 7-Eleven had a more challenging year and Wellcome's earnings in Taiwan declined. In Southern China both 7-Eleven and Mannings made losses. The former was adversely affected by the restrictions on the sale of tobacco products, whilst Mannings has not yet achieved critical mass, but grew by a further 43 outlets to 163.</p>
          <p>In South Asia, sales increased 12% and operating profit was up 7%. This was in part attributable to a buoyant economy in Singapore where profit contributions benefited from a strong Singaporean dollar offset by lower employments incentives offered by the Singapore government.</p>
          <p>In East Asia, sales rose 22% and operating profit by 27% with most formats in both Malaysia and Indonesia doing extremely well. We now have a total of 105 hypermarkets in the two countries, as well as a strong position in the Health and Beauty sector in Malaysia.</p>
          <p>Mandarin Oriental profitability improved across the Group's hotels with the strongest performance being seen in Asia. In Hong Kong, which remains the mainstay of Mandarin profitability, a significant recovery in demand produced increased occupancy and rates.</p>
          <p>As a result, revenue per available room at Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong and The Excelsior was up 38% and 30% respectively. The Singapore hotel also benefited from an increase in visitor arrivals in the city, with revenue per available room up 31%. The only weak performer of any significance was Bangkok due to the political demonstrations early in the year.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere, the Mandarin Hyde Park performed well in spite of the neighboring construction work and the volcanic ash cloud in April. In the Americas, while business levels have yet to fully recover, the New York hotel produced a strong performance and Washington showed some improvement.</p>
          <p>In addition, the fees received from Group &#x2013; the Group's managed hotels increased, reflecting the growing portfolio and improved market conditions. Overall, Mandarin Oriental reported underlying earnings up from $12 million in 2009 to $44 million. The net asset value per share, which is adjusted to include leased properties at fair market value rose 7% to $2.33 and net debt increased modestly to a $144 million, which increased gearing 5% to 6%.</p>
          <p>Now to our Singapore-based holding company, Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage. We split its results into three components. The contribution from its largest subsidiary Astra is reported separately. The head office costs are included within the Group's own corporate costs line. As a result only Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage's other motor interests are reported through the Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage line in our financial statements. These produced an underlying profit of $56 million, down 5% in 2009.</p>
          <p>The main factor in this fall was a challenging environments in Singapore, where the market for passenger cars fell by 32% following a steep reduction in the government quota for new vehicles.</p>
          <p>Astra performed extremely well overall achieving a record profit with improved contributions from all its businesses except contract mining. It reported a record net profit under Indonesian accounting standards of Rp14.4 trillion, up 43% on 2009. This translated into earnings of US$1.6 billion, which due to the strengthening in the rupiah were up 63%.</p>
          <p>The wholesale market for both motor cars and motorcycles in Indonesia grew during the year, the former by 57% and the latter by 26%. Against this background, Astra's own sales grew strongly with the Group obtaining a market share of 56% for motor cars and 46% for motorcycles. The profitability of all of Astra's motor businesses benefited from the healthy growth in these markets.</p>
          <p>The demand for cars and motorcycles also drove business volumes in the consumer finance operations and was reflected in loan book growth, stable net interest margins, and ample liquidity in the local banking sector. The amount financed through Federal International Finance, the Astra Credit Companies and Toyota Astra Financial Services grew by 39%.</p>
          <p>Bank Permata, which is 44.5% owned, benefited from the positive economic conditions with net income more than doubling. Astra Agro Lestari's profit increased with a higher palm oil price in the second half of the year. The 80% owned subsidiary reported profits of Rp2 trillion, up 21% or 39% in U.S. dollar terms.</p>
          <p>United Tractors sold a record 5,400 units of Komatsu heavy equipment, although its aggregate earnings were held back by a lower contribution from its contracting subsidiary, Pamapersada Nusantara, where profits were hit by poor weather and the weaker U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>I should now touch on the other investments held by Jardine Strategic. The Rothschild global advisory business showed some recovery as conditions in financial markets stabilized and it made a positive contribution to Group earnings.</p>
          <p>Our investment in Rothschild is equity accounted, whilst the other investments are dividend accounted. Together, they generated net income for the Group of $24 million, which we include as income within the corporate and other interests line. This compares with a negative contribution of $2 million in 2009, when there was a negative contribution from Rothschild.</p>
          <p>The other items within the corporate and other interest line are the Group's central overhead, which increased modestly during the year and central financing costs, which were largely unchanged.</p>
          <p>That completes my run through of the Group's results.</p>
